         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

2. What are the Characters of true Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>3. I am now in order to prove that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament</hi> do contain the
Matter of Divine Revelation, and have upon
them the Characters belonging to it.</p>
            <p>In which there are two things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>1. The Matter contained in Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. The Books containing that Matter.</p>
            <p>Which two will admit of a distinct Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For,</p>
            <p>(1.) These two, the Matter and the Books,
were originally distinct; for the Matter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
before it was written, and would have
been of the same Authority, if unwritten, as
written. The writing not being essential to the
Authority, but only made use of as a fit means
for the conveyance and preservation of the
Matter.</p>
            <p>(2.) These two are capable of a different proof:
For the matter of Scripture was confirmed by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and had a Divine Attestation given to it:
But we don't find the like Testimony given to
the Books. There were Miracles upon Miracles,
to confirm the truth, suppose, contained in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62572:4"/>
Four Evangelists; but none to prove those Four
Gospels to be wrote by Persons inspired, or that
these were the Books wrote by them. For that has
another sort of Evidence, to be hereafter inquired
into.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis fit these two should be considered
apart. For,</p>
            <p>(1.) If we were to discourse with a professed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,
we must begin with the Truth of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and then proceed to the Authority of the
Books: And we may make Converts (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and others in those primitive times did) from
the proof we are able to make of the Truth and
Authority of our Religion, though at the present
we have not the Books.</p>
            <p>(2.) It's of no little advantage. For by hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Matter apart from the Books, we need
not for the present concern our selves in the
Doubts and Objections about the Books; such as
the supposed Inconsistencies in Scripture; the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Readings; the uncertainty of the Authors;
the Subject of Inspiration, whether words as well
as matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These being laid aside for the present, by this
distinct consideration of the Matter and the
Books, will shorten our Work; and if we prove
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62572:5"/>
the matter to be of Divine original, we also gain
a great point toward the proof of the Books
themselves.</p>
            <p>I am to begin with the Matter contained in
Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now that is of a diverse nature, and therefore
according to the nature of it, so is its Authority.
For there is matter of Fact, and Historical Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of things; and when we say these are of
Divine Authority, we thereby mean they were
recorded and committed to writing by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
Direction or Command of God.
Again, there are Matters of a moral nature,
which might be found out by, and are the Dictates
of pure Reason; and when we say these are of
Divine Authority, we thereby understand that
they are authorised by the Divine Command,
as well as in their own nature obligatory. In
which cases <hi>holy men of God spake,</hi> and wrote, <hi>as they
were moved,</hi> incited, <hi>by the Holy Ghost,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 21.</p>
            <p>But the more especial way was when the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was purely of Divine Revelation, and wholly
proceeding from it; and though this were not to
be learned, and found out by Reason (as has been
before shewed) yet 'tis agreeable to it; as I shall
now proceed to prove; and that I shall do in
this order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62572:5"/>
1. I shall consider, The Claim which the
Matter of Scripture hath to Revelation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration.</p>
            <p>2. The Characters upon which that Claim is
grounded.</p>
            <p>3. The Proof by which that Claim to Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made good.</p>
            <p>1. I shall consider the Claim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that
is, if the Matter contained in the Scripture be
not a Revelation from God, and the True Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
then there neither is, nor ever was, nor
can be such a Revelation.</p>
            <p>1. If That be not a Divine Revelation, there
is no Revelation; for as That denies and rejects
all Revelation besides it self, so there is none other
that can produce such Evidence for it: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
if notwithstanding the Evidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
for Scripture, That is not to be admitted
for Divine, then there is no Revelation existent
in the World, since no other has the Evidence
which That appears to have. This we may leave
to any indifferent person to judge of, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the <hi>Alcoran</hi> with the <hi>Bible;</hi> and the <hi>Chinese</hi>
Divinity of a <hi>Confutius,</hi> with that of Christianity.</p>
            <p>2. If this be not a Revelation from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then
there never has been such a Revelation; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62572:6"/>
that for the Reason before given, <hi>viz.</hi> That there
is no other Revelation extant save this. But if
there ever had been a Revelation, and a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
design'd for all Mankind (as that of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
apparently is), what was once, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
and for ever afterwards have been existent;
since the same reason there was once for a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Mankind, the same would have been
for the Continuance of it; and the same Divine
Goodness that took care there should be a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
would certainly have taken the like care
for the preserving of it. But if there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
(as there is not, if the Scripture be not
that Revelation) then there never was a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
and so all that has been before said upon
this Argument, about the Existence, Usefulness,
and Necessity of a Revelation, must go for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>3. If the Scripture be not of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then there never can be a Revelation, or at
least, such a Revelation as shall oblige us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and believe it: Since there can be no
stronger Evidence produced for the Proof of it,
than there is for that of Scripture. And therefore
he that will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pretend not to believe the Scripture-Revelation
for want of sufficient Evidence, can
never be convinced of the Truth of any Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62572:6"/>
For what better Evidence can be given,
as to the Matter, the Persons Inspired, the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Proofs of Miracles and Prophecy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
than what we have for the Scripture?</p>
            <p>Admit then that there is, or ever was, or may
be a Divine Revelation, we may be certain that
the Matter contained in Scripture is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>But though this must be allowed to be a good
step toward the Proof of the Divine Authority
of Scripture; yet it remains to consider what
that Evidence is which is thus peculiar to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Revelation,
and that none besides ever
have or can have: And this is the Subject of the
Second General:</p>
            <p>Which is to consider,</p>
            <p>2. The Characters belonging to Revelation,
upon which that Claim is grounded.</p>
            <p>That Revelation may be distinguished from
Imposture and mere Pretence, there must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Characters that are essential to Revelation;
without which Marks of distinction, we must do
by it as few have done, and totally reject it; or
else as the <hi>Romans</hi> did by the Deities of other
Countries, that admitted all into their <hi>Calendar,</hi>
we must refuse none. But since there has been
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62572:7"/>
a Revelation (as all Mankind have been inclined
to believe), and several Pretences to it (as the
experience of all Ages has shewed), we must
follow the direction of Scripture,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 21.</note> which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
warns us of <hi>false Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> and exhorts us to
<hi>try the Spirits;</hi> but doth also furnish us with such
Characters, as will enable us to distinguish the
true from the false.</p>
            <p>And this direction, methinks, may pass for
one Character, according to that of our Saviour,
Joh. 3. 20, 21. <hi>Every one that doth evil,</hi> or speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
falsly, <hi>hateth the light, lest his deeds should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,</hi>
and his Pretences discovered. <hi>But he that
doeth</hi> and speaketh <hi>truth, cometh to the light, that his
deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in
God;</hi> or that what he saith, may appear to be a
Revelation from him.</p>
            <p>Now when the Revelation so called doth
thus offer it self to an impartial trial, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
and requires all persons to examine and
make enquiry, and lays down such Rules, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and Characters, as in the opinion of all
men are sufficient to distinguish the true from the
false, 'tis an undoubted sign that it is able to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
it self, and to make out its Claim to a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority, by a correspondence to those
Characters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62572:7"/>
By this the Scripture is distinguished from all
others; for though there were several among the
<hi>Heathen</hi> Lawgivers that pretended to derive their
Laws from the direction of their gods, yet it
was rather to prevent Enquiry, than encourage
it; and to oblige the people to an absolute sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission:
For who might dispute that which the
gods commanded? Or who durst so much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,<note place="margin">Justin. Hist. l. 3.</note>
where the <hi>Fear of Religion</hi> restrained them?</p>
            <p>But to expose it self to a trial, and to require
that men examine before they receive and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and to give them such signs as shall serve
to describe the Truth, and detect Imposture, is
peculiar to the Scripture. From thence therefore
it is that I shall produce such Characters as will
give that a Title to Divine Authority, and oblige
us to a belief of it. And what are such, if
these are not? <hi>viz.</hi> That it could come only
from God, is worthy of him, and has a Divine
and Supernatural Evidence to attest it. Where
these are, there is a Divine Authority, there is a
Revelation. And these I shall shew do belong
to what the Scripture proposes as such.</p>
            <p>1. It is a Character belonging to Revelation,
and a sign of the Truth of it, when it apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
has God for the Author, and can proceed from
none but him. This is a Character, I presume,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62572:8"/>
will upon examination be found to belong to
Scripture.</p>
            <p>As I shall now attempt to prove, by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which is the chief subject of it; and that
is the Revelation of God's Will to Mankind.</p>
            <p>Here I shall premise and take for granted,</p>
            <p>1. That God having created Man, created
him in a state of Innocency and Purity; for being
infinitely Good, it is not to be conceived that he
made any thing evil in it self.</p>
            <p>2. That Man fell from this happy state; of
innocent he became guilty; of a pure, he became
a depraved creature, as the experience of all
Ages shews him now to be.</p>
            <p>3. That Almighty God was disposed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and admit him again to favour.</p>
            <p>Upon this state of things the Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds:
And because it was impossible for Man
to find out of himself the way and means by
which he might be restored, there needed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
to inform him in it.</p>
            <p>I grant there is a Natural Means, and what the
reason of the thing supposes to be necessary to
our Reconciliation, and that is Repentance.</p>
            <p>But that this is of it self a Means sufficient,
and upon which alone God will be reconciled to
the Offenders, has been always doubted of; as is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62572:8"/>
evident from the several ways of Atonement,
and especially of Sacrifices, practised in all parts
of the world. For since God is the Governor
of the world, it seems no more reconcilable with
his Justice, and consistent with that Authority he
is to maintain, to pardon all Offenders upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
than it is consistent with the ends of
Government among men, to accept of the
Offenders Penitence as a full Satisfaction to the
Law, and to remit the Penalty threatned.</p>
            <p>We have an Instance to the contrary, in this
very case; when notwithstanding a supposed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in Mankind, God inflicted the Penalty
threatned, <hi>In the day thou eatest therof, thou shalt
dye.</hi> Now therefore, since the natural Means
of propitiating Almighty God was not sufficient,
there is somewhat further in reserve; and what
that is, none could tell, but he who had it in his
own power what to accept, and what to refuse;
it was for him to reveal, that was to institute.</p>
            <p>And if we take a view of the Scheme of what
the Scripture sets before us as to this matter, it
will abundantly confirm what I have proposed
as a Character of Revelation, and that is, That
it is from God, and only from him.</p>
            <p>The Sum of which is, That since Mankind
had thus lapsed into a Preternatural State, in which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62572:9"/>
through the Infirmity and Corruption of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they themselves neither were, nor could do
what was acceptable to God in order to a Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Reconciliation, it was designed that the
Son of God himself should become a Mediator by
a present Stipulation, and in a prefixed time, by an
actual Undertaking to dye for us. That according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in testimony of God's acceptance of the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of his Reconciliation, the Son rose
from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, is
there our Intercessor, and the Dispenser of all
those Gifts, and that supervenient Grace which
is necessary to the reforming Mankind, and the
fitting them for that state he is now invested in,
and has promised to bestow upon such as are
qualified for it.</p>
            <p>Now who is there, that upon a Review of
these several Particulars that do constitute the
Christian Religion, and make up the chief Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Scriptural Revelation, can pretend that
this was to be found out by Human Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Enquiry; or rather, that must not
grant it proceeded from God? Especially if it be
observed what a wonderful Intermixture there is
in this Scheme, of the Divine Mercy and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
of his Mercy in pardoning the Sinner,
and of his Justice in requiring an Atonement.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62572:9"/>
What a representation of his Hatred to Sin on
one hand, when God established so valuable an
Atonement as the Blood of his own Son; and
of his Favour and Love to Mankind, when <hi>he
spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all?</hi>
What a foundation for our Hope on one hand,
when he accepted of the Propitiation; and what a
dread of offending is there on the other, when
<hi>he that knew no sin, was made a sin offering for us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which laid together, do confirm the Truth
of this Character, and the Title that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Revelation
hath to it.</p>
            <p>But there is somewhat further to be added in
Proof of this Point. That it was a Revelation
from God; and that is, The many Prophecies
that are interwoven with it in Scripture; which
could proceed from none but Him who alone
has all Causes and Events in his Power, and so
alone could foretell how those Causes would
operate, and what should be the Events of such
Operation. These being the chief part of the
Revelation concerning the whole Scheme of
Man's Salvation, confirm what I have before
said, That it was from God, and from Him
alone. But this must be reserved to its proper
place, under the Third General Head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62572:10"/>
To go on,</p>
            <p>II. A Character necessarily belonging to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation, is, That it be worthy of God,
and what becomes the Majesty of Heaven to
make known to Mankind.</p>
            <p>When we say it is to be worthy of him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is meant, that it is suitable to the Perfections
of his Nature, to his Holiness and Justice, his
Goodness and Mercy, his Wisdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which, and all of which, a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
truly so, can no more be repugnant, than
God himself can be other than he is, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of those Perfections which are essential
to him.</p>
            <p>In discoursing upon which, we may observe,</p>
            <p>1. That it cannot be denied, but the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of himself to Mankind is worthy of God,
though it be an Infinite Condescension.</p>
            <p>It was an Infinite Condescension in the Deity,
that had all in himself, to make such a Creature
as Man; and it is no more unworthy of God
to reveal himself to him, than it was to make
him. For what other reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was there for the
making such a Creature, and the enduing him
with the Light of Reason, but that he might
own, honour, and serve the Author of his Being?
And since to know and acknowledge God, is the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62572:10"/>
chief end for which Man was made, it is as much
becoming Almighty God to reveal himself to
him, as it was to make him for the knowledge of
himself.</p>
            <p>2. That is a thing worthy of God to reveal,
which is a thing worthy of God to do: And such
is the Recovery and Restoration of Man to the
like condition he was created in, and unhappily
fell from; for that is a kind of Re-making him,
and giving him a New Being: And since a New
Being is to a Depraved Being, what Being was
to No Being, it is as much becoming Almighty
God from a depraved state to raise him to a state
of Purity and Holiness, as it was at the first to
give Him a Being that before had none.</p>
            <p>And this is the great Subject of what we call
Divine Revelation; which as it respects Man,
may come under a Twofold Consideration; and
that is, the Perfection of Human Nature, and
the Happiness of Mankind.</p>
            <p>It will be a needless undertaking, to prove
that these Ends are worthy of God; but that
which rather becomes us is to shew, That as it
is the great design of the Scriptural Revelation to
represent this, and to acquaint us with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
that the Almighty Wisdom and Goodness
thought fit to observe; so the Method as there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62572:11"/>
laid down, is worthy of such Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as I shall now proceed to shew in the two
Instances given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The Method Almighty God is in Scripture
said to take for the purifying and the perfecting
Human Nature, is highly worthy of so glorious
a Being; and that is Threefold, Cautionary,
Moral, and Supernatural.</p>
            <p>(1.) That which I call Cautionary, is the
way Almighty God was pleased to take for the
representing his Displeasure against Sin, and to
make Mankind cautious of offending. The
Means made use of before the Fall was a Penalty
threatned, <hi>In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt
dye.</hi> But because that had proved of so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
force to restrain mankind, and for fear lest
when God had received them into Favour after
such a Threatning, his Mercy and Indulgence
might be abused, and become an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Sin, God added thereunto an Expiation
(as has been before said), and that to be made
by his own Son; who from the Dignity of his
Person, and the voluntary Oblation of himself,
should be reputed as a Representative of the
whole, and the whole be esteemed to suffer with
him. By which means, as God's Mercy would
be abundantly testified in a design for redeeming
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62572:11"/>
them; so his Justice would be exemplified, when
he that had no sin of his own, should yet be
made a Sin-offering, and suffer for them. For
how could they presume after this to offend the
Almighty Father, when rather than suffer his
Laws to be violated, his Authority slighted, his
Holiness and Justice disparaged, or leave Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
under a temptation so to do, he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
his hatred against sin, and his resolution to
punish it, by requiring and substituting such a
Sacrifice as that of his Son in their stead? This
is the apparent Reason of such an Institution; and
both the Institution and Reason of it are worthy
of the Divine Counsel; since there is no way in
which these things can be represented to greater
advantage, than by the Scripture-Scheme of
Man's Redemption.</p>
            <p>(2.) There is the Moral Means, that serves
the same end, <hi>viz.</hi> the purifying and perfecting
Human Nature, to which Revelation gave the
last and finishing hand. It is true, these Moral
Principles are no other than Natural Maxims,
and which were Nature, unassisted, sufficient for,
might have been extracted out of it. But
Mankind were no more able to attain to that
skill of themselves, than an unexperienced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and unacquainted with the Art of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62572:12"/>
can extract such Exalted and Generous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
out of the Bodies of Plants and Animals, as
upon trial we find they are endued with. It is
another Light we view Nature by since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
of the Evangelical Revelation to
the world. Nature and Reason now, are not
the Nature and the Reason they were before, or
are still where that Revelation has not been
known: And therefore if we would know what
the force of those Principles are, and how far
they operated by their own power, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the way is not to judge of it as it appears
to us, where the Gospel-Revelation is, but as it
was in the state of pure <hi>Heathenism,</hi> not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the finer part of it (as it flourished in <hi>Greece</hi>
it self) and as it is now in some of the remote
parts of the world, as in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> &amp;c.
For <hi>Gentilism</hi> it self apparently mended upon the
Publication of the Gospel; and then their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists</hi>
wrote with another strein, than those of
their own Sect did before that time.</p>
            <p>For in the Scripture there is such an entire and
compleat System of all things requisite to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Human Nature (as far as in this state
it is capable of it) that nothing is wanting for
direction and obligation.</p>
            <p>There we find the most Natural Characters
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62572:12"/>
of Good and Evil traced along from the first rise
in all their tendencies, and the just bounds of
both described. There we have on one hand the
most enforcing Encouragements to Virtue and
Goodness, and on the other the most necessary
Cautions and Admonitions against Sin; and both
fortified with proper Instances and Examples.</p>
            <p>There we find the noblest Principles, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actest
Rules; and the great Lines of our Duty
plainly set forth in their utmost extent; and that
as well for the Regulation of the Thoughts and
Desires, as the Government of our Actions.</p>
            <p>There we find that Duty enforced by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Obligation, by no less Authority than that of
God himself, whose Precepts and Injunctions
they are declared to be, and not the mere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
of our own Nature and Reason.</p>
            <p>And whereas Nature falls as short in its Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(having only Conscience to enforce them)
as its Authority; when these Moral Principles
become God's Laws, they have Rewards and
Punishments of another kind annexed to them,
and as everlasting as our Souls, to bind them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us.</p>
            <p>So that as far as Nature thus directed and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
can go, we have the most effectual means in
our power for the amendment and purification
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62572:13"/>
But because it is only so far in our own power,
and that in the issue we prove too remiss in the
exerting of it; and that after all, Nature flags
and recoils, and is too much Nature still. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>(3.) There is a Supernatural Means to render
the other effectual, and to give encouragement
and success to our endeavours; and that is a Power
as Divine as the Authority, which is the assistance
of the Holy Spirit of God. Look we upon the
Morality of the greatest Philosophers, how poor
is that to the Doctrine of our Saviour and the
Apostles? Look we upon the fruits of it, and
there we shall find them short of their Principles;
and that the case was much with them as with
the Stoical <hi>Posidonius,</hi> that would not allow Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in Human Nature; that when invaded by
the Gout, might chide both that and himself for
his sensation of it; but the Disease and Nature,
kept on their course, and would own no such
Authority. So it was with them that had only
Nature to correct Nature; that while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be the Physicians of it, could not cure
themselves, nor alter so much as Custom, which
had alter'd that.</p>
            <p>The Instances they give of a Philosophical
Cure, are as rare as the Miracles they pretend to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62572:13"/>
have been wrought in the Temple of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi>
or by a <hi>Vespasian,</hi> few and questionable; a <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
or a <hi>Polemon,</hi> to credit the Schools of a <hi>Socrates</hi>
or a <hi>Xenocrates.</hi> But the Instances of such as were
converted by our Saviour and Apostolical Persons,
were like his Miracles, numberless, and not to
be disputed. When the Gospel flew like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
through the earth, and became as successful
in reforming, as teaching the world; Nature by
it was changed, and the Temper became subject
to the Divine Power. So that the Doctrine of
Christ <hi>did turn those that were immersed in wickedness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Contr. Cels. l. 1, &amp; 2.</note>
               <hi>to a life agreeable to Reason, and the practice of all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;</hi>
as <hi>Origen</hi> shews, and appeals to his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in.</p>
            <p>And what was then done, would always be
done, if there were not some obstruction on our
part, either as to asking that Assistance, or in
the not improving it; according to that of our
Saviour, <hi>Matth. 13. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whosoever hath</hi> and useth it,
<hi>to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> It is worthy of God, and becoming the
most Benevolent as well as the most powerful of
Beings, to consult what may be for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the reasonable Nature, and to propound
this as an encouragement to them in the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that Service he expects and requires of
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62572:14"/>
And what can make them happy, if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Method of Salvation revealed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
be not sufficient for it? Whereby they are
not only assured of the Protection and Blessing of
Divine Providence in this Life, but also of a State
of Immortality in the Life to come: Where
they shall be taken into the Enjoyment of their
Ever-blessed Creator; and be fitted both in Body
and Soul, by the Divine Power, for such a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation.</p>
            <p>To which I may add, That it is as worthy of
God to reveal the Way by which that Happiness
is to be attained. I grant that by the use and
power of Reason, and the sense we have of the
difference between Good and Evil, we may learn,
though obscurely and very imperfectly, what is
acceptable to God: But yet without Revelation
we are much in the dark, and can as little know
what is on our part necessary toward the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Happiness, as we do what the
Condition of the Future State is, and wherein
the Happiness of it consists.</p>
            <p>There is as much difference between what is
only supposed, and what is necessary, as there is
between what we hope for, and what is certain.
And therefore, as there needs a Revelation to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us of that which without Revelation we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62572:14"/>
hoped for; so there is as much need of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to inform us of what is necessary to our
Acceptance with God, and to our Happiness in
another world; and without which we are left
to Conjecture only. So that as far as Certainty
is to be preferr'd beyond Hope and Imagination;
and the Knowledge of what is necessary, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Conjecture; so much is the Comfort of
Revelation beyond that of Nature; and so much
is it becoming Almighty God, who gave us our
Nature and Being, to acquaint us with what may
both make us happy, and lead us to it. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
was this necessary, considering how far the
World had wandred out of the right way; and
what superstitious and infamous Rites had been
taken up; and what Practices dishonourable to the
Deity and Human Nature, had been used. And this
way to Happiness the Scripture has plainly reveal'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> It is a Design worthy of God, to reveal
Himself to the World, and to give Mankind a
right Notion and Representation of his Nature.
The Being of God, is what the whole Creation
proclaims; and there are some Attributes of his
lye open to all, and are conspicuous in their
effects, such are his Wisdom and Power. But
there are others that we rather know by Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and need a farther and brighter Light to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62572:15"/>
inform us in; and such are his Goodness and his
Mercy. And since these are as essential Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Deity as the other, and exceed them
in the influence they have upon mankind, as to
our Love and Adoration of him; and yet are
not so legible in the Frame of Nature, nor so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
in the Course of his Providence as the
other; we cannot conceive but that it is as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
our Creator to represent himself to be a
God Gracious and Merciful in a Revelation to
Mankind, as to be a God Great, Powerful, and
Wise in the Creation. We see how confused the
<hi>Gentile</hi> World was in their Notion of the Supreme
Power; how inconsistently they thought, and
how low their Representations were of the
Deity: And at best they had a very imperfect
Notion of those Divine Attributes of Love and
Goodness, of Pity and Compassion, of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and Condescension, of Patience and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
of Mercy and Forgiveness, which the
Scripture represents with Life and Perspicuity</p>
            <p>There it is that we find the Almighty Creator
stooping to the Creature, condescending to their
Condition, bearing with their Infirmities, pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Miseries, forgiving their Sins. There
we find him reproving, arguing, following Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with importunity, and leaving nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62572:15"/>
that was consistent with his Nature and
Honour to do, toward the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
And above all, <hi>In this was manifested the
love of God towards us, because that God sent his only
begotten Son into the world, that we might live through
him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 9.</p>
            <p>So that if to reveal what was not otherwise
to be known, concerning God's Reconciliation
to Mankind, and the Terms upon which he is
reconciled; if to restore Man to the state he is
fallen from, and to promote him to a state of
Purity, Perfection, and Happiness; if for God
to reveal and to render himself acceptable to
mankind by the most obliging Characters of
Love and Favour, be worthy of him; lastly, If
to reveal what is most worthy of God, be a
Character of Revelation, Then the Scripture is
such, and what is therein contained must be from
God.</p>
            <p>III. A Character necessarily belonging to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
and by which the True is to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from the False and Pretended, is a Divine
and Supernatural Evidence; which is the same
with the Third General Head, <hi>viz.</hi> The Proof
by which the Scripture's Claim to Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is to be made good; and that is next to be
considered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62572:16"/>
Now there are Three Instances of this kind, <hi>viz.</hi>
Prophecy, Miracles, and the wonderful Success
of the Christian Religion, and the Preservation
of it under the most Potent Opposition, and
greatest Discouragements.</p>
            <p>(1.) Prophecy. That is of it self a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">Cic. de Divin. l. 1.</note>
and as it is what all Nations, as well Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as Barbarous, have acknowledged; so being an
Instance of Revelation, it is a good Proof of
that Revelation which it doth accompany, and is
interwoven with. And this is the case before us;
for the Scripture being composed of matters of
a different kind, cannot have the same sort of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
But Prophecy being self-evident (when
the Event has apparently answer'd the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
and a Supernatural Evidence, is a good
Proof to what has no such Evidence; and which
for the sake of that Proof is as much a Matter of
Faith, and as credible, as the Prophecy it self; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such a Testimony being a Testimony from
God, cannot be applied to the support of a
Falshood. So that where there is Prophecy
truly so, we may conclude that to be true, and
to come from God, to which that Testimony is
given; for if the Testimony be Divine, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
confirmed by it must be Divine also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62572:16"/>
In discoursing upon which, I premise,</p>
            <p>1. That there is such a thing as Prophecy;
that things future have been predicted: <hi>Tully</hi> saith,
<hi>This all Nations have agreed in;</hi> as has been aforesaid.</p>
            <p>2. That Prophecy is a good Testimony to
what it is given (as I have proved already).</p>
            <p>So that there is nothing remains, but to shew
that the Revelation in Scripture hath had this
Testimony.</p>
            <p>And of this there are two sorts, Near, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.
Of both which we have an Instance in
the Prophet sent to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 Kings 13. 2.</p>
            <p>The Remote was, That a Child should be
born, <hi>Josiah</hi> by name, about 330 years after, who
should burn mens bones upon that Altar. The
Proximate (which we may otherwise call a Sign)
was, That at that time <hi>the altar should be rent, and
the ashes poured out.</hi> If the Remote had been alone,
it would have had little influence upon them who
were most nearly concerned; and therefore there
needed some present Sign to verify it. But
otherwise, the Remote is the stronger, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when at such a vast distance of time, as shall
render it impossible for Men or Angels to foresee,
or by any practices of theirs to accomplish;
when it depends upon Voluntary as Natural
Agents, and is in the conclusion answered by a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62572:17"/>
Parallel Event, it is to After-Ages a certain and
indisputable Evidence.</p>
            <p>To which if we add the Concurrence of both,
when there is a Chain and Series of Prophecies
near and remote, in a certain and continued or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
following each other, the first looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to others that are to succeed, and the latter
having a retrospect to the former; there is no
reasonable nor possible exception to be made
against the matter thus testified, without except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the Testimony of Prophecy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the sense of all mankind.</p>
            <p>As for Instance; if there be a Prophecy or
Prophecies in several Ages, from which it plainly
appears, that at such a precise time, in such an
Age of the world, some Hundreds or Thousands
of Years after, there should arise a certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
born at such a place, and in an extraordinary
way, and descended from such and such Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
who should come to reform Mankind;
and in confirmation of his Doctrine, should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
many astonishing Acts, and do many su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Works; that at a certain time, and in
a certain determined year, he should be put to
death by his own Nation, and upon it that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be captivated and destroyed, and the
Countrey desolate; it is a Testimony not to be
disproved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62572:17"/>
And yet setting aside the many Prophecies in
Scripture relating to particular Persons and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
to the <hi>Jews</hi> and other Nations, I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instance in some of those concerning our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
and others of our Saviour's himself: The
former of which will appear to be exactly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to the Case proposed.</p>
            <p>The first of these is the Prediction immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and 4000 years before
the actual Completion of it; That there should be
one born <hi>of the seed of the woman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 14.</note> and supernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>made</hi> of her alone (as <hi>Adam</hi> was out of the Earth
without a Woman) that should <hi>bruise the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's
head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> who had <hi>beguiled Eve through his subtilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About 2000 years after which Prophecy, and
so 2000 years before our Saviour, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 16.</note> That in his <hi>Seed,</hi> and by one
who should descend from him,<note place="margin">Gen. 12, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>all the families of
the earth should be blessed;</hi> and which was afterward
renewed to <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; about 1700 years before Christ, it
was prophesied by <hi>Jacob,</hi> That <hi>Shiloh,</hi> or the
<hi>Messiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen 49. 8.</note> should descend from his Son <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About 1000 years before our Saviour's Birth,
<hi>David</hi> was exalted to the Throne, of whose Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be a <hi>Branch;</hi> whence it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62572:18"/>
was that he was commonly known among the
<hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 42.</note> by the Character of <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the same Royal Prophet have we the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of our Saviour's Death, Resurrection,
and Glorification; and in very minute Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
as to the first of these, <hi>Vid.</hi> Psal. 16. 10.
22. 1, 7, 8, 14, 16, 18. 110, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is also the great Theme of <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
700 years before the Accomplishment,
That there should be <hi>a root out of Jesse,</hi> the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
who should dye for the Sins of the People,
be rejected by his own Nation, but be believed
in by the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Isa. 11. 10. 42. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 53.</p>
            <p>In the same Age lived <hi>Micah,</hi> who foretells
the very Place he should be born in,<note place="margin">Mic. 5. 2.</note> 
               <hi>viz. Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem-Ephrata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly; About 500 years before our Lord's
Incarnation, <hi>Daniel</hi> directly points to the Time
and the Year the <hi>Messiah</hi> should suffer in,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> which
was to be in the midst of the Seventieth Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Week,<note place="margin">Lev. 25. 8.</note> (each of which consists of Seven
Years) that is, the 490th. Year, from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> for the Rebuilding of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
As may easily be computed by <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon,
and reckoning the Years backward from the
Death of our Saviour, (which was in the Reign
of <hi>Tiberius)</hi> to some fixed year of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62572:18"/>
In consequence of which, the City and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
were to be destroyed, and the whole
Countrey laid desolate, as with a <hi>Flood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conclusion leads us on to the Second
Branch of Prophetical Observations, <hi>viz.</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
own Predictions, which are very many;
but a most remarkable one is his Prophecy of the
Destruction of that People, City, and Countrey,
foretold by <hi>Daniel</hi> as to the very time; and which
our Saviour describes so particularly, as if he had
it at that instant before his eyes, when he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of it to his Disciples.</p>
            <p>There he foretells, * The preceding Signs,
as Famines, and fearful Sights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> * that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
False Prophets should arise. * That there
should be barbarous Slaughters one of another.
* That <hi>Jerusalem</hi> should be closely besieged; but
withal, that at that time there should be an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for escaping; which he advises them
to take, and to fly to the Mountains for present
security. * That the Enemy should at last cast
a Trench about it, and keep them that remained
in on every side. * That he should finally take
the City, and lay it even with the ground; and
that not one stone of the stately Structure, the
Temple, (which they then were admiring)
should be left upon another. * That the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62572:19"/>
               <hi>Jews</hi> should be led Captive into all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and never return again to that Land as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors.
* And that all this was because they
knew not the time of their visitation. * And
that this should happen in that very Age.</p>
            <p>Never was any Prophecy more express, never
any Sentence more terrible, nor more punctually
fulfilled, as to all the Particulars before-recited;
and for which we may appeal to <hi>Josephus</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi>
who was an Eye-witness of all, and as exactly
describes it as to those Instances, as if he was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Comment upon our Saviour's Prophecy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Joseph. de Bell.</hi> l. 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, as the Temple, though at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate's Order, never
could be built, (as the Heathen Historian <hi>Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Marcellinus</hi> relates, <hi>Hist.</hi> l. 23.) so that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to this day remain Vagabonds, without any
certain place, dispersed over the world.</p>
            <p>Having traced this Subject thus far, we may
proceed.</p>
            <p>2. Another way by which we prove the
Claim that the Matter of Scripture hath to a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority, is Miracles; of which kind there
is nothing wanting that can reasonably be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and that either as to the <hi>Judaical,</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Dispensation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:62572:19"/>
As for Instance: If a Person should pretend
that he comes from God with a Revelation, and
which he requires us to hearken to, on peril of
Damnation: What Satisfaction should we desire?</p>
            <p>Surely if the Doctrine he teaches be in it self
credible, and worthy of God, and what in the
nature and tendency of it proves to be useful and
beneficial to Mankind, we have as much Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as the nature of the thing will bear. And
farther, if the Person upon whom we are to rely,
doth openly and in the sight of all, even of
Enemies that watch him, as well as Friends, and
in the most Publick Assemblies, cure all manner
of Diseases, though naturally incurable, by a Word,
or a Touch, and even at a distance. If he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the Winds and the Seas, the Good and the
Evil Angels, feeds Thousands in a Desart with
no more than what would satisfy a few, and
raises the Dead. If he tells the most secret
Thoughts, Inclinations, and Practices of his
Enemies as well as Followers. Lastly, If when
himself is put to a violent Death, he in a few
days, according to his own Prediction, rises
again, appears to, and converses with those that
knew him when alive, and saw him dead: And
afterwards in the view of many ascends bodily
into Heaven; and within a few days, as a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62572:20"/>
Testimony of his former Mission and present
Glorification, confers the same or like Power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Disciples: Who can reasonably doubt
of the Truth of what he has taught?</p>
            <p>I need not here draw the Parallel.</p>
            <p>And if the Question should be put, as it was
by those whom <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> sent, <hi>Art thou he
that should come?</hi> Our Saviour's Answer will serve
for one here, <hi>Tell John what things ye have heard and
seen, how that the blind see,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 19.</p>
            <p>There needs no greater Evidence to convince
Mankind.</p>
            <p>3. Another Proof of the Divine Authority
of the Matter of Scripture, is the Event and
Success, correspondent to former Predictions.
Such was that of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Canaan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And
much more, the wonderful and astonishing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of the Gospel, without any of that Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and Force which that People had, and
when it had the Force of Emperors and Kings to
oppose it.</p>
            <p>Could it be thought possible, that a few simple
and timerous Persons, who had been bred up to
a mean Employment, and had never been out of
their own Countrey, should each by himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
perilous and remote Journeys, among
People they had no knowledge of, and to whose
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62572:20"/>
Tempers, Customs, and Language, they were
altogether strangers; and should prevail with
them to change their gods and their Religion,
their Customs and their Lives?</p>
            <p>Could it be thought that Men of no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
nor Interest, of no Learning, Depth of
Judgment, nor Subtilty in Arguing, should be
able to maintain and propagate a Doctrine that
seemed to be foolish and absurd, a Doctrine of a
Crucified Saviour, a Doctrine opposite to the
sensual Inclinations and Interests of Mankind,
(as the state of the world then was) a Doctrine
that obliged them that believed it, to profess it
with the Hazard of all that was dear to them in
this world, and upon no other Encouragement
than a Reward in another?</p>
            <p>And yet even this Doctrine, so meanly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
became so successful, that according to our
Saviour's Prediction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 14. before the
Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and within Forty years
after his Death, <hi>the sound of it went out into all the
earth,</hi> Rom. 10. 18. Not to proceed further in
this Argument than Scripture; in those early
times we find Converts, if not Churches, in the
most frequented Cities for Trade, Learning, and
Dominion; in <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Ephesus, Athens</hi> and
<hi>Rome;</hi> in the Courts of Princes, even of a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62572:21"/>
and a <hi>Nero: Acts 13. 3. Phil.</hi> 4. 22. And
where not?</p>
            <p>Now if there had not been Truth in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
If it had not been a Doctrine worthy of
God, suitable to the Desires and Expectations of
Mankind; If it had not had a Supernatural Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Testimony, and an Assistance as great
as its Evidence, it could not in those Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have made its own way, nor have proved in
the Event so powerful and successful. No, it
was <hi>God that chose the foolish things of the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the wise, and the weak things of the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the things which were mighty:</hi> And it must be
a Revelation from him alone, that had all these
Testimonies on its side to confirm it. So that
we may conclude as we began, That if ever there
was a Revelation, the Revelation contained in
Scripture is a Revelation, and the only True
Revelation now in the World.</p>
            <p>And if so it be, then what an Obligation is
there upon us to observe it? When 'tis <hi>God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to us, <hi>we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
things we have heard</hi> from him, <hi>lest at any time we should
let them slip,</hi> Heb. 2. 1.</p>
