            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Yet neuertheles I wil franckly ſay what I thinke, and in fewer wordes then ſo great a thinge can wel be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Trulye I neuer iudged nor thought that richeſſe, wealth, ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous buildings, Reuenues, Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, Dominions, and bodely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures (wherin foliſh worldlinges ſet their chiefe delighte) were worthy to be reckened amonge ſuch thinges as are good and expetible. For I do ſee,
<pb facs="tcp:13119:9"/>
that although they haue great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; foyſon of ſuch tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſitory things, yet be they euer coueting and hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting after more, lacking aſwel that which they haue, as that whiche they haue not, becauſe their greedie deſire and thirſte of money and couetouſnes is neuer ſtenched nor ſatiſfyed. And they haue not onely an inward vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and diſquietnes of mind by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vnſaciable deſire and luſte that they haue to encreaſe and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Subſtaunce which they already poſſeſſe, but alſo euer ſtande in dreade and feare to looſe the ſame by one caſualtie or other. And in this poinct, I oftentimes finde a lacke of diſcretion, in our Aunceſtoures and predeceſſours, which were men of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing moſt vertuous and continente, who by the bare and onely name, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and called theſe vncertaine and tranſitory goodes and wares (which are commutable betweene man and
<pb facs="tcp:13119:10"/>
man in their bargaines &amp; traffique) to be good: whereas in verye deede, they thought farre otherwiſe, thenne theyr words outwardly purported. Can a thinge that is ſimplie good, be in an euil man? Or can any man that is endewed &amp; garniſhed with thoſe things that be good in deede, be any other then a good and vertuous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? But all theſe and ſuch like we ſee to be ſuch, that both naughtie men may poſſeſſe them, and good men by them may be hurt and damnifyed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any be ſo peeuiſhly diſpoſed to reprehende and mocke me for ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, let him not ſpare, I force not. For truth and ſound reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall with mee be euer preferred before the raſh iudgementes &amp; waueringe opinions of the fooliſhe multitude. Neyther wil I ſay, that any man hath loſt his good thinges, when he hath loſte his Cattell or houſehold ſtuffe. Neyther can I choſe, but oftentimes to praiſe
<pb facs="tcp:13119:10"/>
and greatly commend the wiſe man <hi>Bias</hi> (as I thinke) who was rekoned and accompted one of the ſeuen wyſe Sages of Greece. For when his citie <hi>Priene</hi> was by the Enemye taken &amp; ranſacked, al the Inhabitaunts ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for them ſelues, &amp; conuaighinge them ſelues out at a Poſterne gate, with bagge and baggage, as muche as they could carie, hee was aduiſed and counſayled by one of his frends to do ſemblably: I do (quoth hee) eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſwell as they. For I carye awaye with mee, all ſuch goods and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are mine: meaning his vertue, wiſedome and learninge. But as for worldlye pelfe and tranſitorie goods whiche are ſubiecte to the variable chaunce and hazard of blind dalying fortune, he thoughte were not to bee called his owne proper goods, which we do call and terme good. What is good then (will ſome ſay) or what is ment therby. If what ſoeuer is done
<pb facs="tcp:13119:11"/>
rightlye, honeſtly, and accordinge to vertue, be ſayde to be done well and laudablie, then it followeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is right, honeſt and according to vertue is (as I thinke) only good.

Notwithſtanding they are not ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately wedded to their owne fond reaſons and ſelfe willes, but they will ſone be perſwaded to relent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that theſe mutable &amp; vncertaine goods &amp; wares which ſerue for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bargayning one man with an other, are not worthy to be rekoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge thoſe thynges that are good. But this poynt they do ſtiffely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and earneſtly defend, that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is the greateſt goodnes and the higheſt felicity. Which ſaying in my opinion ſemeth rather to procede out of the mouthes of brute beaſtes then of men.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou therefore ſo much abaſe and caſt away thy ſelf, ſeing that god or nature (being the common mother of all thynges) hath geuen to thee a

minde, then whiche there is nothinge more excellente and deuine that thou ſhouldeſt thinke no difference to be betwene thee, and a dum beaſt? Is any thing good, that doth not make him that poſſeſſeth it to be better? For as euery man is moſte endued &amp; gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with vertue, ſo is he worthy of moſte prayſe. And there is nothinge that is good, but he that is therewith decorated, may honeſtlye reioyce and glory in himſelfe for it. But is any of all theſe in pleaſure? Doth it make a man either better or more praiſeable? Is there any ſo ſhameles to extoll his owne lewedneſſe, or to attribute any honeſt praiſe to himſelfe, for yelding &amp; enthralling hymſelfe to voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and laſciuiouſlye liuing after hys own inordinate Senſuality? Seing therefore that pleaſure (in defence whereof very many do ſtiffely ſtand) is not to be accompted among good thinges, but the more that it is vſed,
<pb facs="tcp:13119:14"/>
the more it doth alienate the minde from the ſtate wherin it was before: Certes to liue well and happely is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but to liue vprightlye and honeſtly.</p>

And whatſoeuer is vnlawful to bee done, is in this one poinct contayned, and expreſſely proued, in ſaying that it is not lawfull: Which can neyther be made more or leſſe. For if it be not lawfull, it is ſinne, which is alwayes one and the ſame: and therfore the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſpringe and proceede out of them, muſte needes be equall. Alſo if
<pb facs="tcp:13119:18"/>
vertues be equall one wyth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vices alſo muſte be equall. But it may moſt playnly and eaſelie be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and vnderſtanded that vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are all equall one with an other, foraſmuch as there can not bee anye man better then a good man, nor any more temperate, then hee that is temperate, neyther anye ſtowter and valianter then hee that is ſtoute and valiaunt, nor wyſer then he that is wiſe, wilte thou call him a good man, that whereas he mighte gayne clearly and detaine to himſelfe tenne pounds of gold being committed to his keepinge and cuſtodie in ſecreate without any witneſſe, yet faythfully and truly redeliuereth the ſame to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> owner therof, if he would not do ſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blablye in tenne thouſande poundes? Or woulde you repute and take him to bee a temperate man, whiche can brydel his affections and refraine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome one licencious luſt, and lettethe go the Reynes of al diſordered oute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb facs="tcp:13119:19"/>
in an other? Onely vertue is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable with all reaſon and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſtancie. Nothing can be added therevnto, to make it to bee more a vertue: nothing can be taken awaye from it, but the name of vertue ſhall ſtrayght wayes, be taken away and ceaſſe. For if thinges that bee well done, be rightly and vertuouſly don, and nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be righter then right, verily neither can anything be found that is better then good. It foloweth therfore, that vices are equal. For the naughtyneſſe of the mind are aptlye termed vyces. But ſyth vertues are equal, vertuous deedes alſo, (becauſe they proceede and come of vertue) oughte to be equall Semblably ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes becauſe they ſprynge and aryſe out of vyces, muſt nedes be equall. Yea Sir, (wil ſome ſay) you take and ground this opinyon vpon the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers doctrine. I was afrayd, leaſt you would haue ſayd, I had be rowed and gathered it of Ribauo
<pb facs="tcp:13119:19"/>
and verletts. <hi>Socrates</hi> his vſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was to diſpute after ſuch a ſorte. I am well apayde thereof: for aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and autenticke hyſtoryes doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and witneſſe that hee was a profoundly learned and alſo a righte wyſe man. But yet I demaund this queſtion of you (ſeing we do quietlye reaſon the matter wyth gentle wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and not with ſturdye buffettes) whether when wee diſpute of good thynges, we ought rather to ſeeke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mynd and opynion of rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt Tankerd bearers &amp; drudging labourers, or els of the approued lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned and famous Phyloſophers? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſith ther is no ſentence and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion eyther truer or more availeable to mans lyfe then this. What power or force doth more terrefye men from committing any kind of ſinful actes, then when they knowe that there is no difference in offences, and that they do offende aſmuche and as hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly
<pb facs="tcp:13119:20"/>
in laying violent handes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priuate perſons, as they ſhould if they did the ſame to Magiſtrates and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be ſet in high authorytie? And what houſe ſoeuer they do polute w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> baudry and whoredome, that the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoneſtie and ſhame of the lecherous fact is equall and al one. What? is there no difference (wyll ſome ſaye) whether a man kyll his owne father, or els ſome common Seruaunt? If you meane theſe twoe compariſons barely and ſymplye, not addyng the cauſe or the kyllers intente, it is hard to be iudged of what ſort they be. For if it be a horrible offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of it ſelf &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for one to kyl his father, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Sagunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> who had leifer that their Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſhould dye being free and vnuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyſhed, then to lyue in ſeruitude &amp; ſlauerye, were Parricides. Therfore in ſome caſe the ſonne may berefe his father of his lyfe wythoute offence, and manye times a poore drudge or
<pb facs="tcp:13119:20"/>
ſlaue maye be brought to his deathe, without great wronge and iniurye, And therfore the dyfference is in the cauſe, and not in the nature of the deede. Which being not ſought for of the party actyue, but vpon vrgent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſideration &amp; reſpect of the other party done, it is done more redely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiuely: but if the cauſe be a like and all one in both, the faultes alſo muſte needes be equal. Notwithſtandinge herein they do differ, that in killinge a Slaue. if it be done iniuriouſly, ther is but one ſingle offence committed, but in killing and takinge awaye the life of a father, there are many fautes. for therein is an vnnaturall dealinge ſhewed to him that begat thee, that foſtered and brought thee vp, that in ſtructed and taught thee, that placed thee in good ſtate to liue in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and furniſhed thee with houſes and neceſſaries. He is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his offences, which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb facs="tcp:13119:21"/>
from his father, that which he himſelfe receyued of him, and therfore deſerueth a great deale more puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente. But in the race and courſe of our life we ought not to waigh and conſider what puniſhment is mete &amp; due for euery faulte, but to looke and perpend what is lawfull and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for euery man to do. To do that whiche behoueth not to be done we oughte to thinke to be an offence: but to do any thing which is prohibited &amp; vnlawfull, we ought to iudge and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte a deteſtable and curſed deede. Is this to be ſo preciſely taken for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery light matter and ſmall treſpaſſe? Yea truelye, for we cannot imagine a meane of the thynges, but we maye bridle oure affections and keepe oure mindes in a modeſt meaſure. If a Stage player do neuer ſo little in his geſture miſſe &amp; tranſgreſſe the notes of meſure or erre in pronouncing one ſillable in a verſe long which ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:13119:21"/>
be ſhorte or contrarywiſe that ſhorte which ſhould be long, he is hiſſed at, derided, and with clapping of handes driuen away: and wilt thou ſay, that thou ſhouldeſt erre and offende ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as in one ſyllable, in thy lyfe which ought to be more moderat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any geſture &amp; more inculpable then a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny verſe? I cannot abide to heare a Poet make a fault in his verſe thogh it be but in a trifeling matter, &amp; ſhall I heare a citizen ſkanne vpon his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers his faultes which in the ſocietye of his life he hath committed? Whiche if they ſeme to be ſhorter, yet how can they ſeme to be lighter ſithens euery offence and ſinne commeth by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of reaſon and order? For reaſon and order being once broken &amp; perturbed, there can nothinge be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, wherebye it maye ſeeme that the offence maye anye whitte more bee encreaſed.</p>
