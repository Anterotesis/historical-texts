            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That their yonglings might become learned, what paynes or costes refu sed the parentes? They sente theyr children from country to country, from one learned man to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                        <pb facs="tcp:1414:38"/>
pertakers of flesh and bloud, he also him selfe likewise toke part with them.</p>
                     <p>☞ Here as S. Paule declareth euidently, that as the children, that is to say, men be pertakers of flesh and bloud, so lykewise Christ (because he might destroy him that had lordship ouer death: that is to say, the deuill by the death in his owne body) was made pertaker of the same, that is, of flesh &amp; bloud. No man doubteth that our flesh is of the nature and substance of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no more is it to be doubted that Christ toke his fleshe of the nature and substance of Mary his mother, seyng the epistle saith that Christ was made per taker of flesh and bloud wyth vs. This coulde he not haue ben if he had brought his body with hym from heauen, or had taken it of anye other then of a naturall woman, although a pure and vndefiled Uirgine.</p>
                     <p>Therfore lyke as a man taketh hys nature of his parentes, so lykewise toke Christ by humain nature of the blessed Uirgine his mother. He sai eth moreouer (He) meanyng Christ, in no place taketh on him the aungels, but the sede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham taketh he on hym.</p>
                     <p>Here the Apostle manifestlye confuteth the wicked opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them which teach that Christ had a celestiall body or a body made of the ayre, and plainly affirmeth that he toke the sede of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, that is to say: was made and became ve ry true and naturall man of the kinrede of Abra ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accordyng to Gods promise. So that all that euer he had, concerning his humanitie, he had it of the blessed Uirgine, which came of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> stocke of Abraham.</p>
                     <p>☞ Agayne he saith in all things it became hym

to be made lyke vnto hys bretherne. Here saint Paule confesseth that Christ was made like vn to vs in all thynges, which thyng by no meanes could be true, yf he had not taken vpon him our nature and substaunce. If he belyke vnto vs in all thynges (sinne alone excepte) so followeth it that he is of the same nature, &amp; of the same fleshe and bloud that we are, or els could not he be like vnto vs in all thynges. And so should thys holy apostle and al other godly writers and teachers haue brought vs in errour. But let god be true and all heretikes lyers.</p>
