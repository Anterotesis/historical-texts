            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
DEMONSTRATION,
THAT,
Hen. Meriton, John Meriton and Lau. Park, Prieſts,
Of the County of Norfolk, in Confederacy with Francis Bugg, were
The CHALLENGERS;
And not the QUAKERS.</head>
            <p>F. <hi>BUGG,</hi> their Mercenary Agent, Printed a <hi>Challenge</hi> upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> bearing Date,
the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1698. in which he ſays, <q>
                  <hi>Friends,</hi> you cannot but remember your
Ancient Practice in going into the Churches, diſturbing the Eſtabliſhed Miniſters,
your Challenging them into the Field, to Diſpute with you: But behold! Here is a Change
with you. <hi>We</hi> may now <hi>Challenge</hi> you, and Charge you again and again; Fearfulneſs doth
Surprize you, that you dare not appear; but remember it is a ſign you cannot defend your
Errors, and that your Innocency is not Triumphant, as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> boaſts: Let this <hi>Charge
and Challenge</hi> therefore be a Touch-Stone to try your Sincerity, and let it be a <hi>Monument
of your Cowardiſe and Inſincerity for ever.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, whether the Three Perſons above named, who did ſo publickly Eſpouſe <hi>F. B</hi>'s Charge
and <hi>Challenge</hi> be not Included in the <hi>We</hi> Expreſs'd in the above Recited <hi>Challenge:</hi> Let their
following Actions demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>For upon the 28th Day of the Month called <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, <hi>L. Park</hi> wrote a Letter to <hi>S. Cater,</hi>
a Miniſter among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> with the ſaid <hi>Printed <hi>Challenge</hi>
               </hi> incloſed; acquainting him, the
ſaid <hi>S. Cater,</hi> 
               <q>That he, the ſaid <hi>L. Park,</hi> and <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and Four more (Six in all) would make
good the Charge, therein contained, and that they had agreed upon Time and Place, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Third of <hi>October</hi> next (ſays he) if you will meet us with the ſame Number, at Ten of
the Clock in the Forenoon, of that Day, in <hi>Dereham Church;</hi> or if that place Offend you, at
any other Place within the ſaid Pariſh of <hi>Weſt-Dereham;</hi> and you are deſired to reſolve us in
14 Days time, that we may relie upon it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And further, to ſhew the Induſtry and Officiouſneſs of the Three <hi>Prieſts</hi> before named, to
Puſh on the ſaid <hi>Challenge,</hi> and to Urge our Acceptance thereof, and to come forth on the <hi>Third</hi>
of <hi>October</hi> next after: The following <hi>Certificates</hi> may fully Evince.</p>
            <p>This is to Certifie, That on or about the 28th Day of the Month called <hi>Auguſt, 1698. John
Meriton</hi> and <hi>Lau. Park</hi> came, with <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> accompanied with ſeveral of the Inhabitants of <hi>Weſt-Dereham,</hi>
to the Houſe of <hi>William Phillips (Tho. Becket</hi>'s Wife being there) and did leave a
<hi>Printed Charge</hi> and <hi>Challenge</hi> (with <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Name thereto) againſt the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi>
and ſoon after, upon the ſame day, <hi>Samuel Chicko,</hi> one of the Inhabitants of <hi>Weſt-Dereham</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
brought a Paper in Writing to the ſaid <hi>Tho. Becket</hi>'s Wife, wherein was Propoſed a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be upon the <hi>Third</hi> of <hi>October</hi> next following, in <hi>Weſt-Dereham Church,</hi> and that they would
be Six of them, and would allow us the like Number, to Debate the Matters contained in the
ſaid Printed Challenge. Witneſs our Hands, <hi>William Phillips, Mary Becket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is to Certifie, That upon or about the 30th Day of the Month called <hi>Auguſt, 1698.
Hen. Meriton</hi> and <hi>John Meriton</hi> came, with <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>John Hubbard,</hi> in <hi>Stoak,</hi>
and there did urge again the ſaid Matter, of a Publick Meeting, in the Preſence of, <hi>John Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,
Daniel Phillips, Edward Plumſtid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſame day, the aforeſaid <hi>Prieſts,</hi> with <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> went to the <hi>Crown-Inn,</hi> in the ſaid
Town of <hi>Stoak;</hi> and one or more of them, would have had the <hi>Inn-keeper</hi> Poſt up the ſaid
<hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Challenge,</hi> which the ſaid <hi>Inn-keeper</hi> refuſed to do: This he affirmed in our Preſence,
<hi>John Gurney, Joſeph Hadduk, Gilbert Lowe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which it manifeſtly appears, that the ſaid <hi>Prieſts,</hi> with <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> were the <hi>Aggreſſors, and
Challengers,</hi> and not the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore let all Sober and Moderate Perſons Judge, whether we could do any leſs, than
Appear and Defend <hi>Our Selves,</hi> againſt their falſe <hi>Charge;</hi> conſidering how they <hi>Dared</hi> us to
<hi>Come forth</hi> and Charged us with <hi>Fearfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Surprize,</hi> if we did not; and ſaid, <hi>Let
it be a Monument of your Cowardiſe and Inſincerity for ever.</hi>
