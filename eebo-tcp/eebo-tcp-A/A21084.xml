            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

the anſwere is, that in the times when we were
ſerued with the ſaid Wares from <hi>Turkey,</hi> the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was but ſmall, becauſe the prizes then were
deare; ſo that wee may well counterpoize the loſſe
of that imployment of Shipping with as much or
more tunnage now ſet on worke to fetch Timber,
Plancke, Pipe-Staues, and Timber knees out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and Hempe out of <hi>Eaſt land</hi> to make our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
for the furniſhing of ſo many great Shippes
as wee now imploy to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and alſo for the
bringing in of Wines, Elephants teeth, wrought
Silkes, Corrall, Quicke-Siluer, and other forraigne
Wares, to furniſh out thoſe Voyages.</p>
               <p>ANd if it be further objected, that this great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Shipping which is here declared, is not
alwayes in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> vpon occaſion of ſervice,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:324:6"/>
the anſwere is. That neither are the Shippes of any
other Marchants heere at home, but ſome are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſome are comming, and euer the leaſt part
are in the <hi>Kingdome;</hi> yet ſtill whereſoeuer they are,
his Maieſties Subiects haue by them their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and maintenance, and the <hi>Kingdome</hi> aſwell
as the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company haue had their ſervice:
For how famous are their exploits to all Nations?
how many rich Carracks haue they ſuncke and
ſpoyled? how many aſſaults of <hi>Spaniſh Gallions</hi> haue
they withſtood and foyled? What ſlaughter of
their Souldiers, ſacke of their Townes, ſubverſion
of their trades, and ſuch like honorable actions
haue they performed? and all with little loſſe of
Shippes or men. It would require a large diſcourſe,
to declare the particulars: Neither doth the <hi>East
India</hi> Company commonly want three thouſand
Tunns of ſhipping or more heere in the <hi>Kingdome,</hi>
which are either in building or repayring, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all their Ordnance and other Warlike
furniture, beſides their Store-houſes and Dock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards
plentifully provided with Timber, Plancke,
Cordage, Powder, Shot, and many other neceſſary
Ammunitions both for themſelues, and oftentimes
to helpe others with ſuch proviſions as cannot elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
be found for money in this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Gun-powder, whereof they haue a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
now in ſtore, and doe make weekely about
thirtie barrels at their owne powder Mills, of ſuch
<hi>refined Salt Peeter,</hi> as they bring from the <hi>Indies</hi> in
their ſhipping.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:324:7"/>
THere is yet one common Objection, but it is
ſo weake that it ſcarſe deſerues an anſwere,
which is, that this <hi>East India</hi> Trade deſtroyes our
Shipping and Marriners, when cleane contrary to
this wee haue alreadie ſhewed the great encreaſe
of both; and if men dye in theſe long voyages, and
Ships by length of time be laid vp, either here or
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> yet what's all this but natures courſe;
and that which happens here at home in our neereſt
Trades, although with farre leſſe noiſe and notice?
How many braue Commanders haue wee bred
from meane degree? (whereof diuers are ſtill in our
ſervice,) ſome at this preſent are found worthie the
beſt places in his Maieſties Navie, many of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie

and others (being growne rich) doe either
keepe at home or follow ſhorter voyages, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
theſe advantages wee doe anſwere all with this,

firſt of theſe Courſes doth bring in the money
which wee haue, the laſt will carry it away againe
when wee haue gott it. It is a true ſaying, that
plentie or ſcarſitie of money makes all things deare
or cheape in a Common-wealth, but it is neceſſary
to diſtinguiſh the <hi>ſeeming plenties of money</hi> from that
which <hi>onely is ſubſtantiall</hi> and able to performe the

rather impoveriſh the ſame, by the ſeverall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
which ever accompany ſuch altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>FOr firſt, if we ſhould melt downe our Plate into
Coyne, (which ſutes not with the Maieſtie of ſo

it would cauſe plenty of money for a time,

enlarge, (becauſe it is not much pertinent to our

for, whether it be the Stranger or the Engliſh Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant

doe our lands improue, for when the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant

The ſecond is the gaine of the <hi>Marchant,</hi> which

is the gaine of the <hi>King,</hi> whereof he is euer certaine

courſe of Trade, by the ballance of the ſame, when
exceſſes are avoyded: therefore it is needeleſſe here
to make any further repetition; onely wee doe in
this place affirme that ſuch happineſſe may be in
the Common Wealth, when the Marchant for his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:324:11"/>
particular ſhall haue no occaſion to reioyce. As for
example; ſuppoſe the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company ſhould
ſend out one hundred thouſand pounds in Wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

for the ſame, the full value of three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

the Publique Stocke is <hi>trebled,</hi> and yet we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay, that which we can well proue, that our ſayd
Company of <hi>Marchants</hi> ſhall be looſers by ſuch an
adventure, if the returnes be made in <hi>Spice, Indico,
Callicoes, Beniamin, refined Salt Peeter, Cotton-yarne,</hi>
and ſuch other bulkey wares in their ſeverall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
according to their vent and vſe in theſe
parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> for the fraight of ſhipping, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of the Adventure, the charges of Factors
abroad, and Officers at home, the forbearance of
the Stocke, his Maieſties cuſtome and impoſts,
with other pettie charges incident, will bee aboue
two hundred thouſand pounds, which being added
to the principall produceth loſſe,<note place="margin">The King and Kingdome may get by Trade euen vvhen the Marchant looſeth.</note> and thus wee ſee
that not onely the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> but alſo the KING
may get very much, even when the Marchant not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſhall looſe in his proportion, which
giveth good occaſion here to conſider how much
more the <hi>Realme</hi> is inriched by this <hi>Trade,</hi> when
all things paſſe ſo happily that the Marchant is a

               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:324:12"/>
BVt for the better explayning of that which hath
beene alreadie alledged, wee muſt vnderſtand
that if the ſaid hundred thouſand pounds ſhould
be <hi>trebled</hi> by the returne of ſo much Silkes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fine Wares out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> then the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
likewiſe ſhould receiue good gaine by ſuch
an adventure; and the reaſon is, becauſe this great
wealth would require but fiue hundred tunn of
Shipping to lade and bring home the ſame,
which is but a very ſmall charge in reſpect of foure
thouſand and fiue hundred tunnes of Shipping,
which would be required to lade home the like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
in the bulky Commodities of Spice and the like,
which are afore-written.</p>
               <p>THe ſecond ſort of gaine in the courſe of trade
is, when the Marchant by his laudable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
may both bring in and carry out Wares to
his advantage, by buying them and ſelling them
to good profit, which is the end of his labours:
Yet nevertheleſſe, the Common-wealth ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
and growe poore <hi>by a diſorder in the people,</hi>
when through <hi>pride</hi> and other <hi>exceſſes</hi> they doe
conſume more forraigne Ware in value, then the

               <p>ANd here we will ſuppoſe, that our yearely

               <p>TO this the anſwer is, that when we haue
prepared our exportations of wares, and
ſent out aſmuch of euery thing as wee can
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:324:18"/>
ſpare or vent abroad; it is not therefore ſaid,
that then we ſhould add our money thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

rather firſt to inlarge our trade therewith, by
inabling vs to bring in more forraigne wares,
which being ſent out againe into the places of

doth in the the end become an exportation
vnto vs of a farre greater value then our ſayd
monies were, which is proued by three ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
examples following.</p>
               <p>FIrſt, we wil ſuppoſe that one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds ſterling, being ſent in our ſhip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping

hundred thouſand quarters of wheate cleare

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:324:18"/>
Pounds to make the Marchant but a ſauer,
yet by this reckoning wee ſee the <hi>Kingdome</hi>
hath doubled that <hi>Treaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGaine this proffit will bee farre greater
when wee trade thus with our <hi>money</hi> in
<hi>remote Countries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The trade to the Eaſt Indies (in its propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is the beſt trade and meanes wee haue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Treaſure.</note> as for example, if wee ſend
one hundred thouſand pounds into the <hi>East
Indies</hi> to buy pepper there and bring it hither,
and from hence ſend it for <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> it
muſt yeeld fiue hundred thouſand pounds at
leaſt in thoſe places, in regard of the exceſſiue
charge which the Marchant disbourſeth in
thoſe long voyages in ſhipping, wages, victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
inſurance, intereſt, cuſtomes, impoſts,
and the like: all which charges notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>the King</hi> and <hi>the Kingdome</hi> gets. And
wee may heere obſerue, that as the publike
proffit by forraigne trade is the onely meanes
whereby we gaine our <hi>Treaſure:</hi> So this trade
to the <hi>East Indies</hi> (in its proportion) doth
farre excell all others.</p>
               <p>THe third example is, where the voyages
are ſhort and the wares rich, which ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will not imploy much ſhipping, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to the <hi>Kingdome</hi> wilbe farre leſſe; as when
an other hundred thouſand pounds ſhall be
imployed in <hi>Turkey</hi> in raw ſilkes and brought
hither to be after tranſported from hence into
<hi>Fraunce</hi> the <hi>Low Countries</hi> or <hi>Germanie,</hi> the
Marchant ſhall haue good gaine although he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:324:19"/>
ſell it there for one Hundred and Fifty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds: and thus take the voyages all
together in their <hi>medium</hi> the ready monies
exported will bee retourned vnto vs neere
<hi>trebled.</hi> But if any man wil yet obiect that theſe
returnes come to vs in wares, and not really
in moneys as they were iſſued out.</p>
               <p>THe anſwer is, (keeping our firſt ground)
that if our <hi>conſumption of forraigne wares,</hi>
bee no more yearely then is already ſuppoſed,
and that our exportations bee ſo mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by this maner of Trading with ready
money as is before declared: it is not then
poſſible (in the courſe of trade) but that all the
<hi>ouer ballance</hi> or <hi>difference</hi> ſhould returne
either in <hi>monie</hi> or in ſuch <hi>wares</hi> as wee muſt
<hi>Export againe;</hi> which as is already plainely
ſhewed will bee ſtill a greater meanes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
our <hi>Treaſure:</hi> For it is in the ſtocke of
a <hi>Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e,</hi> as in the eſtates of priuate men, who
hauing ſtore of wares, doe not therefore ſay
that they will not venture out, or trade with
their money; (for this were ridiculous) but
doe alſo turne that into wares, whereby they
multiply their money; and ſo by a continuall
&amp; orderly change of one into the other grow
rich, &amp; when they pleaſe, turne al their eſtates
into Treaſure, for they that haue wares can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
want money, and therefore the former
obiection is not conſiderable: for what begot
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:324:19"/>
the monies which wee ſent out, but our
wares.</p>
               <p>NEither is it ſaid that <hi>Money</hi> is the life of
<hi>Trade,</hi> as if it could not ſubſiſt or paſſe
current without the ſame; for wee know that
there was great Trading by way of <hi>Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>Barter,</hi> when there was little Money
ſtirring in the world. The <hi>Italians</hi> and ſome
other <hi>Nations</hi> haue ſuch remedies againſt this
want, that it can neither decay nor hinder
their Trade, for they transferre Bils of Debt,
and haue other wayes whereby they aſſigne
their Credits from one to an other daily for
very great ſummes with eaſe and ſatisfaction
by Writing onely,<note place="margin">Money inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth trade, and trade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> whilſt in the meane time,
the <hi>Maſſe of Treaſure</hi> which gaue foundation,
to thoſe Credits is imployed in <hi>Forraigne
Trade as a merchandize,</hi> which doth much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their Trafficke. It is not therefore the
keeping of our Money in the Kingdome,
which makes a quicke and ample Trade, but
the neceſſitie and vſe of our Wares in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Countries, and our want of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
which cauſeth the Vent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
on all ſides.</p>
               <p>VVE muſt not here forget the practiſe
of the great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuscany</hi> in his
Port of <hi>Leghorne,</hi> which of late yeeres from a

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:324:20"/>
of the moſt famous places for Trade in Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome,

and yet it is worthy obſeruation that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Ships and Wares which come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
haue little or no meanes to make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
from thence, but <hi>onely in readie Money,</hi>
which they may, and doe carrie away freely at
all times and without Cuſtome, and ſuch
charges to the incredible aduantage, of the
ſaid Duke of <hi>Tuſcanie</hi> and his Subiects, who
are much inriched by the continuall great
concourſe of Merchants, from all the States
of the neighbour <hi>Princes,</hi> bringing them plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Monye daily to ſupplie their wants of
the ſaid wares. And thus we ſee that the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of Merchandiſe which carries away their
<hi>Treaſure,</hi> becomes a flowing ſtreame to fill
them againe <hi>In a greater meaſure with Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe example of this growing greatneſſe,
hath lately mooued the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi>
publickely to declare his Princely reſolution
to all Nations, offering them many Priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and immunities, that ſhall come to Trade
in his free Port of <hi>Vila Franca,</hi> and eſpecially
a libertie to carrie away ready Monyes for
all the Wares they bring, or other occaſions:
and yet wee know that neither in <hi>Tuſcanie</hi> or
<hi>Sauoy,</hi> are any <hi>Mines</hi> or <hi>Monies</hi> more then
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:324:20"/>
they haue and doe dayly get by trade; but
they know likewiſe that if wee yearely bring
them wares (although for a very great value)
the money will immediately follow; For, let
no man doubt but that monie muſt euer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
on Marchandize, for they goe together:
And it is worthy the noting that thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are content to part with their treaſure on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to inioy the trade of the wares which are
brought them, for which (to encourage the
Marchant) they take no Cuſtome; whereas
wee by ſending out our money doe gayne the
imployment of our ſhipping, the trade of the
wares, and the proffit of the Cuſtomes which
is a treble benefit.</p>
               <p>THere is yet an obiection or two as weake
as all the reſt: The firſt is, that if we trade
with our money, wee ſhall iſſue out the leſſe
wares; as if a man ſhould ſay, thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
which heretofore had occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
our Cloath, Lead, Tynn, Iron, Fiſh, &amp;
the like ſhall now make vſe of our <hi>monies</hi> in
the place of thoſe <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> which to affirme
were moſt abſurde, or that the Marchant had
not rather carry out wares (by which there is
euer ſome gaines expected) then to export
money, which is ſtill but the ſame without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
encreaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:324:21"/>
BVt on the contrary there are many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
which may yeeld vs very large and
profitable traffique for our money, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
afford vs no trade at all becauſe they haue
no vſe of our wares, as namely the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi>
for one, in the firſt beginning therof although
ſince by induſtry in our Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce with thoſe
Nations we haue brought them into the vſe of
much of our Cloth, Leade, Tynn, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, which is a good addition to the
former vent of our commodities.</p>
               <p>AGaine, ſome men haue alleadged that
thoſe Countries which permit money to
be carried out, doe it, becauſe they haue few or
no wares to trade withall: but we haue great
ſtore of Commodities, and therefore their
action ought not to be our example.</p>
               <p>TO this the anſwer is briefly; That if wee
haue ſuch a quantitie of wares, as doth
fully prouide vs of all things needfull from
beyond the Seas, why ſhould wee then
doubt that our monies ſent out in trade muſt
not <hi>neceſſarily come backe againe in Treaſure.</hi>
together with the great gaines which it may
procure in ſuch manner as is before ſet down?
And on the other ſide if thoſe Nations which
ſend out their monies, do it becauſe they haue
few wares of their owne; how come they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:324:21"/>
then to haue ſo much <hi>Treaſure</hi> as wee euer ſee
in thoſe places, which ſuffer it freely to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
at all times and by whom ſo euer. We
anſwer <hi>euen by trading with their monies:</hi> For
by what other meanes can they get it, hauing
no mines of <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Siluer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THus may wee plainely ſee, that when this
waighty buſineſſe is duely conſidered in
<hi>its end</hi> (as all our humaine actions ought well
to be weighed) it is found much contrarie to
that which moſt men eſteeme thereof,<note place="margin">Our humane actions ought eſpecially to be conſidered in their ends.</note> becauſe
they ſearch no further then the beginning of
this worke, which miſinformes their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and leades them into errour: For if wee
only behold the actions of the Husbandman
in the ſeede time, when he caſteth away much
good corne into the ground, we wil rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
him a madd man then a Husbandman:
but when we conſider his labours in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt,
which is the <hi>end of his indeauours;</hi> Wee
finde the worth and plentifull increaſe of his
actions.</p>
