            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In which Diſcourſe is proved, that preaching of the
Word is a peculiar Calling, to be undertaken by
none without a ſpeciall Call: and that more is
required in ſuch who undertake it, than abilities: in
which likewiſe other incidentall Queſtions and

            <head>The VVriting occaſioning
the enſuing Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He places of Scripture underwritten, which ſome doe
bring to prove That a man who hath the gift of the
ſpirit, and can preach, may preach the Goſpel of
what calling ſoever he be.</p>
            <p>To prove it lawfull, they quote 2 <hi>Acts</hi> 17, 18. from which
place they underſtand, that not only they that have been at the
Univerſity, and have gotten learning, that they only ſhould be
Teachers; but they alſo to whom is given the gift: <hi>Ergo</hi> if I can
teach and edifie my breathren, and my brethren can teach
to edifie me, it is lawfull although we be but Tradeſmen; for
the Apoſtle did labour with his hands, and yet a Teacher; and
many others beſides, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>By way of Reaſon, thus.</p>
            <p>1. A Teacher is knowne to be called of God by thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
and gifts which hee hath received: but many of
Gods people have the gift to teach and reſolve doubts; <hi>Ergo</hi>
they are called, and therefore bound to teach.</p>
            <p>2. Every man who hath a gift which is ſpirituall, it is his
talent; and he who uſeth not his talent, God will take it from
him, and cloath him with ſhame and a curſe: <hi>Ergo</hi> men are
bound to uſe their gifts.</p>
            <p>And this is the way which we have preſcribed.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Joel. 28. 44 Iſaiah 3. 1 Cor. 14. 29. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 31, and
33 <hi>ver.</hi> The Reaſon is given, God is not the author of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
but of peace; which doth prove, as they underſtand,
that when men can propheſie, and doe not, it cauſeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and not peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64508:3"/>
11 <hi>Numb. 29. Would God all could propheſie. 8 Acts</hi> 1.
compared with the third and fourth verſes of that Chapter.</p>
            <p>From which places they underſtand, that any one poore or
rich, weak or ſtrong, if they could teach, they became Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers.</p>
            <p>The ſame times are now for the want of publick meanes;
they were ſcattered, ſo are we.</p>
            <p>Therefore if God enable us, we will take a courſe in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.
If men ſend us to priſon, God will ſend priſon-comforts.</p>
            <p>1 Pet. 4. 10, 11. As every man hath received a gift, ſo let
them adminiſter the ſame one to another.</p>
            <p>In this thing I deſire to be reſolved, being of my ſelfe but
weak, and not able fully to anſwer it.</p>

            <head>An Anſwer to the
former VVriting.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ſeriouſly pondered the paper; and according to
your deſire have returned an Anſwer, to help you to
a ſatisfaction in thoſe things, wherein ſome have
ſought to ſcruple you. All which (by the aſſiſtance
of God) I have throughly ſifted, and I hope ſhall diſcover what
bran was preſented by the Objectors in ſtead of the pure man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet
of Gods word.</p>
            <p>The maine aſſertion in the paper is this.</p>
            <p>A man that hath the gift of the Spirit, and can preach, may
preach the Goſpel, of what calling ſoever we be.</p>
            <p>The proofs alledged ſeeme to prove two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That any, of any Profeſſion, may preach, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled.
<hi>And Secondly,</hi> That ſuch ought to doe ſo, eſpecially in the want
of publique meanes.</p>
            <p>I conceive, that the Affirmers of theſe things doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by this word Preaching, and Teaching: preaching, as it
is largely taken for any kinde of notifying, and making known
the Goſpel of Chriſt, or the Oracles of God: for then what
need this controverſie, ſince it is well knowne, that there are
many wayes thus to doe?<note place="margin">18 Acts 26.</note> as namely, by Conference, ſo <hi>Aquila</hi>
and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> expounded to <hi>Apollos</hi> the way of God more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.<note place="margin">1 Luke 4.</note>
Or by Catechiſing; ſo <hi>Theophilus was inſtructed, that

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>wherein thou haſt
been catechiſed;</hi> ſo is the originall, though in our Engliſh tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
it is rendred, <hi>inſtructed</hi> Or by Writing, in which reſpect
<hi>Solomon</hi> is called a Preacher,<note place="margin">1 Eccleſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</note> becauſe by his writings he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64508:4"/>
thoſe truths wherewith the Spirit inſpired him. Or by
reading; and ſo the Prophecy of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and the minde of the
Lord was made knowne to the Jewes by <hi>Barucks</hi> reading.<note place="margin">Ierem 36.</note> Yea
any other meanes by which the truth is made knowne, may in
a ſenſe be called Preaching: but I think they meane not this
generall kinde of Preaching; but by Preaching they meane
(as it is in a reſtricted ſenſe taken) An expounding of Scripture
by doctrinall deducing of inſtructions, and conſcientiall appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of them to the Hearers by way of dilating or enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Or more briefly: by Preaching they mean A ſpeaking
unto men for exhortation, edification, and comfort. I beleeve
they meane this,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 3.</note> by the word Preaching; for ſo their proofs
ſeeme to prove. And therefore I will propoſe againſt their phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
of the lawfulneſſe for any (of any calling being able) to
preach, five Propoſitions, as an Antidote: which when I have
diſcuſſed, I will punctually anſwer the paper.</p>
            <p>The Propoſitions conſiderable are theſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 Preaching or diſpenſing of the word is a peculiar calling
diſtinct from other callings.</item>
               <item>2 Not any of another calling ought to dispenſe the word (prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chingly)
till they are thereunto called.</item>
               <item>3 In the Call to preach, more things are required than endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to preach: without which things no man hath a Call to
that function.</item>
               <item>4 Men of other Profeſſions, though enabled with ſpirituall gifts,
yet are not to undertake preaching, till they are thereunto law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called.</item>
               <item>5 Such as take on them that calling, after lawfull Call there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
ought not to intangle themſelves in worldly emploiments,
and follow their wordly calling.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Of all theſe I will ſay ſomething; and then come to anſwer
the paper.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The firſt Propoſition.</head>
               <p>Preaching of the word (that is, an expounding or interpreting it,
thence drawing out Doctrines of inſtruction, and applying them
to ſeverall ſorts of Hearers gathered together to heare) is
a peculiar calling, diſtinct from other callings.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>A Calling is a certaine kinde of life,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Perkins</hi> in his Treatiſe of Callings.</note> ordained and impoſed
on man by God, for the common good. Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that God hath conſtituted, and appointed ſome men to
ſpend their dayes in <hi>finding out acceptable words,</hi>
               <note place="margin">12 Eccleſ. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>even the words
of truth;</hi> that they may the better publiſh the word of God,
<hi>and faſten it as Maſters of the aſſemblies,</hi> according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>given from one ſhepherd:</hi>
               <note place="margin">28 Mach, 19.</note> 
               <hi>Goe and teach all Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This truth is evident from two Scriptures, to name no more.</p>
            <p>The firſt place is, 10 <hi>Rom. 14. How ſhall they heare without
a Preacher? And how ſhall they preach, except they be ſent?</hi> The
Apoſtles gradation is remarkable: as faith muſt be before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;
and hearing of the word, before faith; and preaching,
before hearing what is preached: ſo divine Call or miſſion to
preach precedes preaching; intimating that none can ſavingly,
with a good conſcience, and with hope of ſucceſſe, preach, unleſſe
they be divinely ſent and appointed thereunto.</p>
            <p>The ſecond place is 4 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 11, 12. when Chriſt aſcended,
<hi>he gave ſome to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,
and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the
Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body
of Chriſt:</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhe wes what this work is, 26 <hi>Acts</hi> 18.
By this place in the Epheſians we ſee that the calling of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
is ordained,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 15. 3, 5, 6.</note> and the end of it is very profitable. In one
Scripture it is called a <hi>teaching Priesthood,</hi> without which the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64508:5"/>
people were miſerable:<note place="margin">29 Prov. 18.</note> in another it is called <hi>viſion,</hi> without
which the people periſh.<note place="margin">

            <p>I will ſhut up this Propoſition with an obſervation not to
be deſpiſed. In the 2 <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. God commands, that every tribe
of the Iſraelites ſhould be ranked into ſeverall orders, and that
they ſhould all keep to their own ſtanders. After this in <hi>Numb.</hi>
chapter 3. he commands that the Levites ſhould be appointed
to their office. Iſrael was now in the wilderneſſe, journeying to
<hi>Canaan,</hi> a type of the Church of Chriſt thorough many tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and afflictions travelling to heaven. In the campe of Iſrael
the ſeverall orders and ranks aſſigned, were to bee kept, and
none were to uſurpe the Prieſts office; and the Iſraelitiſh camp
was never ſo comely as when every one in it kept within order.
Even ſo it is with Chriſts people,<note place="margin">24 Numb. 5.</note> they are ranked into two
ſorts,<note place="margin">6 Gal. 6.</note> him that is taught, and him that teaches: And both ſorts
are to attend to the proper and peculiar ſervices,<note place="margin">12 Rom. 6, ſ, 3.</note> according to
the rank into which God hath put them. And none of Chriſts
people (unleſſe called) muſt uſurpe the ſacred and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
calling,<note place="margin">5 Heb. 4.</note> ordained for men, in things pertaining unto
God. And the Church of Chriſt never flouriſhes ſo ſtately
againſt her adverſaries, as when every one in it (as it were in
an Army) keeps him to his owne function; for then the Church
(as Chriſt deſcribes it) <hi>is terrible like an Army with banners.</hi>
               <note place="margin">9 Cant. 3.</note>
In one word, as there are ſeverall and diſtinct effices in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
ſo are there in the Church militant. One is a teacher, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is taught: and as the Lord ſaw it neceſſary for Iſrael in the
wilderneſſe, to have the Levites a diſtinct order among them;
even ſo hee ſees it is neceſſary for his people on earth to have
Preachers among them, a diſtinct calling from others: and
therefore he hath erected a miniſtry in his Church, by whoſe
fooliſhneſſe of preaching hee pleaſes to ſave them that beleeve.
All this makes it evident, that preaching of the word is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
calling diſtinct from other callings.</p>

Yea the Lord makes it a character of a falſe Teacher,
to teach,<note place="margin">Verſe 32.</note> being uncalled to that office. <hi>I ſent them not, nor
commanded them</hi> (ſaith God,) <hi>therefore they ſhall not profit
this people at all.</hi> And our bleſſed Saviour intimates no leſſe,
in bidding us <hi>beware of falſe Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 15.</note> 
               <hi>which come</hi> (ſaith he)

wolves.</hi> Theſe words are very remarkable, and deſcribe
ſuch as are falſe and dangerous Teachers by two decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherings.</p>
            <p>1. They are ſuch as Come unto you. The true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are ſent, but theſe come (to wit) of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
being unſent of God. The phraſe of comming to any,
when it is in the new Teſtament applied to forbidden Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
intimates both their preſumptuous raſhneſſe, and
ſacrilegious boldneſſe to teach, being not ſent thereunto.
And therefore our Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 8.</note> 
               <hi>All that have come before
mee, are theeves and robbers:</hi> all that have <hi>come;</hi> not all
that were <hi>ſent. Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were before Chriſt;
but theſe were ſent to the people of God: others there were
who (though unſent) would undertake to propheſie, and
teach, and theſe our bleſſed Saviour brands with the
name of Theeves; becauſe they uſurped anothers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
and with the name of robbers, that is, (as the word
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64508:6"/>
ſignifies) ſuch as make a prey of others. This is their firſt
deſcription.</p>
            <p>2 They <hi>come unto you</hi> (ſayes our Saviour) <hi>in ſheeps cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
In every thing outwardly they ſeeme ſheep: they
<hi>have a forme of godlineſſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5.</note> they pretend Scripture, and uſe
many <hi>goodwords;</hi>

               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 6.</note> they uſe ſmooth inſinuations, <hi>creeping into houſes;</hi>
they are full of <hi>flattering</hi> and <hi>enticing language:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet 2. 3.</note> Thus out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
they ſeeme ſheep. Yet their allurements to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
Chriſts flock from hearing Chriſts voice in the Paſtors
ſet over them, are an evident manifeſtation of them to bee
no other than ravenous wolves, though their pretences and
outward ſhewes ſeeme otherwiſe; for they are no other
but ſuch who intend to prey upon Chriſts flock, having
once divicted them, and withdrawne them from the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
tents: Therefore one Apoſtle tells us, That <hi>through
cove to rcuſneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>they with fained words will make merchandize
of us:</hi> And another exhorts, To <hi>mark ſuch, and avoid them;
for they are ſuch as ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17, 8.</note> 
               <hi>but their
owne belly; and by good words and faire ſpeeches, they deceive
the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> This is another deſcription of the
uſurpers of ſacred Preaching. The ſumme of this Reaſon is;
God and Chriſt deteſts, that any of other callings ſhould
undertake Preaching, uncalled thereunto: yea, and bids us
beware of ſuch; Therefore ſuch ought not to diſpenſe the
word Preachingly, or by way of Preaching.</p>
            <p>Second Reaſon is; Becauſe wee cannot read, either in
the Old or New Teſtament, of any Godly Preacher who
taught others, by Preaching, before hee was thereunto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
called. This is apparent from the enumeration of
particulars. 1. <hi>Enoch,</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> is ſaid to
have Propheſied,<note place="margin">Iude 14.</note> but not without Gods call thereunto; <hi>For
in old time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>holy men of God</hi> (Such an one was <hi>Enoch,</hi> who

God, Heb.</hi> 11. 5.) <hi>ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
2.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Noah</hi> is called <hi>a Preacher of righteouſneſſe,</hi> but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

commanded him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 12.</note> namely, hee built the Ark, and forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the world of Gods judgement; every ſtroke hee gave,
and every naile alſo which hee drave in the building, was a
reall Sermon of Repentance.<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 7.</note> 3. <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
but the Lord aſſigned him his work.<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 19.</note> 4. The Levites

               <hi>I was</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>no Prophet, nor the ſonne of a

Lord ſaid to mee, Goe propheſie unto my people Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Paſſe wee from the Old Teſtament to the New. 1. <hi>John

               <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 40.</note> 2. Our bleſſed Saviour himſelfe did not
preach without a call thereunto; Hee was <hi>ſent</hi> to doe ſo.
And this ſending Chriſt to preach, was fore-propheſied in
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 48. 16. &amp; <hi>Iſa. 61. 1. &amp;c.</hi> Which laſt Scripture, our
Saviour ſaies,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 18.</note> was <hi>then fulfilled,</hi> when he took up a book and
read, and expounded. 3. The Apoſtles were immediately
called to this work by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat 10. 40.</note> and ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>called to
bee an Apoſtle.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 1.</note> 4. The Apoſtles ſet Elders to teach the
Churches and Congregations which were obedient to the
faith,<note place="margin">Acts 14 23.</note> and ſo did S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi> And wee read of
the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note> whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts to <hi>take heed to
the flock over which the holy Ghoſt had made them overſeers.</hi>
And S. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts all <hi>Elders</hi> to the like:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2.</note> Theſe you ſee
had an Apoſtolicall call to preach the Goſpel. 5. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
appointed certaine to ordaine others to preach, that the
preaching of the Goſpel might continue (after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
in an order of men, thereunto lawfully ordained. And
as they themſelves were immediately called to preach, by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64508:7"/>
Chriſt; ſo likewiſe all ſuch, who, according to command
Apoſtolicall, are ordained, are called by Chriſt to preach,
but mediately; namely, by ſuch, who, under Chriſt, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to bee over certaine places to ordaine Preachers.
S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Titus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5.</note> that, <hi>For this cauſe hee left him in (reet,
that hee ſhould ſet in order the things that are wanting, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
Elders in every City, as hee had appointed him.</hi> And hee
commands <hi>Timothy,</hi> that, <hi>The things which hee had heard
of him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>among many witneſſes,</hi> the ſame <hi>hee ſhould commit to
faithfull men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo.</hi> Now theſe
faithfull men (to whom the Apoſtles committed the power
of Ordination) did ordaine others, and by this meanes the
order of Preachers is ſucceſſively to continue, till Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
comming. So then they (whom Chriſt calls to preach)
are ordained thereunto by men, whoſe Authority hath been
derived unto them from the Apoſtles; and the Authority
Apoſtolicall to ordaine ſuch, who ſhould have power to
ordain others, was from God; and accordingly, Chriſt
promiſes to bee <hi>with them alwayes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>to the end of the world:</hi>
namely, in bleſſing the Miniſtry, which, according to your
appointment from me, is ſettled in my Church. I will bee
with them (in the gifts and aſſiſtance of the Spirit) who
(by ordination Apoſtolicall) are ſent to teach all Nations,
and baptize them; while they teach them to obſerve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
I commanded you. The ſumme of this hiſtoricall
narration is this: Wee cannot read in the Old or New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
of any pious man (being of another calling) who
took on him to preach the word, till hee was called: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conclude, that it is an unlawfull act, without any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſident, as this ſecond Reaſon ſhewes; and likewiſe,
becauſe it is without any precept, as the firſt Reaſon ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
declared. The ſecond Propoſition is thereforetrue;
namely, <hi>Not any of another calling ought to diſpenſe the word
Preachingly, till they bee thereunto called.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. III.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The third Propoſition.</head>
               <p>In the call to Preach, more things are required than endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Preach, without which things no man hath a call
to that function. Or more briefly thus: More is required in
the call to Preach, than abilities thereunto.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe very relating of the ſundry requiſites to this calling
evidences the truth of this Propoſition: they are in all
three. 1. Divine Poſition into the Function. 2. Perſonall
Qualifications for the diſcharge of it. 3. Eccleſiaſticall
Authorization for its fulfillance. That all theſe are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
in the call to preach, wee may two wayes collect.</p>
            <p>1. The Church of Chriſt is conſiderable both as it is a
communion and ſociety of the faithfull, whoſe government
(ſo conſidered) is ſpirituall: it is ruled by the Spirit of
Chriſt; therefore it is requiſite, that whoſoever is ſet over
the flock of Chriſt, ſhould have his deſignation thereunto,
from Chriſt. Divine Poſition into this calling, is therefore
needfull. Hence our Miniſtry, among other reaſons, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>the Miniſtry of the Spirit;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 8.</note> becauſe, as it is in ſpirituall
things, ſo it is from the Spirit of Chriſt, working in the heart
of ſome, according to his ordinance, to undertake this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Againe, the Church of Chriſt is alſo conſiderable, as it
is an externall ſociety; and ſo (according to the large circuit.
of it) it hath ſeverall companies, which are to be governed
by the word of Chriſt, and by the ſword of thoſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
(Gods Vice. gerents) who rule over ſuch ſeverall
companies: Therefore, accordingly, ſuch perſonall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
(as the word hath appointed) are required to bee
in ſuch, who execute the Miniſtery in theſe ſeverall Chriſtan
ſocieties; and likewiſe publike authorizing them ſo to doe,
from ſuch who are appointed to bee over theſe ſocieties, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
requiſite.</p>
            <p>2. The neceſſity of the three forenamed Requiſites, is alſo
thus to be gathered. Chriſt is the King of the Church: hee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64508:8"/>
hath the Keyes, and therefore hee muſt open the doore of
gifts and abilities, and endue ſuch whom hee appoints to this
work. Againe, hee hath alſo committed the Keyes to his
Church; and therefore the power delegate under Chriſt, of
ſuch who are to ſee thereunto, is requiſite, that they may
open the door of entrance for ſuch who are truly qualified
to diſcharge this function.</p>
            <p>So that it is apparent, that abilities to preach is not all
that which is required in the entrance into this ſacred functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yet to make all this more evident, I will punctually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
theſe Requiſites ſeverally.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt Requiſite is Divine Poſition into this functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 12.</note>
This S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions in his Call; <hi>Hee counted me faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
putting mee into the Miniſtry.</hi> And this is requiſite in
every ones call to it; becauſe God is the Lord of the harveſt,
and muſt bee prayed unto, <hi>to thruſt out labourers into the
harveſt:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 9 3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The word ſignifies to caſt them out, as it were by
a ſtrong hand. So then, God muſt put them into this work,
and thruſt them into it. And this Divine Poſition into the
Miniſteriall calling is ſtyled in Scripture, The opening of the
door. Now God opens two doors to every one, whom hee
puts into the office of teaching.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5, 6.</note> Hee opens the door of gifts: <hi>Wee are not ſufficient of
our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency
is of God, who alſo hath made us able Miniſters of the New
Teſtament.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 21. 15.</note> This Ability, by our Saviour is called <hi>a mouth
of wiſedome:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloſ. 1. 3.</note> and by S. <hi>Paul, a door of utterance.</hi> By opening
the door of utterance we are to underſtand not only oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
to preach,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 9.</note> as it is ſometimes taken; but likewiſe abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and endowments to prech: an internall faculty fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for the Miniſtry. God firſt furniſhes the mind with
knowledge of divine things, hee firſt gives abilities to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
them, before one have opportunity; therefore hee is ſaid
<hi>to commit to us the Miniſtry of reconciliation:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 18.</note> hee firſt teaches
what wee ſhall ſay, before hee ſends us on his meſſage: Till
God hath opened the door of gifts, there is no ſending from
him on his Embaſſage</p>
            <p>2. Hee opens the door of the heart to deſire this office,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64508:8"/>
and to be willing to ſpend its gifts, and be ſent in it: every
one truly called by God to preach, hath a work of God on
his ſpirit, bending and framing it to addict it ſelfe to this
call.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 15.</note> Such a work had the houſe of <hi>Stephanas</hi> on them;
and ſuch a work was wrought on <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 7, 8.</note> his tongue was
touched, God gave him gifts, and then made him exceeding
willing to employ them;<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and ſuch a work was on S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
whereby <hi>ſo much as in him was, hee was ready to preach
the Gospel:</hi> and ſuch a work is wrought on all their hearts,
whom God ſirs up to feed his flock willingly. So that
when God hath bent the ſtrong delights of the mind on
ſuch kind of learning, which are moſt proper and conducent
to the Miniſtry; and when a man finds his gifts and parts
more ſutable to this than any other learned calling; and
when the deſire of his ſoul is to ſerve in the Church, then
doubtleſſe God hath called ſuch an one to preach; becauſe
hereunto hee hath opened his heart: which opening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
the deſires of the ſoul to enter into this calling, and
alſo the willingneſſe of the heart to embrace the worke
of it.</p>
            <p>They then are by God put into the Miniſtry, to whom
hee hath given both ability and an heart to teach. Many
have gifts, but no heart; theſe God doth not call; for hee
firſt gives <hi>the preparations of the heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro 16. 1.</note> Againe, many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
this calling, but want gifts: neither are they hereunto
called by God;<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4 6.</note> for hee <hi>rejects</hi> ſuch from teaching: But
ſuch are undoubtedly put into the Miniſtry by God, in
whom ability to teach, and a will to teach concurres. A
man who <hi>(as Elihu) is full of matter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 32. 18.</note> hath abilities, and
<hi>the ſpirit within him conſtraines him:</hi> whoſe ſpirit <hi>the Lord
hath ſtirred up,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hag. 1. 14.</note> as hee did the Temples Builders, hee ſurely is
a ſpirituall Builder, one who is called by God to preach.
This is the firſt Requiſite</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond Requiſite is Perſonall Qualifications: He
is not a Teacher ſent of God, who wants the eſſentiall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a Teacher. And theſe are two. 1. Abilities to teach;
2. Fidelity in that function: Both theſe the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in one verſe, <hi>The things which thou haſt heard alſo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64508:9"/>
among many witneſſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 2.</note>

Therefore hee is called <hi>an Interpreter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 33. 23.</note> Hee muſt be one (like
<hi>John)</hi> who <hi>hath taken Gods book,</hi>

which is inſtructed unto the Kingdome of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 52.</note> is like an houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder
which brings forth out of his treaſury things old and

            </p>
            <p>3. Ability ſeaſonably to apply the truth. Hee muſt have
<hi>the tongue of the Learned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 50. 4.</note> 
               <hi>that hee may know how to ſpeak a

               <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 42.</note>
knowing how <hi>to give a portion of meat in due ſeaſon</hi> to his
houſhold:<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 13, 14.</note> miniſtring milk to babes, and ſtrong meat to riper
Chriſtians:<note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 15, 16, 17,</note> He muſt have skill to <hi>feed Chriſts lambs,</hi> and
Chriſts ſheep. Hee muſt have</p>
            <p>4. Ability to refute and <hi>convince</hi> the adverſaries of ſacred
truth.<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 9.</note> Theſe abilities, at leaſt in ſome competency above
ordinary Chriſtians, are requiſite in a Teacher: All which
requires ſtore of learning, both humane and divine; that
the man of God may have dexterity both in diving into the
Scripture, and in refuting the adverſaries. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>They are very bold intruders into the calling of teaching
others, who both are unlearned themſelves, and likewiſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64508:9"/>
have given no <hi>attendance to reading;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13.</note> eſpecially to ſuch
kinds of learning which are ſubſervient to the Miniſtry,
and without which one of neceſſity can be but meanly
qualified for that calling, and will be very lame in the
diſcharge of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Fidelity is another eſſentiall quality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in a Teacher:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Let a man ſo account of us, as of the
Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the myſteries of God:
Moreover, it is required in Stewards that a man may be
found faithfull.</hi> A Teacher is a Diſpenſer of the pretious
blood of Chriſt, of the pretious promiſes of the Goſpel,
of the word of God, and of the unſearchable riches of
Chriſt; and therefore hee muſt faithfully diſpenſe theſe:
concealing no neceſſary truths:<note place="margin">Acts 20. 27.</note> being no way negligent,
but <hi>inſtant in ſeaſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 2, 5.</note> 
               <hi>and out of ſeaſon, to exhort, rebuke,
instruct, to doe the work of an Evangeliſt, and to make full
proofe of his Miniſtry.</hi> Theſe are the perſonall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
required in a Preacher: And this is the ſecond Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; The third Requiſite is Eccleſiaſticall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorization.
As God opens the door of gifts, and of the
heart, which is the inviſible opening of the door to the
<hi>good Shepherd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.</note> or his inviſible Call to the work: ſo for the
execution of it, hee muſt have a viſible Call by thoſe who
are delegated under Chriſt to ordain ſuch, who are to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the work of the Miniſtry. This viſible Call, I name
Eccleſiaſticall Authorization, which is not only a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
declaration, that ſuch and ſuch are choſen of God
to this work; but likewiſe it is a committing of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
of Chriſt to them. And this hath two parts,
which whoſoever wants, hee ought not to doe thoſe acts
on which the edification of Chriſts people publikely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
            <p>1. Ordination: Which is the conſecrating and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
apart for that work of the Miniſtry, with Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of hands and Prayer, ſuch who are deemed, upon
tryall of gifts and life, fit for it. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> ordained
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64508:10"/>
Elders,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5.</note> and left <hi>Titus in Crete</hi> to doe ſo: That Bleſſed
Apoſtle glories that hee was <hi>ſeparated</hi> to preach the
Goſpel:<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Separated,</hi> namely, as by God in his counſell
and decree,<note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l. 1. 15.</note> ſo alſo (according to Gods own appointment)
hee was hereunto <hi>ſeparated</hi> by the Church.<note place="margin">Acts 13. 2.</note> Hee then
who is called according to Gods own appointment, muſt
bee ſeparated or ſet apart by the Church Governours
(I mean Biſhops) to give himſelfe wholy to teach. Which
ſeparation being done ſolemnely,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 22.</note> by Prayer, and <hi>Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 14.</note> is called Ordination.</p>
            <p>2. Derivation of actuall power to fulfill the Miniſtry,
is the other branch of Eccleſiaſticall Authorization:
and this is after the tryall of gifts and life. <hi>Let theſe alſo</hi>
(ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>firſt be proved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and then let them mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
being found blameleſſe:</hi> The words import, that both
Miniſters and Deacons muſt be proved; and being found
fit, then they ſhould be permitted to execute their office.
This admiſſion to execute their office,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2. 4.</note> is called <hi>Gods allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them to preach. This is the third Requiſite, Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
Authorization, which conſiſts in the ordaining
and allowing, by the Churches Overſeers, ſuch, who ſhall
teach: and without this, notwithſtanding there be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency
of gifts for that work, yet none can have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Call to preach.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore this Propoſition: Since to the
entrance into the Miniſteriall Calling there is required
both Gods putting one into it, and Authorities ordaining
and ſetting one apart thereunto, together with its deriving
actuall power, to ſuch who undertake it, to fulfill it, as
well as perſonall gifts for its diſcharge; Therefore I take
this third Propoſition is undeniably true; namely, <hi>In the
Call to preach, more things are required than endowments to
preach, without which things no man hath a Call to that
Function.</hi>

               <p>Men of other Profeſſions, though enabled with ſpirituall

            </argument>
            <p>THough the Arguments proving the ſecond Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will alſo ſufficiently confirm this; yet theſe two
ſhall likewiſe ſerve to evince it.</p>
            <p>Firſt Reaſon: Becauſe every man is bound to abide
in his own Calling. This is proved from two Scriptures:
One is this;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Let every man abide in the ſame calling
wherein hee was called.</hi> Theſe words are very emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
1. Exempting none (though proving afterward
well qualified and endued with gifts and graces) from
their perſonall Calling. 2. Enjoyning to every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in their particualr Function; Let him <hi>abide,</hi> or
make his Manſion in it,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> even dwell on it. 3. Intimating
that the ſtate of Chriſtianity frees none from the Calling
in which God hath ſet them. And there is good Reaſon
for it; Becauſe Chriſtianity as it is a Profeſſion of true
Autarchy, or ſelf-contentedneſſe with ones own ſtation
or condition; ſo likewiſe it is a Religion abhorring all
Ataxy, or diſorderly enormities; and particularly, the
confounding (in one perſon by preſumptuous uſurpation)
ſuch Callings which God hath disjoyned. Another
Scripture proving that every one ought to abide in their
own Calling, is this, <hi>Study to be quiet, and to doe your own
buſineſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and to work with your own hands, as wee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you.</hi> Which words, 1. Commend a calm converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
oppoſite to tumultuous turbulency and reſtleſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling
with things which concern us not; <hi>Study to
be quiet.</hi> 2. They confine our employments within the
limits of our own Calling; <hi>doe your own buſineſſe,</hi> or thoſe
things which are perſonally and properly yours. 3. They
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64508:11"/>
command Mechanicks, or manuall Crafts men to work
with their own hands: Whereupon it will follow, that
therefore they ought not (uncalled) to undertake Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſeeing they are not freed from their manuall works,
from which every Diſpenſer of ſpirituall things is freed;
that hee might <hi>ſow ſpirituals;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 11.</note> and for his maintenance
hee is to <hi>reap the carnall things</hi> of others. Seeing then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is bound to abide in his own calling, therefore
ſuch who are of other Profeſſions, though they be enabled
with ſpirituall gifts, yet are not (being uncalled thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
to undertake Preaching.</p>
            <p>Second Reaſon is, Becauſe Holy Writ affords no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
of any who did ſo, but rather the contrary: For
as wee cannot read of any holy man undertaking (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Call thereunto) the office of Preaching, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Reaſon of the ſecond Propoſition proved; ſo wee
may read of ſuch, whoſe gifts being very ſutable to that
Function, yet without Call would not undertake it, nor
leave their Callings. Two examples ſhall ſerve in ſtead
of many.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>David,</hi> though a man after Gods own heart,
and one who had <hi>more under ſtanding than all his teachers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>19. 99.</note>
yet forſook not either his Calling of feeding ſheep,<note place="margin">Pſal 78. 70, 71, 72.</note> or of
governing the people, to become a Preacher: And though
hee was a Prophet, and extraordinarily inſpired and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to preach, yet wee read not that hee did ſo in any
Synagogue or Aſſembly; but ſtill hee abode in his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and taught publikely no otherwiſe (if my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
fail not) than by his writings: in which, though
dead, hee yet ſpeaks, and preaches to the Churches, as oft
as any thing of <hi>Davids</hi> is read in them. The other example
is our bleſſed Saviour, who was (it ſeems) in Profeſſion
<hi>a Carpenter;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 6. 3.</note> and though hee had gifts beyond Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and humane conception,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1. 19.</note> 
               <hi>all fulneſſe dwelt in him;</hi> yet
till about <hi>thirty years of age</hi> hee did not (ſo farre as wee
read) preach or leave his Calling.<note place="margin">Luke 3. 23.</note> And when hee began
to preach hee was thereunto firſt called, as in the ſecond
Reaſon of the ſecond Propoſition hath formerly been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64508:11"/>
So then, both from precept and example, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the fourth Propoſition is an unſhaken verity:
namely, <hi>Men of other Profeſſions, though enabled with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
gifts, yet are not to undertake preaching, till they are
thereunto lawfully called.</hi>

               <p>Such as take on them that Calling, after lawfull call there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
ought not to entangle themſelves in worldly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and follow their worldly Calling.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Reaſon of this is; Becauſe ſuch are wholly to
intend the work of this Calling which they have
undertaken. The Apoſtles, though ſome of them had
been Fiſhers, and ſome of other Profeſſions, yet affirm
joyntly, that they <hi>would give themſelves continually to
prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and to the Ministry of the word:</hi> neither would
they meddle with a buſineſſe which in its own nature
might well have ſtood with their Miniſteriall Function;
becauſe of ſome inconveniences in it:<note place="margin">Verſe 2.</note> 
               <hi>It is no reaſon</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>that wee ſhould leave the word of God and ſerve tables.</hi>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him all Miniſters,
wholly to inure themſelves to the paines, and whatſoever
other hardſhip accompanies or followes their Miniſtry,
and not be buſie in ſecular negotiations. Hee takes a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
from a Souldier, who having undertaken military
ſervice, doth wholly addict himſelfe to his Commanders
ſervice: even ſo ſuch who undertake Chriſts ſervice muſt
ſeek to pleaſe Chriſt, by doing his work; and therefore
muſt not frame themſelves to thoſe employments in which
they were enwrapt before Chriſt choſe them to his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſervice.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 3, 4.</note> The words are very plain; <hi>Thou therefore
endure hardneſſe, as a good ſouldier of Chriſt:</hi> And again,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64508:12"/>
               <hi>No man that warreth entangleth himſelfe with the affairs
of this life, that hee may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to
be a ſouldier.</hi> And there is good reaſon why Miniſters
ſhould wholly intend the Miniſteriall employment and
no other; both becauſe other employments make them
unfit to diſcharge this freely and fully. He who enters
into this Calling and will ſecularly be employed, is unfit
for this Calling, even as hee who <hi>layes his hand on the
Plough,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                  </gap>. 9. 52.</note> 
               <hi>and looks back, is unfit for the kingdome of God:</hi>
and likewiſe, becauſe any one work which is enjoyned
the Miniſtry, is ſufficient alone to take up the whole man,
and his whole time. As to name but that one mentioned
by S <hi>Paul;</hi> hee is to give <hi>attendance to reading and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
and to give himſelf <hi>wholly</hi> to theſe,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13, 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>that his profiting
may appear unto all.</hi> Now this is work enough for a
man: yea it is ſet out in Scripture, to bee a toylſome and
tireſome work; <hi>much ſtudy is a wearineſſe to the fleſh.</hi>
God compares it to the work of Husbandmen,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 12.</note> who are
in continuall employment, either breaking up the fallow,
or ſowing, or harrowing, or manuring, or reaping, or
gathering into barnes, and then renewing again their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
And hee compares the ſervice of the Miniſtry to
Fiſhing: a trade in which is no loitering but labouring;
not meanly but toughly,<note place="margin">Mar. 4. 19.</note> ſometimes <hi>all day,</hi> oft <hi>all night,</hi>
and many times for <hi>nothing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 5. 5.</note> Such, yea greater is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
work, it is a conſtant continuall labour: he prayes he
reads, hee marks, hee meditates, hee writes, hee utters the
meditation of his heart; and when hee hath done, hee
muſt return to his daily task, and weekly ſpending, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every moment employed, ſave at the times of due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion,
till hee hath fully finiſhed his courſe, and
the time of departure approaches. Preaching is a toylfull
work, and greater than to ſpeak by an hour-glaſſe. Again,
it is ſet out in Scripture to bee an enfeebling work: So the
Prophet found it,<note place="margin">Iſa. 49. 4.</note> 
               <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſpent my ſtrength
for nought, and in vain.</hi> And ſo our bleſſed Saviour found
it, who in the prime of his years, little paſt thirty, was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64508:12"/>
reckoned by the Jewes to be towards <hi>fifty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 57.</note> It is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by Divines, and probably too, that hee ſo ſpent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in preaching, and winning ſoules, that hee ſeemed
to the Jewes to bee much elder than hee was. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall
work well followed makes one weak in ſtrength,
and old in youth: it conſumes the lungs, waſts the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
both animall and naturall, parches the radicall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
draines the blood, looſes the joynts, rivells the
face, and wears the brain. They who ſpeak other mens
labours,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> (and ſuch it ſeemes there were in the Apoſtles
times) count Preaching nothing, becauſe they know
not experimentally what it means;<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> but ſuch who <hi>labour
in the word and doctrine</hi> (as the Apoſtle did) will with
him acknowledge,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 15.</note> that in Preaching they <hi>ſpend and are
ſpent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 17.</note> and that they ſacrifice themſelves for their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Lay all this together: and ſeeing the Miniſteriall Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
hath in it employment for the whole man, and for
his whole time; and ſeeing other Callings will diſtract
in fulfilling the Miniſtery, therefore it muſt be granted,
That they who undertake this Calling, ought not (ſave
in the caſes mentioned in the Anſwers) to divert from the
employments of this Calling,<note place="margin">CHAP. 7.</note> being buſie in worldly

be very true: namely, <hi>Such who take on them that Calling;

            <p>I anſwer to all This. Though the diſtinction of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
gotten, and learning given; or (as Scholars ſpeak)
touching learning obtained by ſtudy, pains, induſtry, and
inveſtigation either at Univerſity, or any other place;
and learning conferred by inſpiration, or by any other
immediate way of divine donation may be admitted; yet
the inference thereupon (that any of any Calling what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
having given learning may preach) is unſound:
Becauſe, the very having of learning, either acquiredly
or inſpiredly, is not ſufficient to authorize preaching with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſpeciall Call. Which as I have proved, ſo this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
in the ſecond of <hi>Acts</hi> confirms: for they of whom
it ſpeaks had abilities to preach, they had been with
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 22.</note> and hee had <hi>breathed on them the holy Ghost;</hi> yet
would they not preach till they had a ſpeciall Call, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64508:13"/>
were authorized thereunto <hi>by power from on high,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 49.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Chriſts command. The pouring out of the Spirit
on them (as the Hiſtory relates) was a ſpeciall and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
declaration of their Call, that God had choſen them
to teach the whole councell of God, to plant the Goſpel
in all Nations; and therefore God accordingly endued
them, extraordinarily, with all languages, and all infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
ſacred knowledge.</p>
            <p>Such then, who propoſe theſe as a preſident for Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachers,
ſhould doe well to conſider theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>1 That inſpiration Apoſtolicall ſerved only for the
planting of the Goſpel: ſince, God inſpires ſo none; and
therefore the pretence of having learning given, not
gotten, is a boaſt <hi>of things without their meaſure;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 12, 13</note> and a
vaunt of the diſtribution of gifts on them, which God
never granted to any but to the firſt Planters of his
Church.</p>
            <p>2 That they ſhould conſider, That though any were
endued with abilities Apoſtolicall (which I ſuppoſe none
will arrogate to themſelves, but ſuch who have no other
knowledge than that which puffs up;) yet ſuch ought not
to aſſume the divine Function, untill hee have alſo (with
theſe here) the Apoſtolicall Call. If hee ſhould without
that Call doe ſo, hee were but an intruder, and a falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.
And therefore. Though <hi>Thou</hi> be able to teach thy
Brother, and thy Brother <hi>Thee;</hi> yet neither of you ought
Miniſterially to doe ſo, till thereunto you have (as theſe
Apoſtles) a ſpeciall Call. So then this Hiſtory gives no
countenance to any, though gifted, to undertake Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
uncalled.</p>
            <p>3 They ſhould ponder, That theſe Apoſtolike men did
nothing in a corner. They had no private undertakings;
for the whole multitude came together, ſaw and heard;
therefore ſuch who reſolve on a private, cloſe courſe of
Preaching in ſecret, cannot juſtifie themſelves by theſe
Apoſtles here. Neither yet follow they our Saviours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64508:14"/>
who ſpake <hi>openly to the world,</hi> and <hi>ever taught in
the Synagogue, and in the Temple, whither the Jewes alwayes
reſort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 20.</note> 
               <hi>and in ſecret ſaid nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 They ſhould conſider, That theſe Apoſtolicall men,
having (by this extraordinary pouring out of the Spirit
on them) their complete Commiſſion to preach, gave
themſelves wholly <hi>to Prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and to the Miniſtry of the
word:</hi> And therefore, hence cannot be raiſed a juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for any Lay-men (continuing ſo) to preach the
word. The Hiſtory affords theſe irrefutable collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Butthe Objectors inference no wayes reſults out of the
quoted words; namely, That any of any Calling who
hath gifts may preach. My reaſon is; Becauſe they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the gifts of the Spirit poured on ſome, whom God
prohibits to preach, as on women: <hi>Your daughters and
my handmaids</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>ſhall propheſie;</hi> and yet
God permits not ſuch <hi>to teach.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim 2. 12.</note> Therefore for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this place from the abſurd collection,<note place="margin">1. Cor 14. 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 35.</note> wee muſt
explaine theſe words, <hi>And they ſhall propheſie.</hi> Know
then:</p>
            <p>Theſe were <hi>Joels</hi> words; but are here alledged by
S. <hi>Peter</hi> to ſatisfie the multitude, who were confounded,
ſeeing the cloven tongues like fire ſitting on the Diſciples
heads, and hearing them ſpeak in their own tongues, the
wonderfull works of God: Hee tells them, that now <hi>Joels</hi>
Propheſie is fulfilled; namely, <hi>I will poure out &amp;c.</hi> After
hee tells them, that, Jeſus Chriſt being exalted to Gods
right hand, hath ſhed forth this which they now ſaw and
heard: which they ſaw in the tongues, and their ſpeaking
of Gods wonderfull works. This is the briefe relation
of the Story, which makes much for the underſtanding of
the quoted Scripture: Wherein we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>1. That in the day of Pentecoſt God poured out of
his Spirit in great meaſure both on men and women, who
were with one accord in one place.</p>
            <p>2. That theſe were thereby enabled to prophefie. And</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:64508:14"/>
3. Their propheſying was, no more but, both a cleare
underſtanding of former Propheſies, as appears by S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
applying this and two more, and alſo a praiſing Gods,
as his and the others ſpeaking of Gods wonderfull works
ſhewes,</p>
            <p>So then theſe words <hi>(Your ſons and your daughters ſhall
propheſie;</hi> and again, <hi>My ſervants and my handmaids ſhall
propheſie;)</hi> imply only thus much: Theſe your ſons and
your daughters which are my ſervants and my hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids,
ſhall have of my Spirit beſtowed on them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they ſhall underſtand the former Propheſies, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kingdome of God, and the Myſtery of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>Which in other ages was not made known unto the ſons
of men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 5.</note> 
               <hi>as it is now revealed unto his holy Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
by the Spirit.</hi> I take this Paraphraſe is the genuine
meaning both of <hi>Joel</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and beſt ſhewes how
both the ſons and daughters of God are ſaid to propheſie
in the laſt dayes. It would be therefore ſhewed plainly,
and without wreſting the words, how the conceit (that
any of any Calling, having gifts, may preach) can bee
grounded on them. The words ſpeak of ſuch a kind of
propheſying, wherein both men and women may have a
part; and that is no other than either a clear underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods myſteries, formerly vailed in dark Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
but now explained and known ſince the Spirits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent,
according to theſe Propheſies of the Goſpels time,
<hi>Iſai. 11. 9 Jerem. 31. 34. Joh.</hi> 6. 45. or elſe it is a laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and praiſing of God for his wonderfull works. One
of theſe, or rather both, is the propheſying meant in this
place: and ſo both ſons and daughters may propheſie. But
that kind of propheſying which conſiſts in interpreting
Scripture, thence deducing Doctrinall and Practicall
Concluſions for the inſtruction of others, (I am ſure)
cannot bee meant in this place; becauſe in that kind of
propheſying the daughters of God have no part nor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
with the ſons of God; for God hath excluded
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64508:15"/>
them, as hath been ſhewed. Let this ſuffice for anſwer to
the quotation in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 17. 18.</p>

               <p>TO that which is added, That Trade ſmen may preach,
becauſe the Apoſtle did labour with his hands, and
yet a Teacher; and many others beſides. 2 Theſ. 3. 8.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I anſwer. 1. It followes not, becauſe the Apoſtle or
any other, having a Call to teach, did in ſome caſes labour
with their hands, therefore that ſuch who are Tradeſmen,
having no calling thereunto, ſhould preach, I think this
conſequence cannot poſſibly be made good.</p>
            <p>2 I anſwer. All which can be collected, for imitation,
from the Apoſtles labouring with his hands is, That a
Miniſter, in ſome caſes, (there being thereby no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his preaching, or other Miniſteriall duties) may
voluntarily uſe any lawfull Art or Calling, manuall or
mentall, to ſupply his neceſſities.</p>
            <p>The cauſes why S. <hi>Paul</hi> laboured with his hands, are
recorded in Scripture to be theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Hee would not be burdenſome. The penury of
the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> was ſuch (they being poor Artificers)
that they could not conveniently contribute towards
S. <hi>Pauls</hi> reliefe: Beſides, that little which they had was
liable to be preyed upon by their Perſecuters; therefore
the Apoſtle, in compaſſion, remitted his right, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than hee would burthen them hee wrought with his
hands.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note>
And for this cauſe the Miniſters of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>
did work to ſuſtaine themſelves;<note place="margin">So they profeſſe in their anſwer Ad l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the exacting of due maintenance (which yet they might
have took) was burthenſome to the Church, being for
their poverty termed <hi>the poor men of Lions:</hi> which men
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64508:15"/>
yet profeſſed, that they were ſorry that they had not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ſtaied livings for their Miniſters, whereby they
might have more time to their ſtudies, and greater oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to inſtruct them with neceſſary doctrine and
knowledge.</p>
            <p>Secondly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrought with his hands, becauſe
hee would avoyd appearing ſcandall. 1. In reſpect of
ſome <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who, being covetous, would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
the faith, if they had found it any way chargeable:
being like the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> who would rather part with the
Miniſtry of Chriſt, than forgoe their Swine. Leſt the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhould hereupon reject the Goſpel, S. <hi>Paul</hi>
forbears his right, and ſo farre a baſed himſelfe, to work
with his own hands.<note place="margin">Ambroſ. in 1 Cor. 9. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma vult eſte cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris, ut ubi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent non expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

not to uſe their lawfull liberties, unleſſe wherein they ſee
an expediency. 2. In reſpect of falſe Apoſtles among the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> to ſtop their mouth. They, likely, would
have accuſed him for making advantage of the Goſpel,
and would, perhaps, have reported that hee only taught
for gain; therefore the Apoſtle to cut off all occaſions of
ſuch thoughts from them, would not challenge any thing
from the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 12.</note> but wrought with his hands. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
in like caſe and condition, a Miniſter may take on
him another Calling, what hee likes; ſo it bee not an
hinderance of his preaching, nor any offenſe of men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrought with his hands, to gain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
authority and credence to his Doctrine touching la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
hee had taught, at <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of working; therefore to ſhame them from their loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and idleing, hee ſo farre abaſed himſelfe below his
Apoſtolicall function,<note place="margin">Acts 18. 3.</note> as to worke in Tent-making. Hee
tells the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that hee <hi>did not eat any mans bread
for nought,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſ. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>but wrought with labour and travell night and
day, that hee might not be chargeable to any of them. Not
becauſe hee had not power, but to make himſelfe an enſample</hi>
for them <hi>to follow</hi> him.<note place="margin">Acts 20. 34.</note> And hee tells the <hi>Epheſians, You
your ſelves know, that theſe hands have miniſtred unto my
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64508:16"/>
neceſſities, and to them that werewith me.</hi> And again, <hi>I
have ſhewed you all things, sic how that ſo labouring, yee ought
to ſupport the weak, and to remember the words of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, how hee ſaid, It is more bleſſed to give than to
receive.</hi> And queſtionleſſe it is lawfull for a Miniſter (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of excellent parts and abilities, abundantly ſufficient
to diſcharge his Calling) for the provocation of others
to double diligence in their Callings, to undertake (if hee
pleaſe) either ſuch a Calling which is ſubſervient, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately
conducent to his Theologicall Profeſſion; as
teaching,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19. 20.</note> or tutoring of Youth; for ſo <hi>Samuel,</hi> a Prophet,
had a ſchool of young Prophets at <hi>Ramah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 4. 38.</note> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> at
<hi>Gilgal:</hi> or hee may employ himſelfe in any manuall
work; yet ſtill remembring the caution, That it hinder
not his paſtorall function, nor be any offenſe to others.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> did labour with his hands, becauſe
the prophane <hi>Corinthians</hi> forced him partly to it: they
would not give him needfull reliefe, though hee might
(if hee had pleaſed) juſtly have commanded it. <hi>Even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then hee concludes, <hi>I write
not theſe things to ſhame you, but as my beloved ſonnes I
warne you.</hi> It ſeems hee had but hard entertainment, and
therefore was forced to relieve himſelfe by his labours,
till the Brethren of <hi>Macedonia</hi> ſupplyed what was lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto him.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 9.</note> A Miniſter may be driven to great exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and though hee have power and authority to claime
maintenance, yet from a way ward people hee cannot (it
may be) have it: They will diſobey Gods command in

caſe a Miniſter may undertake Callings lawfull, though

godly, yet after much paines in his publike Miniſtry, was
ſo ill uſed, that hee was glad to get into a Weavers houſe,

his family: at laſt, the Weaver thruſt him out of his
houſe, and then was worthy <hi>Muſculus</hi> forced to goe to
the common ditch of the town, and work with his ſpade
to get his living. This may well be recorded, that poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
may ſhunne ſuch <hi>Corinthian</hi> humours, as to ſuffer
their <hi>Pauls</hi> to be miſerably needy,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 14.</note> and not relieve them;
but force them rather to manuall labours. Theſe were the
cauſes of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> working with his hands, which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
warranteth Miniſters, in like caſes, to doe the
like; but no wayes juſtifies any Tradeſmen to uſurp
teaching.</p>
            <p>Thus did S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and thus did <hi>Barnabas,</hi> both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters;

               <hi>Hitherto
alſo they belong, who conſcious to themſelves of their great
learning may dreame of ſome great danger to themſelves, if
they inſtruct not others; alledging that they hide in the
earth the talent given them, and doe expect with the evill
ſervant the heavie doom of the Lord; Satan doth ſo delude
their fancies with ridiculous trifles. Who, by this verſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
ought to know, that it is not wee who teach, neither
is it our word which is taught, but onely our mouth may doe
ſervice unto his word if hee will, and call. Thou (hee ſaith)
haſt perfected praiſe: not they, not we. And ſo in the Goſpel,
the Lord truly delivered talents to his ſervants, but they
were firſt called: therefore doe thou alſo expect till thou be
called. In the mean time, thou maiſt not deſire it, thou maiſt
not voluntarily preſſe into it, thy knowledge will not burst
thee. They ran (ſaith the Lord in the Prophet) but I ſpake
not by them. This temptation miſerably vexes many, that
it grieves and repents them of their vocation. The Devill
doth this to diſquiet them who have begus well, and at
length conſume them with irkeſomneſſe. Therefore hee who
is called, let him offer his mouth, receive his word; let him
be an Inſtrument, not the Author. Hee who is not called,
let him pray to the Lord of the harveſt, that hee may ſend
Labourers, and perfect ſtrength one of the mouth of infants.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>THe Objectors ſay, that this is the way which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed:
And they alledge ſundry Scriptures for
proofe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their firſt allegation is in</hi> Joel 2. 28. <hi>The words are,</hi>
I will poure out of my Spirit on all fleſh, and your ſons and
your daughters ſhall propheſie, &amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Theſe words of <hi>Joel</hi> preſcribe nothing; they
only declare what God will doe in the laſt times: <hi>Hee
will</hi> (ſay they) <hi>poure out of his Spirit on all fleſh, and your
ſonnes and your daughters ſhall propheſie.</hi> That is, They
ſhall apply the ancient propheſies, ſeeing plainly that
they are teſtimonies of Jeſus Chriſt and his Kingdome;<note place="margin">Revel. 19. 10.</note>
and they ſhall ſpeak of Gods marvellous works. This
God ſhall doe ſaith <hi>Joel,</hi> and this they did, ſaith the ſtory,
in the ſecond of <hi>Acts;</hi> and this is the propheſie which
theſe words ſpeak of: but I think it paſſeth the skill of an
underſtanding and judicious Divine, to eſpy in them an
injunction that Lay-men ſhould preach Miniſterially.
Till I ſee proofes, naturally concluding, that there is in
theſe words ſuch a preſcription, I ſhall repute the aſſertion
of it to be but a groundleſſe fancy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond Proofe is in</hi> Iſaiah 44. 2. <hi>The words are
theſe,</hi> I will poure water upon him that is thirſty, and
floods upon the dry ground: I will poure my Spirit upon thy
ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine of ſpring.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Theſe words preſcribe nothing; they only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
an effuſion of the word of Grace, and the comforts
of Grace, and of the Spirit of Grace, and bleſſing upon
the Churches children, both Jew and Gentile. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it is a very hard task for the Objectors to prove,
that they preſcribe Lay-men, uncalled, to teach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64508:19"/>
though the Lord bee pleaſed upon the Gentiles (who
were as a thirſty and dry ground) to poure out his water,
that is, make them partakers of the word of Grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the compariſon by <hi>Moſes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 2.</note> and of the floods,
that is, of the comforts of Grace, theſe <hi>living ſprings,</hi> as
our Saviour calls them;<note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 39.</note> yet it is ridiculous to ſay, That
therefore Lay-men, uncalled, may propheſie: and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequentiall
it is, to ſay, That becauſe God will poure
his Spirit on the ſeed of the Church, and his bleſſing on
her of-ſpring, therefore Lay-men may preach. Though
God poure his Spirit on the ſeed, yet the ſeed is not bound
to poure out; but muſt ſtay till God have ſent, and given
a commiſſion to goe and <hi>drop the word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 21. 2.</note> as hee did to the
Prophet. Beſides, the very next Verſe in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44. ſhewes,
That the pouring of water, and floods, and the Spirit on
the ſeed, is not a pouring that the ſeed ſhould poure, but
that the ſeed ſhould grow and encreaſe: namely, in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in the exerciſe of the ſeverall graces of the Spirit,
This place therefore proves not the Objectors fancy.</p>
            <p>Another Proofe they produce out of 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 29. Let the
Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judge.</hi> And
verſe 31. <hi>Yee may all propheſie one by one, that all may
learn, and all may be comforted.</hi> And the Reaſon is given,
Verſe 33. <hi>For God is not the Author of confuſion, but of
peace.</hi> Which doth prove, as they underſtand, That
when men can propheſie and doe not, it cauſeth confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and not peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This allegation proves not, that Lay-men may
preach. Here, indeed, the Prophets are commanded to
diſpenſe the word orderly; but ſuch who are no Prophets
have hence no command for its diſpenſation. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
would have but two or three of the Prophets to ſpeak
in their meetings or Congregations. A courſe much like
to that in the Synagogues, wherein one read <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
another (as it is thought) read in the Prophets;<note place="margin">Acts 13. 15.</note> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64508:19"/>
when theſe had done, another expounded and ſpake a
word of exhortation. This courſe the Apoſtle enjoynes,
and ſhewes in the 31. verſe the conveniency of it; Becauſe
hereby <hi>yee may</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>all propheſie.</hi> Hee meanes not
all the promiſcuous company of the godly, for hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
it an abſurdity to think all are Prophets; but hee
meanes,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9.</note> all who are Prophets may propheſie. And from
the twelfth Chapter wee may gather, that three things
muſt concurre in the propheſying of which hee ſpeaks in
this place. 1. The operation, that is, the act of propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
2. The adminiſtration, that is, the office or calling
to propheſie. 3. The gift, or the enablement; ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
meaning here is, <hi>All,</hi> that is, All who have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the gift, but likewiſe the calling from thoſe Prophets,
to whom the ſpirit of the Prophets are ſubject, may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
themſelves in propheſying by courſe, or in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
turnes. And hee gives the reaſon of this courſe which
hee preſcribes; becauſe it is of Divine inſtitution from
God, for two ends: both that there may be no confuſion
in their meetings; and likewiſe, that peace may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in them. And he further tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that,
This courſe is obſerved in all the Churches of the Saints.
this then is that which the Apoſtle preſcribes, That the
Prophets ſhould exerciſe their gift of propheſying order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but here hee enjoynes no Lay-men to become Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
or Preachers.</p>
            <p>I therefore exceedingly wonder, how the Objectors
can affirm, and underſtand, that theſe words prove, That
when men can propheſie and doe not, it cauſeth confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and not peace! That which may be proved from them
is, That men in their owne Callings, and particularly,
Preachers in theirs, doing all thins orderly, ſhall avoyd
confuſion, and obtain peace in ſo doing. But it is an idle
conceit, That theſe words teach, that men able to preach,
and actually not doing ſo, cauſe confuſion. Did our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviour (being able, never any abler to preach, yet
not doing ſo for thirty years,) cauſe any confuſion in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64508:20"/>
Jewiſh Church all that time? I think the Objectors dare
not utter ſo blaſphemous an affirmation. Even ſo Gods
people, though able to preach, yet cauſe no confuſion,
though they are not Actors in ſo holy an employment.
Confuſion would then be cauſed, if what the Objectors
plead for, were admitted; becauſe an everſion of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of Callings muſt needs ſucceed; for the ſacred
would hereby be blended with others, and every one (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his owne ſelfe-conceiteidneſſe of parts and abilities)
might appoint himſelfe a Teacher: Which any may
diſcern is near to confuſion, who have read both that
God hath appointed Stewards over his houſhold, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Leaders over his flock, Labourers in his harveſt,
divers Adminiſtrations, as well for the preſervation of
peace in the Church, as for the edification of it; and
likewiſe, That none takes this honour on him, but ſuch
who are thereunto called. This quotation therefore will
nothing advantage the Objectors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next place alledged, is,</hi> Numb. 11. 29. Would God
all could propheſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This Scripture doth not prove that Lay-men
may preach.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the propheſying here mentioned, is not a
Salvificall teaching others, but a Politicall diſcourſing
unto others: it is an uttering wiſe and grave Apothegmes
or Councells, (as <hi>Moſes</hi> did) concerning the publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Iſrael. The Spirit of propheſie, put on the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
was,<note place="margin">Numb. 11. 17.</note> that they with <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould beare the burthen
of the people, that is, rule them: and their propheſying,
therefore, was no more but a prudentiall ſpeaking of
things appertaining to rule. <hi>Moſes</hi> his wiſh therefore is
not, That all were able to preach, but that <hi>all</hi> were able
to rule; and ſo proves nothing for the Objectors.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Moſes</hi> his wiſh is, That <hi>all could propheſie,</hi> that is,
That they were called to propheſie, and enabled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64508:20"/>
as theſe Seventy in the hiſtory were called, in that
their names were writ to enter into the Tabernacle, <hi>v.</hi> 26.
and they were enabled from God, hee put his Spirit on
them; therefore this wiſh doth not juſtifie the intruſion
of any into anothers Office, who is either uncalled, or
ungifted. So that <hi>Moſes</hi> his wiſh that all were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
yet imports alſo, That till they are Prophets,
as well by Calling as enablement, they muſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not abſolutely wiſh, that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
could propheſie; but hereby hee only intimates, that
it would be no impeachment to him and his Authority,
though all the Camp (if God thought fit) could prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
that is, be able to governe. His words are an anſwer
to <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> jealouſie, leſt the propheſying of <hi>Eldad</hi> and
<hi>Medad,</hi> in the Camp, ſhould derogate from <hi>Moſes</hi> his
Authority; <hi>Moſes</hi> tells him, that for his ſake hee would
have none prohibited from propheſying; that is, from
ruling; but hee wiſhes that all the people were fellowshelpers,
and able Aſſiſtants to him in governing. This is
the very true meaning of his wiſh. Which teacheth pious
men, not to envy at the gifts and calling of others in the
ſame Vocation with themſelves; but it no way preſcribes
men of other Callings, to undertake, without call there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
the Office and Function of others. Therefore from
hence, Lay-men can have no warrant for their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
to preach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another place alledged, is</hi> Acts 8. 1. At that time
there was a great perſecution againſt the Church, that
was at Hieruſalem, and they were all ſcattered abroad
thorowout the regions of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> except
the Apoſtles. <hi>Compared (ſay the Objectors) with</hi>
verſe 3. <hi>and</hi> 4. As for <hi>Saul</hi> hee made havock of
the Church, entring into every houſe, and haling men
and women, committed them to priſor. Therefore they
that were ſcattered abroad, went every where preaching
the word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:64508:21"/>
               <hi>From which place, the Objectors underſtand, That any,
poor or rich, weak or ſtrong, if they could teach, they
became Diſpenſers.</hi> The ſame times <hi>(ſay they)</hi> are
now; for the want of publike meanes, they were ſcattered,
ſo are wee; Therefore, if God enable us, wee will take a
courſe in private: if men ſend us <hi>(ſay they)</hi> to priſon, God
will ſend priſon-comforts.</p>
            <p>I perceive that the Objectors collect hence three things,
1. That any, of what condition ſoever may preach,
though they bee no Miniſters. This I conceive they
prove from <hi>verſe 1. All were ſcattered thorowout the
regions of</hi> Judea <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>except the Apoſtles,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>verſe 4. Therefore they who were ſcattered
abroad, went everywhere preaching the word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the agreement of our times with theſe Primitive
times, in diſſipation or ſcattering, warrantizeth any,
though no Miniſters, to preach privately.</p>
            <p>3. That if trouble ſhould befall them for this their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
they ſhould find like comfort in priſon to that
which theſe Primitive Chriſtians found, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Theſe three collections will find no defenſe
from this Scripture, as ſhall be made apparent by our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
particularly to every one of them: And therefore,</p>
            <p>I anſwer to the firſt, That this quotation proves not
that any, rich or poore, weak or ſtrong, being of other
Callings, did Miniſterially diſpenſe the word. It is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an hiſtory what was done upon the perſecution of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi>
as, 1. It ſayes, That all were ſcattered, except
the Apoſtles, that is, Many, or the moſt of beleevers: for
wee muſt not think that none (but the Apoſtles) who
profeſſed the name of Jeſus abode there, ſeeing wee read,
that <hi>devout men carried</hi> Stephen <hi>to his buriall, verſe</hi> 2. and
that the Apoſtles (during this perſecution) ſent <hi>Barnabas</hi>
as farre as <hi>Antioh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 11. 12.</note> to the Gentiles, who had turned to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64508:21"/>
the Lord. And ſecondly, The hiſtory relates, that all who
were ſcattered did preach.</p>
            <p>The Objectors ſuppoſing that ſome of theſe were Lay-men,
hence imagine, that Lay-men may preach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though it be granted that ſome of the ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
were Lay-men, and that they did preach, yet I dare
confidently affirme, That not one of them who were Lay-men
did Miniſterially diſpenſe the word. This will be
evident, if wee find what kind of preaching Theſe uſed.
The text (according to the Originall) ſaith, they all who
were ſcattered <hi>did Evangelize,</hi> that is, did ſhew the glad tidings
of the word, or, did bring the word of glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings:
All did thus. And if wee look further into the
hiſtory, wee ſhall find, according to the two ranks of the
Scattered, two kinds of Evangelizing by them. Such of
them who were Miniſters did miniſterially Evangelize;
but ſuch who were Lay-men did Evangelize only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſively.
In the thirteenth <hi>verſe</hi> it is ſaid, That the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi>
believed <hi>Philip</hi> Evangelizing; it is rendred
Preaching: And the fifth <hi>verſe</hi> tells how, and in what
manner hee Evangelized, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hee preached (as an
Ambaſſadour) Chriſt. Againe, ſome of thoſe who were
ſcattered, were men of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and theſe alſo
according to the quotation did Evangelize; and yet the
Holy Ghoſt tells us how, and in what manner they did
ſo;<note place="margin">Acts 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19, 20.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they talked, or, diſcourſed of the glad tidings
of Chriſt Jeſus; firſt, only to the Jewes, and then alſo to
the Greeks. So then, this Evangelizing or Preaching was
but their diſcourſing and telling the Jewes and Greeks
the good tidings of Chriſt, which any may doe. And
this diſcourſe is a kind of Preaching; but yet it is not the
Preaching which is properly ſo called. And it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that their talking and diſcourſing was available to
the converſion of others.</p>

If any reply, that the Holy Ghoſt uſeth the ſame word
touching <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Johns</hi> preaching at <hi>Samaria,
Acts</hi> 8. 25. and therefore it is likely theſe men of
<hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrene</hi> did miniſterially preach.</p>
            <p>I anſwer; <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did two wayes preach at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria:</hi>
Firſt, by their diſcourſe they teſtified the truth of
that which <hi>Philip</hi> had taught; and ſo may any godly man
doe. But ſecondly, They did Evangelize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in many Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> which I believe was as <hi>Philip</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had done, by ſpeaking as Ambaſſadours from Chriſt;
which only Miniſters (as they were) may doe. The men
of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrene</hi> did diſcourſively preach, as <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>John</hi> did; but they preached not miniſterially, as
<hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> And I the rather think ſo, becauſe the
Holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking of their preaching, uſeth a word
ſignifying an ordinary talking,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Plut in Alcib.</note> but no artificiall ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
whereas in deſcribing <hi>Philips</hi> preaching, hee uſeth a
word ſignifying his uttering as an Ambaſſadour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
deciphering <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Johns</hi> preaching, hee uſeth not
barely the word of ordinary conference, but joynes with
it another of witneſſing and evangelizing; thereby ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was more than an ordinary diſcourſe. And
laſtly, in ſetting down <hi>Barnabas</hi> his preaching, when hee
came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> hee tells us, It was by publike exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
giving us in all to note a difference of Miniſteriall
preaching from that manner of divulging by diſcourſe,
divine things, which is permitted to Lay-men.</p>
            <p>Their ſecond collection from this Scripture in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. is,
That the agreement of our times with theſe Primitive,
in point of diſſipation, warrants any Lay-man to
preach privately.</p>
            <p>For they ſuppoſe, that upon the perſecution, there
was a Prohibition, or a Non-permitting the word to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64508:22"/>
be publikely taught at <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> And then they
imagine that there was private preaching in houſes by
thoſe who were no Miniſters. And hence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That <hi>if God enable them, they will take a courſe in
private.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though wee grant that the publike diſpenſing
of the word was interrupted by the perſecution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
likewiſe, that the Chriſtians met in private houſes,
where together they enjoyed the ordinances of the word
and Sacraments; yet ſtill it is to bee denyed, that the
word was preached among them in any private houſe, by
any Lay-man.<note place="margin">Acts 5. 42.</note> I believe (as moſt congruous to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
that when they met in houſes, either an Apoſtle, or
ſome other Miniſter among them did only teach. The
Objectors muſt firſt prove, that any Lay-men in theſe
Primitive times did at all, either in private or in publike,
Miniſterially preach, before they conclude hence the
lawfulneſſe of Lay-preaching. I have already ſhewed
the contrary, and till it be as clearly diſproved, neither
I, nor others have reaſon to believe their bare affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
            <p>And to their reſolution I ſay, This Scripture will not
warrant it.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe it relates nothing what theſe Primitive
Chriſtians did in private; and therefore they cannot be
brought as a preſident of that, which is not recorded.</p>
            <p>2. That which this Scripture teaches for imitation, is,
That if the Church of God ſhould be ſcattered through
perſecution, then the ſcattered may doe what they can to
plant a Church elſewhere: Even as <hi>Philip</hi> preacht to the
<hi>Samaritans,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to them of <hi>Antioch;</hi> ſo Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
at ſuch times may diſpenſe the word (if they can)
in Popiſh, and unbelieving Countreys. And as the men
of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrene</hi> did by diſcourſe win many to the
faith; ſo may Lay-men (in thoſe barbarous Countreys
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64508:23"/>
whither they ſhall come,) aſſay by diſcourſe and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to gain ſoules to the acknowledgement of Chriſt.
This Scripture therefore allowes no private undertakings
of Lay-men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third Collection (which I ſuppoſe by their words
they make) is,</hi> That if trouble ſhould befall them for
attempting a private courſe of preaching, they then ſhall
find like comforts, in priſon, to that which theſe Primitive
Chriſtians found, being committed to priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If Authority ſhall commit any private Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
to priſon, for their clancular and private preaching,
ſurely there is no cauſe for ſuch to expect or claime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from God in priſon; becauſe the cauſe of their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
is not good. The Primitive Chriſtians ſuffered for
their Faith, for true Religion, for Righteouſneſſe ſake, and
ſo found priſon-comforts; but theſe Undertakers will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for their own fancy, for a groundleſſe opinion, for their
unrighteous uſurpation of anothers Function, and ſo
may be ſure they have no ground of comfort. S. <hi>Peter</hi>
prohibits Chriſtians to ſuffer <hi>as a buſie-body in other mens
matters;</hi>

Chriſtian, but as an evill-doer. And therefore ſuch muſt
not look for priſon-comforts, if men ſend them to priſon.
Let this ſuffice to this allegation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The laſt Proofe is</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 10. As every man hath
received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The words of S. <hi>Peter</hi> exhort every man to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64508:23"/>
help one another, according to thoſe abilities which God
hath given; but they are no command of Lay-men to
turne Preachers.</p>
            <p>The Objectors, ſuppoſing that many Lay-men have
Miniſteriall abilities, imagine that theſe words
preſcribe them Miniſterially to diſpenſe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Such a collection cannot be made hence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wrong to the Text. S. <hi>Peter</hi> allowes all to miniſter
their gifts; but withall gives the limitation, or rather the
direction how to miniſter them; namely, As they have
received them. Such then who have received gifts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall,
and publikely to be diſpenſed to others, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Text) muſt <hi>ſo</hi> diſpenſe them; but ſuch who
have no ſuch receiving of their gifts to be ſo employed,
can from this Text have no warrant for the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
diſpenſation of their gifts, it onely commanding
ſo to miniſter them, <hi>as every man hath received.</hi> Some
have gifts given, yet they themſelves are not given; and
therefore they muſt not miniſterially diſpenſe their gifts
without Call. Others (namely ſuch who are Miniſters)
have both gifts, and themſelves are alſo given,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>For the
perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry,</hi> and
<hi>for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</hi> And therefore they
are accordingly bound to diſpenſe themſelves, and their
gifts. This Text only enjoynes in the generall, how the
gifts of every one in their ſeverall Callings are to bee
employed; but it no way enjoynes a diſpending of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
gifts, in a Calling not perſonally our owne. In
one word, Though ſome Lay-men may be ſuppoſed to
have Miniſteriall abilities, or gifts, yet ſeeing they want
Miniſteriall faculties, or allowance, (being neither by
God, nor his Church thereunto called) they are not
bound Miniſterially to employ their gifts. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it will be a hard work for the Objectors to make it
evidently apparent, that theſe words of S. <hi>Peter</hi> enjoyne
Lay-men to preach.</p>
