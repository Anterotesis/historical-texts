            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO ALL NOBLE GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ere it abſolutely neceſſary for him that ſhould write of <hi>Eloquence</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>Eloquent,</hi> I would eaſily confeſs my ſelf too raſh in this enterpriſe: But having ſeen often thoſe treat knowingly of <hi>Painting,</hi> that never held <hi>Pencill;</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> remarking that <hi>Aratus,</hi> by the comon conſent of learned men, wrote excellently of the Heavens &amp; Stars, though he was no celebrated Aſtronomer; I'm encourag'd to ſay, Why then may not I too diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> without being a Orator?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> that great Maſter of Phyſick, who wrote ſo learnedly of every part of that Science, was little ſeen in the Practick; Nor
<pb facs="tcp:48341:3"/>
are thoſe, that diſcourſe beſt of the embattailing Armys, and differencing military functions, alwaies the beſt Warriers, or the moſt daring. The like may happen in this ſubject, that he, who is able to ſet down the Rules and Laws which ought to be obſerv'd in Speech or ſtile, may notwithſtanding find himſelf defective in the application, and ſo may be ſaid to give that to others, which he has not himſelf.</p>
            <p>The conceits of the mind are Pictures, whoſe Interpreter is the tongue, and the order of Gods Creatures in themſelves, is not only admirable and glorious, but <hi>Eloquent;</hi> he then, that could apprehend the conſequence of things in their truths, and deliver his apprehenſions as truely, were a perfect Orator; Thus <hi>Cicero; Dicere recte nemo poteſt niſi qui prudenter intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eloquence</hi> is equally fortunate in taming Paſſions and in charming ſenſes: ſhe imitates Muſick, and makes uſe of the voice of Orators to enchant the Eares, with the cadence of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, and the harmony of Accents; whilſt the geſtures, apt motions, Natural Aire, and all thoſe graces, which accompany exact Recitation, ſteal away the Heart by the eyes, and work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon the will. But <hi>Eloquence</hi> is chiefly grounded upon Wiſdom, &amp; Wiſdom ariſes prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from a due pre-conſideration of all our
<pb facs="tcp:48341:3"/>
actions; Hence that excellent ſaying of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>French</hi> Author, <hi>Il eſt impoſsible de bien dire, ſans avoir bien penſé,</hi> 'tis impoſſible to ſpeak well, without having firſt well conſidered what to ſpeak. And <hi>Plotinus</hi> ſays, 'tis wiſdom to think upon any thing, before we execute it.</p>
            <p>Now, as 'tis certain, that No harmony, can appear in his thoughts, nor ſoundneſs in his reaſon, whoſe ſpeech is faltering and prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: So likewiſe no clearneſs nor perfection in that Fancy, which delivers it ſelf by a confus'd abortion. Great is the diſparagment which flows from the defailance of the Tongue: it not only diſhonours the perſon of the Speaker, but even ſullys the opinion of his reaſon and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a diſrepute, and oft-times renders the very truth ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>If then it ſo befall our verball expreſſions, which are tranſient and leſs lyable to cenſure, and where one hanſome expreſſion may excuſe a number of ſolaeciſmes; how ſhall that perſon be eſteem'd prudent, whoſe pen layes him wide open in a fungous and ſordid ſtile; how ſhall we expect ingenuity from him, whoſe leiſure and <hi>Genius,</hi> aſsiſted with the examen of his eyes, yeild us no ſpirit in his writing? <hi>He that has worth in him and cannot expreſs it, is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet keeping a rich Jewell and the key loſt,</hi> ſayes a modern. Author; whereas a good ſtile,
<pb facs="tcp:48341:4"/>
with choiſe matter and embroidery of well choſen words, is like a beautifull Woman with a virtuous Soul, who attracts the eyes and charmes the hearts of all beholders.</p>
            <p>This excellent faculty of ſpeech ha's bin in high eſteem even from the very infancy, &amp; will be to the end of the World; For in ſacred Story we read,<note place="margin">Prov. 16.21, 24.</note> 
               <hi>the wiſe in Heart ſhall be called prudent and the ſweetneſs of the lips increaſeth underſtanding: Pleaſant words are as an honycomb; ſweet to the ſoul and health to the bones.</hi> Hence 'twas, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Author maintained, that <hi>Pericles</hi> (the Orator) was no leſs Tyrant in <hi>Athens</hi> then <hi>Pyſiſtratus;</hi> without acknowledging other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, then that this exercis'd his Empire armed, the other without armes, by the ſole terror of his ſpeech, which <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to a thunder bolt, as <hi>Homer</hi> did that of <hi>Vliſses</hi> to a Torrent, that beares down all with its violence. And 'twas ſaid of old, that the <hi>tongue</hi> of <hi>Cyneas</hi> (the fam'd Scholler of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi>) conquer'd more Citties, then the <hi>ſword</hi> of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> the valiant King of <hi>Epire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To have ſaid thus much, of the much more might be added in behalf of this charming Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and of the diſadvantage commonly attending thoſe who are unskill'd in it, may ſerve as an inducement to the youth of both

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a <hi>Metaphor</hi> is pleaſant, becauſe it enriches our knowledge with two things at once, with the <hi>Truth</hi> and a <hi>Similitude</hi>; As this, <hi>Heads diſinherited of their naturall Seigniories,</hi> whereby we underſtand both <hi>beheading,</hi> and the <hi>government</hi> of the head over the body, as the heir hath over the Lordſhip, which he inherits; Of which in another place, <hi>To divorce the fair marriage of the Head and body</hi>; where beſides the cutting off of the head, we underſtand the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the head and body to reſemble a <hi>marriage.</hi> The like in concealing love, uttered in theſe words, <hi>To keep love cloſe Priſoner. There came along the ſtreet a whole fleet of Coaches,</hi> for <hi>a great number. Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Metaphors</hi> and exchanges of words, are of excellent uſe, and much conducing to height in eloquence.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Allegory</hi> is the continuall proſecuting of a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> (which before I defined to be, a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one word,) and that proportionably through the whole ſentence, or through many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; As <hi>Philoclea was ſo invironed with ſweet Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of vertue, that ſhe could neither be battered nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined:</hi> Where <hi>Philoclea</hi> is expreſſed by the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litude
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48341:6"/>
of a <hi>Caſtle</hi>; her naturall defence, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall fortification of Rivers about a Caſtle; and the <hi>Metaphor</hi> continues in the attempting her by force or craft, expreſſed by <hi>battering or undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> Another, <hi>But when ſhe had once his Enſign in her mind, then followed whole ſquadrons of longings, that ſo it might be with a main battle of miſlikings and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt their Creation</hi>; where you have <hi>Enſigns, Squadrons, main Battels</hi>; Metaphors ſtill derived from the ſame thing. i. <hi>Warr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I ſaid before, a <hi>Metaphor</hi> might be too bold, or too far fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atter, you may uſe the groſſer terms.</p>
            <p>Therefore for generall delight, take your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from ingenious Arts and Profeſſions; to pleaſe the learned in ſeverall kinds; As from the <hi>Meteors, Plants, Beaſts</hi> in naturall <hi>Philoſophy</hi>; And from the <hi>Starres, Spheres</hi> and their motions in <hi>Aſtronomy</hi>; from the better part of Husbandry; from politick government of Cities; from <hi>Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> from the military profeſſion, from <hi>Phyſick</hi>; but not out of the depth of thoſe myſteries; And (unleſs your purpoſe be to diſparage) let the word be always taken from a thing of equall or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> greater dignity, As ſpeaking of <hi>Vertue, The skie of your vertue overcaſt with ſorrow,</hi> where 'twas thought unfit to ſtoop to any <hi>Metaphor,</hi> lower then the <hi>Heaven.</hi>

            <p>An <hi>Embleme,</hi> an <hi>Allegory,</hi> a <hi>Simile,</hi> a <hi>Fable,</hi> a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48341:7"/>
               <hi>Poeticall Fiction</hi> differ thus. An <hi>Embleme</hi> is but one part of the <hi>Similitude</hi> in the body and the other part under application in the words; An <hi>Allegory</hi> is the ſimilitude of the application expreſt indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and joyned in one ſentence with words, ſome proper to one part, ſome to another; A <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile</hi> hath two ſentences of ſeverall proper terms compared. A <hi>Fable</hi> is a <hi>Simile</hi> acted by Fictions in Beaſts; A <hi>Poets Tale,</hi> for the moſt part by Gods and Men. In the former example, Paint a Caſtle, compaſt with Rivers, and let the <hi>Motto</hi> be NEC OBSIDIONE NEC CUNICULIS, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſiege nor undermining,</hi> that is an <hi>Embleme.</hi> Lay it as it is in Sir <hi>Philips Philoclea; Vertue, environed, Rivers, battering, undermining,</hi> the terms of the other part; Put all theſe terms in one ſentence, and it is an <hi>Allegory</hi>; But let it be thus, <hi>There was a Lamb in a Caſtle, and an Elephant and a Fox beſieged her; The Elephant would have aſſaulted her, but he could not ſwim over the River; the Fox would make an earth to get un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her, but he feared the River would ſink in upon him and drown him</hi>; then it is a <hi>Fable.</hi> Let <hi>Spencer</hi> tell you ſuch a Tale of a <hi>Fairy Queen,</hi> or <hi>Ovid</hi> of <hi>Danae,</hi> and 'tis a <hi>Poeticall Fiction</hi>: But utter it thus in one ſentence, <hi>As a Caſtle, compaſſed about with rivers, cannot be battered or undermined.</hi> (And thus in another) <hi>So Philoclea defended round about with vertuous reſolution, could neither be forced nor ſurprized by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>; Then it is a <hi>Similitude</hi> in its own nature, which is the ground of all Emblemes, Allegories, Fables and Fictions.</p>
            <p>METONIMIA is an exchange of a name, when one word comes in lieu of another, not for a ſimilitude, but for other naturall affinity and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence; As when the matter is uſed for that which conſiſts thereof; As, <hi>I want ſilver,</hi> for <hi>money.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48341:7"/>
When the efficient or author is uſed for the thing made; As <hi>my blade is right Sebaſtian</hi>; for, <hi>of Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans making.</hi> The thing containing, for the thing or perſon contained; As the <hi>the City met the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> for <hi>the Citizens.</hi> The adjunct, property, or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the ſubject of it; As, <hi>deſerts are preferred,</hi> for <hi>men deſerving. Take heed young idleneſs</hi>; for, <hi>idle youth. Give room to the quoif,</hi> for, <hi>the Serjeant</hi>; with the like.</p>
            <p>SYNECDOCHE is an exchange of the name of the part for the whole, or of the name of the whole for the part. There are two kinds of totall comprehenſions; An entire body, or a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall name; As, <hi>my name is toſſed and cenſured by many to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues,</hi> for <hi>many men</hi>; where the part of an intire body goes for the whole. Contrariwiſe <hi>he carries a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths ſhop on his fingers,</hi> for <hi>Rings. He fell into the water and ſwallowed the Thames,</hi> for <hi>the water.</hi> So the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall name for the ſpeciall; <hi>Put up your weapon,</hi> for <hi>your Dagger.</hi> And the ſpeciall, for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, As, <hi>the Admirall is gone to ſea,</hi> for <hi>Admirall Blake.</hi> The particular for the ſpeciall. As <hi>I would willingly make you a Sir Philip Sidney,</hi> for <hi>an eloquent, learned, valiant Gentleman</hi>; or, for many; as, <hi>the Hollander they ſay comes againſt us,</hi> for <hi>the Hollanders,</hi> and ſuch like; which (becauſe they are eaſie) I have exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied familiarly. Both theſe figures ſerve well, when you have mentioned ſomthing before, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Variety in repetition.</p>
            <p>CATACHRESIS, in Engliſh, <hi>Abuſe,</hi> is now grown in faſhion, as moſt abuſes are; It is ſomewhat more deſperate then a <hi>Metaphor</hi>; And is the expreſſing of one matter by the name of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is incompatible with, and ſometimes clean contrary to it; As, <hi>I gave order to ſome ſervants of mine, (whom I thought as apt for ſuch charities as my ſelf) to lead him out into a Forreſt, and there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48341:8"/>
kill him</hi>; where <hi>Charity</hi> is uſed for <hi>Cruelty.</hi> But this may alſo be by the Figure IRONIA. The abuſe of a word drawn from things far differing; As, <hi>a voyce beautiful to his ears. Accuſing in himſelf no great trouble in mind by his behaviour or action. Do you grudge me part of your ſorrow being ſiſter in Nature, I would I were not ſo far off a Kin in fortune</hi>? This is a uſuall figure with the fine converſants of our time, when they ſtrain for extraordinary expreſſions; As <hi>I am in danger of preferment. I am not guilty of thoſe praiſes. I have hardly eſcaped good fortune. He threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens me a good turn.</hi> All by the contrary. And as he ſaid that miſliked a picture with a crooked Noſe. <hi>The elbow of his Noſe is disproportionable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ear is not onely pleaſed with ſtore and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of words, but takes great delight in the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the ſame words; which, becauſe they may be at the beginning, at the middle, in the end, and in ſundry correſpondencies of each of theſe places one to another; it happens that it has purchaſed ſeverall names of Figures; As <hi>Repetition</hi> of the ſame word or ſound immediatly without interpoſition of any other, is called EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZEUXIS. <hi>O let not, let not from you be powred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me deſtruction. Tormented, tormented? torment of my ſoul,</hi> Philoclea <hi>tormented.</hi> This figure is not to be uſed but in paſſion.</p>
            <p>ANADIPLOSIS is a repetition in the end of a former ſentence, and beginning of the next; As, <hi>you fear leſt you ſhould offend; offend, O how know you that you ſhould offend? Becauſe ſhe doth deny, deny? now in earneſt I could laugh, &amp;c. Why loved I? alas, alas; why loved I? to die wretched, and to be the example of the heavens hate, and hate, ſpare not; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48341:8"/>
perſwaſion, &amp;c.</hi> This figure is often and handſomly uſed by Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi> in his Preface to <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibert.</hi> And as no man ſtrikes in thought upon any thing, but for ſome vehemency or diſtruſt; ſo in ſpeech there is no repetition without impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>CLIMAX is a kinde of ANADIPLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIS, by degrees making the laſt word a ſtep to a further meaning. If it be turned to an argument, it is a SORITES; <hi>A young man of great beauty, beautified with great honor, honored with great valor. You could not enjoy your goods, without government, no Government without a Magiſtrate, no Magiſtrate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obedience, and no obedience, where every one upon his private paſſion doth interpret the Rulers actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to make it a SORITES or climing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, joyn the firſt and the laſt with an ER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GO. As ERGO <hi>you cannot enjoy your own goods, where every man upon his own private paſſions doth, &amp;c,</hi> This in a penned ſpeech is too Academicall, but in diſcourſe more paſſable and plauſible. <hi>Seeing to like, liking to love, loving to, &amp;c. Deceived me, after deceit abuſed me, after abuſe forſaken me. What doth better become wiſdom then to diſcern what is worthy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving? What more agreeable to goodneſs then to love it, ſo diſcerned? and what to greatneſs of heart, then to be conſtant in it once loved.</hi> Where the laſt word or ſome one word in the laſt ſentence begets the next clauſe. This Figure hath his time, when you are well entred into diſcourſe, have procured attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, mean to riſe and amplifie.</p>
            <p>ANAPHORA is when many clauſes have the like beginning; <hi>You whom vertue hath made the Princeſs of Felicity, be not the miniſter of ruine. You whom my choyce hath made the Goddeſs of my ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. You whom Nature hath made the Load-ſtarr of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48341:9"/>
be not the rock of ſhipwrack.</hi> This figure beats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one thing, to cauſe the quicker apprehenſion of it in the audience, and to awake a ſleepy or dull paſſion.</p>
            <p>EPISTROPHE is contrary to the former, when many clauſes end with the ſame words; <hi>Where the richneſs did invite the eyes, the faſhion did en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And all the night did nothing but weep.</hi> Philoclea, <hi>ſigh</hi> Philoclea, <hi>and cry out</hi> Philoclea, &amp;c. <hi>Either arm their lives, or take away their lives.</hi> This is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Figure of Narration or Inſtruction, then of motion.</p>
            <p>SIMPLOCE or COMPLEXIO, is when ſeverall ſentences have the ſame beginning and the ſame ending. <hi>The moſt covetous man longs not to get riches out of that ground which can bear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; Why? Becauſe it is impoſſible. The moſt ambitious perſon vexes not his wits to climb to heaven. Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible.</hi> This is the wantoneſt of <hi>Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,</hi> and is not to be uſed in ſerious matters.</p>
            <p>EPANALEPSIS is the ſame in one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which SIMPLOCE or COMPLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>XIO is in ſeverall; As, <hi>Severe to his ſervants, to his children ſevere.</hi> Or the ſame ſound reiterated firſt or laſt in a ſentence. As, <hi>His ſuperior in means, in place his ſuperior. In ſorrow was I born, and muſt die in ſorrow. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkindneſs moved me, and what can ſo trouble my courſes, or wrack my thoughts as unkindneſs</hi>? This is a mild and ſweet Figure, and of much uſe, though ſingle and by it ſelf, not uſuall in the <hi>Arcadia,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thus, <hi>Overthrow of my deſires, recompence of my overthrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EPANADOS is when the midſt and the end, or the midſt and the beginning are the ſame, As, <hi>If there were any true pleaſure in ſleep and idleneſs, then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48341:9"/>
no doubt the Heathen Philoſophers would have placed ſome part of the felicity of their heathen Gods in ſleep and idleneſs. Your diligence to ſpeak well muſt be great, but you ſhall be abundantly recompenced for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your diligence in the ſucceſs of perſwaſion. If I ſhould ever wiſh the perfection of your eloquence, it is for your inſtruction, and for your benefit, that I would wiſh you eloquent.</hi> This kind of <hi>Repetition</hi> and the former EPANALEPSIS are moſt eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into diſcourſe, and are freeſt from the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of affectation; becauſe words recited at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of many ſentences, or at both ends of the ſame, are more remarkable.</p>
            <p>ANTIMETABOLE, or COMMU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATIO, is a ſentence inverſt, or turn'd back; as, <hi>If any for love of honor, or honor of love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That as you are the child of a mother: ſo you may be mother of a child, &amp;c. They miſliked what themſelves did; and yet ſtill did what themſelves miſliked, &amp;c.</hi> If <hi>before he languiſhed, becauſe he could not obtain his deſiring; he now lamented, becauſe he could not deſire the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. — Either not ſtriving, becauſe he was contented; or contented, becauſe he would not ſtrive — Juſt to exerciſe his might, mighty to exerciſe his juſtice.</hi> Learned Sir <hi>Philip</hi> ſlipt often into this Figure, yet he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conceald the particularity of his <hi>affection</hi> to it, by not turning the words wholly back, as they lay; <hi>To account it not a purſe for treaſure, but as a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it ſelf worthy to be purs'd up, &amp;c. Men ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lives to conquer; ſhe conquers lives without ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, &amp;c. Shewed ſuch fury in his force, ſuch ſtay in his fury</hi>; which is rather EPANADOS; Sometimes the ſame ſenſe inverſt in contrary words. As, <hi>Parthenia deſir'd above all things to have Argalus; Argalus feared nothing but to miſſe Parthenia.</hi> Where he returns <hi>fear to miſſe</hi> in ſtead of <hi>deſire.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48341:10"/>
Neither could you have thought ſo well of me, if extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of love had not made your judgement partiall; nor could you have loved me ſo intirely, if you had not been apt to make ſo great undeſerved judgment of me.</hi> Where he returns, for, <hi>extremity of love; loving intirely,</hi> and for <hi>partiall judgement; great undeſerved judgement.</hi>

The Spaniard gave aſſiſtance to a people untrue in their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, uncivill in their manners, to thoſe who have traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly rebelled without provocation, and fled out contrary to their own ſubmiſſion, brake their own peace, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted their own Countrey.

arranged together by pairs one to one, thus. <hi>Compare the ones impatiency with the others mildneſs, the ones inſolency with the others ſubmiſſion, the ones humility with the others indignation, and tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that conquered ſeemed not rather confounded, then he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This is one way of arranging contrarieties.</p>
            <p>There is another way of ordering them with interchangeable correſpondence in ſentences, that though each touch not other, yet it affronts the other: As, <hi>Shall a Souldier (for a blow with his hand given in warr to a Captain) be diſgraced? And ſhall a Lawyer (for the Baſtinado given in a Court of Juſtice to his companion) be advanced? ſhall we that profeſs Laws, maintain outrage? And ſhall they that break all Laws, yet in this obſerve civility?</hi> Where you may ſee every word in the later ſentence aggravated by oppoſition to every word in the former. Another, <hi>Did the moſt innocent vouchſafe a part of his glory to pray for his enemies? And ſhall we the moſt ſinfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem it a blot to our reputation to be unrevenged on our brethren?</hi> Of this you ſhall have more examples hereafter. But unleſs it be for the Declamatory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, you are to avoyd too great ſwelling without ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48341:13"/>The ſecond way of <hi>Amplification,</hi> is by Diviſion, which (as a modern Author ſays) is to anatomize it into ſeverall parts, and to examine it according to ſeverall circumſtances; Not unlike the ſhew that Pedlers make of their Packs when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play them, contrary to the German magnificence, that ſerves in all the good meat in one diſh. But whereas the ſame Author ſays, that this Art of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying will betray it ſelf in method and order. I think it rather adorns it ſelf. For in ſtead of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>He put the whole Law to the Sword</hi>; let me rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon all ages and ſorts, and ſay; <hi>He neither ſaved the young men, as pittying the unripe flower of their youth; nor aged men, as reſpecting their gravity; nor children, as pardoning their weakneſs; nor women, as having compaſſion on their Sex; Souldier, Clergyman, Citizen; armed or unarmed, reſiſting or ſubmitting, all within the Town were deſtroyed by the fury of that bloody Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Note that the diviſions here, are taken from age, profeſſion, ſex, habit, or behaviour. It may likewiſe be from all circumſtances; <hi>All dance, the Heavens, Elements, mens mindes, Common-wealths, and ſo by part all dance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another example varied, <hi>He apparels himſelfe with great diſcretion</hi>; Thus amplifie for circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>For ſtuffs, His cloathes were more rich then glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: As to the faſhion, rather uſuall for his ſort, then fantaſtical for his invention; for colour, more grave and uniform then wild and light. For fitneſs, made as well for eaſe of exerciſe, as to ſet forth to the eye thoſe parts which had in him any excellency.</hi> So, to ſay, he would take an occaſion of diſcourſe with a young witty Lady, and would raiſe it firſt from her <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</hi> If ſhe ſaid nothing he would partly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with her <hi>ſilence</hi>; if ſhe <hi>ſmiled,</hi> he would gather out of it ſome interpretation of praiſe of her
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48341:14"/>
favour, and of his own joy and good fortune; if ſhe <hi>frowned,</hi> he would both move her to mirth, and deny that ſhe could be angry in earneſt; if ſhe were ſad, he would conform his ſpeech and action in that ſoberneſs to her humor, as might beguile her paſſion, by way of falſe confederacy; if ſhe walked or played, the ſecret praiſe of her face, her eyes, her hair, her voyce, her hands, her body, her gait, was the application of moſt conceipts, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gave the ground of them; yet with ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling art, as if forgetfulneſs or love alluded in them, not cunning or want of variety.</p>
            <p>So you may divide by the forms of ſpeech in general; as, <hi>he was never to ſeek how to propoſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, raiſe or maintain, reconcile and diſtinguiſh any Arguments, Hiſtories, Similitudes, Proverbs; Jeſts attended him in great plenty, when he needed to imploy them: he would deliver ſtrong Reaſons careleſly, and choyce words ſmoothly and unaffectedly; he uſed a ſporting wiſdom, an eloquent prating. But with Gallants and Ladies of better reſpect, and leſs curioſity, his duty, their kindeneſs, their common acquaintance, the occaſion of his coming, the remembrance of his laſt conference, the place, the time, the laſt news of forraign parts, the Court, the Countrey, the City, fed his invention, and ſatisfied their ears.</hi> All this is but diviſion of the perſons, with whom you converſed, their Manners, Carriage, the Faſhions and Ornaments, the Matter and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of diſcourſe. This in ſome ſort uſed, is more properly called <hi>Dilatation,</hi> then <hi>Amplification</hi>; and being often practiſed, will inable you to diſcourſe almoſt of any thing, wherein you are not preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tyed to the exact manner of diviſion, which <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians</hi> uſe. But you have liberty of ſeeking all things comprized within the ſence of your generall Theame, differ they eſſentially, or in any notable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48341:14"/>
Property. You may alſo if you pleaſe, run over the intire part of <hi>Amplification</hi>; as, <hi>the ſhip was blown up</hi>; for the <hi>ſhip</hi> you may ſay the <hi>maſt, ſails, tacklings, keel, prowe, ſtern</hi>; for <hi>blowing up,</hi> you may ſay <hi>rent, torn, ſmouthered, ſcattered</hi> in the ayr, <hi>ſunk</hi> under the water, all the circumſtances of <hi>blowing up.</hi> So in ſaying a <hi>fair tree,</hi> you may divide the tree into the <hi>root, body, branches and fruit</hi>; and <hi>fairneſs,</hi> into <hi>talneſs, ſtraitneſs, verdure, ſweetneſs,</hi> and ſuch things as are fair in a tree. In deſcribing a <hi>gallant man,</hi> you may talk of his minde, perſon, his attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting, proſecuting and finiſhing an enterprize. And note, that this <hi>Amplification</hi> hath in it both credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and inſtruction; for it makes inſtances of that which being generally ſpoken, would ſeem but a flouriſh, and gives more ſpecial note of that kinde, which univerſally could not be conceived, without confuſion and dulneſs. This kinde of <hi>Amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is more taken up by <hi>Cicero</hi> then <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>; for <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> never uſes it, but as it falls in his way.</p>
            <p>The third way of <hi>Amplification,</hi> is <hi>Accumulation,</hi> which is a heaping up of many terms of praiſe or accuſation, importing but the ſame matter, without deſcending into any part, and hath his due ſeaſon after ſome argument of proof. Otherwiſe it is like a Schoolman foming out <hi>Synonima</hi>'s, or words of one meaning, and will ſooner beget a cenſure of ſuperfluity of words, then of ſufficiency, of matter. But let us give ſome example to amplifie a <hi>Sedition; tumults, mutinies, uproars, deſperate conſpiracies, wicked confederacies, furious commotions, trayterous rebellions, aſſociations in villany, diſtractions from allegiance, bloody garboyles, inteſtine Maſſacres of Citizens.</hi> But this example is ſomewhat too ſwelling. Now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a beautiful woman; you may ſay, <hi>She hath a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48341:15"/>
moſt winning countenance, a moſt pleaſant eye, a moſt amiable preſence, a cheerful aſpect, ſhe is a moſt delicate object, &amp;c.</hi> The taſte of former times hath term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſweet, to bring in three clauſes together of the ſame ſenſe; as, <hi>Your beauty</hi> (ſweet Lady) <hi>hath conquered my reaſon, ſubdued my will, maſtered my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> How this will hold amongſt our curious ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in their time, I know not; he that looks on the wearing of it, will finde it bare, how full of ſtuff ſoever it appears. Firſt, it paſſeth for parts of diviſion, when indeed it is but a variation of an Engliſh. Yet notwithſtanding the practiſe will furniſh you ſtore of phraſes, without which you ſhal never have choyce, the Mother of perfection. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Orations uſes it much; ſome others follow it to four clauſes, but he ſeldom exceeds three. It has this certain effect, that it will ſufficiently ſecure your vein not to be dry and exhauſted. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our firſt ſort of <hi>Accumulation,</hi> and reduce it with this under one precept. I take the uſe of this to be in anger, deteſtation, commiſeration, and ſuch paſſions, as you, ſeeming throughly poſſeſt with, would willingly ſtir up in others.</p>
            <p>The fourth way of <hi>Amplification</hi> is by <hi>Intimation,</hi> and leaves the collection of greatneſs to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, by expreſſing ſome mark of it. It exceeds ſpeech in ſilence, and makes our meaning more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible by a touch, then by direct treating; as he that ſhould ſay, <hi>you muſt live very many years in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whom you ſhould account for your friend,</hi> ſays well; but he that ſays, <hi>you had need eat a buſhel of ſalt with him,</hi> ſaith more, and gives you to reckon more then many years in his company, whom you ſhould account for your friend. It ſavours ſometimes of <hi>Hyperbole</hi>; as, <hi>that man that is grown groſs, is grown from a body to a corporation</hi>; again, for a little man on
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48341:15"/>
horſe back, <hi>He was taken for a hat riding on the pommel of a ſaddle.</hi> Of this ſort, examples are familiar; <hi>So honeſt a wrangler, that his noſe being betwixt, was the onely cauſe why his two eys went not to Law.</hi> So the hugeneſs of a Gyant is expreſt, by ſaying, <hi>his skull held half a buſhel of wheat.</hi> This may be done with <hi>Ironia,</hi> or denyal. <hi>He was no notorios malefactor, but he had been twice on the pillory, and once burnt in the hand for trifling overſights.</hi> So, by ambiguity of the word, <hi>he draws his ſword oftner then his purſe.</hi> This faſhion of <hi>Amplification,</hi> I term <hi>Intimation,</hi> becauſe it doth not directly aggravate; but by conſequence or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, intimate more to your minde, then to your ears.</p>
            <p>PROGRESSIO is the laſt kinde of <hi>Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> which by ſteps of compariſon ſcorns every degree, till it come to the ſupreme; and ſometimes to advance the matter higher, it deſcends lower. It is an ornament in ſpeech to begin at the loweſt, that you may aſpire to the higheſt <hi>Amplification.</hi> For example, in reprehending the prodigality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents. <hi>I begin with the exceſſes of</hi> Alphonſus <hi>on his fathers funeral; thence to</hi> Alexanders <hi>profuſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of his friends Tombs; then to</hi> Urbanus, <hi>towards his ſervant; thence to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>on his horſes burial; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, to the</hi> Moloſſians <hi>on their dogs; and thence to the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>that charged themſelves with the ſumptuous burial of a Crocodil.</hi> So ſeeming in ſome ſort, to admit the firſt leſs then the ſecond, and by growing weaker and weaker in the exceſs of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, as I proceed, the laſt will ſeem moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, if not odious. So <hi>Cicero</hi> againſt <hi>Verres</hi> meaning to amplifie his Bribery and Extortions. <hi>It is rigorous exaction</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not to abſolve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent without money; great cruelty to commit him, till be ranſom himſelf; but not to ſuffer the parties to have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48341:16"/>
acceſs unto him without reward, is wretched covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. To ſell the egreſs and regreſs of them that ſhall bring him victuals; nay, to take money that he ſhall have an eaſie death: To put a price upon the ſtrokes that ſhall execute him; So much, that he ſhall be beheaded at one blow; ſo much, at two. This is beyond all degrees of moſt barbarous and intollerable extortion.</hi> So in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther example; <hi>He was careleſs of doing well, a looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of youth; he was inclined to do ill, a weakneſs of fleſh; his minde conſented to offend, a ſhrewd tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he committed the act, an unhappy fault; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed himſelf to abuſe, a ſad employment: yet he did not this alone, but infected others with his perſwaſion, and ſeduced them by his example. And not that only, but detained thoſe he had drawn in, with freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and diſgraced the modeſty of them who reſiſted his corruptions, with ſcorns and deriſions, which could argue no leſs in him, then a moſt reprobate damnable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rule of this is, when you would praiſe or diſcommend any thing, to conſider how many leſs things there are of that kinde, to which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you would give ſome ſhew of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. As he that would render <hi>ſleep</hi> obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, may ſay that <hi>Idleneſs</hi> (which is leſs) by <hi>Draco</hi>'s Laws was <hi>Felony.</hi> Or, to give that Biſhop his right, that built two abſolute Colledges at his own charges, and indowed them with Lands. <hi>Look downwards how rare it is for a Prelate in theſe days, not to grant long Leaſes, diminiſh the revenues of his fee. How laudable it is to repair the ruines of his own decayed Palaces and Granges? How magnificent an Act it is thought for a noble man to build an Hoſpital. How royal for two or three Princes to erect one Colledge. And can there be ſuch an unthankfulneſs, as to bear but an ordinary remembrance of him, that inricht his Biſhoprick,

built two the moſt famous Nurſeries of Learning in the Land, was liberal to all wants in his life, and left wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy bequeſts to all degrees at his death.</hi> In like ſort, by an example of abuſing the name of God. <hi>To make table talk of a mean mans name were injurious; to run upon a Noble mans title, were great ſcandal; to play with a Princes name, were Treaſon: And what ſhall it be to make a vanity of that name, which is moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible even to Tyrants and Devils, and moſt reverend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Monarchs and Angels?</hi> There be two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary aſcents to the top of this form, either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating the means, as in a former example: or by aggravating them, as in this laſt of ſwearing. And may not a matter be well amplified in this manner, by exchanging the compariſon of every particular circumſtance, that the whole may ſeem the greater? As in this example, <hi>It is lamentable that a yong man ſhould be offended with the advice of his experienced friend, tending to his profit. Firſt, it is a hard caſe that counſel ſhould be neglected, but harder that it ſhould offend. It is a ſad thing to ſee any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with good admonitions, but more ſad, to ſee a youth ſo affected, Who would not grieve to have his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ill taken? but who would not grieve more, to ſee his experience controlled? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy is that youth, that liſtens not to the good exhortations of the Skilful. But more, that diſdains the inſtructions of his diſcreet friend. He is miſerable and unfortunate, that quarrels with the ſound precepts of his dear friends; but more miſerable and unfortunate, that miſlikes directions given for his own good and advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a moſt eaſie, clear and uſual kinde of <hi>Amplification</hi>; For it gives more light and force to every circumſtance. The circumſtances are theſe.

There is a richer ſhew in this kinde of amplifying by every circumſtance, then in any other. Firſt, you muſt begin every circumſtance with a new figure. Sometimes with <hi>Affirmation,</hi> ſometimes with <hi>Interrogation,</hi> ſometimes with <hi>Admiſſion,</hi> ſometimes with <hi>Ironia.</hi> Secondly, when you, upon every circumſtance, urge the whole ſenſe, you are for every circumſtance almoſt to vary the words: As before, for <hi>Lamentable; unhappy, unfortunate, heavy, ſad, grievous</hi>; ſo for <hi>Counſel; A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are Figures that help <hi>Amplification,</hi> and make ſhew of ſetting forth a matter fairer then it is. The firſt of them is HIPERBOLE, whereof I will give you ſome ſuch examples, as my own read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long ſince obſerved in the <hi>Arcadia.</hi> Sometimes it expreſſeth a thing in the higheſt degree of poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility beyond the truth, that in deſcending thence, you may finde the truth. Sometimes in flat impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, that you may rather conceive the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, then the untruth of the relation. Poſſibly, as for <hi>Hypocritical Hoſte; he gave as pleaſing entertainment, as the falſeſt heart could give him, whom he means worſt unto. That ever eye ſaw, or heart could imagine.</hi> For

               <hi>diligent inquiry; making their eyes, their ears, and their tongue ſerve for nothing elſe, but for that inquiry.</hi> This is the utmoſt that is poſſible. But in the very frontiers of impoſſibility, thus, <hi>though a thouſand deaths follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and every death were followed with an hundred diſhonors. The world ſooner wanted occaſions, then he valour to go through them. Words and blows came ſo thick together, as the one ſeemed a lightning to the others thunder.</hi> Sometimes there is no certain quantity of a thing ſet, but plainly and ingeniouſly told un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably. As, <hi>Beyond the bounds of conceipt, much more of utterance.</hi> And, <hi>this Figure is more for the credit of your wit, then of your ſpeech.</hi>

            <p>CORRECTIO, having uſed a word of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient force, yet pretending a greater ſtrength of meaning, refuſes it, and ſupplyes the place with one of more extenſion; as, <hi>I perſwade you not to let ſlip occaſion, whilſt it may not onely be taken, but offers, nay ſues to be taken.</hi> Where the firſt riſing of the matter is, upon, <hi>Not onely, but,</hi> then upon the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, <hi>Nay: Again, you muſt be content, nay you muſt be deſirous to take pains, if you will write well; It is the onely quality, which in all actions will gain you praiſe, praiſe</hi> (ſaid I,) <hi>nay honor.</hi> This Figure is to be uſed, when you would make the matter more credible in it ſelf, then by the manner of delivery; 'tis ſometimes uſed upon paſſion, without intent to amplifie.

               <hi>Paralepſis</hi> (the ſecond counterfeit of <hi>Amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) is when you ſay you let paſs that which not withſtanding you touch at full: as, <hi>I make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any hinderance in other the direct ſtudies of my courſe: I value not my pains in collecting theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

ſhall we diſcharge our own Engagements to your Father, if this time hath not taken his full effect of profit in our labours and endeavors.</hi> Two figures properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this kinde of <hi>Amplification,</hi> which are called <hi>Accumulation</hi> and <hi>Diviſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is a round diſpatching of much matter, not plainly and ſimply the ſame in ſenſe, yet tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame end; as, <hi>Loves companions be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs, longings, fond comforts, faint diſcomforts, hopes, jealouſies, rages, careleſneſs, yieldings, &amp;c. Spite, rage, diſdain, ſhame, revenge came upon hatred.</hi> Theſe examples are out of <hi>Arcadia.</hi> You may frame one thus, <hi>All men exclaim upon theſe exactions, Nobles, Gentry, Commonalty; Poor, Rich, Schollers, Merchants, Peaſants, Yong, Old, High, Low, and all cry out upon the hard impoſitions of theſe burthens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Figure differs not much from the firſt, but that the firſt is a ſudden entrance into a confuſed heap of matter: This is a wilde and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute repetition of all that went before. As, <hi>you have heard of his pride, ambition, cozenage, robberies, mutinies, in the City, in the Camp, in the Country. What kinſman of his unabuſed, what friend unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, what companion uncorrupted, can ſpeak for him? where can he live without ſhame? where can he dye with honor?</hi> Theſe two Figures do not only make your cauſe ſeem better, but skilfully and properly uſed, do amaze an adverſary of mean ability.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Interrogation</hi> is but a warm propoſition, yet it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes doth better then a bare <hi>Affirmation,</hi> which were but too eaſie and live-leſs a ſpeech: as, <hi>The credit of behaviour, is to cover imperfection, and ſet forth your good parts better.</hi> Thus expreſſed, <hi>Is it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48341:19"/>
not the chiefeſt credit of behaviour, to ſet forth your good parts fairly and clearly, and to cover imperfection. Men are ignorant, and therefore by good expreſſions without raunting or affectation, you ſhall gain a more general opinion, then by ſufficiency ſmothered in too modeſt a ſilence.</hi> By Interrogation thus, <hi>Are not moſt men ignorant? ſhall you not then by quaint expreſſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outraunting or affectation, pleaſe more, and get a more general good opinion, then by great ſufficiency concealed by your own ſhamefaſtneſs?</hi> To diſſemble excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is good policy in him, whom his courſe muſt at length neceſſarily draw into light and proof, and then all that he delivers will be admirable, becauſe expectation foreſtall'd nothing of his worth; which may likewiſe be turned into an <hi>Interrogation,</hi> and is very fit for a ſpeech, addreſſed to many illiterate hearers; is much uſed in <hi>Pirocles</hi> Oration to the ſeditious multitude, and then it may be well fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented and iterated. <hi>Did the Sun ever bring fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Harveſt; but was more hot then pleaſant? Have you any of your children, that be not ſometimes cumberſom? Have you any Fathers that be not ſometimes froward? ſhall we therefore curſe the Sun? hate our children? and diſobey our Fathers?</hi> An example of many <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogations.

ceremonies, then with diſcovering your Nature?</hi> Many ſuch like <hi>Interrogations</hi> might be added; but let it ſuffice, that it is eaſie and gentile to ſharpen the flats of affirmations and down-right telling of Tales.</p>
            <p>EXCLAMATION is not lawful, but in the extremity of motion; as <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> ſeeing the mild <hi>Philoclea</hi> innocently beheaded, cryed out, <hi>O Tyrant Heaven, and Traytor Earth, blind Providence, how is this done?

            <p>ACCLAMATION is a ſententious clauſe of a diſcourſe, or a report, ſuch as <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems concludes with often. It is a generall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for every man commonly for his pains in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Hiſtory, or other mens Books for ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat uſe of it to himſelf.

It ſerves for <hi>Amplification,</hi> when after a great crime or Deſert exclaim'd upon, or extol'd, it gives a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall note worth credit and obſervation. As after the true relation of <hi>Scipio Africanus's</hi> courſe, who having been chief governor of the greateſt Armies in the world; having all his life time Kings ſuiters for his favour, and nations kept in awe of his Name; yet in 56 years neither bought nor ſold goods or lands, built any Houſe or Caſtle of his own, left not above 46. l. in Gold, and 6. l. in ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver behind him at his death. It may be folded up in this <hi>Acclamation: So little need has he to ſtoop to privat cares, that thrives upon publick victories; and ſo ſmall leaſure has he to be deſirous of riches, that hath been ſo long poſſeſt and ſatisfied with honor, which is the immortall end of mortal actions.</hi> Such notes are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This <hi>Acclamation</hi> ſometimes is the cauſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a former <hi>Narration,</hi> as a ſtory of one, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſervant to a family, and of mean quality, won the doting love of a witty Lady in the Houſe, whereas ſhe never looked upon the humble ſuits, the cunning inſinuations, the noble deſerts of many lovers of higher degree, but with free judgment and careleſs cenſure; This cloſe may follow, <hi>So hard entrance hath affection into a heart prepared to ſuſpition, eſpecially in the weakeſt natures, whoſe ſafeguard is miſtruſt: So eaſie is the increaſe of love by inſenſible ſteps, when the ſervice you offer ſeems to proceed out of the goodneſs of your own diſpoſition, which women expect to be permanent, and not out of the neceſſity of your ſuit, which may force you for the time to a wained difference

            <p>Contrary to <hi>Amplification</hi> is DIMINUTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON, and this deſcends by the ſame ſteps that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification</hi> aſcends, and differs no more then up Hill and down Dale, which is the ſame way, begun out of ſeverall ſentences; Yet ſome examples in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> will make you obſerve two ways of Diminiſhing ſingle terms, one by denying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; As if you ſhould ſay, <hi>But reaſonably pleaſant; Arcadia</hi> ſpeech is, <hi>Not unpleaſant, hardly liked, nor miſliked.</hi> But why ſhould I give examples of the moſt uſuall phraſes in the Engliſh tongue, as we ſay, <hi>Not the wiſeſt that ever we ſaw,</hi> for <hi>a man of ſmall wiſdome.</hi> The ſecond way is, by denying the right of the words, but by error of ſome; As, <hi>Thoſe fantaſticall mind-infected people, which Children and Muſicians call Lovers. That misfortune of letting fall his Dagger, which the rude Swaggerers of our time, call, being diſarmed.

            <p>And as for actions of perſons, there are many rarely and perfectly deſcribed. As the mutiny and fire in a ſhip; cauſes of an uproar; The Garboyl; an armed skirmiſh; policy and preparation. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times managing a Horſe is deſcribed; tilting and ſhews. Many other lively and notable portracts there are, which I will not ſet down to ſave you ſo ſweet a labour, as the reading of that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone will make you eloquent and wiſe. Sir <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Sidneys</hi> courſe (beſides reading <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi>) was to imagine the thing preſent, that his pen might the better deſcribe it.</p>
            <p>Under this notion of <hi>Illuſtration</hi> may come live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcriptions, and the apt fitting a perſon repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with ſpeech and action, both which grow into very pleaſing acquaintance with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and memory of the Reader.</p>
            <p>For ſpeciall light in every Sentence, there are other ſparks of Figures. Firſt, if there be any doubt or ambiguity in the words, it is better left out then diſtinguiſhed. But if you are to anſwer former ſpeeches, that imply any doubtfulneſs, you may diſperſe all clouds, and remove all ſcruples with <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> As being charged you have brought very light reaſons, you may anſwer, <hi>If by

light you mean clear, I am glad you ſee them; If by light, you mean of no weight, I am ſorry you do not feel them.</hi> So you may expreſs a man of hidden lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Hidden as well for the obſcure and mean eſtate of his perſon, as hidden for the unuſuall and not vulgar con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceit of the matter.</hi> But as ambiguity is not onely in words but in matter; ſo both wayes it is taken away by <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> Sometimes it is in ſingle words, as in theſe former, <hi>light</hi> and <hi>hidden.</hi> Somtimes in coherence of Sentences, by reaſon of the relation of each word to other, or by reaſon of the change of the pointing, which is cleared by delivery. You have many examples of this in the ſecond Book of <hi>Tully de Oratore,</hi> and <hi>Quintilian,</hi> where there is mention of <hi>Jocus ab ambiguo.</hi> As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Apothegmes.</p>

               <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of ambiguity in matters of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the truth of generall propoſitions, is to tell wherein they are certain, wherein they are not.

'Tis true, if you ſatisfie thoſe deſires which are like to depart with their youth; As, gaming, feaſting, idle ſporting, you are like to be caſt off with theſe toys, and forgotten.

That you are uncapable, is a ſlander, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to your own conſcience and my experience, that hath ſeen ſuch fair Eſſayes of your endeavours.

            <p>The ſecond of this ſort is PROSOPODOSIS, that overthrows no part of the <hi>Diviſion,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns ſome part to each member.

               <p>If a ſhort ordinary ſenſe be oddely expreſt by more words, it is <hi>Pariphraſis</hi>; but if by as many other, it is <hi>Paraphraſis</hi>: as, <hi>manifeſt Oathes, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful perjury.

To make a muſter of himſelf in the Iſland: for kill any marryed man; make his ſword curſed by any widow, which is by conſequence, ſeeking by curteſie, to undo him.</hi> Making curteſie the outſide of miſchief, by <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude</hi> or <hi>Metaphor</hi>: ſo then the courſe is, inſtead of any ordinary words importing a trivial matter, to take the abſtracts, or ſome conſequence, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, note, property or effect, and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it.

               <p>It is ſometimes requiſite for gaining life and luſtre in your diſcourſe, to repreſent ſome unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſtrangeneſs, beſides the tenor of your Theame or Story: and, as it were, to act your meaning; which is done either by faigning the preſence or the diſcourſe of ſome ſuch perſons, as either are not at all: or if they be, yet ſpeak not but by your imagination.

               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48341:27"/>APOSTROPHE, is a turning of your ſpeech to ſome new perſon, as to the people or witneſſes, when it was before to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To the people thus, <hi>Now let me intreat any man here preſent, that thinks himſelf not exempted from misfortunes, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged from all mischiefs, to imagine himſelf in my caſe, and to undertake for my ſake ſome few thoughts of my Diſtreſs.</hi> Sometimes the occaſion is taken from ſome quality or other thing, whereto your ſelf gives ſhew of life; as, <hi>Hope tell me, what haſt thou to hope for? Love, be aſhamed to be called Love.</hi> But to animate, and make dead men ſpeak is PROSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POPAEIA; as, <hi>If your Anceſtors were now alive, and ſaw you defacing ſo goodly a Monument by them erected, would they not ſay thus, &amp;c.</hi> And as Sir <hi>Philip Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> gives ſenſe and ſpeech to the <hi>Needle</hi> and <hi>Silk</hi> in <hi>Pamela</hi>'s hands, <hi>as learning,</hi> as a <hi>Lily</hi>: as <hi>death</hi> it ſelf is faigned to live, and make a ſpeech.</p>
               <p>Another way of clearing and reviving your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, is by <hi>deliberating,</hi> by <hi>entring into communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> by <hi>preventing and anſwering</hi> Objections. In <hi>deliberating</hi> ſometimes you are amazed; as, <hi>Whom ſhall I blame? what ſhall I pretend? ſhall I make learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hateful to you by my reprehenſions? ſhall I make my ſilence acceſſary to your idleneſs? It is not in my power, It is not in my diſcretion to reform it.</hi> Under this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure are <hi>Philoclea</hi>'s wiſhes of <hi>Zelmaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another kinde of <hi>Deliberation,</hi> which propoſes many things with intricating or intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a mans ſelf: as <hi>Nothing can aſſure me of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of your love towards me, if you diſcontinue the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48341:27"/>
ſtudy of ſpeaking well. For ſuppoſe you marry into ſome worthy Family; ſuppoſe they inrich you with ſome new friends; may not a vain of thriving rob me of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance? may not I loſe you? nay, may not you loſe your ſelf in a labyrinth of worldly cares</hi>? Sometimes we enter into <hi>Communication</hi>; as, <hi>Were it your caſe, what would you anſwer? Tell me, I appeal to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts. Your friend hath eſteemed better of his own stomack, then of the eternal love vowed betwixt you, and prefers the tryal of his valour, before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of both your credits, which muſt dye, however ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or both of you ſurvive the combat. Would you not judge him unworthy to be your friend, that began his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity with an inviolable Covenant never to be an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prevention</hi> of an Objection hath two figures; the one is <hi>Occupatio,</hi> the other <hi>Subjectio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Occupatio</hi> is thus, <hi>You will ſay to me, that in a facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Countrey, it is the only policy to ſtand neutral. I ſay, not unleſs many circumſtances help you</hi>; viz. <hi>Theſe, if none of your friends be entred into the quarrel, If you be aſſured that your wealth and diſcretion is equal to the beſt. If there be a likelihood to ſcatter the reliance on both ſides, and make a new park, then it is wiſdom to ſtand aloof a while, that if you pleaſe, you may adde the victory to which ſide you will. But having declared your ſelf, you intend to be upright? you will grow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, you offer Reconciliation? your ſtrength will forſake you, you diſpraiſe your adverſaries? you will be deemed envious. You commend his wiſdom? you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray your own weakneſs: praiſe then his wealth, his Anceſtors, his Beauty, his pleaſures; but praiſe not his foreſight nor his valour. Are you Judge amongſt your neighbors and inferiors? be preciſely juſt and rightful. Are you Aſſiſtant to your friend? be adviſedly and throughly partial. You would be counted liberal? teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

                     </gap>. He heard her comfortable ſpeeches: nothing more joyful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This figure cannot be out of ſeaſon, unleſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, as it was in the fuſtian ſpeech: <hi>You liſten to my ſpeeches, I muſt needs confeſs it; you hearken to my words?

               </p>
               <p>There is another figure, which hath been called by the name of <hi>Conceſſio.</hi> But I mean to miſtake <hi>Occupatio</hi> and <hi>Conceſſio,</hi> one for the other, till I can diſtinguiſh them better. The form of <hi>Conceſſio</hi> is this, <hi>I admit you are reſolute: I grant your determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is immoveable, but it is in things againſt your friends judgements.

               <p>Her gracious ſoul hath more Antidote in it, then all the world hath poyſon, which will therfore in her affliction make her like the Sun, which ſhewes his greateſt countenance in his loweſt declenſion, and bring her out of it, lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ſometimes men make buſineſs of kindneſs; As, <hi>I could not ſatisfie my ſelf, till I had diſcharged my remembrance, and charged my Letters with commendations to you. My buſineſs is no other but to teſtifie my love to you, and to put you in mind of my willingneſs to do you any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>: Or, <hi>have you leaſure to deſcend to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that aſſurance you have long had in me; and upon your next opportunity to make me happy with any imployment, you ſhall aſſign me, &amp;c.</hi> or ſuch like words, which go a begging for ſome meaning, and labour to be delivered of the great Burden, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:48341:76"/>When you have invented, if your buſineſs be matter, and not bare form, not meer ceremony, but of ſome concern, Then you are to proceed to the ordering it, and digeſting the parts, which is ſought out of two circumſtances: One is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the reaſons to whom you write; the other is the coherence of the matter; for mens capacity and delight, you are to weigh what will be apprehended firſt with greateſt attention and pleaſure, what next regarded &amp; longed for eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what laſt will leave moſt ſatisfaction, &amp; as it were the ſweeteſt reliſh &amp; memorial of all that is paſt in his underſtanding to whom you write.</p>
            <p>For the conſequence of ſentences, you muſt ſee that every clauſe do as it were give the cue to the other and ſeem to be beſpoken ere it come, order &amp; coherence in writing being that fire of <hi>Prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now for <hi>Faſhion,</hi> it conſiſts in four qualities of your Style. The firſt is <hi>Brevity</hi>; For Letters muſt not be Treatiſes or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſcourſes, except it be amongſt learned men, and even amongſt them there is a kind of thrift and ſaving of words. You are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to examine the cleareſt paſſages of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and through them to convey the ſweeteſt and moſt ſignificant <hi>Engliſh</hi> words you can deviſe, that you may the eaſier teach them the readieſt way to another mans fancy, and to pen it fully, ſmoothly, and diſtinctly; ſo as the Reader may not think a ſecond view caſt away upon your Letters. In eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> goodneſs of words is, as the foundation of all <hi>Eloquence</hi>; and he ſaid well, who compared them to garments, that were invented for neceſſity, yet did alſo ſerve for ornament.</p>
            <p>But though reſpect be a part after this, yet muſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48341:76"/>
I here remember it. If you write to a perſon, with whoſe condition and humor you are well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you may be the bolder to ſet a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ask to his brain. If to your ſuperior, you are bound to mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure in him three further points; Firſt, your <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rest</hi> in him; ſecondly, his capacity of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; thirdly, his <hi>leaſure</hi> to peruſe them. For your <hi>intereſt,</hi> or favour with him, you are to be the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or longer, more familiar or ſubmiſs, as he will afford you time. For his <hi>Capacity,</hi> you are to be quainter, or fuller of thoſe reaches or glances of wit or learning, according to his comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For his <hi>leaſure,</hi> you are commanded to the greater brevity, as his place is of greater diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and cares. With your betters, you are not to put Riddles of wit, by being too niggardly of your words, nor to cauſe the trouble of making Breviats, by writing too copiouſly, or waſtingly.</p>
            <p>Brevity is attain'd upon the matter, by avoiding idle complements, prefaces, proteſtations, long Parentheſes, ſupplications, wanton circuits of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and digreſſions, by compoſition, omitting conjunctions, <hi>Not onely but alſo, the one and the other, whereby it comes to paſſe, &amp;c.</hi> and ſuch like particles, that have no great buſineſs in a ſerious Letter; By breaking off ſentences; as oftentimes a ſhort jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is made long by many baits. But as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith, There is a briefneſs of the parts ſometimes, that makes the whole long; As, <hi>I came to the stairs, I took a pair of Oares, they lanched out, rowed apace, I landed at Weſtminſter, I paid my Fare, went to the Parliament Houſe, asked for a Member, I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi> All this is, but <hi>I went to Weſtminſter, and ſpake with my friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under this Notion ſomewhat may be ſaid
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48341:77"/>
of <hi>Periods,</hi> which ought not to bee too long, nor yet too ſhort, <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>O MAGIS VIRT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, EO MAGIS MEDIETAS.</hi> All vertue conſiſts in a certain Geometricall mediocrity, equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from exceſs and default. Some Writers have preſcribed a <hi>Period</hi> not to exceed that length which a man may well pronounce in a breath. There ought likewiſe to be a ſpeciall regard had to the cadence of the words, that the whole contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Period</hi> may yeeld a certain kind of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the ear; for <hi>Longinus</hi> ſays, <hi>The true ſounds and tones of Periods may be compared to a great Feaſt made up of many diſhes,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next property of Epiſtolary Style, is, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity,</hi> which is not ſeldom endangered by the former quality. <hi>Brevity</hi> oftentimes by affectation of ſome wit, or oſtentation of ſome hidden termes of Art, is ill angled for; few words darken ſpeech, and ſo do too many; as well too much light hurts the eyes, as too little; and a long Bill of <hi>Chancery</hi> confounds the underſtanding as much as the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt note. Therefore let not your letter be pen'd like an <hi>Engliſh Statute,</hi> and be ſure to avoid fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous words, and empty inflations; which may beſt be done by conſidering your buſineſs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly underſtanding your ſelf; and this will be much furthered by examining your thoughts, and expoſing them as well to the light and judgment of your own outward ſenſes, as to the cenſure of other mens ears. 'Tis for want of this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that many good Scholers ſpeak but faltringly, like a rich man that for want of particular note and difference, can bring you no ware readily out of his ſhop. By this means talkative ſhallow men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times content the hearers more then the wiſe. But this may find a ſpeedier redreſs in writing, where
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48341:77"/>
all comes under the laſt examination of the Eyes. Firſt, mind it well, then pen it, then examine it, then amend it, and you may be in the better hope of writing accurately.</p>
            <p>Under this vertue may come <hi>Plainneſs,</hi> which is, not to be too curious in the order; as to anſwer a Letter, as if you were to anſwer Interrogatories, <hi>To the firſt, firſt, to the ſecond, ſecondly</hi>; But in the method, to uſe as Ladies do in their attire, a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent kind of negligence; <hi>NON ENIM E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ENTIAM EX ARTIFICIO, SED ARTIFICI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M EX ELO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ENTIA NAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M,</hi> ſays <hi>Cicero.</hi> And <hi>Longinus</hi> hath this excellent obſervation, <hi>That</hi> Art <hi>does then appear perfect, when ſhe can ſcarce be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from</hi> Nature <hi>her ſelf.</hi> And though with ſome men you are not to jeſt, or practiſe capricio's of wit; yet the delivery of the moſt weighty and important matter, may be carried with ſuch an eaſie grace, as it may tickle the fancy of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and yeeld a recreation to the Writer, as <hi>Plato</hi> obſerves, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de Legib.</hi>

            <p>There muſt be variety, but not exceſs of terms, as if you are to name <hi>ſtore,</hi> ſometimes you may call it <hi>choyce,</hi> ſometimes <hi>plenty,</hi> ſometimes <hi>copie,</hi> or <hi>variety,</hi> But ever ſo, as the word that comes in. lieu, have no ſuch difference of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as to put the ſenſe in hazard to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>

            <p>There follows <hi>Life,</hi> which is the ſtrength and ſinews (as it were) of your ſtyle, by pretty ſayings, ſimilitudes and conceits, alluſions, ſome known hiſtory or other Common-place, ſuch as are in the ſecond book of <hi>Tully, de Oratore.</hi> And (if we may credit <hi>Hermogenes</hi>) a moderate interlacing of verſe among proſe, is not without its gentileſſe.</p>
            <p>But too great a mixture of other languages in your ſtyle, ſome (and thoſe of the more learned) have compared to a party coloured coat, made up of ſeverall pieces of ſtuff; others to <hi>Anacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The fourth is <hi>Respect,</hi> to diſcern what befits your ſelf, him to whom you write, and the matter you treat of, which is a quality fit to conclude the reſt, becauſe it does include the reſt; and that muſt proceed from ripeneſs of judgment, which (as an

Author truly ſays) is gotten by four ways, by the gift of God, by Nature, diligence, and converſation; ſerve the firſt well, and the reſt will ſerve you.</p>
            <p>In the cloſe of your letter you muſt by all means endeavour to come off handſomly, by avoyding thoſe trite and over-worn concluſions, <hi>Thus I reſt, So I remain, Thus I take my leave,</hi> &amp; the like; and by taking riſe from the next precedent matter of your letter, make your ſubſcription appendent thereto.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Hand-writing,</hi> if you attain not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it ought at leaſt to be legible, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fairly written, and truly pointed, with <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> (,) <hi>Colon</hi> (:) <hi>Semicolon</hi> (;) <hi>Period</hi> (.) <hi>Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> (<hi>Interrogation</hi> (?) and <hi>Admiration</hi> (!) points, as the matter requires.</p>
            <p>The laſt is the <hi>Orthography,</hi> or true writing of words, which (though not much valued by ſome, yet) I hold a quality ſo incident to a good Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he cannot be ſaid to be perfect in that faculty, without it; nor do I beleeve that one of ten, even among Scholars, are well skild therein.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S worth is not confin'd to place; ſo not the affection of friends to preſence: your excellent deſerts command my reſpects where ever, your abſence drawes theſe following ſalutes, as the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of my eſteems and well-wiſhes. In your noble Father I loſt a worthy friend, in you I find him again: you no leſs inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit his goodneſs, then eſtate; this entitles me your neighbour, that makes his loves lineall and ſure; and as neither with decreaſe, ſo both to the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of my acknowledgements; The power of my friend is a ſhelter and joy, his faithfulneſs my ſecurity, yet I love for worth, not-profit. This name of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> I grant is ſpreadly appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, but the thing it ſelf as rare in experience,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48341:80"/>
as lowd in vogue. Your fathers love I enjoy'd in calm times; I prove yours in the tempeſts of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: My confidence aſſures me he would not have faild the Teſt, my triall proves you do not; a certainty that precludes doubt, and no leſs obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges my proportion'd gratitude. It were eaſie now (Sir) to ſay, were you under my Stars, I would be the ſame I find you; I would ſo, nay ſhould hate my ſelf, did I feel but an inclination to the contrary. Yet all this evinces no more, then what you pleaſe to believe; Profeſſions and Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not the ſame; what I would be, will not ſurmount conjecture; your nobleneſs ſhews it ſelf in effects irrefragable. I know nothing can make me truly miſerable, but my ſelf; and as well I know and feel in lowring times, how conſolatory is the countenance of a reall friend; ſuch your beſt ſelf, to whom I ſhall always ſubſign my ſelf</p>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48341:85"/>
hear your ſafety and health. The Relator had an accidentall view of you, and I a reall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. I was once made fortunate by opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to enjoy your obliging converſation, and engag'd by your noble endearments, but this loſt, almoſt as ſoon as gain'd; ſo vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chiefe enjoyances of this fickle life, ſo unlaſting thoſe contents we eſteem moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and innocent.

But this is a world of croſſes, ſuch as, though it hath pull'd many down, yet hath it ſet others up in the ſtead. And this muſt be ſo, ſince without a croſs we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not arrive our Crown. However, neither diſtance of place, nor intervall of time can change thoſe reſpects to your noble ſelf, that took both root and date from our firſt enterview. Affection grounded on vertue, muſt parallell it in content, or be injurious. Your true worth engaged me in ever-honoring eſteems, and theſe I muſt be unworthy if I recall. Nor are our immortall ſouls ſo menſurated to place, but they can meet; though our duller clay be confin'd to the accident of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſuration; what they cannot perform by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, by operation they can; remain where they live, and be where they love; in the circumference be diſ-joyned, yet united in the center of hearts, which is their life and Being; and this is <hi>God.</hi> Here (Sir) was our firſt union, and here, I hope, nothing ſhall ſeparate: yea each flying moment of time drawes to a more emboſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neerneſs.

For how muſicall ſoever thoſe higher are; this I am ſure ſounds nothing but harſh Diſcords: and ſo lowd; that wee cannot but hear them; ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, that the dinne diſcompoſes quiet minds. The way to eaſe our ſelves is hard, yet not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: but what is it? 'tis this, <hi>To elevate our abode: To Compoſe our own interiour.</hi> He that enjoyes in time Peace, is not open to extern broiles: they may beat the out ſide, but cannot enter; batter the walls of fleſh and bloud, but the Citadell of reaſon is ſafe; and if reaſon ſway, wee fly up to manſions indiſturbd. We are all Citizens of the lower World, I grant, muſt wiſh 'tis good; may deplore it's evills; Yet our own private welfare, ought to be to us moſt precious. This were a Paradox with Polititians (if not well gloſſed) and ſo I allow it (each part was made for the whole.) But our Placite ſtill ſtands: and ſtands in this: each mortall is neareſt to himſelf.

               <p>THe ſad need a Comforter, and a Soul, in deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, requires to bee aſſiſted with reaſons to bear the cauſe of its griefs. That you are both ſad and grieved, I can no more doubt, then I can be without a ſhare in your paſſions. That you have many comforters, becauſe friends, many ſolid conſiderations from your own pietie and pious wiſdome to ſalve your ſorrowes, I am as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; Yet as none more tenders your happineſſe then my ſelf, ſo could not I alone be ſilent in this motive of your teares; what I would ſay is, <hi>Deareſt Madam,</hi> be comforted, and this (were't in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) I would effect. The reaſon of your ſable thoughts, the ſpring that ſtreames your cheekes, riſe I know from the ſad accident of your childs death. It was I confeſs the firſt image of your like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the firſt bleſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>g that heaven honored your body with, the firſt pledge of nature, the firſt title you had to be a Mother. And to bee deprived of this, almoſt as ſoon as 'twas given, could not but find and afford matter both for teares and grief, in a diſpoſition ſo natural and good. But <hi>Madam,</hi> there's a time for all, and a meane alſo. What could not be denied to your ſweetneſs, muſt be moderated by your diſcretion. 'Tis true, that ſweet infant was yours, 'twas your firſt, 'twas dear, and you ſuffered many dolours, to give it life; But withall you conſider, as 'twas yours, ſo given you by God; as the firſt, ſo more due to him; as dear,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48341:97"/>
yet could it not be too dear for him that hath it; Although of painfull birth; yet that your throwes brought forth a Saint, that your dolours were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, ſo ſoon to enthrone a part of your ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong the Angels; theſe dolours, theſe throwes, happily ſuffered. Thoſe whom God makes Parents, he makes but Nurſes of his own children, he lends them to be brought up for heaven: and if hee hath ſo ſoon diſcharged you of this obligation, tis not ſo much a croſs, as a bleſſing; Had it lived to mature age, perhaps he ſaw danger both to It and you: it might have been more cauſe of grief to you, more loſs to it ſelf; it might have been unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in life, in death unhappy; 'Tis not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children of either good or great extract, that makes them alwayes either good or happy. And this perhaps God (that provident Parent of all) foreſaw. Be it ſo, or not, certaine it is, the bodies but the ſouls priſon, wherein 'tis no ſoner breathed from Heaven, but 'tis maculated by this corrupt Earth: and in this, as it longer ſojournes, ſo is it not only debarred of its true happineſs &amp; welfare, but alſo offends its great Creator; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is miſerable. Therefore would God make the cradle of yours, its death bed, that he might haſten its bliſſe. As he breathed a pure ſoul into it, ſo would he again take it before defiled by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall blemiſhes of ſin. Had it liv'd, it could have afforded no comfort to your piety, but being in health, proſperity, and pious; and can it be more pious, then in heaven, more proſperous, then in heavens joyes, more healthfull then in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of immortality. O conſider, tis now paſt all danger, 'tis freed from all miſery, 'tis bleſſed in bleſſedneſs, it prayes for you. And can there be any ſorrow ſo great that theſe conſiderations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48341:98"/>
conſolate? O what more happy then to be ſo happy a Mother; no ſooner a Mother, then a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to heaven. Nor doubt (dear <hi>Madam,</hi>) but hee that gave you this dear pledge of his love, will give you more, and, as he took this to his own joyes, ſo will he leave in its ſtead more to your comfort. This he took to give it as ſoon happineſs as being, and therein to try your virtue and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his will: this as I doubt not but he will find, ſo may you be confident he will bee bountifull: a ſure rewarder, of your patience, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperer of your ſoul, body, and its fruitfulneſs. But pardon (moſt honoured <hi>Madam</hi>) my loves red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and if in this unpoliſhd Conſolatory I have errd, let it be as it is loves fault, a fault that your nobleneſs I am certain will remit.

But ſhe has inverted Nature, and the Seaſon too; the flower of beauty died, when the beauty of flowers ſhould ſpring; and ſo has not onely left a withered World, but diſmayed the Blowth of what ſhould garniſh it.

If ſhe were not Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative in Beauty, in beauty ſhe had many infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; if in fortunes, not the favourite of fortune; yet, ſhe has had her ſmiles. Many Beauties have faln ſooner, many may ſooner fade; yet in her all beauties, all fortunes, have expreſt, what fortunes and beauties are; what is the <hi>Exit</hi> of the Fable of this temporary life: to wit, ugly death, eternall deprivation, the cold Tomb, and deformed duſt. Fortunate life! that ſo contemplates mortal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to be indifferent and ready to change; that fraile incertainties, and vain glitter may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to aſſure and fix on laſting good, that by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death learnes to live, and lives the life that feares not death: that ſo accompanies others fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, as in that ſable equipage, to behold the mournfull Pomp of the Worlds farewell, and their own deſtiny: that reads in that earthy bed of death (the Grave of others) their own Motto, <hi>we are duſt, and all mortall things Momentary.

               <p>SInce you have been pleas'd to ſing ſo ſweet a <hi>dirge,</hi> and to make ſo excellent a comment upon our late funerous text, I cannot think the particulers of that ſad ſubject (how confuſedly ſoever I deliver them) will be unacceptable to you; This Lady was 3 moneths continually dying, without any hope of recovery, and this occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an ulcer in her throat, it was my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (though others had aſſai'd it) to gain her firſt aſſent to bring a ſpirituall Phiſitian to her. <hi>Dr. G.</hi> was next at hand, and did act his part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly well; after 2 or 3 effective viſits, the Patient (through the comfort and eaſe of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Cataplaſmes and emplaiſters, which the <hi>Doctor</hi> applied) was ſo rapt and piouſly enamor'd of him, as ſhe even embrac'd him at every appearance. When ſhee drew neer the confines of deaths king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhe did uſually ejaculate not only moſt pious but even eloquent or rather diviniloquent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as this (amongſt many others) which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven grant I may never forget. <hi>I have</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>lived long in the vanity of this World, for which God hath placed mee in this bed of ſorrow; Were it his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48341:118"/>
holy pleaſure, I ſhould act over one of them again, and the choice left to mee, I would</hi> (<hi>by the Grace of</hi> Jeſus) <hi>rather choſe the torments of this bed, and malady, then have any thing to do with the Worlds vanities,</hi> &amp;c Beſides nothing did ſo much trouble her, as that <hi>ſhe had lived</hi> (as ſhe ſaid) <hi>for fear of Worldly enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magement) ſome yeares in an outward profeſſion that contradicted her inward perſwaſion</hi>; The <hi>Doctor</hi> was no leſs taken with his Patient, then ſhe with him, for I heard him ſay hee was never more ſatisfied with the manner of any perſons death; And I confeſs her exit did more triſtitiate mee, then did that of my own Siſter, the manner of it, not a little both mortifying and edifying mee; For to ſee her picture in the Anti-chamber, and then go in and look upon the originall, was ſubject enough for mortification, the one being ſo incomparable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, the other ſo ghaſtly; In a word, the laſt breath ſhe drew was <hi>Je</hi>-and in pronouncing-<hi>ſus</hi> ſhe expir'd. So that we may conclude, as ſhe was a great beauty living, ſhe was a greater dead; For whereas corporall beauty in others dies with the body, hers did not ſo, but by a ſecret tranſition paſs'd into the ſoul.

Whilſt theſe appeare, let us be the ſame we were, conſtant old friends to God, heaven and our ſelves. Change, though to the better, argues imperfection, yet not to change to the better, were the worſt of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. As reſtles rivers haſt to their Ocean, ſo ought we to ours, which is God, that Ocean of bliſs, repoſe, and Center of aeternity; Till here arrived, we are in flux and variety: Let us be ſo, but hold the right way.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Grace</hi> is elder then <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo ſhe firſt begins her year; <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> commence theirs with the ſprings vigour, when the Sun's in <hi>Aries,</hi> the Church is content with <hi>Capricorn</hi>; When her Sun's in the Cradle, that Orient of Juſtice and mercy, the Son of God, The ſignes melancholy; yet the forerunner of more propitious. So let our ſorrows ſhorten with the nights, our joyes with the dayes lengthen.
