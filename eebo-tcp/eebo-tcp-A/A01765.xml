            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the time of Saint Paul God did ſmite and ſharpely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe the Churche of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, becauſe they dyd euyll vſe this Sacrament. In our tymes (becauſe we wyll not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the errours of all worldes) be brought in, ſundry kyndes of ſuperſticious hipocriſies, about the vſage of this Supper. All
<pb facs="tcp:18974:3"/>
whiche I wyll not nowe name in perticuler, for ſpendynge of tyme. I wyll onely intreate of that which is of moſt force, that we may learne after what ſorte we ought to preſent our ſelues to this holy table. Some wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters moued by theſe wordes of S. Paule: He that cateth vnworthelye of this breade and this wyne, cateth his owne iudgement: they haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hand to declare how a man may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely vſe this Sacrament. And after much debating, they haue thus reſolued them ſelues: that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath than worthely eaten this bread, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is in the ſtate of grace. And paſſing on a little further, they haue expounded &amp; ſaid, that a man is than in ſtate of grace, when he is purged and clenſed of all mortall and veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinnes. In this ſort they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
<pb facs="tcp:18974:3"/>
them ſelues, becauſe their ſtudye is to vnderſtande after what ſort ſynnes be purged, &amp; howe a man may come into the ſtate of grace. The writers of theſe dayes be of diuers iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes touchyng this matter. Some ſay that through contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, confeſſion, and ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of workes, a man is purged from all ſinne, and doth deſerue the ſtate of grace. But when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth diligently ſearch what is this meritorious worke of this great goodnes, thei do very yll agree vpon the matter. For ſome ſay that this ſatiſfactorye worke is faſtyng, accompanyed with teares and prayer. Other adde this and ſay that our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt be done with ſackcloth and other chaſtiſementes of the fleſhe. Others do ſaye, that not
<pb facs="tcp:18974:4"/>
only theſe workes be neceſſarye to deſerue the ſtate of grace: but alſo there muſte be almoſe, the whiche doth clenſe a man from ſinne.</p>
            <p>The furder we be ſeperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pure time of the Apoſtles, ſo much greater is the nomber of ſatiſfactions, and the thyng is ſo augmented, that mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be brought into feare, error, and deſperation, and in them ſelues ſo confounded, that they knowe not where to fynde the beginning. Wherfore a man is neuer certayne to do theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfactory workes ſo perfectlye that he may deſerue to be in the ſtate of grace: No more there is no conſcience of anye lyuynge man, be he neuer ſo holye, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſure himſelf to be without ſinne, yf he ſhall beholde his
<pb facs="tcp:18974:4"/>
merite, and the dignitie of his own workes. Let vs then leaue of ſuch encomberaunce of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: and for the eatyng of the Lordes ſupper, let vs folow the facion that was vſed by the Apoſtles. Paule doeth not bring our mindes to this deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and doubtfulneſſe, when he doth exhorte the Churche of the Corinthians to vſe worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye this Supper: But this he ſaith, that than do we worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe this ſacrament, when we do acknowlege our ſelues to be vnworthye, and laye open our ſinnes before Ieſus Chriſt, that he through his mercye woulde make vs worthye. That we ſhoulde alſo diſpayre of our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, &amp; all our workes: for that we myght receaue comforte in hym, that we ſhuld humble our
<pb facs="tcp:18974:5"/>
ſelues, that in Chriſt we myght be exalted: that we ſhoulde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our ſelues ſinners, that in Chriſte Ieſu we myght be iuſtified: therfore we mai not thynke to come to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t boyde of ſinne, nether that wee be worthye to deſerue ſo great a benefit. But let vs thus thinke, that we being poore, do go to a liberall geuer: that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng ſicke, we go to a gentle phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian: And beyng ſinners, doo runne to our ſauiour. Thus the dignitie wherof Paul ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that is in this Supper, is perfourmed by fayth, at thoſe tymes when we beleue that all the merites of Chriſt be oures: And that we behaue our ſelues in loue towards our neygbours as this daye ſhalbe declared.</p>
            <p>This error that I haue nowe
<pb facs="tcp:18974:5"/>
ſpoken of, is one of the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table errours y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in the church conſerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſage of the lordes Supper. The ſeconde error is this, the which hath ben and is continuallye preached, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der breade and wine is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the body &amp; bloud of Chriſte Ieſu. Theſe preachers &amp; ſcoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters of mens conſciences, do only occupy them ſelues to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade two thynges to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>The firſt, that in this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is the body and bloud of Chriſt. The other, that all Chriſtians ought with great deſyre to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue this Sacrament, becauſe thei do receiue the body &amp; bloud of Ieſu Chriſt. And theſe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend fathers ſay, that men may ſearch no further, becauſe that all matters of faith ought to be
<pb facs="tcp:18974:6"/>
beleued ſimplye. But to what ende a man ought to vſe this Sacrament, and what commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie a Chriſtian getteth by it: theſe our reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de fathers haue not ſo muche as touched one worde, to comfort ſuche conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as be in trouble. Theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers do not conſider that this theyr fayth may be in the deuyl, and in all his members. It is no hard thing to perſwade this theyr article to the people. For yf thei beleue that Ieſus Chriſt is ryſen from death, that by a miracle he entred, the gate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng ſhut, into the houſe where the Apoſtles were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without any hurt to his body: alſo if they beleue manye other miracles that was done of the Lord whyle he lyued here vpon earth: By the ſame reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:18974:6"/>
it is an eaſy mater to perſwade the Chriſtian people, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in bread and wine there is the body and bloud of Ieſu Chriſt. This this were a ſmall matter whervpon to ſtay: but we muſt ſearch ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further. Theſe ſpirituall maſters thynke to haue done theyr offyce, whenſoeuer they haue perſwaded this to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: that in the ſacrament is the bodye of Ieſu Chriſte, and that they be bounde to receaue it.</p>
            <p>We be come nowe to this paſſe: lette a man aſke a Chriſtian yf he wyll communicate, he wyli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aunſwere yea. And if you aſke him wherfore he wyll do ſo, he aunſwereth, becauſe the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hath ſo ordeyned. But yf we ſhoulde conſyder the matter ſomthyng more deepelye, and ſearche for what pourpoſe and
<pb facs="tcp:18974:7"/>
to what end this was ordeined: he wyll aunſwer, to receaue the body and bloud of Chriſt Ieſu. And they thynke to knowe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they can after this ſort geue accompt of theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. But as I haue already ſayde, yf this thing be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conſidered, this fayth is nothing: becauſe euery naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye perſon can haue this faith. And he that can geue no better accompte of his fayth, then is commenly done nowe a dayes, lette hym take heede to receaue this ſacrament. To admit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſupper thoſe perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s thus euyll enſtructed: is as a manne ſhould admit a brute beaſt to an holy banquet, to the great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie of Ieſu Chriſte, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the church, It is then erpedient that the Chriſtian be
<pb facs="tcp:18974:7"/>
otherwaies inſtructed, and that he knowe what thing this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is, and for what ende the Lorde hath ordeyned it, for what cauſe alſo the church doth vſe it: what profite the faithful do receaue by it: and manye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges which be neceſſary to vnderſtande, as this daye is made manifeſt. I ſay the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ought to vſe in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſelfe ſame meanes, as is vſed in baptiſme, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a child is baptiſed, or yet any other per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon growen in yeres. The whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che partie when he goeth to be baptiſed, it is not ſufficient to deſire to be vnited to the church &amp; that he beleueth ſuerlye that this waſhyng is baptiſme, and that this ſacrament is ordeined of God: No nor it is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe that the partie doeth
<pb facs="tcp:18974:8"/>
deſyre to be baptiſed, becauſe this belief may be both in good and euyll. But the principall point that the miniſter doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know of him that is bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſed, is this: Whether he doth forſake the deuyll with all his works, and that he that is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed do confeſſe ſo to do openly. That done, the miniſter doth aſke yf he beleue in the father, in the ſonne, and in the holye ghoſt. In which demaunde the mynyſter doth ſearche out the fayth of him that receaueth the Sacrament: of which faith, the Church muſt be aſſured. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is nedeful that euery one that is baptiſed, ſhuld know to geue accompte of theyr fayth in the face of the congregation. Howe muche more then oughte this to be done in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:18974:8"/>
of the Lordes ſupper, the which is only miniſtred to ſuch as be of ſufficient yeres, &amp; that be able to vnderſtande the word preached.</p>
            <p>Therfore when any man ſhal firſt communicate, it is erpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to heare his confeſſion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this article. For by that confeſſion the Churche maye iudge yf ſuche a perſon bee a fitte veſſell to receaue ſuche a Sacramente: that by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes there maye bee a difference of Iudas and other brutyſſhe creatures. There is then to be wyſſhed ſome other fayth, muche dyfferynge from this of the Hypocrytes, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thynke they haue done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that worke, becauſe it is ſo
<pb facs="tcp:18974:9"/>
ordeyned. Were it not a great folly yf one of rype yeres ſhould be baptiſed, and yf he were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wherfore art thou baptiſed could make no other aunſwere but that he is baptyſed becauſe it is ſo ordeyned. And hauynge no other ſtaye wherevnto the Chriſtian fayth ſhould ſtaye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: ſhould not ſuch one be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt iudged and taken for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimuled Chriſtian? Seing than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacramentes be witneſſes of our fayth: it is needefull that they whiche wyll preſent them ſelues to this table, be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to geue accomptes of theyr fayth. Therfore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uement that ſuche ſhoulde be eramined of the miniſter of the Churche.</p>
            <p>Firſt the miniſter doth aſke the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what is this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?
<pb facs="tcp:18974:9"/>
The faithful doth anſwere, that this ſacrament is an aſſuraunce and gage, left of Ieſu Chriſte in his church, for that none ſhould doubt, but that his body is dead for vs, &amp; that hys bloud is ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſinnes. Then the miniſter ſhal aſke him what he intendeth to do, when he doth preſent him ſelfe to this ſupper. The faithfull doth aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, I do beleue to receaue al the merites of Ieſus Chriſt, and to receaue them in ſuche ſorte, that they bee no more Chriſtes, but that they bee myne, in no leſſe force then yf I with my owne proper bodye had merited the kingdome of heauen. Then the miniſter doth thys aſke and ſay: what aſſuraunce haſt thou to aſſure thy ſelfe after this ſort of the workes of thy Lorde? The
<pb facs="tcp:18974:10"/>
faythfull doth aunſwere, I do thys aſſure my ſelfe vppon the wordes that Ieſu Chryſt ſpake in his laſt ſupper, when he ſaid, take and eate, this is my body, thys is the cuppe of the newe Teſtamente in my bloud, the whiche ſhalbe ſhed for you. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne the miniſter doth aſke, after what maner doeſt thou thynke to eate thys bodye, and drinke this bloud? The faithful doth aunſwere: I do beleue to eate it ſpiritually, in ſuche ſort as the goſpell vnder the ſignes of bread and wyne doth offer, &amp; my fayth doth receaue. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter doth aſke, wherefore doeſt thou not thynke to eate the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal body of Chriſt? The faithful doth aunſwere, becauſe it is the ſpirite that geueth me life, &amp; the fleſhe profiteth nothynge. For this cauſe ſayeth the Chriſtian,
<pb facs="tcp:18974:10"/>
am I come hyther vnto the company of the faythfull for to receaue this ſacrament, becauſe I beleue that the bodye of my Lorde is dead for me, &amp; that hys bloud is ſhed for my redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: therfore my fayth is confirmed &amp; comforted by this ſacrament. The miniſter doth demaunde, what profit &amp; commoditie rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thy ſoule of thys holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? The faithful doth anſwere, the commoditie that I receaue therby, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I am made a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of Chriſte, who is the head of the Churche: And I do tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme my ſelfe into my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I become one ſoule, one hart, &amp; one wil w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. With theſe &amp; other lyke inſtructions, ought the Chriſtian people to be inſtructed, when they doe fyrſt preſent them ſelues to thys ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſupper. Thys Sacramente
<pb facs="tcp:18974:11"/>
is a witneſſe of our fayth, and alſo an open confeſſion of the ſame: For when we do frequent it, we do declare the death of the Lord. The miniſter of the churh ought to admyt none to thys ſupper, who were not very well inſtructed, and alſo openly had made confeſſion of theſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys faith is not, all thinges be decayed and of no force. Let vs now then conſider what difference is betwixt the fyrſt fayth &amp; this ſeconde. Thou beleueſt by thy fyrſt fayth, that in this ſacrament is the bodye and bloud of Ieſu Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What profit haſt thou by this beliefe? The deuil and any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſon may haue this faith, and yet for all that ſhall not be ſaued. Thou beleueſt that to vſe this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is a good worke.
<pb facs="tcp:18974:11"/>
The deuyll beleueth alſo &amp; kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that it is a good woorke: ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> this common faith maketh man no better then the deuyll, or any other naughtie perſon: Therfore it is requiſite to haue ſome other fayth. But ſo ſone as the true &amp; lyuely fayth ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in our hartes, and ſpeaketh to our conſcience, it ſayeth: Ah from henceforth be mery, ſeinge Chriſt is wholy thine in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectes, becauſe that in this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thou doeſt receaue all hys merites, he hath ſupped vp in his bloud all thy ſinnes. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe therefore from henceforth openly in thys Sacrament, the death of thy Lord, becauſe he is preſent in all thy doinges.</p>
            <p>This ſeconde fayth farre paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the fyrſt, the which maketh thee no better then the Deuyll,
<pb facs="tcp:18974:12"/>
no nor than any hipocrite. But this ſecond chriſtian faith, doth geue vnto thee, al that treaſure encloſed, and promyſed in theſe wordes of Ieſu Chriſte: Take &amp; eate this is my body. Therefore it is nedefull that the miniſter of the Church be wel aduiſed in geuinge thys ſacrament to any body, yf he haue not before vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande his faith. And by that confeſſion which the Chriſtian hath made in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, to iudge that he is worthye to eate thys ſupper, and to be made one bodi with Ieſus Chriſt. This confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to be had of neceſſitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for this ende, that they may be witneſſes, &amp; alſo an open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith. It is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that we liue after ſuche ſort in thys mortall lyfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we helpe our neyghbour, &amp; that we ſhuld ſhew our faith, the which is hid
<pb facs="tcp:18974:12"/>
in our hartes, openly by ſome outwarde token to the Church. That is bi baptiſme, &amp; with the ſupper of the lorde. The goſpell muſt bee confeſſed openly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our mouth, and for this cauſe alſo is this ſacrament ordayned, that al the worlde maye knowe that we be Chriſtians: he that vſeth not the ſacrament of this ſort, doth greuouſly offend hys lord. What ſhall profit thee this fyrſt faith of the hipocrites, when in paſſing ouer of this worlde, the deuilles ſhal tempt thee? if thou ſhalt ſaye I beleue that I haue receaued the body of Chryſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo ordayned: In lyke ſort wil the deuil ſay. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue alſo that thou haſte recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it. This faith will nothinge profit thee, nor yet eaſe thee of thy troubles. But if thou be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the true fayth: thou ſhalt aunſwere the deuill &amp; ſay.
<pb facs="tcp:18974:13"/>
Ah Satan thou tyraunt, what power haſte thou in me? I am armed in thys ſacrament with the merites of Ieſu Chriſt, who is made mine and I am become his: what canſt thou do againſt me? I do not eſteme thee, vſe thy force, I do not feare it: my lorde is greater then thou. With thys fayth ought euery one to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not only to paſſe ouer this lyfe, but alſo in all parylles whiles we ſhall here lyue. After thys ſort it becommeth a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to be inſtructed, yf this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſhould profit him. For yf thou haſt not thys fayth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou hadeſt al the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes of the worlde aboute thee with the Sacrament in theyr handes, it ſhould profit thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge. We reade in the boke of the Kynges, that the people of
<pb facs="tcp:18974:13"/>
Iſraell fyghting with the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, were ouerthrowen, put to flyght, and diſperſed. After thys ouerthrowe, the Elders of the people of Iſraell, gathered them ſelues together and ſayde to them: for thys cauſe are the Philiſtines lordes and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in this warre, becauſe the arke of the couenaunte is not <note place="margin">1. Reg. 11</note> with vs. It was then ordayned that the arke ſhould be brought into the army, of whiche when it came, al the people were glad. The Iewes cryed with greate ioye, thinkinge therby to haue made affrayde the Philiſtines, triumphinge of victoritie, not yet gotten. The people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el being proude for the preſence of the arke of the Lord, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne battell a freſhe with the Philiſtines, but with great loſſe
<pb facs="tcp:18974:14"/>
and more ſhame, they were put to flight &amp; ouerthrowen. Howe came this to paſſe, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes were thus ſubdued &amp; euyll han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled? The arke of the lorde was preſent, in which they had ſuch confidence, that they thought God to bee preſent, and that he had there a peculier habitation. Of thys they had no leſſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then hath the hipocrites of this ſacrament. Why dyd not God helpe the Iewes: becauſe the Hebrues were voide of faith, thought by the preſence of the arke, to haue god to be fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The very ſelfe ſame thinge doth come to paſſe in our times, to ſuch as truſt in the outward worke of this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and be not inſtructed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true faith where with a chriſtian ought to be endued. Therefore the deuill hath more power of ſuche, after thei haue receaued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrament,
<pb facs="tcp:18974:14"/>
then euer he had before. Let vs then leaue of this illuſion, and beleue, that that Chriſtian whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is partaker of Ieſu Chriſte by faith, doth become of the ſelf ſame ſubſtaunce with his lord. This is that coniunction of the church w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt, whereof Paule ſpake ſaying: that we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe <note place="margin">Ephe. 11</note> by all meanes in Chryſt, who is the head, whervnto the body faſtened &amp; ioyned by euery kind of coniuction, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power &amp; meſure of euery part, cauſeth the body to encreaſe in edifiyng it ſelf by charitie. Our bodies be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres of Ieſu chriſt, and the habitation of the holye ghoſt. Theſe benifites be geuen vnto vs, becauſe our lord is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs both in ſpirite &amp; in bodi. This coniunction that we haue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſu Chryſt, can not be declared, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greater prayſe then Paul did, when he ſaid, that our
<pb facs="tcp:18974:15"/>
fleſhe is the fleſhe of Chriſt, and <note place="margin">Ephe. v.</note> our bones the bones of him. In no leſſe force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the bones and fleſhe of Eua formed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</p>
            <p>Seinge we haue nowe made manyfeſte the inſtruction that ought to be kept when a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian will vſe thys ſacrament or ſupper: It is nowe nedefull to declare what fruite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie we haue of this ſupper. I ſaye thys ſupper doth brynge forth two fruites to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. The fyrſt is, that we become after a ſort the brethren of Ieſu Chryſt, and that we be the ſelfe ſame ſubſtaunce with him. The ſecond fruite is, that we be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed after a ſort with oure neighbour, that we become one harte, and one ſoule with hym. And after this ſort al the whole
<pb facs="tcp:18974:15"/>
Churche is vnited with Ieſus Chryſt and in it ſelf. Theſe two fruites be deſcribed of Saynct Paule who ſayth: The cuppe of bleſſynge whiche we bleſſe, is it not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the bloud of Chriſt? The bread whiche we breake, is it not the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bodi of Chriſt? Becauſe that many be one bread and one body, therefore all we be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of one bread, whenſoeuer we do eate of thys bread, that wytneſſeth that thys meate is common to all beleuers. And ſeyng that in this ſacrament al thinges be common: let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue together that, the whiche Chryſte hath wrought for vs. Thys is that commoditie of whiche I haue ſo often ſpoken. If the chriſtian haue fayth, and beleue that the body and bloud
<pb facs="tcp:18974:16"/>
of the lorde be hys, he hath then Ieſu Chriſt in him with all hys benifites. Thenceforth the hart is meri, reioyſeth &amp; triumpheth, truſtyng to be ſaued, not by his owne goodnes, but by the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud of Ieſu Chriſt. This is to be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſfourmed into chriſt, and to be his body &amp; bloud: for that he taketh vpon him al our miſeries, all oure vnhappynes, &amp; al our miſhappes. Theſe two thinges be ioyned together, and agree in one, that is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Chriſt and our ſinne, that we ſhould be of the ſame health and ſtrength, if we be one ſoule with Ieſu Chriſt: what thynge ſhuld we deſire more then that. Theſe and ſuch other like thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ought to bee preached and taught the people, when they fall a reaſonynge of thys ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:18974:16"/>
for that end, that the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may vnderſtande to geue accompt to the Church of theyr ſayth. But ypocriſie hath nowe ſuche power and force, that the Chriſtians be onely geuen to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonyes, the whiche be more ſuperſticious then godly. They vſe this ſacrament only becauſe it is ſo ordayned: becauſe they thynke to receaue the bodye of Ieſu Chriſt: there thei ſtay. And leauyng the true vſe of thys ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, they haue framed of their owne heades, many other commodities without the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiſe of the worde of god. The fyrſte commoditie is thys, yf a man heare maſſe, all day he can haue no harme: If thou haſte loſte any thynge, or yf thou bee robbed, cauſe maſſe to be ſayde, and thou ſhalte fynde thy
<pb facs="tcp:18974:17"/>
thinges, and that ſhalbe reſtored that was robbed. If thou wyll fynde grace in maryage, or bee healed of any dyſeaſe, or yf thou wouldeſte haue a proſperous iourney, or delyuered from any peryll, cauſe maſſe to be ſayd of ſuche or ſuche a Sainct, vnto whom the wyſedome of man hath grauen theyr peculyer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Theſe be not the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this ſupper. For it is not intituled that a manne ſhoulde therby obtayne proſperitie, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ryches, and other worldly goodes: but it is principally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned for a remembraunce of the lordes death, that we ſhould be vnited to him, neuer to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated. There is alſo an other cauſe, wherfore this ſacrament is ordayned, and that is: that it ſhould be in ſtede of an erhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:18974:17"/>
to ſtirre vs vp to loue and vnitie with our neighbour. For this cauſe doth the Lord parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate his bodye to vs, that he may be wholy vnited to vs, and we ioyned together with hym. And being al ioyned in one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall bodye, we ſhoulde be the members one of another. This ſociete which we ought to haue together, is figured bi the bread and wine whiche be offered in this ſupper. The bread is made of many cornes, the whiche be after a ſorte made one and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together, ſo that the one can not be ſeperated from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Euen ſo we Chryſtians ought to be vnited together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ch charite, that one could not be ſeperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another. This vnitie was deſcribed of Saint Paule as I haue ſayde before:
<pb facs="tcp:18974:18"/>
who ſayde that all thoſe which were partakers of this holye breade, be one body. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian than ſhall reape a greate profite by this Sacrament, yf he ſhall be tranſfourmed into his neyghbour, and doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the wealth, honour, and profite of his neyghbour before his owne. Out of this greate charitie ſpryngeth theſe good thoughtes in vs, which can not offende, which can not deſpyſe, nor by any meanes torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our neyghbour. And by that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is not Ieſu Chriſt offended, neither torne, nor yet rente in peeces. Therfore we can not be ſeperated from our neyghbour, but we be alſo ſeperated from Ieſu Chriſte: we can not loue our brother, if we loue him not in Ieſu Chriſte. We ought to
<pb facs="tcp:18974:18"/>
haue the ſelfe ſame care of our neyghbour, as we haue of our ſelues. We be one the membre of another, and we be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bodye of Ieſu Chriſte, who is the head. Lyke as there is no one part in our carnal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that is hurt, but that all the reſt of the members feele ſmart by the ſame: Euen ſo ought we to haue compaſſion one vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, when he is in trouble, and ſuffereth any ſorowe: and our neyghbours buſines ought no leſſe to be oures, then our owne. This is to be mery with them that be mery, &amp; to ſorowe with them that ſorowe, and to be diſpoſed with the ſelfe ſame mynde one towardes another. Theſe two frutes be at large ſet forth of S. Auguſtin, who ſaid: The faithfull do nowe knowe
<pb facs="tcp:18974:19"/>
this to be the bodi of Chriſt, not to deſpiſe to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Chriſt. They become the body of Chriſt yf they wyll lyue by the ſpirite of Chriſt: of the ſpirite of Chriſt lyueth nothyng but the body of Chriſt. Vnderſtande this bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thou art a man and haſt a ſpirit and a body: thy ſpirite is inuiſible, thy body viſible. Tell me what lyueth? liueth the ſpirite by the bodye, or the bodye through the ſpirite? The bodye to conclude lyueth by the ſpirite. Wylt thou ti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ words">

               </gap> by the ſpirit of Chriſt, become Chriſtes body. Tell me, liueth my body by the vertue of thy ſpirite? my body liueth by his owne ſpirite, and thy body by the vertue of thy owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. The bodye of Chryſte can not lyue but by the ſpirite of
<pb facs="tcp:18974:19"/>
Chriſt. Therfore Saint Paule makynge manifeſt this breade, ſayde: we be one bread and one bodye. O Sacrament of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, O ſigne of vnitie, O knot of charitie. What oration either of Demoſthenes, or yet of Marcus Cicero, or of any other famous wryter, coulde ſtirre vp or moue more vehementlye to the loue of our neighbour, than this ſacrament moueth? What prouocation can be more lyuely and ſenſible then this? Let all the Oratoures of the worlde come forth and perſwade vs to the loue of oure neyghboure with theyr polyſhed Orations: Let them vſe all the coloures of Khethoricke and all theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, they ſhall neuer brynge ſuche a perſwaſion as this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth preache.</p>

O how much hath the Chriſtian profyted in this ſacrament, yf he be moued &amp; ſtirred with a wyl to ſerue his neyghbour. Not without cauſe than dyd S. Auguſtine name this Supper a Sacrament of Godlyneſſe, a ſigne of vnitie, and the bonde of charitie. For as this Sacrament is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meate, and ſwete to thoſe that be incorporate with Ieſu Chriſte, and with their neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Euen ſo of the contrary, it is a mortal poyſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che put not their whole truſt in Ieſu Chriſte, &amp; be ſeperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their neighbour. The naturall meat whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in findeth a body full of naughtye humours, turneth to poiſon, corrupteth &amp; hurteth:
<pb facs="tcp:18974:21"/>
Euen ſo doeth the ſpirituall meate yf it fynde the ſoule vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfull, it dryueth it to vtter ouerthrowes, becauſe that to an vnfaythfull manne, euery<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thyng is vnfaythfull and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>Therfore ſayth Paule: he that <note place="margin">1. Cor. xi.</note> eateth and drynketh vnworthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, is worthy blame, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a betrayer of the Lorde: ſuch one as this doth eate and drynk his owne iudgment, not iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the body of the Lorde. By which place I vnderſtande that it is all one, not to iudge the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of the Lorde- and to eate it vnworthelye. Wherefore they which lacke faith, &amp; be voyde of charitie, without all religion, and lyke hogges caſte in them ſelues to this Supper: ſuch as theſe make no difference of the
<pb facs="tcp:18974:21"/>
Lordes Supper. Therefore ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng they beleue not, that that body is theyr lyfe, whenſoeuer they do preſent them ſelues in the Church to receaue this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: they do blaſpheme, &amp; do greate iniurye to the body of Chriſt, they ſpoyle it of all dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and receauyng it after this ſorte, they be falſe betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of theyr Lord. Euen ſo theſe that be in diſcorde with theyr neyghbours, the whiche do ſo hate them that they can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde the ſyght of them, whan they do come together in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to celebrate the holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and to ſhewe that they be knytte together with theyr bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the bande of charitie: ſuch do blaſpheme God, deuide the miſtical bodi of Ieſu Chriſt, and teare in ſunder the holye
<pb facs="tcp:18974:22"/>
Churche by peece and peece, Therefore worthely are they to be blamed, &amp; be betrayers of the body of Chryſt. I ſay not onely that they bee betrayers of the Churche, whiche is the miſtical bodye of Chryſte: But I ſaye they be betraiers of theyr Lord, no leſſe then Iudas and the Iewes whiche crucified hym. Eatyng after thys ſort, vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely, thei do receaue their own damynation, for vſynge thys Sacrament without fayth as the hypocrites do, they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that with theyr mouth, whiche they beleue not in their harte. And to be preſent at thys table, is no other thinge but an abiuration whiche is done in euery falſe religion. It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that we beleue to bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued onely by the death of Ieſu
<pb facs="tcp:18974:22"/>
Chryſte. The hypocrite then doth condemne hym ſelfe, doth pronounce ſentence in hys owne condemnation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh the anger of GOD vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hys owne head. When a man doth not putte hys whole confydence in Chriſt, he can not loue hys neyghbour with that Chriſtian loue wherewith thys Sacrament doth bynde hym. Then a wycked perſon is cutte of from his neyghbours, and ſo he hath no parte at all in the Churche, nor yet maye vſe thys Sacrament, but faynedly.

Thys is that preparation the which he ought to haue, that myndeth to eate the ſupper of the Lorde.

This is the wyl of my father that hath ſente me, that I ſhoulde not loſe one of thoſe that he hath geuen me: that euerye one that ſeeth the ſonne, &amp; beleueth in him, maye haue lyfe euerlaſtynge.

glorious with Ieſu Chriſte. I praye and beſech you brethren, that euery one of you conſider with deepe conſideration, this fact of humilitie of our Lord, to the ende that we ſhoulde know that he came to this extreme baſeneſſe to eralt vs. What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were they (O ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) whoſe feete thou waſhed? it was theyrs who betrayed thee, denyed thee, forſoke thee in thy daunger, fled away when thou ſtodeſt in moſte nede of them.</p>
            <p>Wherfore we ought to conſider in this waſhynge of feete, the marueylous humilitie of oure maſter, and the feruent loue he bare towardes his enemies.

For if any do hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble them ſelues after this ſorte, as to be content with ſo meane an office as to waſhe the feete of Saintes, &amp; to ſerue ſuch as haue ſores and infirmities: this is an euidente ſigne of a loue that is vnfayned. He came vnto Peter, &amp; Peter ſayd: Lorde ſhalt thou waſhe my feet, Ieſus aunſwered and ſaid: What I do thou knoweſte not, but thou ſhalt know hereafter. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Peter beyng conſidered
<pb facs="tcp:18974:27"/>
as they be in apparent, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare great modeſtie, whiche in the worlde is worthy of prayſe. Yt is a ſigne of ciuilitie not to ſuffer without great nede to be ſerued of a mans better. But Chriſt in this that he dyd, hadde occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherfore he willed that Peter ſhould beare that ſeruice, although it were baſe. Therfore ſayd Chriſte, thou ſhalte knowe hereafter Peter why I do this. At this aunſwere ought Peter to haue ſubmitted hym ſelfe, &amp; ſuffered his feete to be waſhed, &amp; to haue declared a ciuill wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Therfore it may be ſayd, that in Peter doth appeare the ſuperſtitious hypocriſie of our carnall nature. Peter made a conſcience, and feared to declare ſo ſmal reuerence to his maſter, to ſuffer him to waſhe his feete.
<pb facs="tcp:18974:28"/>
But after forgettyng all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, treadyng vnderfeet both the loue and reuerence to his deare maſter, with an othe forſoke hym when he ought to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Chryſt hath ſaide: he that wyll not confeſſe me before men I wyll not confeſſe him in <note place="margin">ath. 10.</note> the preſence of my father. Peter made ſmal accompt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of God, denyed his maſter, makyng lytle conſcience to ſwere falſely, with <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>te ſhame and ignominie to Ieſu Chriſt: yet he after made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and thought it ſinne to ſuffer his maſter to waſſhe his feete. Thus doth our naturall hipocriſie: it reuerenceth Chriſt and wyll honour hym where is no nede: And agaynſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement he wyll after make ſmall accompt of that true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

wherwith god wyl be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and worſhipped.

               </gap>nſwere, we ſhall fynde Peter a great blaſphemer. The maſter had ſayde before to his diſciples, that it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe that he waſſhed theyr feete. Therfore Peter being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, &amp; reſiſting that he ſhuld not waſhe his feete at all, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſelfe to be wiſer then his maſter. And the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath this vnderſtandynge.
<pb facs="tcp:18974:29"/>
Albeit thou art my maſter, yet for all that thou ſhalte pardon me: for in this doyng thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareu thy ſelfe to haue ſmal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience touching wordly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. I know by experience it is not decent the ſeruaunt woulde be ſerued of his maſter: ſo that thy fact maſter doth gayneſaye the polytyke order of the world. And this that I do is done poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikely. In Peter is declared a zele of the honour of God: but this deuotion was not grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the word of God. Lette vs ſee what aunſwere the wiſdome of God doth make to Peter. If I ſhall not waſſhe thy feete, thou ſhalt haue no parte with me.</p>
            <p>Chriſt contendeth not with Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for that he ſhuld not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and wyſe in his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite. What ſhall we ſaye to the
<pb facs="tcp:18974:29"/>
aunſwere of our Lord? ah is it ſo great a matter to waſhe feet? was not Iudas feete waſſhed? yet he had no part with Chriſt: it is verye true his feete were waſhed, but not after that ſorte as Chriſt doth heare declare in this Goſpell.</p>
            <p>The aunſwere of Chriſt is this. Peter hath not wel vnderſtand my office, nor yet vnderſtandeth not home nedeful my ſeruyce is to all the whole worlde. O thou fantaſtical man, why doeſt thou beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am a Meſſias, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall king, a monarche of all the worlde, to whom all nations ſhould be ſubiect, thou thinkeſt to ſerue this Meſſias, but Peter thou arte deceaued. For if I do not fyrſt ſerue thee, thou ſhalte neuer ſerue me: yf I do not fyrſt ſaue thee, thou ſhalt neuer come to be ſaued, if I do not fyrſt ſhed
<pb facs="tcp:18974:30"/>
my bloud for thee, yf I do not firſt waſh thy ſinnes, thou ſhalt neuer be ſaued, nor yet haue ani porcion with me. Theſe wordes of Ieſu Chriſt, yf I waſhe not thy fete, thou ſhalt haue no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with me: Albeit they bee few, and appeare ſimply, yet for al that, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider them depe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhall fynde that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all falſe and cloked religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Although there bee many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the Iewes, which lyue honeſtly, yet for all that they be not ſaued in the bloud of chriſt, nor yet haue they no part with him. The Turkes albeit they ſay they ſerue god aboue, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they haue the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſhewe with outwarde ceremonies, a cloked holynes: yet they obtayne not remiſſion of their ſinnes, becauſe they be not waſhed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of Chriſt.
<pb facs="tcp:18974:30"/>
Our hipocrites although they doe manye good workes, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thynke to be waſhed in theyr owne merites, and not in the bloud of Chriſt: Therfore ſuch hipocrites haue no portion with Chriſt at al. But let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to Peter who ſaid: O lord not only my fete, but my hands and head alſo. At the firſt Peter was very obſtinate, and would not ſuffer hys maſter to waſhe his fete, but now he would haue him to doe more then was fyrſt commaunded. The ſelfe ſame thinge we ſe nowe to be done in many, who when they perceaue the ſeueritie of the law, and the bonde which we are bounde in, they do as Peter dyd, they wyll not only obſerue the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of god, but they finde of theyr owne workes beſydes the worde of God. Therefore they
<pb facs="tcp:18974:31"/>
thinke to merite remiſſion of ſin nes. partly by the merite of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu Chriſt, and partly by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of their owne worke. Such be lyke Peter, for they wyll not only do that that god commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, but thei wil of their owne heades finde out other merites, wherby to deſerue lyfe euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge. Peter not walkyng in the kinges high way, Ieſus ſaid vn to hym: he that is waſhed, hath no nede to waſhe any parte, but his fete, and than he is al clene. Our maſter reproued the vnſkil fulnes of Peter by the common cuſtome of theſe dayes. For ſuch as be waſhed in a bathe, when thei go forth, they ſet their feete vpon the ground: And nede not after to waſhe anye thynge but theyr feete. When any was byd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to feaſt to the Iewes, it was onely nedeful to waſhe the fete,
<pb facs="tcp:18974:31"/>
becauſe they vſed to eate vppon beddes: As nowe emongeſt vs, when any is bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to feaſt, it is only nedeful to waſh theyr han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, for all elles is cleane. But Chriſt by this matter wyl in<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

All they whiche by fayth be made cleane &amp; pure, all ſuch be al wholy clenſed in Ieſu Chryſt, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the purenes &amp; holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Ieſu Chriſt. There is no damnation to thoſe that be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in Ieſu Chryſt: with all this therfore is iuſtified the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp; yet hath he his feete mye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the which continually haue nede to be clenſed.</p>
            <p>The feete be the carnal deſires and the remanentes of the olde man, the which ought continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be chaſtened and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb facs="tcp:18974:32"/>
The Chriſtian in Chryſte is wholy cleane: but in him ſelf he hys filthy, foule, &amp; ful of carnal deſires. And although he is not therfore condemned, yet he hath ſinnes, the which were nedeful to bee waſhed awaye: whyleſt therefore we lyue in this myery lyfe, we haue nede to haue oure feete waſhed. That is, to walke in the ſpirite, &amp; not in the fleſhe, becauſe a Chriſtian oughte to ſerue with his mynde the lawe of god, therfore ought he to take good hede not to ſerue the lawe of ſinne. When our maſter had waſhed hys Diſciples feete, he toke agayne his garmentes, ſat him down, and ſaid vnto them: you call me maſter and lorde, ſo ſay you well, for ſo I am. If I then beinge lorde &amp; maſter haue waſhed your fete, you ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to waſhe one anothers feete,
<pb facs="tcp:18974:32"/>
becauſe I haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that as I haue done eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo do ye. The lord hath now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe that moued hym to take in hand ſo meane an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe in the world. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did thinke that Ieſus chriſt ought to be the worldly meſſias that was loked for of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, that ſhoulde be a kinge and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narche of the whole world. Our Lorde had often preached vnto them, that hys kyngdome was ſpirituall and not terreſtriall, &amp; that they ſhould not ſet their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie beneth in the earth. For to confirme therfore the trueth of this his prechyng, he did this baſe and meane offyce to waſhe his diſciples feete. And our lord deferred this fact vntill his laſt ſupper, for that hys doctryne ſhould be more freſhe in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in our mindes, being done at
<pb facs="tcp:18974:33"/>
a tyme moſte worthy of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, I haue geuen you an example that you ſhoulde do as you haue ſeene me to doe: you thynke that I am come into this world to enioye an earthly kyngdome, you receaue youre ſelues. Therefore caſte of from you al felicitie that the worlde can promyſe you, take example by me that am made your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt. Thus followe my pathe and foteſteppes, be ſeruauntes of all men, but be faythfull. This onely ſayeth Paule is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the miniſters of the goſpel, that they be faythfull in their doctryne: none then ſhall glory in man, we ſhal onely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Ieſu Chryſt who is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true fode of our ſoules. To whom be honour, power and glory for euer and euer.</p>
