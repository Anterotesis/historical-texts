            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL great Errours have ever
been intermingled with some
Truth. And indeed, if Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
should appeare alone
unto the world in her owne
true Shape and native Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
she would be so blacke
and horrid, that no man
would looke upon her; and
therefore she hath alwayes had an Art to wrap her
selfe up in a Garment of Light, by which meanes
she passes freely disguised and undiscerned. This
was elegantly signified in the Fable thus; Truth at
first presented her selfe to the world, and went about
to seeke enter ainment, but when she found none,
being of a Generous nature, that loves not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50941:4"/>
her selfe upon unworthy spirits, she resolved to
leave earth, and take her flight for Heaven, but as she
was going up, she chanced, <hi>Eliah</hi>-like, to let her Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
fall, and Falshood waiting by for such an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
snatch'd it up presently, and ever since goes
about disguised in Truths attire.</p>
            <p>Pure Falshood is pure Non-Entity, and could not
subsist alone by it self, wherfore it alway twines up
together about some Truth <gap reason="foreign">

the Christian Philosopher speakes, like an Ivy
that growes upon some Wall, twining her selfe into
it with wanton and flattering embraces, till it have at
length destroyed and pul'd downe that which held
it up. There is alway some Truth which gives Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to every Errour: <hi>Est quaedam Veritatis Anima, quae
Corpus omnium Errorum agitat &amp; informat:</hi> There is
ever some Soule of Truth, which doth secretly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Enliven the dead and unweildy Lump of all
Errours, without which it could not move or stirre.</p>
            <p>Though somtimes it would require a very curious
Artist, in the midst of all Errours Deformities, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scry
the defaced lineaments of that Truth which first
it did resemble:<note place="margin">Lib. De Iside &amp; Osiride.</note> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> spake sometime of those
Aegyptian Fables of <hi>Isis</hi> and <hi>Osiris,</hi> that they had

               </gap>, some notable Diviner
to discover them.</p>
            <p>And this I thinke is the case of that Grand Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the Papists, concerning <hi>the Lords Supper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Sacrifice:</hi> which perhaps at first did rise by
Degeneration from a Primitive Truth, whereof the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50941:4"/>
very Obliquity of this Errour yet may beare some
dark and obscure intimation. Which wil best appear
when we have first discovered the <hi>True Notion of the
Lords Supper,</hi> whence we shall be able at once to
convince the Errour of this Popish Tenet, and
withall to give a just account of the first Rise of it:</p>

               <p>THe Right <hi>Notion</hi> of that Christian Feast cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>The Lords Supper,</hi> in which we eate and
drinke the Body and Bloud of Christ, that was
once offered up in Sacrifice to God for us; is to be
derived (if I mistake not) from Analogy to that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Rite amongst the Jewes of <hi>Feasting upon things
Sacrificed,</hi> and eating of those things which they had
offered up to God.</p>
               <p>For the better conceiving whereof, we must first
consider a little, how many kinds of Jewish Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there were, and the Nature of them. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they are very well divided, according to the
received opinion, into foure, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
The Burnt-offering, the Sinne-offering,
the Trespasse-offering, and the Peace-offering. Yet
perhaps I may make a more Notionall Division of
them, for our use, into these three <hi>species.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, such as were wholly offered up to <hi>God,</hi> and
burnt upon the Altar, which were the <hi>Holocausts,</hi>
or <hi>Burnt-offerings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, such wherein besides something offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50941:5"/>
up to <hi>God</hi> upon the Altar, the <hi>Priests</hi> had also a
part to eate of. And these are subdivided into the
<hi>Sinne-offerings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">* Concerning the difference betweene these two, see <hi>Petite</hi> in his <hi>Variae Lectiones.</hi>
                  </note> and the <hi>Trespasse-offerings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, such, as in which, besides Something
offered up to <hi>God,</hi> and a Portion bestowed on the
<hi>Priests,</hi> The <hi>Owners</hi> themselves had a share likewise:
and these were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi>
which contained in them, as the Jewish Doctors
speak, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Portion
for <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Priests,</hi> and the <hi>Owners</hi> also; and
thence they use to give the Etymon of the Hebrew
word <hi>Shelamim</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these Sacrifices brought Peace to the Altar,
the Priests, and the Owners, in that every one of
these had a share in them.</p>
               <p>Now for the first of these, although (perhaps to
signifie some speciall Mystery concerning Christ)
they were themselves wholly offered up to God, and
burnt upon the Altar; yet they had ever Peace-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
regularly annexed to them when they were
not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Offerings for the whole Congregation,</hi>
but for any particular persons, that so the Owners
might at the same time when they offered up to
God, feast also upon the Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>And for the second, although the Owners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
did not eate of them, the reason whereof was,
because they were not perfectly reconciled to God,
being for the present in a state of guilt, which they
made atonement for in these Sacrifices, yet they did
it by the Priests who were their Mediators unto God,
and as their Proxies, did eate of the Sacrifices for
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50941:5"/>But in the Peace-offerings, because such as
brought them had no uncleannesse upon them,
(<hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 20.) and so were perfectly reconciled to
God, and in covenant with him; therefore they
were in their owne persons to eate of those Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which they had offered unto God, as a Federall
Rite betweene God and them, which we shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>So then, the Eating of the Sacrifices, was a due
and proper <hi>appendix</hi> unto all Sacrifices, one way or
other, and either by the Priests, or themselves, when
the person that offered was capable thereof. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we shall find in the Scripture, that Eating of the
Sacrifices, is brought in continually as a Rite belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to Sacrifice in generall, Which we will now
shew in divers instances. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 15. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the Jewes, that when they came into the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they should destroy the Altars, and
Images, and all the Monuments of Idolatry among
those Heathens, giving the reason thus. <hi>Lest thou
make a Covenant with the Inhabitants of the Land,
and they goe a whoring after their Gods, and doe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
unto their Gods, and one call thee, and thou EATE
of their Sacrifice:</hi> Which indeed afterward came
thus to passe, <hi>Numb. 25. 2. They called the people to
the Sacrifice of their Gods, and the people did EATE,
and bow downe to their Gods;</hi> or as it is cited in <hi>Psal.</hi>
106. <hi>they joyned themselves unto</hi> Baal-peor, <hi>and ATE
the Sacrifice of the dead.</hi> When <hi>Iethro, Mose's</hi> Father
in Law came to him, <hi>Exod. 18. 12. He tooke a Burnt-offering
and Sacrifices for God, and</hi> Aaron <hi>came, and
all the Elders of Israel TO EATE BREAD be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50941:6"/>
the Lord;</hi> by Sacrifices there, are meant Peace-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
as <hi>Aben-Ezra,</hi> and the <hi>Targum,</hi> well expound it,
which we said before were regularly joyned with
Burnt-offerings: So <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. When the Israelites
worshipped the golden Calfe, the Text saith that
<hi>Aaron built an Altar before it, and made a Proclamation,
saying, To morrow is a FEAST unto the Lord,</hi> (see
how the Altar and the Feast were a kinne to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other)
<hi>And they rose up early in the morning, and
brought Burnt-offerings and offered Peace-offerings, and
the people SATE DOWNE TO EATE AND
DRINKE.</hi> Which passage Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes use

                  <hi>The first of</hi> Sam. 1. <hi>It is said of</hi> Elkanah, that he

Domus Accubitus, A house of feasting, <hi>because feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and sacrificing were such generall Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of one another. So againe in the 16. Chap.</hi>
Samuel <hi>went to</hi> Bethlehem <hi>to anoint</hi> David: I am come
(<hi>saith he</hi>) to sacrifice to the Lord, sanctifie your selves,
and come with me to the Sacrifice; <hi>but when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that</hi> Iesse's <hi>youngest sonne was absent, he
saith to</hi> Iesse, Send and fetch him, for we will not SIT
DOWNE untill he come. <hi>So I understand that of
the Sichemites, according to the judgement of the
Jewish Doctors,</hi> Iudg. 9. They went into the house of
their God, and did EATE and DRINKE, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Abimelech; <hi>that is, they went into the house of
their God to Sacrifice, and did eate and drinke of
the Sacrifice: which perhaps was the reason of the
name by which they called their God, whom they
thus worshipped, BERITH, which signifies a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
because they worshiped him by this Federall
Rite of eating of his Sacrifices, of which more
hereafter. Thus likewise the Hebrew Scholiasts
expound that in the 16. Chapter of the same Booke
Verse 23. concerning the Philistims when they had
put out</hi> Sampsons eyes. They met together to offer a
great Sacrifice unto Dagon their God, and <hi>TO RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IOYCE,
that is, in Feasting upon the Sacrifices.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50941:7"/>Hence it is that the Idolatry of the Jewes in
worshipping other Gods, is so often described syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecdochically
under the Notion of Feasting. <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 7.

laid themselves downe to eate of the Sacrifice that
was offered on the Altar. And in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 11. Eating
upon the Mountaines seemes to be put for Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
upon the Mountaines, because it was a constant
appendix to it. <hi>He that hath not done any of these
things, but hath even EATEN upon the Mountaines,</hi>

                  <hi>i. e.</hi> Hath worshipped Idols
upon the Mountaines, so the <hi>Targum</hi> renders it. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes Eating of the Sacrifice a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Appendix of the Altar, <hi>Heb. 12. We have an
Altar, whereof they have no right</hi> TO EATE
<hi>that serve the Tabernacle.</hi> I will observe this one
thing more, because it is not commonly understood,
that all the while the Jewes were in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
they were to Eare no meate at all at their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Tables, but that whereof they had first sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to God at the Tabernacle. For this is clearely
the meaning of that place, <hi>Levit. 17. verse</hi> 4, 5.
<hi>Whatsoever man there be in the house of Israel that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

to him.</hi> And so <hi>Nachmanides</hi> there glosses according
to the mind of the Ancient Rabbines,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>i. e. Behold
God commanded at first that all which the Israelites did
Eate should be Peace-offerings.</hi> Which command was
afterward dispensed with, when they came into the
land, and their dwellings were become remote from
the Tabernacle, so that they could not come up eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day to sacrifice; <hi>Deut. 12. 20, 21. If the place
which the Lord thy God hath chosen, be too farre from
thee, then thou shalt kill of the Heard and of the Flock,
and thou shalt eate within thy gates whatsoever thy soule
lusteth after.</hi> Onely now there were instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
three constant and set times appointed in the
yeare, in which every male was to come up and See
God at his Tabernacle, and eate and drinke before
him: and the Sacrifice that was then offered, was
wont to be called by them <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But otherwise if there were any thing yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
it belonged to the Priests, as we learne from

                  <hi>i. e. It was an ancient Law among the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that the Priests should have the remainder.</hi> Which
is not onely to be understood of the skinne and such
like parts, but of the flesh of the Sacrifice it selfe, as
we learne from Saint <hi>Austine</hi> in his exposition upon
Rom. 2. who tels us also that these reliques were
sometimes sold for them in the Market, whence
that speech of <hi>Paul, 1 Corin. 10. Whatsoever is sold
in the shambles, Eate, asking no question for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will shut up all, with this one observation more,
that as we said of the Jewes, that in the Wildernesse
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50941:10"/>
they did eate no meate, but of that which they had
first sacrificed: In like manner the Heathens were
wont to Sacrifice before all their Feasts: Whence
it is that <hi>Athenaeus</hi> observes, Feasts among the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Heathens were ever accounted Sacred and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
things. And thus we must understand that
speech of <hi>Paul</hi> in the 27. verse of the forenamed
Chapter. <hi>If any one that beleeves not, invite you, and
you be disposed to goe, whatsoever is set before you, eate,
asking no question for conscience sake.</hi> Nay, it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a prophane thing amongst them, to eate any
meate at their private tables, whereof they had not
first Sacrificed to the Gods, as appeareth by that
Greeke Proverb, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, used by <hi>Anacreon,</hi> and
others, as a Brand of a notorious wicked man, <hi>viz.
one that would eate meate whereof hee had not sacrificed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now having thus shewne, that both amongst
the <hi>Iewes</hi> under the Law, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their
Pagan worship, (for <hi>Paganisme</hi> is nothing but <hi>Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme
degenerate</hi>) it was ever a Solemne Rite, to joyne
<hi>Feasting</hi> with <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> and to <hi>EATE of
those things which had beene offered up;</hi> The very
Concinnity and Harmony of the thing it selfe,
leads me to conceive, that that Christian Feast under
the Gospel, called <hi>THE LORDS SUPPER,</hi> is the
very same thing, and bears the same <hi>Notion,</hi> in respect
of the true <hi>Christian Sacrifice</hi> of Christ upon the
Crosse, that those did to the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Heathenish
Sacrifices:</hi> and so is <hi>EPULUM SACRIFICIALE,
a Sacrificiall Feast,</hi> I meane, a Feast upon Sacrifice;
or <hi>EPULUM EX OBLATIS,</hi> A Feast <hi>upon
things offered</hi> up to God. Onely this difference ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50941:11"/>
in the Parallel, that because those <hi>Legall Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
were but Types and Shadowes of the true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Sacrifice,</hi> they were often repeated and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as well as the <hi>Feasts</hi> which were made upon
them: But now the True <hi>Christian Sacrifice</hi> being
come, and offered up once for all, never to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
we have therefore no more Typicall <hi>Sacrifices</hi>
left amongst us, but onely the <hi>Feasts upon the True
Sacrifice</hi> still Symbolically continued, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
in reference to that ONE GREAT SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRIFICE,
which is alwayes as present in Gods
sight, and efficacious, as if it were but now offered
up for us.</p>

<hi>the true Notion</hi> of the Lords Supper is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

being the common opinion of Divines, that the
Jewes had but two <hi>Sacraments,</hi> viz. <hi>Circumcision</hi> and
the <hi>Passeover,</hi> that answer to those two amongst us,
<hi>Baptisme,</hi> and <hi>The Lords Supper:</hi> But the <hi>Iewish Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi>
had no relation to a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> being nothing
else but a meere <hi>FEAST,</hi> and therefore from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy

a Feast upon Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I answer, First, That I know not

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50941:11"/>
imposed upon us by some, that the Jewes had
but two <hi>Sacraments, Circumcision</hi> and the <hi>Passeover,</hi>

that the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> must <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, answer
only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the <hi>Iewish Passeover;</hi> Sure I am, the Jewes had
many more, for not to instance in that of <hi>Paul, Our
Fathers were all BAPTIZED unto Moses in the
Cloud, and in the Sea,</hi> like our Christian Baptisme;
<hi>And did all EATE the same Spirituall Meate,</hi> (viz.

<hi>Lords Supper:</hi> Nor to Examine all the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
Ceremonies which they had, that were
almost as many <hi>Sacraments</hi> as <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> These
<hi>Feasts upon the Sacrifices,</hi> which we have all this while

               </p>
               <p>But secondly, I will grant that the Jewish <hi>Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi>
hath a speciall resemblance to the Christian
<hi>LORDS SUPPER,</hi> although upon other grounds;
For I say undoubtedly, the <hi>Passeover</hi> was a <hi>true and
proper Sacrifice,</hi> and therefore the Pascall-Feast, a
<hi>Feast upon a Sacrifice;</hi> So that this shall still advance
and improve our former <hi>Notion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better conceiving whereof, we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that besides those foure Generall kinds of
Sacrifices among the Jewes before mentioned, The
<hi>Burnt-offering,</hi> The <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> The <hi>Trespasse-offering,</hi>
and the <hi>Peace-offfering;</hi> there were some other <hi>Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
kind</hi> of Sacrifices, as the Masters tell us, viz. these
three, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> The <hi>Firstlings of Cattle,</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50941:12"/>
the <hi>Tenth,</hi> and the <hi>Passeover;</hi> And the reason why
these in the Distribution of Sacrifices, are thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
by them from all the other Generall kind
of Sacrifices, is thus given by the famous <hi>Maymoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
upon the <hi>Misna</hi> of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> in <hi>Massecheth Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bachim,</hi>
the sixth Chap. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
<hi>Because those foure fourenamed, were such
kind of Sacrifices as that a private person was often
bound to each of them in severall cases, and the whole
Congregation in severall seasons, but these three were
not of that nature, being peculiarly restrained to some one
case or season.</hi> Now, these three kind of <hi>Peculiar
Sacrifices,</hi> were in their nature, all neerest of kinne to
the <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> and are therefore called by the
Jewish Doctors, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>like to Peace-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,</hi>
because they were not onely killed in the same
place, being all <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Light Holy things,</hi>
and had the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>inward parts</hi> thereof to be
burnt likewise upon the Altar; but also in that part of
them was to be <hi>eaten by the Owners.</hi> In so much that
the Talmudists put many cases, in which a Lamb
that was set apart for a <hi>Passeover,</hi> and could not be
offered in that Notion, was to be turned into a <hi>Peace-offering,</hi>
as that which was neere of kinne to it.</p>
               <p>But yet these Masters tell us, there were three
precise differences betweene the <hi>Pascah,</hi> and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<hi>Peace-offering:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
First, in that there was no <hi>laying on of hands</hi>
upon the <hi>Passeover</hi> in the killing of it, for this was no
where commanded as in all the <hi>Peace-offerings;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50941:12"/>
that there was no <hi>Mincah,</hi> or Meat-offering,
nor <hi>Libamen,</hi> or Drink-offering to be joyned with it,
(for so they use to include both in the word <hi>Nesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim)</hi>
Thirdly, that there was no <hi>waving of the Brest
&amp; Shoulder</hi> for the Priests Portion; the reason wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was, because the Priests were bound alwayes to
have Passeover-offerings of their owne, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<hi>Ezra</hi> 6. and so needed not any <hi>Wave-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that the <hi>Passeovers</hi> were in other respects, of
the same nature with the <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
true and proper Sacrifices; because it is a thing
generally not so well understood, and therefore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by divers, I shall labour the more fully to
convince it. I say, That the <hi>Passeovers</hi> were alwayes
brought to the Tabernacle or the Temple, and
there presented and offered up to God by the Priest,
as all Sacrifices were: That the bloud of them was
there sprinkled upon the Altar, of which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Doctors well observe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>the very Essence of a Sacrifice, is in the sprinkling of
the bloud:</hi> and also that the Imurim (as they call
them) that is, the Fat and Kidnies were burnt upon
the Altar; All this I shall endeavour to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
               <p>Onely first I must premise this, that when I say
the <hi>Passeover</hi> was brought to the Tabernacle, and
offered by the Priests, I doe not meane that the
Priests were alwayes bound to kill the Passeovers:
For I grant that the people were wont to kill their
owne Passeovers, and so I find it expressely, in the
<hi>Misna</hi> of the <hi>Talmud. Massech. Zebach. Cap.</hi> 5. §. 6.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50941:13"/>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>All Israel killed the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
and the Priests received the bloud:</hi> Which <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudicall</hi>
Expression alludes to that place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6.
<hi>The whole assembly of the Congregation of Israel shall
kill it in the Evening:</hi> Where this seemes to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by God. And the Practice consonant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
I finde intimated at least, in Scripture, in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi>
Passeover, 2 <hi>Chron. 30. 17. There were many
in the Congregation that were not sanctified, therefore
the Levites had the charge of killing the Passeover for
every one that was not cleane to sanctifie it unto the
Lord:</hi> Where <hi>R. Solomon</hi> writeth thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
<hi>Wonder not why the
Owners themselves did not kill them, for it followeth
that many in the Congregation had not sanctified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
therefore the Levites were appointed in their
place to sanctifie the Worke unto the Lord.</hi> And <hi>R. D.
Kimchy</hi> to the same purpose: <hi>Though many of them
did eate the Passeover in uncleannesse, it being a case of
necessity, in that they had no time to purifie themselves,
yet for them to come into the Court and kill the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs,
this was not needfull, when it might be done as well
by the Levites.</hi> And therefore the same is to be
thought likewise of the Priests and Levites killing
the Passeover, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6. because the people returning
newly from Captivity, were not yet purified, as it
is there also partly intimated.</p>
               <p>But this doth not at all hinder our proceeding,
or evince the <hi>Passeover</hi> not to be a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> For it
is a great Mistake in most of our learned Writers, to
thinke that the killing of every Sacrifice was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the Priest, whereas indeed there was no such
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50941:13"/>
matter, but as we have already granted that the
people commonly killed their owne Passeovers, so
we will affirme, that they did the same concerning
any of the other Sacrifices. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 4, 5. It is said
concerning the <hi>Burnt-offering: If any man bring a
Burnt-offering to the Lord, he shall lay his hand upon
the head of the Burnt-offering, AND HE SHALL
KILL the Bullock before the Lord, and the Priests
Aarons sonnes shall take the bloud:</hi> So concerning
the <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>HE shall lay his hand on
the head of his offering, and KILL it at the doore of
the Tabernacle of the Congregation:</hi> And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Sinne-offering,</hi> Chap. 4. 24. <hi>HE shall lay his
hand on the head of the beast, and KILL it at the
place, where they kill the Burnt-offering before the Lord.</hi>
We see then what incompetent Judges our owne
Authors are, in Jewish Customes and Antiquities.
The Jewish Doctors and Antiquaries, (which are
so much contemned by some of our Magisteriall
Dictators in all Learning) would have taught us
here another Lesson. For thus <hi>Maimonides,</hi> in <hi>Biath
Hammik.</hi> speaks to this point, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
that is, <hi>The
killing of the Holy things may lawfully be done by
strangers, yea of the most holy things, whether they be
the Holy things of a private person, or of the whole
Congregation:</hi> as it is said, (<hi>Levit.</hi> 1.) <hi>And He shall kill
the Bullock; &amp; the Priests Aarons sons shal take the bloud.</hi>
The same is avouched againe afterward by the same
Author in <hi>Maaseh Korban.</hi> Chap. 5. But if any one
would therefore faine know what were properly the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50941:14"/>
Priests actions about the Sacrifice, which might not
be done lawfully by any stranger; the same Jewish
Authours have a Trite Rule amongst them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the blood and the other parts that were to be
offered up, and all that followeth after that, belongeth
to the Priests office.</hi> And <hi>Isaak Abrabanel</hi> will teach
us more particularly, in his Comment on <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
that there were five things to be done by the
Owners of the Sacrifice that brought it, and Five,
things by the Priest that offered it; the first Five,
were Laying on of hands, Killing, Flaying, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up, and Washing of the inwards; the other
Five were, the Receiving of the blood in a Vessell,
the Sprinkling of it upon the Altar, the Putting<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Of this</hi> vide Magistrorum Placita.</note>
of fire upon the Altar, the Ordering of the wood
upon the fire, and the Ordering of the pieces upon
the wood. Hence it is, that upon the forequoted
place of the <hi>Misna,</hi> which I brought to shew, that
the People did kill the Passeovers, <hi>Rabbi Obadiah of
Bartenora</hi> thus glosseth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>i. e.
The people of Israel might all kill the Passeovers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
if they pleased, because the KILLING
OF ANY SACRIFICE might be done law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
by strangers, but the Priests Received the blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I come to prove what I have undertaken.
And first, That the Passeover was alwayes brought
to the Tabernacle or the Temple, and there offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto God as the other Sacrifices were, is cleare
enough, from <hi>Deut. 16. Thou shalt not Sacrifice the
Passeover within any of the gates which the Lord thy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50941:14"/>
God giveth thee, but at the place which the Lord thy
God chuseth to place his Name there, there thou shalt sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi>
And that this is to be understood, not of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
in generall, but of the Tabernacle or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
appeares, both because the same expressions
are used of the other Sacrifices, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. ver. 5, 6.
11. 14, Where it is clearely meant that they were
to be brought to the Temple: And because it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that every thing that was killed amongst the
Jewes, was either to be killed at the doore of the
Tabernacle of the Congregation, or else might be
killed indifferently in any part of the whole Land.
Let us now see how the Jewish Doctors Comment

Court, as the rest of the Holy things, yea in the time
when High-places were permitted, they sacrificed not the
Passeover in a private High-place, for it is said (Deut.
16.) Thou mayst not sacrifice the Passeover in any of
thy gates: We have learnt, that this is a Prohibition to
kill the Passeover in any private High-place, although
it be in a time when High-places are permitted.</hi> From
which excellent glosse of theirs, it appeareth that
there was more precisenesse to be observed in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Passeover to the place where Gods name
was put, and offering of it at the Tabernacle, or
the Temple, then of any of the other Sacrifices.
And this was the reason as was before intimated
out of <hi>KIMCHI,</hi> why in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Passeover
the Levites had the charge of killing: because the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50941:15"/>
Passeovers were to be killed in the Court of the
Temple, whither the people being uncleane could
not enter; for otherwise if it had beene done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Court, they might as well have killed their
owne Passeovers as have eaten them. And this
may be further confirmed, in that the Passeover is
called a <hi>Korban: Numb. 9. 7. When certaine men
were defiled by a dead body, that they could not keepe
the Passeover, They came to Moses and said: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are we kept backe that we may not OFFER an
OFFERING of the Lord in his appointed season:</hi>
And againe, ver. 13. <hi>If any one be cleane and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth
to keepe the Passeover, even that Soule shall be
cut off, because he brought not an OFFERING (or
a KORBAN) to the Lord in his appointed season.</hi>
Nothing was called an OFFERING, or a
KORBAN, but that which was brought and
offered up to God at the Tabernacle or Temple,
where his Name was put.</p>
               <p>That the Blood of the Passeovers was to be
Sprinkled by the Priest, and the Fat to be burnt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Altar, although this must needs follow
from the former, yet I prove it more particularly,
thus, <hi>Exod. 23. 18. Thou shalt not offer the blood of
my Sacrifice with leavened Bread; Neither shall the Fat
of my Feast remaine untill the morning:</hi> For by the
generall consent of the Jewish Scholiasts, and all
those Christian interpreters that I have seene, this
place is to be understood onely of the Passeover;
and therefore ONKELOS that famous Chalday
Paraphrast for <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the <hi>Blood
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50941:15"/>
of my Passeover.</hi> But it appeares undoubtedly, from
a Parallell Place in the 34. Chap. of the same
Booke, ver. 23. 25, 26. Where those 17, 18, and
19. verses of the 23. Chap. are againe repeated;
<hi>Thrice in the years shall all your men-children appeare
before the Lord.—Thou shalt not offer the blood of
my Sacrifice with leaven, neither shall the Sacrifice of
the Feast of the Passeover be left unto the morning: The
first of the first fruites of thy land, thou shalt bring into
the House of the Lord thy God: Thou shalt not seeth a
Kid in its Mothers Milke.</hi> Here, what was wanting
in the former, is supplyed. <hi>Neither shall the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Feast of the PASSEOVER be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the morning.</hi> And I have set downe the whole
Context with it, because it will be needfull for the
better clearing of it, to consider its coherence with
other verses, which is the very same in both Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and <hi>Isaak Abrabanel</hi> hath set it downe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
in this manner. First therefore, saith he,
when God had spoken of the Jewes appearing
thrice before him every yeare, <hi>viz.</hi> at The Feast
of the <hi>Passeover</hi> or of <hi>Unleavened bread,</hi> The Feast
of <hi>Weekes</hi> or <hi>Pentecost,</hi> The Feast of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> or
<hi>In-gathering,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>i. e.</hi> When he had
spoken of these three Feasts, he subjoynes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
some Rule Concerning every one of them in
particular: First, for the <hi>Passeover</hi> in those words,
<hi>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my Sacrifice with leaven,
neither shall the Sacrifice of the Feast of the Passeover
be left untill the morning:</hi> Secondly, for the Feast
of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> in those, <hi>The first of the first fruites of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50941:16"/>
the Land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy
God.</hi> Thirdly, for the Feast of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathering,
Thou shalt not seeth a Kid in his mothers
Milke:</hi> which words, for want of this Light of the
Context, were never yet sufficiently explained by
any of our Interpreters. And the thread of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
alone, led <hi>Abrabanel</hi> very neare the true
meaning of them, ere he was aware: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>i. e. It seemes most
probable, that this command was occasioned from a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
amongst the Idolatrous Heathons, that at the time
of their gathering in of fruites, they were wont to boyle
a Kid in the Dammes milke, thinking that by this
meanes, they were made acceptable to their gods,
and did procure a blessing by it.</hi> To confirme which
Glosse, he tels us of a custome somewhat like to
this, used in his time in some parts of <hi>Spaine.</hi> But
because <hi>Abrabanel</hi> doth not tel his tale so handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he should, I will helpe him out a little from
an ancient <hi>Karraite,</hi> whose Comment I have seene
upon the Pentateuch, <hi>MSS.</hi> (For the Monuments
of these <hi>Karraite</hi> Jewes were never yet Printed, and
are very rarely seene in these <hi>European</hi> Parts) And
it is thus. <hi>It was a custome of the ancient Heathens,
when they had gathered in all their fruites, to take a Kid
and boyle it in the Dammes Milke, and then <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
in a Magicall way, to goe about and besprinkle with it,
all their Trees, and Fields, and Gardens, and Orchards:
thinking by this meanes they should make them fructifie,
and bring forth fruite againe, more abundantly the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50941:16"/>
yeare.</hi> Wherefore God forbad his people
the Jewes at the time of their Ingathering to use any
such superstitious or Idolatrous Rite. And I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this the rather, because <hi>Abrabanel,</hi> toward
the end of his Comment on this place, mentions a
glosse of some <hi>KARRAITISH</hi> Authour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, although it be altogether unlike to this
which we have here related. <gap reason="foreign">

As from the coherence of the whole Context thus
cleared, it is manifest that this verse in both places,
is to be understood onely of the <hi>Passeover:</hi> so it
may be further confirmed from the <hi>Talmudists,</hi> who
ever expound it in this sense, as appeares by the
<hi>Misna</hi> in <hi>Zebachin,</hi> Chapter the 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>He that killeth the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
with leaven, sinneth against a Negative Command,</hi>
(which is more amongst the Jewes, then to sinne
against a Positive) <hi>viz.</hi> That in these places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
quoted, <hi>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
with leaven:</hi> From whence they Collected,
as <hi>Maymonides</hi> tels us, that they were to put away
Leaven the foureteenth day, a day before the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Passeover, Nay, this place cannot
possibly be understood in any other sense, as of
Sacrifices in generall, because Leaven was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
commanded with Sacrifices, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.
13.</p>
               <p>But that the Blood of the Passeovers was <hi>sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:50941:17"/>
may be demonstrated further, not onely from
that of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Passeover, 2 <hi>Chron. 30. 16. The
Priests sprinkled the blood, which they received from
the hand of the Levites: For there were many in the
Congregation that were not sanctified, therefore the
Levites had the charge of killing the Passeovers:</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
from <hi>Iosiahs,</hi> chap. 35. ver. 11. which can no waies
be evaded: They, that is, <hi>The Levites, killed the
Passeover, and the Priests Sprinkled the Blood from
their Hands, and the</hi> Levites <hi>Flayed them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Now
the Sprinkling of the Blood is the Essence of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
as before we noted from the Jewish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.
And therefore the <hi>Passeover</hi> must needes be
a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>For a Confirmation of all this, I will describe
punctually the whole manner of the PASCHAL
SACRIFICE, from the <hi>Misna</hi> of the Jewish
<hi>Talmud,</hi> a Monument of such antiquity as cannot
be distrusted in these Rites. Nothing (say they)
was killed before the morning Sacrifice, and after
the Evening Sacrifice, nothing but the Passeover:
The Evening Sacrifice was usually killed betweene
the eighth and ninth houre; that is, halfe an houre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
two in the afternoone, and offered betweene
the ninth and tenth, that is, halfe an houre after
three: But in the Evening of the Passeover, the
daily Sacrifice was killed an houre sooner, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, began the killing of the Passeover, which
was to be done betweene the two Evenings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the first began at Noone from the Sunnes decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
toward the West, the Second at Sunne-set:
yet the Pascha might be killed before the Daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50941:17"/>
if there were but one to stirre the blood,
and keepe it from coagulating, till the blood of the
Daily Sacrifice were Sprinkled, for that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to be sprinkled first: The Passeovers were
alwayes killed by three severall Companies: When
the Court was once full, they shut the doores, and
the Priests stood all in their rankes with round ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
in their hands to receive the blood, those that
were of Gold in a ranke by themselves, and those
that were of silver, all without bottomes, lest they
should be set somewhere on the ground, and the
blood congeale in them. And they killed the
Passeovers, as the Peace-offerings, in any part of
the Court, because they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> The
<hi>lesse holy things,</hi> as the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The <hi>Holy
of Holies,</hi> were alwayes to be killed at the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Altar. The Priests then tooke the blood,
and gave it from one to another, till it came to
him that stood next the Altar, and he sprinkled it
all at once toward the Bottome of the Altar: which
was a Square of 32. Cubits, save that the South-East
Home had no bottome. After the blood was
sprinkled, the Lambe was flayed, and cut up, the
<hi>Imurim,</hi> or inwards taken out and laid upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
then the Owner tooke up the Lambe with the
Skinne of it, and carryed it to his owne home,
The First company having ended, then the Second
came in, and afterward the Third; and for every
Company they beganne anew the HALLEL, and
sang all the while the Passeovers were killing; but
it was never knowne that they had sung out the
HALLEL quite, or came any further then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50941:18"/>
before the Priests had done.</p>
               <p>But because, besides these Talmudisticke Jewes,
there is another Sect of KARRAITES, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
before, (that reject all Talmudicall Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which are not grounded upon Scripture) though
little knowne amongst us, yet famous in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
I will produce one Testimony of theirs also,
froman ancient Manuscript, that so it may appeare
we have the full consent of all Jewish Antiquity
for this Opinion. The Authors name to me is
uncertaine, because the Papers have lost both their
beginning and end. But they containe in them, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
large and compleate Discourses upon severall
Arguments in the <hi>Karraite</hi> way, as about the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
yeare, The Sabbath, The Passeover, &amp;c.
Concerning the Passeover, he divides his Discourse
into severall Chapters, whereof the Title of one is
this: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Offered and Eaten: Where he thus beginnes.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>i. e. Know, that the Offering of
the Passeover was alwayes in the place which God had
chosen,</hi> (to put his Name there) <hi>as it is Written, Thou
shalt not sacrifice the Passeover within any of thy gates,
and the place of the killing of the Passeover was in the
Court called</hi> HESRA, <hi>and the blood of it was powred
out toward the bottome of the Altar, and the Imu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,
or inward parts of it were burnt upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:50941:18"/>Hence it was that when <hi>Cestius</hi> once demanded
what the number of the Jewes was that resorted
to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at the time of their solemne Feasts,
The Priests made answer, and told him exactly,
how many Lambs and Kids were sacrificed at the
Passeover, <gap reason="foreign">

Which they could not have done, had not they
sacrific'd them at the Temple.</p>
               <p>But what need have we of any more dispute? when
the Passeover was first kept in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were not the
Paschall-Lambs there killed in a Sacrificiall and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory
way, When the bloud thereof was to be
sprinkled upon the houses, for God to looke upon,
and so passe over them? It is true, they were killed
in every private house, but the reason of that was,
because there were then Priests in every Family,

of the world? Give me leave to note one thing to
this purpose, upon the credit of <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> in his
Dialogue with <hi>Trypho:</hi> That in the ancient Hebrew
Copies of the Bible, there was in the Booke of <hi>Ezra</hi>
a speech of his which hee made before the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
Expounding the Mystery thereof concerning
Christ, which because it favoured the Christians,
was timely expunged by the Jewes. The speech was
this; <gap reason="foreign">

if it be true; and the Author deserves the better
credit in it, because he was Samaritane, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might be the better skilled in Jewish Writings.
But however, I am sure the Apostle tels us, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the Passeover was a Type of Christ in respect
of his death, but also that the Proper Notion of the
Paschall-Feast, was, to be a <hi>Feast upon Sacrifice,</hi> in
those words, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 7. Christ our Passeover is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according
to the Law; where he meanes doubtlesse, that in
<hi>Exod 12. 6. The whole Assembly of the Congregation of
Israel shall kill it;</hi> For this is that <hi>Solenne delirium</hi> of our
late Authors also, which we have chastized before.
But if he meane moreover, that the people did not
onely kill their Passeovers, but doe all other Priestly
offices concerning them; when hee saies they were
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this, as it hath no ground from
Scripture, and I thinke will hardly find a Patron
now to defend it, so it doth not prejudice our opinion
of the <hi>Passeovers being a Sacrifice,</hi> but still much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may seeme to some, a kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50941:20"/>
to conceive, How so many Sacrifices as
there must be at every Passeover, could all be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon one Altar, since there was no more by the
Law permitted. To which neverthelesse I need not
answer any thing but this, that there was nothing
but the Fat, and some of the Inwards, burnt upon
the Altar, and that the Bignesse of the Altar was
greater then perhaps is ordinarily conceived; for
under the second Temple, the <hi>Area</hi> thereof upon the
Top, was a <hi>Square of twenty eight Cubits,</hi> as the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudists
constantly relate, to which <hi>Iosephus</hi> also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
very neere, if the difference of those Cubits
which he useth be allowed. Onely, they may please
to learne from the Instance of <hi>Iosias</hi> Passeover,
which was said to be so great, that <hi>there was no Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
like to that kept in Israel from the daies of</hi> Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
<hi>the Prophet unto that time;</hi> that this was possible
to be done: For it either is, or must be confessed, that
then they were all offered upon the Altar.</p>
               <p>But lastly, we must confesse ingenuously, that
there is one Great Difficulty yet behind, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our Saviours last Passeover, which according
to the Generall Consent of our best Divines, Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and Chronologers, was kept a Day before
the Jewes kept their Passeover: Whether therefore
his Paschall-Lamb which he with his Apostles did
then Eate, were first Sacrificed at the Temple, and
How that could be?</p>
               <p>Where not to engage our selves any more then
needs we must, in that nice &amp; perplexed, but Famous
Controversie, concerning <hi>the time of the Iewish
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50941:21"/>
Passeover about our Saviours death.</hi> It will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
first to take notice, that the <hi>Latin Church</hi> ever
maintained the contrary opinion against the <hi>Greeks,
viz.</hi> that the Jewes kept the Passeover on the same
night which our Saviour did: and though it be true
that of later times, most of our Best-Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have quitted that opinion of the Latins, and
closed altogether with the Greeks, as <hi>Paulus Burgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
Munster, Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Casaubon,</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
our Country-man Master <hi>Broughton,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
perhaps better then they did, that the
Jewish Passeover was a true and proper Sacrifice, &amp;
first, according to Gods command, was to be offered
up to God, before Feasted on; he espied a difficulty
here concerning our Saviours Passeover, (which
they tooke no notice of) that could not easily be
solved; and therefore he thought good <hi>Scindere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
as <hi>Alexander</hi> did, <hi>to cut the knot, which he
could not loose,</hi> and absolutely to deny that the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Passeover and our Saviours were then celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on two severall Nights. And he is of late se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by <hi>Iohannes Cloppenburg</hi> a Belgick Divine,
[in a learned Epistle written upon this Argument to
<hi>Ludovicus De Dieu</hi>] insisting upon the very same
ground, because the Paschall-Lamb, which Christ
with his Disciples did eate, could not have beene
sacrificed at the Temple, unlesse it had beene, at the
same time when the Jewish Passeover was solemnly
celebrated. His words to this purpose expressing:
fully Master <hi>Broughtons</hi> sense, are these. <hi>Non potuit

               <p>But I must confesse, although I am as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> of <hi>the Passeovers being a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
and as tender of it, as Master <hi>Broughton</hi> could

(as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith a Philosopher should do) to <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of our own Phaenomena.</hi> And indeed those two
Places especially, brought out of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
to prove that the Jewes kept their Passeover,
the day after our Saviour did his, seeme to me to
be unanswerable, nor any way cured by those
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which are applied to them. The first is
<hi>Chap. 19. ver.</hi> 14. where, the next day after Christ
had kept his Passeover with his Disciples, when <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
delivered him up to the Jewes to be crucified,
it is said, that it was then, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The
Preparation of the Passeover,</hi> where they tell us, that
by <hi>The Preparation of the Passeover;</hi> is meant, <hi>The
Preparation of the Sabbath on which the Second day of
the Feast of the Passeover fell.</hi> But <hi>En Iecur Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum!</hi>
as <hi>Scaliger</hi> sometimes cries out: and what a
farre-fetcht conceit is this? The second is that in
Chap. 18. vers. 28. when Jesus was led into <hi>Pilates</hi>
Judgement-Hall, early in the morning, it is said,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50941:22"/>
that <hi>the Iewes themselves went not into the Iudgement-Hall,
lest they should be defiled, but that they might eate
the Passeover.</hi> Here we are told, that by Eating of
the Passeover, is meant the eating of the <hi>Chagigah,</hi>
that was killed the day before with the Passeover,
whereof something perhaps remained till the day
following. And this glosse is little better then the
former: for although they appeale to that place in
<hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. to prove that the <hi>Chagigah</hi> was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called by the name of <hi>Passeover;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if our English Translation were authenticke,
would make something for them; <hi>Thou shalt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sacrifice the Passeover unto the Lord thy God, of
the flocke, and the Heard,</hi> as if there had beene a <hi>Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi>
of Oxen, as well as Sheepe. Yet in the Hebrew
the words runne thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
which according to a severall Punctation, and
a severall supplying of something that must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
may be expounded severall wayes; any
of which is farre better, then that which our English
Translators unhappily pitcht upon. <hi>Onkelos</hi> in his

reads it thus: <gap reason="foreign">

the</hi> GREAT DAY <hi>of the Feast, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</hi>
And doubtlesse by the same Evangelist, for the
First day of the Feast, in this place: and therefore
the Jewes did not Eate their Passeover, till the night
before, which was the same night that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
was crucifyed.</p>
               <p>Which may be strengthened further by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
That if the Jewes had celebrated their
Passeover the same night which our Saviour did
his, it is certaine they would never have gone about
immediately, with swords and staves to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50941:23"/>
him, and then have brought him to the
High-Priests Hall, and afterward have arraigned
him, at <hi>Pilates</hi> Judgement seate, and lastly have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
him, all the same day. For the Frist day of
unleavened Bread, was by the Law an Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
to the Lord, on which it was not lawfull
to doe any worke: And we know the Jewes were
rigid enough in observing these Legall Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>If then it must be granted that our Saviour with
his Disciples kept the Passeover the night before
the vulgar Jewes did celebrate it, Our next Worke
is, to shew how it might be probable, that our
Saviours Passeover was first Sacrificed at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>And here perhaps I might runne for shelter to
that story in <hi>Suidas</hi> upon the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that
Christ was enrolled into the number of the two and
twenty Legall Priests that served at the Altar; from
the pretended Confession of an ancient Jew in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinians</hi>
time; and then he might possibly Sacrifice
his owne Passeover at the Temple, though the
Jewes had not solemnized theirs till the day after.
But that I hold this to be a meere Fable, and that
not onely ridiculous, but impious.</p>
               <p>Or, I might take up the opinion of the Greekes,
that Christ did not keepe a true Legall Passeover,
but a Feast of Unleavened Bread in Imitation of it.
Or as the learned <hi>Hugo<note n="*" place="margin">In Annot. ad Matth. cap. 26.</note> Grotius,</hi> who hath lately
asserted this opinion, expresseth it, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, such as the Jewes at this day keene,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50941:24"/>
because the Temple being downe, their Sacrifices
are all ceased. But this opinion hath beene explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by most of our late Authours, and indeed I can
no way satisfie my selfe in it, and therefore will not
<hi>acquiesce</hi> in this answer.</p>
               <p>But before we be able to give a true account of
this <hi>Quaere,</hi> We must search a little deeper into the
true ground of this difference betweene our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Passeover and the Jewes.</p>
               <p>The common opinion is, that the Jewes in our
Saviours time were wont to translate their Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
from one <hi>Feria</hi> to another upon severall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
as when ever two Festivals were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to follow one another, to joyne them into one,
and therefore when any fell upon the sixth <hi>Feria,</hi>
to put it over to the next <hi>Feria,</hi> or the Sabbath, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd
the concurrence of two Sabbaths together: in
the same manner as the Jewes use to do in their
Calendar at this day, where they have severall Rules
to this purpose, expressed by Abbreviatures thus, <hi>Adu
Badu, Gahaz, Zabad, Agu.</hi> Whereof each Letter is a
Numerall for some <hi>Feria;</hi> The Rule for the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Badu:</hi> that is, that it should not be kept on
the Second, Fourth, or Sixth <hi>Feria.</hi> (There is an
Extract of a Rabbinicall Decree to this purpose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>R. Eliezer:</hi> in <hi>Munster</hi> upon <hi>Matth.
cap.</hi> 26.) And therefore at this time when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was crucified, the Passeover falling upon the
sixth <hi>Feria,</hi> or Friday; was (say they) by the Jews
translated, according to this Rule, to the next <hi>Feria,</hi>
and kept on Saturday, or the Sabbath; but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
not regarding these Traditions, observed that

day precisely which was commanded in the Law,

it, <hi>Upon which the Passeover</hi> OUGHT <hi>to have beene

               </p>
               <p>But, under favour, I conceive that all these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
together with that <hi>Ratiocinium</hi> or Calendar,
to which they doe belong, were not then in use in
our Saviours time, although it be so confidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred
by the incomparable <hi>Ioseph Scaliger,</hi> but
long since invented by the Jewes. Which I shall
make appeare, First, in that the ancient Jewes,
about, and since our Saviours time, often solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
as well the Passeovers, as the other Feasts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Feria's</hi> next before, and after the Sabbaths,
and those other <hi>Feria's,</hi> which have beene made

i. e. In this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
they never constituted the New Moon of Tisri upon
Adu, because this Accompt was made according to the
Conjunction of the Sunne and Moone, in the middle
Motion, therefore now they constituted some Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and other Rejectitious dayes, which they could not
doe before, when the New Moone (and therefore all the
other Feasts) were determined according to the

This is confessed by all Israel,

of the Great Controversies to this day, betweene
those two Sects of the Jewes the <gap reason="foreign">

make this for one, that they should no way belong

<hi>i. e. A second condition is, that they be
not such as hold an opinion concerning the Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the New-Moone different from the opinion of Our
Wisemen. And therefore in this regard, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Testimony of the Ishmaelites (that is, the Turks
and Saracens) because they follow the opinion of Our
Wisemen Concerning the Phasis, and in most of their
appointed times they agree with us: But we may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the testimony of any one that is of the Sect of the
Rabbins, because they are divided from us in this; And
although they be our brethren and our flesh, yet herein
they have rebelled and grieved his holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus disproved the common and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
opinion, and removed the false Ground of this
Difference of time, betweene our Saviours Passeover
and the Jewes, we come in the next place to lay
downe the True, which must be derived from that
way of reckoning the moneths, and of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

which as we have shewed already in generall, was

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, so it will be expedient to describe the

Authors.<note n="*" place="margin">Talmud. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byl. in Rosh. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shanah. &amp; Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. in Kiddush Hachod.</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50941:27"/>In the great or outer Court of the Temple, there
was a House called <hi>Beth-Iazek,</hi> where the Senate sate
all the thirtieth day of every Moneth, to receive the
Witnesses of the Moones apparence, and to examine
them. And here they alwayes had a Feast provided
for the entertainment of those that came, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
men to come the more willingly. In ancient
times, they did admit of strangers, and receive their
Testimony, if it were approved upon examination.
But when the Hereticks (that is, the Christians) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
grew up, by whom, they say, they were
sometimes deluded, they began to grow shy, and
to admit of none but such as were approved of, to
be of the Jewes Religion. If there came approved
Witnesses upon the thirtieth day, of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> seene,
then the chiefe man of the Senate stood up and
pronounced MEKUDDASH, <hi>it is sanctified:</hi>
and the people standing by, caught the word from
him, and cried out, MEKUDDASH, MEKUD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DASH.
Whereupon there was notice presently gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to all the Country: which was done at first by
Torches from Mountaine to Mountain, till at length
the Christians (they say) abused them in that kind
also with false fires: wherefore they were faine to
send Messengers from place to place, over the whole
Land to give intelligence of the New-Moone. But
if, when the Consistory had sate all the thirtieth day,
there came no approved Witnesses of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then
they made an intercalation of one day in the former
Month, and decreed the following, one and thirtieth
day, to be the Calends. And yet notwithstanding, if
after the fourth or fifth day, there should come some
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50941:27"/>
Witnesses from afarre, that testified, they had seene
the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in its due time, nay, though they came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the end of the Moneth, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
The Senate, when they had used all meanes by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting
them from that Testimony, that so, if it
were possible, they might decline a New Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
(after they had already made an <hi>Embolisme</hi> in
the former Moneth) if the Witnesses remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
were then bound to alter the beginning of the
Moneth, and reckon it a day sooner, to wit, from
the thirtieth day.</p>
               <p>Here we see the True Ground of the Difference
of a day, that might arise continually about the
Calends of the Moneth, and so consequently about
any of the other Feasts which did all depend on
them, <hi>viz.</hi> Betweene the true Time of the Moones
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, upon the thirtieth day, and that of the Senates
Decree a day after. For since it appeares out of
their owne Monuments, how unwilling they were,
having once made a Consecration of the <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
to alter it againe; it may be probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that in those degenerated times, the Senate
might many times refuse to accept the Testimony
of undoubted Witnesses: And then it seemes they
had such a Canon as this: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>That whatsoever Time the Senate should conclude of for
the Calends of the Moneth, though it were certaine they
were in the wrong, yet all were bound to order their Feasts
according to it:</hi> Which I cannot thinke was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of by our Saviour, and the most pious Jewes.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50941:28"/>
And therefore I conceive it most probable, that
this was the very case betweene our Saviours Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
and the Jewes, in that he followed the True
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, confirmed by sufficient and assured Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
but the other Jewes superstitiously observed
the Pertinacious Decree of the Senate or Sanhedrin,
which was for the day after.</p>
               <p>And now at last, we are come againe to the <hi>Acme</hi>
of the Question, that was first propounded; How
our Saviours Passeover, notwithstanding all this,
might be sacrificed the day before those of the other
Jewes were.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, that upon this Ground, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
our Saviour &amp; his Apostles, but also divers others
of the most religious Jewes, kept the Passeover upon
the fifteenth day from the true <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Moone,
and not from the Senates Decree; which I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
from the Testimony of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that reports,
there was at this time <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">In Panario Har. ll.</note> a Tumult, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongst the Jewes about the Passeover; and so
we may easily perswade those other Evangelists,
that intimate Christs Passeover to have beene so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized,
when many others kept it, to agree with
Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> who assures us, that it was also by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Jewes kept the day after. Now it was a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
among the Jewes, in such doubtfull cases as
these, which oftentimes fell out, to permit the
Feasts to be solemnized, or Passeovers killed, on
two severall dayes together. <hi>Maymonides</hi> affirmeth,
that in the remoter parts of the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> they
alway solemnized the Feast of the New-Moones
two dayes together, nay, in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it selfe where
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50941:28"/>
the Senate sate, they kept the New-Moone of <hi>Tisri,</hi>
which was the beginning of the yeare, twice, lest
they should be mistaken in it. In the <hi>Talmud</hi> we
have an instance, of the <hi>Passeovers</hi> being kept two
daies together, because the New-Moone was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
in <hi>Gemara Rosh Hashanah. cap.</hi> 1. Hence the
Karraites who still keepe the ancient custome of
observing the Moones <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

themselves since they have changed the <hi>Phasis,</hi> for

to keepe the Passeover two dayes together, <hi>iisdem

<hi>Corinthians</hi> of the unlawfulnesse of Eating things

Shewing, that though an Idoll were truely No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and things Sacrificed to Idols were Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
Nothing, as different from other Meates; [as
it seemes they argued, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confesses, ver.
19.] Yet Morally and Circumstantially, to Eate
of things Sacrificed to Idols, in the Idols Temple,
was to consent with the Sacrifices, and to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them: Which he doth illustrate, First, from a
<hi>Parallel Rite,</hi> in Christian Religion. Where the
Eating and Drinking of the Body and Blood of
Christ, offered up to God upon the Crosse for us,
in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> is a Reall Communication in
his Death and Sacrifice, ver. 16. <hi>The Cup of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
which we blesse, is it not the Communion of the blood
of Christ? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, From another <hi>Parallel</hi> of the same Rite
among the Jewes. Where, alwayes they that Eate
of the Sacrifices, were accounted partakers of the
Altar, that is, Of the Sacrifice offered up upon the
Altar, ver. 18. <hi>Behold Israel after the flesh, are not
they which Eate of the Sacrifices partakers of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar?
In veteri Lege quicunque admittebantur ad Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum

it.</p>
               <p>Therefore, as to Eate the Body and Blood of
Christ in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> is to be made partaker
of his Sacrifice offered up to God for us; as to Eate
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50941:30"/>
of the Jewish Sacrifices under the Law, was to
partake in the Legall Sacrifices themselves: So to
Eate of things offered up in Sacrifice to Idols, was
to be made partakers of the Idoll-Sacrifices: And
therefore was unlawfull.</p>
               <p>For, the things which the Gentiles Sacrifice,
they Sacrifice to Devils, but Christs Body and
Blood was offered up in Sacrifice unto God, and
therefore they could not partake of both together;
the Sacrifice of the true God, and the Sacrifice of
Devils. <hi>Ye cannot drinke the Cup of the Lord, and the
Cup of Devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the table of Devils.</hi> S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument
here, must needs suppose a perfect <hi>Analogy</hi> between
these three, and that they are all <hi>Parallels</hi> to one
another, or else it hath no strength. Wherefore
I conclude from hence, that the LORDS SUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER
is the same among Christians, in respect of
the <hi>Christian Sacrifice,</hi> that among the Jewes the
<hi>Feasts</hi> upon the <hi>Legall Sacrifices</hi> were, and among

               <p>THUS having Declared and Demonstrated
<hi>The True Notion of The Lords Supper:</hi> We see
then, How that Theologicall Controversie, which

SACRIFICIUM, but EPULUM EK
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Not A SACRIFICE, but <hi>A Feast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sacrifice:</hi> or else in other Words, Not OBLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIO
SACRIFICII, but as <hi>Tertullian</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
speakes, PARTICIPATIO SACRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICII:
Not the <hi>Offering of something up to God
upon an Altar,</hi> but the <hi>Eating of something which
comes from Gods Altar,</hi> and is set upon Our Tables.
Neither was it ever knowne amongst the Jewes or
Heathens, that those Tables upon which they did
eate Their Sacrifices, should be called by the Name
of Altars. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the Feasts upon
the Idoll-Sacrifices, calls the places upon which
they were eaten, <hi>The Tables of Devils,</hi> because the
Devils meate was eaten on them, not the Altars of
Devils: and yet doubtlesse he spake according to
the true Propriety of speech, and in those Techni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Words that were then in use amongst them.
And therefore keeping the same Analogy, he must
needes call the <hi>Communion Table,</hi> by the name of
the <hi>Lords Table: i. e.</hi> The Table upon which <hi>Gods
Meate</hi> is eaten, not his Altar, upon which it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
It is true, an <hi>Altar</hi> is nothing but a <hi>Table,</hi>
but it is <hi>A Table upon which</hi> GOD <hi>himselfe eates,</hi>
consuming the Sacrifices by his <hi>Holy Fire:</hi> but
when the same Meate is given from GOD unto
Us to Eate of, the relation being changed, the
place on which WE Eate, is nothing but a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And because it is not enough in any Discourse, as
<hi>Aristotle</hi> well observeth in his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> to confute
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50941:31"/>
an Error, unlesse we can also shew <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<hi>The Cause of that Error;</hi> Having thus Discovered
<hi>The True Notion of the Lords Supper,</hi> we may easily
from hence discerne also, How that mistake grew
up, and that by the Degeneration of this Truth.
There is a Sacrifice in the Lords Supper Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
but not there as Offered up to God, but Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
on by us; and so not a Sacrifice, but a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
Feast: Which beganne too soone to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood.</p>

               <p>I Should now come, to make some further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of this Generall <hi>Notion of the Lords
Supper:</hi> By shewing what these Feasts upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
did signifie, under the Law; and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the same in a more perfect manner to the
Lords Supper under the Gospell; being warranted
thereunto by that Analogy which is betweene
them. But because there may be divers glosses
and Interpretations of These Feasts upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
which are obvious to every common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
We will decline them all, and pitch
onely upon one, which is not so vulgarly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
And it is this, that, <hi>The Eating of Gods Sacrifices</hi>
was a FEDERALL RITE, betweene God and
those that offered them, according to the Custome
of the Ancients, and especially in those Orientall
Parts, to Confirme and Ratify their Covenants, by
Eating and Drinking together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:50941:31"/>Thus when <hi>Isaak</hi> made a Covenant with <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi>
the King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> the Text saith, <hi>He made
him and those that came with him a Feast,</hi> and <hi>they
did eate and drinke, and rose up betimes in the morning
and sware to one another.</hi> When <hi>Laban</hi> made a
<hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 21. ver. 44. <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
come</hi> (saith <hi>Laban) let us make a Covenant, I and
thou, and let it be for a witnesse betweene me and thee;</hi>
Then it followes in the Text, <hi>They tooke stones, and
made a heape, and did eate there upon the heape, and
Laban called it</hi> JEGARSAHADUTHA, <hi>in his
Chalday Tongue, but Iakob</hi> (in the Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage)
GALEED, <hi>i. e. A heape of witnesse.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
that those stones upon which they had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and drunke together, should be a witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
either of them that should first violate that
Covenant. <hi>R. Moses Bar Nachman</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thus glosseth upon this place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>i. e.
They did eate there, a little upon the heape, for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall:
Because it was the manner of those that entred
into Covenant, to eate both together of the same Bread,
as a Symbol of love and friendship:</hi> And <hi>Isaak A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brabanel</hi>
much to the same purpose, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> It was an ancient custome
amongst them, that they which did eate Bread to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
upon the same Table, should be accounted
ever afterward as entire Brethren. And in this
sense he conceiveth, that place, <hi>Lamentations</hi> 5. v. 6.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50941:32"/>
may be expounded: <hi>We have given the hand to the
Egyptians, and to the Assyrians by fulnesse of Bread,
i. e.</hi> We have made a Covenant with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioshua</hi> 9. verse 14. When the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> came
to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and desired them to make a league
with them, it is said; <hi>The Men of Israel tooke of
their victuals and asked not counsell of the mouth of the

familiar friend, that did eate of my Bread, hath lift
up the heele against me:</hi> but seeming prophetically,
to glance at <hi>Iudas,</hi> that dipping with Christ in the
same dish, betrayed him. The Singular Emphasis
of which speech, we that are unacquainted with this
Custome of the Orientall Nations, cannot easily
perceive; neither can wee any where better learne
it, then from that passage of <hi>Celsus</hi> in <hi>Origen,</hi>
who carping at that History of <hi>Iudas</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
Christ, in the Gospell, as an incredible

<hi>All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee to the

as hath beene shewed.</p>
               <p>And, as the Jewes, so likewise did the Heathens
in the same manner use to Ratifie their Covenants,
betweene Parties, by <hi>Eating together. Lucian</hi> in
<hi>Toxaris,</hi> reports it of the Scythians, That when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one was injured and could'not revenge himselfe,
the manner was, that he should kill and Oxe, and cut
it into small peeces, which being boyled, he was to
sit downe by them, with his hands behind him,
(which was a gesture of earnest supplication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them) and then whosoever was minded to
helpe him, came, and did Eate a piece of his flesh,
and so, with this Ceremony promised to assist him.
And this was counted a sacred and inviolable Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of mutuall defence betweene them, whence
that Greeke Proverbe, <gap reason="foreign">

his Wife. And there remaineth a Custome to
this day, something like this, at Weddings in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Countries; That when the Bridegroome and
Bride are come from Church, they have a piece of
Cake brought them, which when the Bridegroom
hath tasted, he gives it to the Bride to taste of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
in token of a Covenant betweene them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> still use to conclude of Bargaines, and

It is an Axiom in the Civill Law, that
if a man drinke to one, against whom he hath an
Accusation of slander, or other Verball injury, he
loses his Action, because it is supposed he is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to him.</p>
               <p>In like manner, I say, the Eating of Sacrifices,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50941:34"/>
which were Gods meare, was a Federall Rite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and those that did partake of them, and
signifyed that there was a Covenant of Friend-ship
betweene him and them.</p>
               <p>For the better conceiving whereof, we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that Sacrifices, beside the Nature of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
had the Notion of Feasts, which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
did, as it were, feed upon. Which I explaine
thus: When God had brought the Children of
<hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> resolving to manifest himselfe
in a peculiar manner present among them, He
thought good <hi>to Dwell amongst them</hi> in a visible and
Externall manner: And therefore while they
were in the Wildernesse and sojourned in Tents,
he would have a <hi>Tent or Tabernaole</hi> built, to sojourne
with them also. This Mystery of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
was fully understood by the Learned <hi>Nachma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi>
who in few words, but pregnant, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
it: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
And againe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
That is, <hi>The
Mystery of the Tabernacle, was this, that it was to be a
Place for the Shechinah, or Habitation of Divinity to be
fixed in:</hi> And this, no doubt, as a speciall Type
of Gods future <hi>Dwelling</hi> in Christs humane Nature,
which was the TRUE SHECHINAH. But
when the Jewes were come into their Land, and
had there built them Houses, God intended to have
a fixed Dwelling-House also, and therefore his
Moveable Tabernacle was to be turned into a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Temple. Whence by imitation came
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50941:34"/>
came all those Temples among the Heathens, which
they apprehended as so many places of Peculiar
Residence or Habitation, for their Deities next the
Heavens to dwell in. As appeares by that of <hi>Silius</hi>
amongst many others,
<q>
                     <l>—Tarpeie Pater, qui Templa secundam</l>
                     <l>Incolis à Coelo sedem—</l>
                  </q>
Now the Tabernacle or Temple, being thus as a
<hi>House</hi> for God to <hi>Dwell</hi> in visibly, to make up the
<hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Dwelling</hi> or <hi>Habitation</hi> compleate, there
must be all things sutable to a House, belonging to
it. Hence in the Holy Place, there must be a
<hi>Table</hi> and a <hi>Candlesticke;</hi> because this was the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
furniture of a roome, as the fore-commended
<hi>Nachmanides</hi> observes,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>i. e. He addeth
a Table and a Candlesticke, because these suite the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Dwelling-House.</hi> The <hi>Table</hi> must have its
<hi>Dishes,</hi> and <hi>Spoones,</hi> and <hi>Bowles,</hi> and <hi>Covers</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, though they were never used, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be furnished with <hi>Bread</hi> upon it. The <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke</hi>
must have its <hi>Lamps</hi> conninually burning.</p>
               <p>Hence also there must be a <hi>Continuall Fire</hi> kept,
in this House of Gods, upon the Altar, as the <hi>Focus</hi>
of it; to which Notion, I conceive, the Prophet
<hi>Esay</hi> doth allude Chap. 31. ver. 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
which I would thus tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate,
<hi>Qui habet ignem suum in Sion, &amp; focum suum
in Ierusalem.</hi> And besides all this, to carry
the <hi>Notion</hi> still further, there must be some <hi>Constant
Meate and Provision</hi> brought into this House, which
was done in the Sacrifices, that were partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50941:35"/>
by Fire upon Gods owne Altar, and partly
eaten by the Priests which were Gods <hi>Family,</hi> and
therefore to be maintained by him; That which
was consumed upon Gods Altar, was accounted
GODS MESSE, as appeareth from the first chap.
of <hi>Malachy;</hi> Where the <hi>Altar</hi> is called GODS
TABLE, and the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> upon it GODS MEAT; <hi>You
say the Table of God is polluted, and the fruit thereof
his Meat is contemptible:</hi> and often in the Law,
the Sacrifice is called Gods <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, his <hi>Bread
or Food.</hi> Whence in that Learned Hebrew Booke
<hi>Cozri,</hi> The King <hi>Haber</hi> objects to the Jew <hi>Cozar</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Religion, that it seemed to place Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reity
in God, in making him to feed upon the Flesh
of Beasts in these Sacrifices: to which the Jewish
Doctor replieth Cabalistically in this manner: That
as in men, Corporeal meate is a meanes to unite and
continue the Soule (which is a Spirit) to the Body:
So in the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Bloud of Beasts offered
up in Sacrifice, had an Attractive power to draw
downe Divinity, and unite it to the Jewes. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
this may be a little further convinced from
that passage in the 50. <hi>Psal. If I were hungry, I would
not tell thee, for the world is mine, and the fulnesse
thereof: Will I eate the Flesh of Buls, or Drinke the
the Bloud of Goates?</hi> For though it be here denied
that God did really feed upon the Sacrifices, yet it
is implyed there was some such Allusive Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is further observable, that beside the
flesh of the beast offered up in Sacrifice, there was
a Mincah or Meat-offering, made of Flowre and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50941:35"/>
Oyle, and a Libamen, or Drink-offering, that was
alwayes joyned with the daily Sacrifice. As the
<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> which was to go along with Gods
<hi>Meate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was also strictly commanded, that there should
be Salt in every Sacrifice and oblation: Because all
Meate is unsavory without Salt, as <hi>R. Moses Bar
Nachman</hi> hath here also well observed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>i. e.</hi>
Because it was not honourable, that Gods Meate
should be unsavory, without Salt.</p>
               <p>Lastly, all these things were to be consumed on
the Altar, onely by the Holy Fire that came downe
from Heaven, because they were <hi>Gods Portion,</hi> and
therefore to be <hi>eaten</hi> or consumed by himselfe, in an
extraordinary manner. And this the Devill some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
imitated, in some Sacrifices offered up to him.
For so I understand that Passage of <hi>Pindar</hi> in his <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bympiacks,
Ode</hi> 7. speaking of the Rhodians, That
when they had prepared, and were come to offer
Sacrifice to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> they had by chance forgotten
to bring Fire with them: But <hi>Iupiter</hi> being consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of their good intentions, rained downe upon
them A GOLDEN SHOVVRE, that is, (as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it) A SHOVVRE of Fire. A pure imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Sacred Story. Take it in that elegant
Poets owne words.</p>

               <p>That is, according to <hi>Benedictus</hi> his Metaphrase:

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Solinus</hi> reports it of the <hi>Vulcanian</hi> Hill in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
that they which offered Sacrifice upon it, never
put fire to it, but expected it should be kindled from
Heaven. His Words according to <hi>Salmasiu's</hi> Edition,
are these, <hi>Nec longè indè Collis Vulcanius, in quo qui di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae

The place is very remarkable; &amp; where he saies thus,

of Feasting on the Sacrifices, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
explained.</p>
               <p>I will adde to all this, the words of a late learned
Author, that sometime stumbled unawares upon
this very <hi>Notion,</hi> which we are now about, and yet
exprest it happily in this manner, <hi>Deus ad suam cum
populo Iudaeorum familiaritatem significandam, sibi
ab illo carnes, sanguinem, asque fruges, in ALTARI
atque NENSA offerri voluit, ut ostenderet se quasi
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50941:36"/>
COMMUNEM in illo populo Habere MENSAM,
esse illius CONVIVAM perpetuum, atque it a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liariter
cum illis habitare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as it was thus among the Hebrewes, so it
seemes that <hi>Sacrifices</hi> had the Notion of Feasts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
among the ancient Persians, that worshipped
the Fire: of whom <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> thus relateth
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.
Bringing in the Sacrifices to the Fire, which was their
God, they were wont to say,</hi> Ignis Domine Comede.</p>
               <p>The Sacrifices then being Gods Feasts, they
that did partake of them, must needs be His CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIVAE,
and in a manner EATE and DRINKE
with him. And that this did bear the Notion of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derall
Rite, in the Scriptures account, I prove from
that place, <hi>Levit. 2. 13. Thou shalt not suffer the
SALT OF THE COVENANT of thy God
to be lacking, with all thine offerings thou shalt offer
Salt.</hi> Where the Salt that was to be cast upon all
the Sacrifices, is called THE SALT OF THE
COVENANT, to signifie, that as men did use to
make Covenants by Eating and Drinking together,
wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re <hi>Salt</hi> is a necessary <hi>Appendix,</hi> so God by these
Sacrifices and the Feasts upon them, did Ratifie and
Confirme his Covenant with those that did partake
of them, in as much as they did in a manner EATE
and DRINKE with him.</p>
               <p>For Salt was ever accounted amongst the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
a most necessary Concomitant of Feasts, and
Condiment of all Meats: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
saith the Jewish Proverb, in Berachoth;
Owne Convivium in quo non est salitum non est convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50941:37"/>
And therefore, because Covenants and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliations
were made by Eating and Drinking,
where Salt was alwayes used, Salt it selfe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
among the ancients, AMICITIAE

                  </gap>, (by <hi>Erasmus</hi> his leave) <hi>for
friendship and hospitality.</hi> There is a pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this very Phrase in the Scripture, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.
14. Where our Translatours read it thus, <hi>Because

[that is, because we have engaged our selves in a

Which was, because that Federall Symboll had
beene so often abused. Nay, hence there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
a Superstitious custome amongst us and

other Nations, to this day; To count the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning

some evill to him towards whom it fals: <hi>Quia

I thinke, I have given a sufficient Comment upon
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Salt of the Covenant</hi> in the Text.</p>
               <p>Only I must not forget, that as in Gods Sacrifices,
there was ever Salt to be used; So the like was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
observed in the Heathen Sacrifices; as that one
place out of <hi>Pliny,</hi> amongst many, shall sufficiently
testifie, <hi>Maxima Salis authoritas è Sacris veterum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligitur,
apud quos nulla sacra sine molâ salsâ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiebantur.</hi>
And the reason of it also is thus given
by that famous Scholiast, upon Il. a. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
Because Salt is a Symboll of friendship:
which is the same with that reason given by God,
why he would alwayes have Salt in his Sacrifices,
because it was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Sal Symbolum foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris,</hi>
as before was shewen. And this Phrase be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus explained, will clearely expound that other
Phrase, about which Criticks have laboured so
much in vaine, where the same words are used, but
inverted, and a Covenant is called <hi>A covenant of
Salt,</hi> as Salt is here called <hi>The Salt of the Covenant,
Numb.</hi> 18. 19. and 2 <hi>Chron. 13. 5. viz.</hi> Because

               <p>Now therefore, that we may returne; As the

God and Men: In like manner I say The Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
under the Gospel, which we have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be EPULUM SACRIFICIALE, <hi>A Feast upon
Sacrifice,</hi> must needs be EPULUM FOEDERALE,
<hi>A Feast of Amity and Friendship,</hi> betweene God and

with him.</p>
               <p>Which I will confirme from that fore-commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
place, whence I have already proved that the
Lords Supper is <hi>A Feast upon Sacrifice.</hi> For there the
Apostle thus deliorts the Corinthians from Eating
of the Feasts upon Idoll-Sacrifices, which are a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to the Feast upon the Christian Sacrifice, in
the Lords Supper, Because this was to have <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,</hi>
and <hi>Federall Communion</hi> with Devils; <hi>The
things that the Gentiles Sacrifice, they Sacrifice to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,

                  </gap>
                  <hi>That is, if among men to communicate of
Bread and Salt, be a token and Symboll of friendship;
it must carry the same Notion betweene men and Devils,
in the Idoll-Feasts.</hi> If therefore to Eate the Sacrifice
of Devils be to have <hi>Federall Communion</hi> with those
Devils, to whom it was offered; then to Eate of the
Sacrifice of Christ, once offered up to God, in the
Lords Supper, is to have Federall <hi>Communion</hi> with
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:50941:38"/>There is an excellent Story in <hi>Maimonides</hi> his

the <hi>Zabii:</hi> Of Feasting together with their Gods
in this Federall way, which will much illustrate
this Notion. For going about to give the reason,
why the Eating of Blood was forbidden in the
Law, he ferches it from that Idolatrous use of it
then in <hi>Moses</hi> time among the <hi>Zabii;</hi> according to

blood was forbidden in the Law, as <hi>Maymonides</hi> did,
although in the first place, he saith, it was because
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50941:39"/>
Blood served in the Sacrifices for expiation, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then <hi>Maymonides;</hi> (for there was a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie

Nature of Sacrifices) but yet in the Second place,
he brings in this also; Because it was used supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously

                  <hi>i. e.
They performed their Superstitious Worship, by eating
of Blood in this manner; They gathered together Blood
for the Devils their Idoll-Gods, and then they came
themselves, and did eate of that blood with them: As
being the Devils GUESTS, and INVITED to
EATE at the TABLE of Devils, and so were
JOYNED in Federall Society with them. And by
this kind of Communion with Devils, they were able to
Prophecy, and foretell things to come.</hi>
