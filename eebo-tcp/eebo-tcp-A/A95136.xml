            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True Relation from <hi>Rome,</hi> of a bloody and cruel Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
That for many Years hath deſtroyed an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Men, Women,</hi> and <hi>Children</hi>; devoured the
Growth of that Country, and reduced other Nations to
want: VVith a Deſcription of its prodigious Shape, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
Aſpect, and Fox-like Craftineſs; the like never
yet ſeen in any other part of the VVorld.</head>
            <p>WE are aſſured in <hi>Scripture,</hi> That before the Diſſolution
of the Univerſe, there ſhall appear Signs in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
and Wonders: But there never has been known
ſuch a Wonder, or Prodigy, as the <hi>Monſter</hi> in this monſterous
Narrative will appear; yet it is not ſo ſtrange as true, as too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nations have felt, and found by woful Experience.</p>
            <p>The Letter which gives a Deſcription of him runs thus: In this
City there is a <hi>Monſter,</hi> ſuch as never was ſeen, but only in this
Place: He at firſt ſprang out of the Sea, having <hi>Seven Heads,</hi>
and <hi>Ten Horns;</hi> and on his Head the Name of <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> He is
ſpoted like a <hi>Leopard,</hi> his Feet are like a <hi>Bears,</hi> and his Mouth
is like a <hi>Lyon's:</hi> He hath done great Wonders, and deceived ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nations; ſlain many Thouſands of <hi>Innocents,</hi> and is drunken
with the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Saints:</hi> He cauſeth himſelf to be worſhiped,
and exalteth himſelf above all that is called <hi>God's,</hi> and he ſits as
<hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Temple of God:</hi> He is Letcherous as a <hi>Bore,</hi> as full of
Poiſon as a <hi>Toade,</hi> Cunning as a <hi>Fox,</hi> Surly as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> Bloody
minded as a <hi>ſhee Bear,</hi> Deceitful as a <hi>Leopard,</hi> Wiſe as a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
and as Proud as the <hi>Devil;</hi> treading upon the Necks of
<hi>Emperors</hi> and <hi>Kings:</hi> And although he is of the Nature of a
<hi>Wolfe,</hi> yet he always goes in <hi>Sheeps Cloathing,</hi> the better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Multitude; but he is known by his Works. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
him to the Life, would be almoſt impoſſible; but thus much
we can ſay of him: He is an <hi>Idolatrous, Traditious, Malicious, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious,
Perfidious, Deceitful, Hateful, Bloody-Minded, Proud,
Letcherous, Lofty, Factious, Perjur'd, Equivocal, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gly, Wicked,
Damnable, Devil Incarnate;</hi> and is called the <hi>POPE.</hi> He ſells
<hi>Heaven</hi> for Money, and lets who he pleaſes in; He forgives who
he pleaſes, and who he pleaſes he damns; He dethrones <hi>Kings</hi>
at his Pleaſure, and them that will not worſhip him he Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates,
or puts to ignominious Deaths: He extols and exalts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
above all others; and therefore, by all that hath been ſaid,
can be no other than the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi>
a Burthen to the Earth, and a Limb of the Devil; unfit to live,
and more unfit to dye; loathſome to Heaven, and a Shame to
Mortals; therefore fit for nothing but a Brakefaſt for <hi>Satan.</hi>
