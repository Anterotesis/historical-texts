         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>thou hast
in this small
Treatise, set
beforethee, the
several pieces of that great
and glorious mysterie, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, God manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in the flesh: and if
thou art enlightned by the
spirit of Christ, here thou
maiest see by that spirit,
how Jesus Christ the Son
of God, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi>
is both true God and true
Man, both Natures ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
but one Christ one
Jesus, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
verses, where speaking
first of his being God, and
then of his taking upon
<pb facs="tcp:102699:3"/>
him the nature of man; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
in the 8 and 9
verses he saith, he (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this Jesus) hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himself, &amp;c. and God
(meaning the Father) hath
highly exalted him, &amp;c.
speaking of both natures
God and Man as together
making but one Christ;
who is the Saviour,
and is to be beleeved and
trusted in for Salvation,
not only as God, but as
man also; and those who
do not thus make him the
object of their faith, will
surely fall short of pardon
of sin, and of salvation, <hi>Act.</hi>
13. 38, 39. through this
man (speaking of Christ as
crucified at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) is
preached unto you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of sins: and in the
<pb facs="tcp:102699:3"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. saith he, there
is one Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and men, the

discovers the damnable

               </gap> as true man: and
this is also quite contrary
to those commonly called
<hi>Familists, Ranters, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
or others, who
on the other hand either
deny Christ to be a reall
man without them, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously
fancying him
to be only God manifest
in their flesh; or else make
his humane nature with
the fulnesse of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
in it, to be but a
<pb facs="tcp:102699:4"/>
type of God to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in the saints, and so
according to their wicked
imagination, his humane
nature was to be laid aside
after he had offered it up
upon the crosse without
the gate at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Acts</hi> the 1. 1, 2, 3, 9,
10, 11 verses, compared
with the last chapter of
<hi>Luke</hi> verses 34, 39, 40, 50,
51. where it is clearly held
forth that the man Christ
rose againe out of the
grave with the same body
which was crucified and
laid in the grave, and was
taken up above the clouds
into heaven with the same
real body, and that he shal
again descend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in that same glorious
body of flesh, as <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9,
<pb facs="tcp:102699:4"/>
10, 11. and this sure truth,
of Christ being the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
&amp; Mediatour, as man,
and not only as God, will
also shew serious believers
what to thinke of some,
who though they will not
(it may be) deny that
Christ is a real man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them in the heavens
as well as God, yet doe
own him to be the Saviour
only as God, first dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in that flesh that was
born of the Virgin,
and then dwelling in
Saints, and thus both
beginning and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
their Salvation
within them, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
doe hold Christ as
man, to be only (I say to
be only) the saved or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
one of God, together
<pb facs="tcp:102699:5"/>
with the Saints his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
only something in
another and more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
manner and meisure
then the Saints; and these
highflown people are in
this very like to <hi>Familists</hi>
and <hi>Quakers,</hi> undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord Jesus Christ,
God-man, and though
they may speake much of
Christ, yet they doe not
rightly and savingly lay
him for their foundation.
Now as a helpe against all
these dangerous things,
thou hast here the maine
things of Christ laid down
before thee briefly, and
fully proved by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
first of his being
true God out of flesh from
eternity, and then of his
taking flesh, or the nature
<pb facs="tcp:102699:5"/>
of man upon him in the
wombe of the Virgin, and
so his fulfilling the Law,
his dying for sins at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
his rising againe
without, his ascending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heaven without, and
not into a fancyed heaven
only within, as some say;
his interceding in heaven
for all his, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
again in his body of
flesh to judge the world.
And if thou art yet in a
state of nature, though co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
profession, here thou
maiest find something (if
the spirit of Christ meet
thee in reading) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
thee of the sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
thou art in, and to
shew thee the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thou art to fly to by
<pb facs="tcp:102699:6"/>
faith, and to trust in for
salvation, when convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of sin; which is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
wrought by that
God-man Jesus Christ
without thee, dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thee at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for
sinners: here also thou
maiest see the difference
between true and faise
faith. If thou art a true
believer, as these things
are the foundation of thy
faith; so they may be of
great use for thee to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
upon, and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
thy faith in, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in meditation, and in
this way to seek daily for
a higher faith in these
truths to be given into
thy heart from heaven;
and there is a great need
of this, for though these
<pb facs="tcp:102699:6"/>
truthes be commonly
known amongst professors
to the notion of them;
yet very few know or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them aright: nay it
may well be said in this
age, that, if the faith of the
true saints was wel sifted,
and tradition notion and
the apprehensions of their
own reason and fancy was
sifted out, most of them
would be found to have
very little knowledge of,
and faith in, these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
truths.</p>
            <p>Secondly, these truths
being put thus together
and plainly proved by the
Scriptures may be a great
help (through the Spirit
concurring) to strengthen
thee against all those dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
heresies which are
spread abroad, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:102699:7"/>
the Lord Jesus Christ
either plainly or more
cunningly and mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.
And thirdly, the
more thou art rooted and
set down from heaven in
the faith of these truths of
Christ, to believe fully the
glorious reality of them, &amp;
their interest in them, the
more heavenly peace and
joy, thou wilt have 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.
7, 8. &amp; also thou wilt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
attain the more true
holiness &amp; purity of heart
and life, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their hearts by faith:
and then the more thou
hast of the right faith of
Christ and of his things in
thy heart, the more strong
and valiant wilt thou be
in spirit to doe any worke
private or publick for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
Christ, like <hi>Stephen Acts</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102699:7"/>
6 ver. 8. who being full of
faith and of the holy spirit
was also full of power. In
this book thou hast also
laid down from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
how Jesus Christ is
without the Saints as man,
and yet dwelleth within
them, that is, somthing of
his divine nature or his
blessed spirit dwels within
them, which spirit is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
called the spirit of
Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. he that
hath not the spirit of
Christ, &amp;c. and sometime
called Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. if
Christ be in you, &amp;c. and
also how we may know
whether it be Christ and
the spirit of Christ within
or a false spirit calling it
self Christ, &amp; that is thus, if
it be indeed Christ within,
<pb facs="tcp:102699:8"/>
that is, the spirit of Christ
God-man: why then it
teaches that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in whom it is, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and trust in Christ
without for Salvation,
Christ as born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary,</hi> as fulfilling the
Law without them, as dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without the gate of
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> as a sacrifice for
sin, it teaches them to trust
in the man Christ as rising
againe out of the grave
without them, as ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
into, and interceding
in heaven without for
them; and as to come from
that heaven againe in his
flesh to judge the world:
Thus the man Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
saith <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. <hi>When he</hi>
(the spirit of truth) <hi>is come</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>he shall glorifie me,</hi> v. 14.
<pb facs="tcp:102699:8"/>
he shall make you more to
prize, admire and glorifie
me, who am both God
and man; And who shal be
absent from you touching
my body. Then followes,
For he shall take of mine
(of my glorious things)
and shew them to you;
He shall take my divine
and humane Nature, my
birth, my person and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
my obedience, death,
satisfaction, my resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ascension, and interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and of my second
comming in the clouds
with my mighty Angels
to judgement, and shall
shew them, or cleer them
up to you; He shall take
of my salvation, which I
have wrought for you in
my own person without
<pb facs="tcp:102699:9"/>
you; And he shall take of
my glorie and exaltation
in the heavens, and shew
to you: Now to minde
this one thing, and to be
set down in a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of it, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
from the Scriptures,
will be of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to thee and me; for,
for want of this, many
professors have split them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
some looking only
on what Christ hath done
&amp; suffered without them,
resting in an historical, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
and indeed a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed
faith of it, without
looking for the Spirit of
Jesus Christ to come with
power into their hearts,
without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rightly know, nor
rightly believe in Christ
<pb facs="tcp:102699:9"/>
the Son of God without
them, so as to have any
share or interest in him,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. If any man
have not the Spirit of
Christ, he is none of his:
Others have been depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
too much upon som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
they call Christ and
the righteousness of Christ
within them, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Christ and his
righteousnesse without
them, from which all true
saints have their justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and comfort, it being
received through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
dwels in them; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
these may talk much
of Christ within them, yet
it is manifest, that it is not
the spirit of Christ, but
the spirit of the Divel; in
<pb facs="tcp:102699:10"/>
that it doth not glorifie,
but sleight and reject the
man Christ and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
which was
wrought without them:
Reader, in this book thou
wilt not meet with high-flown
aerie notions, which
some delight in, counting
them high mysteries, but
the sound, plain, common
(and yet spiritual and
and mysterious) truths of
the Gospel, and if thou art
a believer thou must
needs reckon them so, and
the more, if thou hast not
only the faith of them in
thy heart, but art daily li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the spiritual sence
and feeling of them, and of
thy interest in them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth this Treatise of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to the doubtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversial
<pb facs="tcp:102699:10"/>
things, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of opinion, as some
Books chiefly doe, which
when insisted upon more,
the weightier things of
the gospell, have alwayes
done more hurt then
good: but here thou hast
things certain, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed, which
thou canst not too much
study. Therefore pray,
that thou maiest receive
this word which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Scriptures in
faith and love, not as the
word of man, but as the
word of God, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of persons, and be
not offended because
Christ holds forth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
treasure of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to thee in a poor ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
vessell, by one, who
<pb facs="tcp:102699:11"/>
hath neither the greatness
nor the wisdome of this
world to commend him
to thee; for as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
saith, Christ (who
was low and contemptible
in the world himself) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
chuseth such for
himself, and for the doing
of his work, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26,
27, 28. Not many wise
men after the flesh, not
many mighty, not many
noble are called: but God
hath chosen the foolish
things of the world, &amp;c.
this man is not chosen out
of an earthly, but out of
the heavenly University,
the Church of Christ,
which Church, as furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with the spirit, gifts,
and graces of Christ, was;

And though this man hath
not the learning or wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of man, yet, through
grace, he hath received
the teaching of God, and
the learning of the spirit
of Christ, which is the
thing that makes a man
both a Christian and a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Gospell, as
<hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 4. The Lord God
hath given me the tongue
of the learned, &amp;c. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 18.
where Christ, as man, saith,
the spirit of the Lord is
<pb facs="tcp:102699:12"/>
upon me, because he hath
anointed me to preach
the gospel to the poor, &amp;c.
<hi>He hath, through grace, taken
these three heavenly degrees,</hi>
to wit, <hi>union with Christ,
the anointing of the spirit,
and experience of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
of Satan, which doe

            <p>My end in writing these
few lines is not to set up
man, but having had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
with many other
saints of this mans sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the faith, of his
godly conversation, and
his ability to preach the
gospel not by humane art,
but by the spirit of Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:102699:12"/>
and that with much suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
in the conversion of
sinners when there are so
many carnal empty prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
both learned and
unlearned; I say, having
had experience of this,
and judging this Booke
may be very profitable to
many others, as well as to
my selfe: I thought it my
duty upon this account
(though I be very unfit
for it) to beare witnesse
with my brother to the
plain and simple (and yet
glorious) truths of our
Lord Jesus Christ. And
now Reader the Lord give
thee and me a right
understanding in these
things, that we may live
and dye not with a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
notional dead faith,
<pb facs="tcp:102699:13"/>
but with a right spiritual
lively faith of Christ, in

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, wrought by
the mighty power of
God; such a faith as may
make Jesus Christ more
reall and precious to us
then any thing in the
world, as may purifie our
hearts, and make us new
creatures, that so we may
be sure to escape the

               </gap>eele sin to be a

sinfull: Then in the
2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> place, his design is to drive

thee that thy sins are
too big to be pardoned, he
will seek by all meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to aggrovate them by all
the circumstances of time,
place, person, manner, nature
and continuance of thy sins,
he will object in thy soul, thou
hast out-sinned grace, by
rejecting so many exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

many reproofs, so many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of grace; hadst thou

been well with thee, but now
thou hast stood it out so long
that there is no hope for thee:
thou mightest have come
sooner, if thou didst look to
be saved, but now it is too
late. And withall, that he
might carrie on his designe
upon thee to purpose, he will
be sure to present to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
the most sad sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of the Scripture; yea,
and set them home with such
cunning arguments, that if it
be possible, he will make thee
dispair, and make away thy
self, as did <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he be prevented in
this his intended purpose;
the next thing he doth beset
thee with, is to make thee rest
upon thy own righteousnesse,
telling thee, that if thou wilt
needs be saved, thou must
<pb facs="tcp:102699:16"/>
earn heaven with thy fingers
ends; and it may be, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
to thy soule such a

And thou having
(but in the strength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
kept thy self from thy
former grosser polutions, and
it may be from some more
secret sins, art ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
now thou dost well;
now God accepts thee; now
he will pardon, yea, hath
pardoned thee; now thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is good: &amp; so goest on
till thou meetest with a sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
word, and Ministery,
which tels thee, and discovers
plainly unto thee, that thou
doest all this while deceive
thy self, by a vaine hope and
confidence; for though thou
seek after the Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
<pb facs="tcp:102699:17"/>
thou hast not yet
attained to the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
nor yet canst,
because, thou seekest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t not by
faith, <hi>but as it were by the
works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9.
31, 32. Here again, thou art
left in the mire, and now
peradventure thou seest, that
thou art not profited by the
works of the Law; nor thy
own righteousness: And this
makes thee stirre a little, but
in processe of time, (through
the subtil sleights of the devil
and the wickednesse of thine
own heart;) thou forgettest
thy trouble of Conscience, and
and slippest into a notion of
the Gospell, and the grace
thereof; and now thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
thy self cock sure: Now
thou art able to say, he that
lives and dies in his sins shall
<pb facs="tcp:102699:17"/>
be damned for them: he that
trusts in his owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shall not be saved: Now
thou canst cry Grace, Grace,
its freely by grace, its through
the death of the man Christ
Jesus, that sinners doe attain
unto eternal life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.
This I say thou hast in the
notion, and hast not the
power of the same in thine
heart, and so it may be thine
head is full of the knowledge
of the Scriptures, though
thine heart be empty of
sanctifying grace. And thus
thou do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st rejoice for a time:
yet because thou hast not the
root of the matter within
thee, <hi>in time of temptation
thou fallest away,</hi> Luke
8. 13.</p>
            <p>Now being in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and thinking thy self
<pb facs="tcp:102699:18"/>
to be wondrous well, because
of that Notion of the Truth,
and that notion thou hast in
the things of God: I say
being in this state, thou art
lyable to these dangers. First,
Thou art like to perish if thou
die with this notion in thine
head, except God out of his
rich gr ace doe work a saving
work of grace, and knowledge
in thy heart; for know this,

mysteries and yet be a
Castaway, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3.
Or else. Secondly, thou art
lyable to the next damnable
heresy that the Divel sendeth
into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that at last through
<pb facs="tcp:102699:18"/>
the delusions of the Divell,
thou mayst have thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
seared as with an hot
iron, so hard, that neither
Law, nor Gospel, can make
any entrance thereinto, to the
doing of thee the least good.
And indeed, who are the men
that at this day are so delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and
other pernicious Doctrines?
but those who thought it
enough to be talkers of the
Gospell, and Grace of God,
without seeking and giving
all diligence to make it sure
unto themselves? And for
<hi>this cause God hath sent
them strong delusions,
that they should believe a
lye: That they all might
be damned, who believed
not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102699:19"/>
as it is written, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>
2. 11, 12. And indeed if you
marke it, you shall see, that
they be such kinde of people,
who at this day are so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with the <hi>Quakers</hi>
delusions; namely, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of loose <hi>Ranters,</hi> and
light Notionists, with here
and there a Legalist, which
were shaking in their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
from time to time,
sometimes on this Religion,
sometimes on that: and thus
these <hi>Vnstable Souls</hi> are
deluded and beguiled at last,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. So that these
who before (as one would
have bought) had somthing
of God in them, are now
turned such enemies to the
glorious truths of the Gospel,
that there is none so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
erroneo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s as they. And
<pb facs="tcp:102699:19"/>
indeed it is just with God, to
<hi>give then over to believe
a lye,</hi> 2 Thes. 2. 11. who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were so idle that they
would not receive the Truth
of God into their hearts, <hi>in
the love of it:</hi> And to be

they migth be saved.</p>
            <p>But you will say, what lyes
are those, that the Divell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guileth
poor souls with all?
I shall briefly tell you some of
them, but having before said
that they especially are lyable
to the danger of them, who
slip into high Notions, and
rest there; taking that for
true faith which is not. I
shall desire thee seriously to
consider this one Character
<pb facs="tcp:102699:20"/>
a Notionist. Such an one,
whether he perceives it or
not, is puffed up in his fleshly
mind, and advanceth himself
above others, thinking but
few may compare with him
for religion and knowledge
in the Scriptures, but are
ignorant and foolish in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of him: (thus know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
puffeth up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1.)
whereas when men receive
truth in the love of the truth,
the more the head and heart
is filled with the knowledge
of the mysterie of Godlinesse,
the more it is emptied of its
own things, and is more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of its own vileness, and
so truly humbled in its own
eyes.</p>
            <p>And further, a Notionist,
though he fall from his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
strictness and seeming
<pb facs="tcp:102699:20"/>
holiness, and appeare more
loose, and vain in his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
yet speaks as confidently
of himself, as to assurance of
Salvation, the love of God,
and union with God, as ever.
But now to return, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
some of those lyes
which the Divell perswades
some of these men to believe.
First, That salvation was not
fully, and completely wrought
out for poor sinners by the
man Christ Jesus, though he
did it gloriously, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38,
39. by his death upon the
cross, without the gates of
<hi>Jerusalem, Heb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 13, 12.
compared with <hi>Jo.</hi> 19. 20.</p>
            <p>2. This is another of his
lyes wherewith he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
poor sinners, bidding
them follow the light that
they brought into the world
<pb facs="tcp:102699:21"/>
with them, telling them, that
light will lead them to the
Kingdome; for (say they)
it will convince of sinne, as
swearing, lying, stealing,
covetousness, and the rest of
the sins against the Law,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>But the Law
is not of faith, Gal.</hi> 3. 12.
And then I am sure, that it,
with all its motions and
convictions, is never able to
justifie the soul of any poor
sinner. <hi>For as many as are
of the works of the Law
are under the Curse: for it
is written, Cursed is every
one that continueth not
in all things that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Book of the law
to doe them, Gal.</hi> 3. 10.
<hi>but that no man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the law is evident,

faith, ver.</hi> 11. Now because
I am not altogether ignorant
of the delusion of the Divell
touching this grace of faith
also, I shall therefore in short
give thee (reader) a briefe,
yet true description from the
Srcipture 1. What true
justifying faith is, and what
it laye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hold upon. 2. I shall
shew who it doth come from.
3. That every one hath it
not. 4. What are the fruits
of it. First therefore True
faith is a fruit, work, or gift
of the Spirit of God. (<hi>Gal.</hi>
5. 22. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 11. and
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9.) whereby a
poor soul is enabled through
the mighty operation of God
(<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12.) in a sence of
its sins and wretched estate
to lay hold on the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
bloud, death, resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:102699:22"/>

31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 12. according to
that saying in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Now
faith is the substance of
things hoped for, and the
evidence of things not seen;
that is, the things that are
hoped for faith sees, layes
hold upon, and embraces
them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. as if they
were present: yea, it seales up
the certainty of them to the
soule. Therefore saith the
Apostle it is the evidence, or
testimony, or witness, of those
things that are not seen as
yet with a bodily eye: which
<pb facs="tcp:102699:22"/>
are obtained by the bloud of
the man Christ Jesus, <hi>Heb.</hi>

things that God hath laid up
for them that feare him,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you would
know who this faith comes
from, read <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>For
by grace ye are saved</hi>
(saith the Scripture)
<hi>through faith, and that
not of your selves it is the
gift of God.</hi> Againe, in
<hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. it is thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
<hi>For unto you</hi> (that
is believers) <hi>it is given in
the behalf of Christ, not
only to believe on him,
but also to suffer for his
sake:</hi> And thus much doe
the Apostles hold forth to us
<pb facs="tcp:102699:23"/>
in their prayer, or request t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. and he
is therefore called <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and finisher of our
faith, Heb.</hi> 12. 3. also we
find in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. that, <hi>Every
good and perfect gift is
from above and commeth

faith comes from God, for
true justifying faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a good
gift, and perfect in respect of
the Author God, in respect of
its object, Christ; and in
respect of the nature, though
not in respect of the degree,
and measure of it in us: even
as a grain of gold, is as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
gold, as a pound of gold,
though not so much.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>All men have not

and unbelieving is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pure, &amp;c. It appeareth
also in this, that all doe not
attain salvation, which they
must needs doe if they had
true justifying faith; compare
<hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. and 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.

<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 3. with <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and
11. <hi>they that believe shall

            </p>
            <p>4. The fruits of it are,
first, to purifie the heart, <hi>Acts</hi>
15. 9. and 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 3. and
that, as I said be fore, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hold on what Jesus Christ
hath done and suffered for
sinners, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38, 39.</p>
            <p>2. It fills the soule with
<pb facs="tcp:102699:24"/>
peace and joy, in that it layes
hold on the things that are
obtained for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 1.
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>It makes the Soule to
wait patiently,</hi> for the glory
that is to be revealed at
the second appearing of
the man Christ Jesus,
whom God hath raised
from the dead; which
hath also delivered it
from the wrath to come,

doth the Divell make his

               </gap>usions take place in the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rts of poore creatures?
<hi>Ans.</hi> Why. 1. he labours to
render the doctrine of the
Lord Jesus, and Salvation by
him alone, very odious and
<pb facs="tcp:102699:24"/>
low: and also his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as hearing, reading,
meditation, use of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
&amp;c. telling poore
sinners that these things are
but poore, low, carnal, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly,
empty Notions; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
up by the Clergie-men,
who are the Scribes and
Pharis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of this Generation;
who have the letter, but not
the Spirit of God in them;
which lead men into the
forme, but not into the power
of the Lord Jesus: And with
this perswasion, he also repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
the ungodly and base
carriage, or behaviour of
some, who have taken in
hand to preach the Doctrine
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
thereby he doth render the
Gospell of our Lord Jesus the
more contemptible and base.
<pb facs="tcp:102699:25"/>
But Woe, woe, woe, be to
them by whom such offences
come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>Lu.</hi> 17. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>2. He pretends to lead
them up into some higher
light, mysteries, and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Spirit, into which
but a very few have attained
or can attain, also bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
their affections, and
taking them with an earnest
pursuite after these his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
truths: perswading
them, that they shall be as
God himself, able to discerne
between good and evill, <hi>Gen.</hi>
3. 5. And in this he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
subtile and expert,
as having practised it ever
since the dayes of <hi>Adam.</hi>
These things being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
and in some measure
hungred after, and the rather
because they are good (as
<pb facs="tcp:102699:25"/>
they thinke) to make one
wise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. The poore
Soule is all on the sudden pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with a desperate Spirit
of delusion, which carries it
away headlong with some
high, light, frothy Notions,
and spiritual wickednesse
(which drown it in perdition
and destruction) that doth
feed and tickle the heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
while, to the end it may
make way for a farther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of it selfe in the
poore deluded soule; which
when it hath attained to, it
doth then begin to bring the
soule into a clearer sight of
those things, which it was
loth it should know at the
first: but having fitted the
soule by degrees, for a further
possession of it self, at last it
begins to hold forth its new
<pb facs="tcp:102699:26"/>
Gospell; shewing the soule a
new Christ, and new Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
The new and false
Christ, is a Christ crucified
within, dead within, risen
againe within, and ascended
within in opposition to the
Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> who was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
without, dead without,
risen againe without, and
ascended in a cloud away
from his Disciples into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
(<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9. 10, 11.)
without them.</p>
            <p>Now this new &amp; fals Christ
hath a new and false faith
belonging to his Gospell,
which faith is this, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
this Christ crucified
within, dead within, risen
againe within, and ascended
within. But aske them for
a Scripture that doth posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
prove their Doctrine,
<pb facs="tcp:102699:26"/>
they also have a Scripture, but
it is within, it doth bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
within, &amp; if they had not
that, (though that be of the
Divels making,) I am sure
they would have none out of
Gods holy Scriptures, for
they will allow of no crucified
Christ but he that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
without the gates of
<hi>Jerusalem:</hi>

hath it not is none of Christs.
So then, the<note n="*" place="margin">The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection answered.</note> Answer that I
give to the question, is this.
The Spirit of Christ that is
given to believers, is the
Earnest, or hope of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
that Christ hath
already purchased, and is
now preparing for so many
as he hath given, or shall give
this holy Spirit unto. And
for the proofe hereof, Read

(saith the Scripture) <hi>ye

that ye believed, ye were
<pb facs="tcp:102699:30"/>
sealed with the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of promise, which is
the earnest of our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi>
(which inheritance
is the eternal redemption
that was purchased by Christ
for poor sinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.)
<hi>untill the redemption of
the purchased possession,
unto the praise of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi>
Againe; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>for
ye through the Spirit wait
for the hope of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by faith.</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 1.
27. the Apostle speaking of
this great mystery, saith, <hi>To
whom God would make
known what is the riches
of the glory of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
among the Gentiles,</hi>
which is, Christ in you the
hope of glory, which glory
was then revealed to the
Saints no otherwise then by
<pb facs="tcp:102699:31"/>
faith, as the Apostle saith,
<hi>We rejoyce in hope of the
glory of God, Rom.</hi> 5. 2.
Which hope is begotten by
the Spirits shedding abroad
the love of God in our hearts,
<hi>ver.</hi> 5. which hope is not yet
seen, that is, not yet actually
enjoyed; for we are saved by
hope; <hi>but hope that is seen
is not hope; for what a
man seeth, why doth he
yet hope for? But if we
hope for that we see not,
then do we with patience
wait for it, Rom.</hi> 8. 24, 25.
And as I say, the cause of
believers hope is this, Christ,
or the Spirit of Christ in
them, the hope of glory. And
indeed he may well hope for
glory to come, who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
an earnest thereof gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him of God, and that
<pb facs="tcp:102699:31"/>
earnest no less than the Spirit
of the Lord Jesus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
16, 17.</p>
            <p>But now, this Spirit, which
is the Cause of a believers
hope, all men have not, <hi>Jude</hi>
19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9.

               <hi>He that is without sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

the Divell, that he might be
sure not to miss of his design,
labours by all meanes to
render the Scriptures also
odious and low, telling them
of the Scriptures within;
which Christ never taught,
nor yet his Disciples: But
they being given up of God
to a reprobate minde, have
given themselves over, rather
to follow the suggestions of
the Divel, then the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures

<hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 4, 7, 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.
4. 8. 12. But this designe
(as I told you) the Divell
carries on, by pretending to
shew them a more excellent
way which they may attaine
to, if they be but wise, and
follow what is made knowne
to them from the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them.</p>
            <p>But (Reader) that thou
mayest be able to escape the
snare of this cunning hunter,
I shall lay thee downe some
few directions, which if the
Lord give thee grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
thou shalt escape these
wicked delusions.</p>
            <p>And first of all, I admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
thee to be very serious
<pb facs="tcp:102699:33"/>
touching thine estate and
condition; and examine
thine own heart by the rule
of the word of God, whether
or no, thou hast as yet any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of desiring after
religion: and if thou findest
that thou hast lived untill
now in ignorance, and hast
not set thy selfe to remember
thy Creator as thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 1. then
I beseech thee consider that
thou art under the wrath of
Almighty God, and hast been
so ever since thou camest into
the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 2. being
thou in thy first parents didst
transgress against thy Maker,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Therefore
as by the offence of one,</hi>
that is, of Adam, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.
<hi>judgement came upon all
men unto condemnation.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102699:33"/>
Besides the many sins thou
hast committed ever since
thou wast born: Sins against
the Law of God, and sinnes
against the Gospell of the
grace of God: Sins against
the long suffering and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of God, and sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his judgements: Sins
of Omission and sins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
in thoughts, words
and actions: Consider I say
thy condition; yea get a very
great sense of thy sins that
thou hast committed; and
that thou mayest so doe, Beg
of God to convince thee by
his holy Spirit, not only of
sins against the Law, but also
of that damning sin, the sin
of unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>2. If thou by grace art
but brought into such an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
as to see thy selfe in a
<pb facs="tcp:102699:34"/>
lost Condition because of sin,
without the Lord Jesus: then
in the next place, have a care
of resting on any dutie done,
though it be never so spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
I say, have a care of
making any stay any where
on this side the Lord Jesus
Christ: but above all strive
to believe, that that very
man that was borne of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> did come into
the World, on purpose to save
thee, as well as other poore
sinners:
I say, thou must not
be content till thou art ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to say,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20. Rev. 22. 17.</note> 
               <hi>He loved me,
and gave himselfe for me.</hi>
And that thou mayest be sure
to attaine to this most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
faith, (for so it is) be
much in applying the freest
promises to thy own soule;
yea those that have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb facs="tcp:102699:34"/>
annexed to them, as
these, or other like, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 3.
<hi>Jer.</hi> 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. also <hi>Jo.</hi>
14. 19. <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 4. I say,
labour to apply to thy owne
soule in particular, the most
glorious and freest promises
in the book of God. And if
at any time the divell besets
thee by his temptations (for
so is his wonted manner to
doe, and so much the more as
he sees thee labour to get out
of his reach) I say, when he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thee with his fierie
darts, be sure to act faith
on the most free promises,
and have a care that thou
doest not enter into any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with him; but rather
resist him by those blessed
promises that are laid down
in the word of God: And
withall, be sure to meditate
<pb facs="tcp:102699:35"/>
upon the blood of the Man
Christ Jesus, who also is the
true God, and read those
Scriptures that doe most ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and cleerly speak of it; as
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi>
9. 14, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25.</p>
            <p>But if thou say (as it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the speech of poore soules
lying under a sence of Sin, &amp;
the apprehensions of wrath
due to it) I cannot apply the
promises to mine own soule;
and the reason is, because, my
sins are so great, and so
many: Consider, and know
it for a truth, that the more
and greater thou seest thy
sins to be, the more cause hast
thou to believe; yea, thou
must therefore believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thy sinnss are great:
<hi>David</hi> made it an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to himselfe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:102699:35"/>
the Spirit of the Lord
made it his encouragement,
to crave, yea to hope for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
because he had greatly
transgressed: <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 11.
<hi>For thy Name sake, O
Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>pardon
mine iniquitie, for it is
great.</hi> As if he had said, O
Lord, Thy name wil be more
glorified, the riches of thy
grace wil be more advanced,
thy Mercy and goodness will
more shine, and be magnified
in pardoning me who am
guiltie of great iniquitie,
than if thou pardonest many
others who have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
such hainous offences.
And I dare say, the reason
why thou believest not, is not
because thy sins are great, but
because thou doest reason too
much with that wicked ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
<pb facs="tcp:102699:36"/>
of mans salvation, and
givest way too much to the
fleshly reasoning of thine own
heart. For Christ hath said,
<hi>he that commeth unto me
I will in no wise cast out,
Joh.</hi> 6. 37. And againe,
<hi>Though thy sins be as red
as scarlet, they shall be as
white as snow, Jsa.</hi> 1. 18.
And Christ calleth those that
labour, and are heavy laden,
to come to him, with promise
to give them rest, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28.
Wherefore thou must not say,
my sins are too big; but thou
must say, because I am a
great sinner, yea, because I
have sinned above many of
my companions, and am
nearer to Hell and eternal
damnation than they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of my sins, therefore
will I crie unto the Lord, and
<pb facs="tcp:102699:36"/>
say, O Lord, Pardon my sins,
for they are great.</p>
            <p>Now that thou mayest not
be deceived in a matter of so
great concernment, have a
special care of these three
things. First, have a care
of putting off thy trouble of
Spirit the wrong way, which
thou mayest doe three wayes.
First, when thy Conscience
flieth in thy face, and tells
thee of thy sins, thou doest
put off convictions the wrong
way, if thou doest stop thy
Conscience by promising to
reform thy selfe, and lead a
new life, and gettest off thy
guilt by so doing: For though
thou mayest by this meanes
still and quiet thy conscience
for a time, yet thou canst
not hereby satisfie and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
the wrath of God; Yea,
<pb facs="tcp:102699:37"/>
saith God to such, <hi>though
thou wash thee with
Nitre, and take thee much
Sope, yet thine iniquitie
is marked before me,</hi> Jer.
2. 22.</p>
            <p>2. If when thou art under
the guilt of thy sins, thou put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
off convictions by thy
performances or duties, and
so satisfiest thy Conscience,
then also thou doest put off
thy Convictions the wrong
way: For God will not be
satisfied with any thing lesse
then the blood, righteousness,
resurrection, and intercession
of his own Son, <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 12.
and thou shouldest not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thy self with any less then
God would have thee to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
thy selfe withall; and
that is the water of life, <hi>Jsa.</hi>
55. 1, 2. which water of life,
<pb facs="tcp:102699:37"/>
thy duties and all thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is not, <hi>for it is but
menstruous ragges, Jsa.</hi>
64. 6.</p>
            <p>3. Have a care that when
thou art under conviction,
thou doest not satisfie thy self
with a notion of the free
grace of the Gospel; My
meaning is, doe not content
thy selfe with any measure of
knowledge that thou canst
attain unto, or bottome thy
peace upon it, thinking thou
art now well enough, because
thou canst speak much of the
grace of God, and his love in
Christ to poore sinners. For
this thou mayest have, and
do; &amp; yet be but a companion
for <hi>Demas,</hi> yea, for <hi>Judas</hi>
and the rest of the damned
multitude; As the Apostle
saith, <hi>For all this thou
<pb facs="tcp:102699:38"/>
mayest be but as sounding
brass, and as a tinckling
Cymball;</hi> that is, nothing
but a sound, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1.
2, 3.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, if thou
wouldst not be deceived, then
have a care to avoid false
Doctrines, which are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the spirit of the divel,
and not after Christ.</p>
            <p>As first, If any Doctrine
doth come unto thee, that tel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

                  </gap>an make us accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God, but the merits of Jesus Christ.</note> then canst not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
That is, if any man
come unto thee, and tels thee,
thou must doe such and such
works of the law, to the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
thou mayest present thy selfe
the better before God, doe not
receive him: <hi>For to him
that worketh not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
<pb facs="tcp:102699:38"/>
in him that justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the ungodly, his faith
is counted for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
Rom. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>2. If any come unto thee,<note place="margin">The Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is false.</note>
and bring such a Doctrine as
this; That thou mayest be
saved by grace, though thou
walk in the imaginations of

Doctrine also is divellish, doe
not receive him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.
19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>3. But if any come unto
thee, and doth in truth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the bloud, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
resurrection, intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and second comming of
that very man in the clouds
of heaven, that was borne of

presse thee to believe on what
he hath done, (shewing thee
thy lost condition without
<pb facs="tcp:102699:39"/>
him) and to own it as done
for thee in particular, and
withall doth admonish thee,
not to trust in a bare Notion
of it, but to receive it into
thy heart, so really, that thy
very heart and soule may
burne in love to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ againe: And doth
also teach thee, that the love
of Christ should and must
constraine thee, not to live to
thy selfe; but to him that
loved thee and gave himselfe
for thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 20, 21, 22, 23.

<pb facs="tcp:102699:39"/>
Receive that Doctrine
* and receive it really,<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is true, and of God, whatever the man be.</note> for it
is the Doctrine of God, and
of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4.

            <p>Againe, if thou wouldst
not be deceived, then, beware
of slighting any known truth
that thou findest revealed, or
made known to thee in the
Gospel; but honour, and obey
it, in its place, be it (as thou
thinkest) never so low, <hi>Joh.</hi>
14. 15.</p>
            <p>2. Have a care that thou
<pb facs="tcp:102699:40"/>
doe not undervalue, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
low thoughts of God,
Christ the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> and
the holy Scriptures; but
search them, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39.
And give attendance to the
reading of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13
for, I will tell thee he that
slights the Scriptures, doth
also slight him of whom they
testifie. And I will tell thee
also, that <hi>for this cause,
God hath given up many
to strong delusions, that
they might believe a lye:
that they all might be
damned who believed
not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
2 Thes. 2. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Therefore I say unto thee,
In the name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Son
of God, the very Creator of
<pb facs="tcp:102699:40"/>
heaven and earth, and all
things that are therein: have
a care of thy selfe, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
doth watch for thee day
and night, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. thine

therefore, have a care that
thou labour in the strength
of the Lord Jesus, to escape
all these things, For if thou
fall into any one of them, it
will make way for a further
income of sin and the divell,
through whose deceitfulnesse
thy heart will be hardned,
and thou wilt be more unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or reaping advantage, by
and from the Ordinances of

therefore, Give all diligence
to believe in the Christ of

all that he hath done, and is
doing, unto thy felfe, as for
thee in particular; which
thing if thou doest, thou shalt
never fall.</p>
            <p>And now Reader, I shall
also give thee some few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
and so I shall
commit thee to the Lord.</p>
            <p>1. Consider, That God
doth hold out his grace, and
mercy freely, and that to
every one, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17.
<hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>2. Consider, That there is
no way to attaine to this free
mercy and grace, but by him
that was borne of the Virgin
<pb facs="tcp:102699:41"/>
               <hi>Mary,</hi> for he himselfe saith,
I am the way, the truth, and
the life; No man cometh to
the Father but by me. <hi>Joh.</hi>
14. 6. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi>
1. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>3. Consider, if thou strivest
to go over any other way thou
wilt be but a thief and a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 1. compared

devil should be too hard for
thee and deceive thee by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
thee to embrace, or
entertaine a new Gospell;
which neither Christ, nor his
Disciples did allow of, it
would make thee gnash thy
teeth when it is too late.</p>
            <p>5. Consider, that though
<pb facs="tcp:102699:42"/>
thou hast been deluded by
Satan to this day, yet if now
thine eyes be opened to see
and acknowledge it, though
as yet thou hast been either
exceedingly wicked,<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> or an

all this there is hope, and if
now thou receive the truth in
the love of the truth, being as
willing to be rid of the filth
of sin, as the guilt of it, thou
shalt be saved.</p>
            <p>6. Consider, that the Lord
will call thee to judgement
for all thy sins past, present,
and what else thou shalt
practice hereafter; especially
for thy rejecting, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
on the bloud of his Son,
the Man Christ Jesus: And
if thou doest not agree with
<pb facs="tcp:102699:42"/>
thine adversary, now, while
thou art in the way, <hi>he will
deliver thee to the Judge,
and the judge will deliver
thee to the officer, &amp; if he
cast thee into prison; I
tell thee, thou shalt not
come out thence till thou
hast paid the very last
mite,</hi> Luke 12. 58, 59.</p>
            <p>And therefore I beseech
thee to consider: Here is at
this time, life and death;
heaven and hell; everlasting
joy, and everlasting torment
set before thee. Here is also
the way to have the one, and
the way to escape the other.
Now if the Lord shall do thee
any good by what I have
spoken, I hope it will be a

the Lord that ever he did use

first promised to the Fathers,
and afterward expected by
their children. But before I
doe that, I shall speak a few
words, concerning Gods fore-ordaining
and purposing, that
a Christ the Saviour should be,
and that before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.
Now God in his own
wisedom and counsel, knowing
what would come to passe, as
if it were already done, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.
17. He knowing that man
would break his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and so throw himselfe
under eternal destruction, did
in his own purpose fore-ordain
such a thing as the rise of him
that should fall, and that by
a Saviour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>According
as he hath chosen us in him</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Saviour) <hi>before the
foundation of the world.</hi> That
is, God seeing that we would
transgresse, and break his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
did before chuse
some of those that would fall,
and give them to him that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102699:45"/>
should afterward purchase them
actually, though in the account
of God his blood was shed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world was, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8.
I say, in the account of God
his son was slain; that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods purpose and
conclusion, which he purposed
in himself before the world was;
as it is written, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.
<hi>Who hath saved us, and called
us with an holy calling, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own purpose and
grace which was given us in
Christ before the world began.</hi> As
also in 1 Pet. 1. 20. where the
Apostle speaking of Christ, and
the redemption purchased by
him for sinners; saith of him,
<hi>Who verily was fore-ordained
before the foundation of the world,
but was manifest in these last
dayes for you who by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>m doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in God that raised him from
the dead.</hi> God having thus
purposed in himselfe that he
would save some of them that
by transgression had destroyed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102699:46"/>
themselves, did with the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
son of his love make an
agreement, or bargain, that
upon such and such terms, he
would give him a company of
such poor soules as had by
transgression fallen from their
own innocency and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
into those wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
that they themselves
had sought out, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 29.
The agreement also how this
should be, was made before the
foundation of the world was
laid, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. The Apostle,
speaking of the promise, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made between God and
the Saviour (for that is his
meaning) saith on this wise,
<hi>In hope of eternal life, which God
that cannot lye, promised before
the world began.</hi> Now this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
or covenant, was made
with none but with the son of
God, the Saviour: And it must
needs be so, for there was none
with God before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
but he by whom hee made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102699:46"/>
the world; as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. from
<hi>v.</hi> 22. to <hi>v.</hi> 31. which was and
is the Sonne of his love.</p>
            <p>This Covenant, or Bargain,
had these conditions in it.</p>
            <p>First, that the Saviour should
take upon him flesh and blood,
the same nature that the
sonnes of men were parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of (sinne onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15.
And this was the will or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that God had made with
him: And therefore when he
speaks of doing the will of
God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. he saith, <hi>a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
hast thou prepared me</hi> (as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thy promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
15. which I was to take of a
woman) and in it I am <hi>come to
do thy will O God, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of me in the volume of thy
Book,</hi> v. 7.</p>
            <p>2. The Saviour was to bring
everlasting righteousnesse to
justifie sinners withal, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.
24, 25. The Messias, or Saviour
shal bring in everlasting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102699:47"/>
and put an end to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
as it is there written.
To make an end of sins, and
to make reconciliation for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and to bring in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
righteousnesse. This,
I say, was to be brought into the
world by the Saviour, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the covenant, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that was between
God and Christ before the
world began, which God, that
cannot lye, promised at that
time,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p>3. He was to accomplish th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
everlasting righteousnesse by
spilling his most precious
blood, according to the terms
of the covenant or bargain;
and therefore when God would
shew his people what the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was that he and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
had made, even before
the Covenant was accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and sealed actually. See for
this <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">When these words were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Covenant was not actually sealed; for that was done when the blood of Christ was let out upon the cross.</note> (where he is spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of him that should be the
Saviour) <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>And as for thee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102699:47"/>
also</hi> (meaning the Saviour) <hi>by
the blood of thy Covenant;</hi> or as
some render it, whose Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is by blood (which is all
to one purpose) I (meaning
God) <hi>have sent forth the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
out of the pit wherein there
was no water.</hi> The meaning is
this: As for thee also, seeing
the covenant or bargain that
was made between me and
thee before the world was, is
accomplished in my account,
as if it were actually and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done; with all the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that were agreed upon
by me and thee; I have
therefore, according to that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
that was on my part,

by his transgression then
God brings out of his love
that which before he and his
Son had concluded upon and
begins now to make forth that
to the world, which he had
purposed in himselfe before
the world began, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1 4. 9.
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. Now the first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
that was made to a lost
creature of the love of God,
was made to fallen <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi>
3. 15. where it is faid, <hi>I will put
enmity between thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and between thy seed and
her seed,</hi> which is the Saviour,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. it shall break thy
head, and thou shalt bruise
his heel. This was the first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the love of God to
lost man: This was the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
which was preached to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
in his generation; in
these words was held forth to
them in that generation, that
which should be further accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
in after generations.</p>
            <p>2. Another discovery of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102699:49"/>
love of God in the Gospel,
was held forth to <hi>Noah,</hi> in that
he would have him to prepare
an Ark to save himself withal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
which Ark did type out the
Lord that was to come, and
be the Saviour of those whom
he before had covenanted for
with God the Father. <hi>And
God said to</hi> Noah, <hi>the end of all
flesh is before me. Make thee an
Ark of Gopher wood,</hi> Gen. 6.
13, 14. And Chap. 7. 1. <hi>The
Lord said unto</hi> Noah, <hi>come thou
and all thy house into the Ark,
for thee have I seen righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me in this generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. God breaks out with a
further discovery of himself in
love to that generation in
which <hi>Abraham</hi> lived, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.
3. where he saith, <hi>And in thee,</hi>
(that is, from thee shall Christ
come thorow, in whom) <hi>shal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the families of the earth be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
This was also a further
manifestation of the good will
of God to poor lost sinners;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102699:49"/>
and through this discovery of
the Gospel, did <hi>Abraham</hi> see
that which made him rejoyce,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 56.</p>
            <p>4. When the time was come
that <hi>Moses</hi> was to be a Prophet
to the people of his Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then God did more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
yet break forth with one
type after another; as the blood
of Buls, &amp; Lambs, &amp; Goats: Also
Sacrifices of divers manners,
and of several things, which
held forth that Saviour more
clearly which God had in his
own purpose &amp; decree determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be sent; for these things
(the types) were a shadow of
that which was to come, which
was the substance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9.
10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 5, 6, 7. Now
when these things were thus
done, when God had thus sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
to the world what he
intended to doe in after times,
presently all that had faith to
believe that God would be as
good as his word, began to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102699:50"/>
look for, and to expect that
the Lord should accomplish
and bring to passe what
he had promised, what his
hand and counsel had before
determined to be done.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Abraham</hi> begins to look
for what God had promised
and signified; namely, that he
would send a Saviour into the
world in his appointed time;
which thing being promised,
<hi>Abraham</hi> embraces, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the certainty of it,
as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. and this did
fill his heart with joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as I said before; for he
saw it, and was glad, <hi>John</hi> 8.
56.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Jacob</hi> also, while he was
blessing his Sons concerning
things to come, breakes forth
with these words, I have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for thy salvation. He was
also put in expectation of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to come by this Saviour.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>David</hi> was in earnest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of this, which was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102699:50"/>
held forth by types and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes

Where by the way take notice,
that the true Salvation and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of Israel, was to come out
of Sion, that is, out of the
Church of God, touching the
flesh, as it is written, <hi>A Prophet
shall the Lord your God raise up
unto you of your brethren like unto
me,</hi> Deut. 18. 15, 18. <hi>And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
I have laid help upon one

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102699:51"/>

               </gap>
is over all, God blessed for ever.
<hi>Christ as concerning the flesh,
did come of the fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Isaiah</hi> did prophesie of
this, that God would thus save
his people, yea, he breaks forth
with these words, <hi>But Israel shal
be saved with an everlasting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
Isa. 45. 17. He also tels
them how it shall be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in that 53. <hi>Chap.</hi> Yea, he
had such a glorious taste of the

               </gap>
though it had then been actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done.</p>
            <p>5. In the dayes of <hi>Jeremie</hi>
this that God had promised to
the fathers, was not yet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished;
in <hi>cap.</hi> 23. 5. he saith,
<hi>behold the dayes come saith the

<hi>shall be saved, and Israel shall

dwell safely, And this is his name
wherewith he shall be called, The
Lord our righteousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. He was also to come in
<hi>Zacharies</hi> time, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 8. where
he saith, <hi>For behold I will bring
forth my servant the Branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. He was not come in the
time of <hi>Malachy</hi> neither, though
he was indeed at that time
neer his comming. For he
saith himself, <hi>Behold, I will send
my Messenger</hi> (meaning <hi>John</hi>

the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Old <hi>Simeon</hi> did also wait
for the consolation of Israel a

is said, And behold there was a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rove it by are these.</p>
            <p>1. Because, it was man that
had offended, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ustice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that man must give the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:
And therefore, when
he that should be the Saviour,
was come, <hi>he tooke upon him the
forme of a Servant, and was
made in the likeness of men,</hi> Phil.
2. 7. And in Heb. 2. 14. <hi>Because
the children were partakers of flesh
and blond he also himself likewise
took part of the same:</hi> to what
end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>that through death he might
destroy him that had the power of
death that is the Dwell.</hi> And is
that all? No, but also that <hi>he
might deliver them who through
feare of death, were all their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102699:53"/>
life time subject to bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second argument is this,
because, if a Spirit only could
have made satisfaction for the
fin of mankind, and have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
Satan for man; without
the nature of man; either there
had been weaknesse in God
when he made that promise to
fallen <hi>Adam, That the seed of the
woman should break the serpents
head:</hi> (for there had been no
need of, and so no room for
that promise) or else God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made it would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
unfaithful in not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his promise by redeeming
the world without it.</p>
            <p>3. If a Spirit only could have
made satisfaction, and so have
saved man; then Christ needed
not to have come into the
world, and to have been borne
of a woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. but in
that he must come into the
world, and must be borne of a
woman, it is cleer, that without
this he could not have been a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102699:53"/>
Saviour: for he was made of a
woman, made under the law, to
this end, that he might redeem
them that were under the law;
Implying,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> No subjection to this
(<hi>viz.</hi> the taking of the nature
of Man) no redemption from
the curse of the law. But Christ
hath delivered from the curse
of the law, (all that believe in
his name) being in their Nature
made a curse for them.</p>
            <p>And this is the reason, why
the fallen Angels are not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from their damnable
estate, because, he did not take
hold of their<note n="*" place="margin">They that are redeemed must have redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought out for them thorow their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for except that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that sinned do bring in recovery from the curse that is due to it for its sin, that nature that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned must suffer for its own sin.</note> nature, <hi>For he
tooke not on him the nature of
Angels, but he tooke on him the
seed of Abraham, Heb.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
            <p>Now then, seeing this is the
very truth of God, I shall next
prove, that Jesus that was born
of the virgin, to be the Saviour:
And first, I shall prove it by
comparing some places of the
old and new Testament toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by some arguments
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102699:54"/>
drawn from the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And first, see <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.
where he is called the seed of
the woman, saying, <hi>I will put
enmity between thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and between thy seed and
her seed;</hi> and so was Jesus, <hi>Gal.</hi>
4. 4. where it is said, God sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
forth his son made of a woman,
or borne of a woman.</p>
            <p>2. This woman must be a
virgin, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. 14. where it is
said, <hi>a virgin shall conceive and
beare a Sonne and shall call his
name Emanuel.</hi> And Jesus is he
that was the fulfilling of this
Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 22, 23. <hi>Now
all thus was done that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken of the
Lord by the Prophet, saying, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a virgin shall conceive, and
bring forth a son, and they shall
call his name Emanuel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Saviour must be of the

Luke</hi> 1. 32.</p>
            <p>And againe, The Jews knew
this very well, or else they
would have been sure to have
laid it open before all the
world; for they sought by all
meanes to disown him. And
though they did through the
divellishnesse of their unbeliefe
disown him, yet could they find
no such thing as to question the
right of his birth from <hi>Mary.</hi>
If it had been to be done, they
would no doubt haue done it;
they did not want malice to
whet them on; neither did
they want meanes so far as
might helpe forward their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
without manifest and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
injury; For they had
exact Registers or records of
their genealogies, so that, if
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102699:55"/>
they had had any colour for it,
they would sure have denyed
him to have been the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
There was reasoning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him when he was with
them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. and I do believe,
part of it was about the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which he came. And
this was so commonly knowne,
that the blind man that sat by
the way side could cry out, <hi>Jesus
thou Some of David, have mercy
on me; thou Sonne of David, have
mercy on me,</hi> Luke 18. 38, 39.
It was so common, that he came
from the loines of his Father
<hi>David</hi> according to the flesh,
that it was not so much as once
questioned. And when <hi>Herod</hi>
demanded (<hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6.) of
the chiefe Priests and Scibes of
the people where Christ should
be borne, <hi>they said unto him in
Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is
written by the Prophet, And thou
Bethlehem in the land of Judea,
art not the least among the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Judah, for out of thee shall

my people Israel:</hi> (For out of
thee) Mark that; if <hi>Mary</hi> had
not been of <hi>Judah,</hi> Christ had
not come out of <hi>Judah.</hi> But
Christ came out of <hi>Judah,</hi>
therefore <hi>Mary</hi> is also a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Judah.</hi> and this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as saith the Scripture, <hi>for
our Lord sprang out of Judah,</hi>
Heb. 7. 14.</p>
            <p>Againe, when Christ the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was to come into the
world, at that time the Scepter
was to depart from <hi>Judah,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the prophesie of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.
The Scepter shall not depart
from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from
between, his feet until Shiloh come,</hi>
Gen. 49. 10.</p>
            <p>Now the Scepter was then
departed from those that were
Jews by nature, and also the
lawgiver, and <hi>Herod</hi> who was
a stranger, and not of <hi>Judea,</hi>
was King over them, as <hi>Caesars</hi>
Deputy; and <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi>
imposed lawes on them.</p>
            <p>The stuborn Jews also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the Scepter to be depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102699:56"/>

they cryed out against Christ:

            <p>Nay further, the Jewes from

that the word <hi>Scepter</hi> in that
49. of <hi>Gen.</hi> is not meant of a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102699:57"/>
Kingly Government, but the

persecutions shall not depart

Now they doe most grosly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
that place; for though I am
not skilled in the Hebrew
tongue, yet through grace, I am
enlightned into the Scriptures,
whereby I find that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is not persecutions, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the rod of afflictions, but a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
or Scepter of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
shall not depart from
<hi>Judah</hi> till Shiloh come. And
that this is the meaning of the
place, weigh but the very next
words of the same <hi>verse,</hi> and
you will find it to be the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a King that is meant: for
he addeth <hi>nor a Lawgiver from

Scepter, nor a Lawgiver; the
Legislative power depending
on the Scepter of the Kingdom
shall not depart from <hi>Judah</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
Shiloh come. According
to that Scripture, written in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102699:57"/>
               <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>For before the Child

of the Scepter to be a

            <p>Againe, to prove that Jesus
is the Christ, it is cleer from the
hand of God against the Jews
for putting him to death:
What was the reason why they
did put him to death but this,
he did say that he was the
Christ the Sonne of God? <hi>Luke</hi>
22. 70. <hi>Then said they all, Art
thou the Sonne of God? And he
said, ye say that I am:</hi> that is,<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 9. 37.</note>
I am he as you say, I am the son
of God, Yea the only begotten
Son of the Father, and I was
with him before the world was.<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Jews did put him to
death for his thus owning his
own, That is, for not denying
of his Sonship, but making
himself equal with God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did they put him to death,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now God did, and doth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102699:58"/>
most miserarably plague them
to this very day for their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
of him; But I say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
he not been the Christ of God,
Gods Son, he would not have
laid sin to their charge, for cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
him; but rather have
praised them for their zeale,
and for taking him out of the
way, who did rob God of his
honour, in that he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
equal with God, and was
not. He would have praised
them for doing the thing that
was right, as he did <hi>Phinehas</hi>
the son of <hi>Eleaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>le,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 8.</p>
            <p>But in that he said he was
the Sonne of God, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it no robbery so to call
himself, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. And seeing
that they did put him to death,
because he said he was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Son
of God, And in that God doth
so severely charge them with,
and punish them for their sin in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102699:59"/>
putting him to death, for saying
that he was the son of God, it
is evident that he was and is
the sonne of God, and that
Saviour that should come into
the world. For his blood hath
been upon them to this very
day for their hurt, according
to their desire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 25.</p>
            <p>Againe, Jesus himselfe doth
in his day hold forth that he is
the Christ, where he saith, the
time is fulfilled and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven is at hand, <hi>Mat.</hi>
1. 15. What time is this th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

he saith Seventy weeks are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined

that Christ saith hath an end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and the argument that he
brings to perswade them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Gospel, is this, the
Kingdome of God is at hand,
(according as was prphesied of
it by <hi>Daniel</hi>) repent, and believe
the Gospel. Repent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that this is the Gospel;
And that this is the truth of
God, Consider, that <hi>Daniel</hi> had
a revelation of these daies from
the Angel of God, and also the
time in which it should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished:
Namely, Seventy
weekes was the determined
time of the Messias his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
from the time when the
Angel spake these words to
<hi>Daniel:</hi> Seventy weekes, that
is about 490 years, if you rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon

so is the holy Spirits way some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to reckon dayes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 6.
and this the Jews were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of, when Christ saith to

            <p>Another Argument that doth
prove this Jesus to be the Christ
is this, namely, he to whom
it was revealed that he should
see him, though he waited long
for him. So soone as ever he
did but see that sweet B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>be that

he cryed out, <hi>Lord, now lettest

eyes have seene thy Salvation,
which thou hast prepared before

all those that waited for redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
in Israel,</hi> ver. 36, 37, 38.</p>
            <p>Another Argument is the

makes this very thing an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of Man be three dayes and three
nights in the heart of the earth,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:102699:61"/>
Mat. 12. 39, 40. And this, the
Apostle makes mention of to be
accomplished, where he saith,
The Jews <hi>slew Jesus, and hanged
him on a tree, Act.</hi> 10. 39. <hi>and laid
him in a Sepulchre,</hi> Mat. 27. <hi>But
God raised him up the third day,
&amp; shewed him openly,</hi> Acts 10. 40.</p>
            <p>Another Scripture argument
to prove that Jesus is the Christ,
is this, that there was not one
of his bones broken, which
thing was foretold and typed
out by the paschal Lambe,
where he saith, <hi>thou shalt not
leave any of it until the morning,
nor break a bone of him,</hi> Exod. 12.
46. Numb. 9. 12. which thing
was fulfilled in the Sonne of
the Virgin, (though contrary
to the customes of this Nation)
as it is written, <hi>Then came the
Souldiers and brake the legs of
the first, and of the other that
was crucified with him. But
when they came to Jesus and saw
that he was dead already, they
brake not his legs,</hi> Joh. 19. 31, 32.

               <hi>That the Scripture should be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,

broken,</hi> ver. 36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Scripture demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
is, in that they did ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
the saying that was written,</hi>

is written:</hi> Then the Souldiers,
when they had crucified Jesus, took
his garments, and made four
parts, to every Souldier a part,
and also his coat. Now the coat
was without seame; They said

               </gap> lots, <hi>John</hi> 19. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>Againe, the Scripture saith,
they shall look on me whom
they have pierced, Zach. 12. 10.
But the Souldier thrust a spear
into his side, <hi>that it might be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102699:62"/>
fulfilled which was written, They
shall look on him whom they have
pierced,</hi> Joh. 19, 34, 35, 36, 37.</p>
            <p>Now then, seeing this is the
truth of God that Jesus that
was borne of the Virgin is the
Christ of God; how horribly
are those deceived who look on
Jesus the son of Mary,<note place="margin">A believer hath no law to fulfill for justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; only believe on what the man Christ Jesus hath done and be saved.</note> to be but

Christ Jesus hath obtained e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
righteousness, having
fulfilled all the law of God in
the body of his flesh wherein he
also suffered on the Cross with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the gates, and doth impute
this righteousness to poor man,
having accomplished it for him
in the body of his flesh, which
he took of the Virgin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4
God sent forth his son made of

a Curse for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. to

the law, That is to redeem such
as were ordained to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,

from the curse of the law.
And this he did by his birth,

by his obedience, yea, by
his perfect obedience he became
the Author of eternal salvation
to all them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi>
5. 8, 9. and by his doing and
suffering, did compleatly satisfy
the law and the justice of God,
and bring in that glorious and

which we had all eternally
been undone, and that without
remedy; for without shedding
of his blood there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.<note place="margin">See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. and Compare it with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 3. where he saith it is of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity that this man hath somwhat also to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, which man was Jesus, <hi>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Againe, Seeing Gods Christ
which was with him before the

took upon him flesh and blood
from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> (who

and in that humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
yielded himself an offering
for sin, (for it was the body of

<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22.) I say, seeing
the son of God as he was in a

deceived who own Christ no

without flesh and blood (for
he took that in time of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.) I say,
they are wickedly deluded who
own him no otherwise but as
he was before the world was:
For in their owning of him
thus and no otherwise, they do
directly deny him to be come

not of God; and this is that sprit
of Antichrist, whereof you have
heard that it should come, and
even now already it is in the

doth most notably wrest this
Scripture, as they do others, to
their own damnation, I shall
speak something to it; and
therefore, when he saith, every
Spirit that confesseth not that

is not of God, his meaning is,
Every spirit that doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102699:65"/>
that that Christ that was
with the father before the world
was, did in the appointed time
of the father come into the
World, took on him a body
from the virgin, and was very
man as well as very God, and
in that body of flesh did do and
suffer whatsoever belonged to
the sons of men for the breach
of the holy law of God, and
impute his glorious righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which he fulfilled in that
body of his flesh, to the soules
that shall believe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> what he
hath done and is a doing in the

the mind of the Spirit of God,
consider, First, he himself saith,
handle me and see, for a Spirit
hath not flesh and bones, as ye
see me have, when his disciples
had thought he had been but a
spirit, <hi>Luke</hi> 24 39, 40. Now
that in this flesh he died for
sins, consider secondly that
Scripture which saith, <hi>Who his

               </hi> (that is the Christ that

was born of the Virgin) <hi>did
bear our sins in his own body on
the tree.</hi> See Col. 1. 22. <hi>in the
body of his flesh,</hi> saith he, <hi>to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you holy and unblameable, &amp;
unreproveable in his sight.</hi> Now
that he arose again from the
dead with the body of flesh
wherewith he was crucified,
consider, that forenamed Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 39, 40. spoken
after his resurrection.</p>
            <p>Now that he went away with
the same body from them into
heaven, consider that it is said,
<hi>And he led them out as, farre as
Bethany, and he lift up his hands
&amp; blessed them: &amp; it came to pass
while he blessed them, he was carried
from them, &amp; carried into heaven,</hi>
Lu. 24. 50, 51. This is the meaning
of those words therefore; Jesus
Christ is come into the flesh, that
is, Jesus Christ hath come in the

hath brought us who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled

testifie these things plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be most true, yet there
be some places more pregnant
and pertinent to the thing then
others; and therefore I shall
mention some of them: As
first, minde that in</hi> Prov. 8. v.
22, &amp;c. <hi>and there you shall
finde him spoken of under the
name of</hi> Wisedome, <hi>the same
name that is given him in</hi> 1
Cor. 1. 24. <hi>I say in that place
of the</hi> Prov. <hi>above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
you shall find these expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102699:68"/>
from his own mouth.</hi> The
Lord possessed me in tho begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his way before his works
of old. I was set up from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
from the beginning: or
ever the earth was, when there
was no depths, I was brought
forth; while there was no
fountaine abounding with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Before the mountains were
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tled, before the hills, was I
brought forth. While as yet he
had not made the Earth, nor
the fields, nor the highest pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the dust of the world. When
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> prepared the Heavens, I was
there; when he set a compasse
upon the face of the depth: when
he established the clouds above;
when he strengthened the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of the deep: When he gave
to the Sea his decree, that the
waters should not pass <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
When he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the foundations of the Earth;
then was I by him, as one brought
up with him: And I was daily
his delight, rejoycing in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102699:69"/>
parts of the Earth, and
my delight was with the Sonne
of men. <hi>Also</hi> John 1. 1 2. <hi>you
have these words spoken of
Christ,</hi> In the beginning was
the word, and the word was with
God, and the word was God. The
same was in the beginning
with God. <hi>As also in</hi> Heb. 1. 2.
<hi>the Apostle being about to
prove the Sonne of</hi> Mary <hi>to be
very God, saith;</hi> He hath in
these latter daies spoken to us by
his Sonne; <hi>which sonne is the
sonne of</hi> Mary, <hi>as in</hi> Matth. 3.
<hi>But (saith the Apostle)</hi> Heb. 1.
8. <hi>to the Sonne he saith,</hi> Thy
Throne, O God, is for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
a Scepter of righteousnesse
is the Scepter of thy Kingdome.
<hi>Again, in</hi> John 17 5. <hi>you have
the words of the sonne of</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>for it, saying,</hi> And now Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
glorifie thou me with thine

had with thee before the world
was. <hi>Again, he himself saith,
before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102699:69"/>
And again, I and my Father
are one. And in</hi> Phil. 2. 5. <hi>the
Apostle saith,</hi> Let the same mind
be in you which was also in Christ
Jesus; who being in the form of
God, thought it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Christ himselfe saith,</hi> I am the

have I quoted some few Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to prove that the Sonne

the truth of this, <hi>viz.</hi> That

            <p>1. That they obey him, is
clear, if we compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.

that there came one of the
Angels of the seven vials, which

of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where,
speaking of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nne of <hi>Mary,</hi>

                  </gap> Fathers, who is over all, God
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102699:72"/>
blessed for ever, amen.</hi> And the
Apostle <hi>John</hi> doth also witness
as much, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 20. where
speaking of Jesus Christ, he
saith on this wise, <hi>And we
know that the Sonne of God is
come, and hath given us an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
that we might know
him that is true, and we are in
him that is true</hi> (Who is that?
why, saith <hi>John) even in his
Sonne Jesus Christ.</hi> Who is he?
Why, <hi>This is the true God, and
eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could here also bring in
the testimony of the very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
themselves, as <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 41.
<hi>Luke</hi> 8. 28. where he is by them
acknowledged to be the Son
of the living God: But it is
needlesse so to doe, for we have
plainly proved it already.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the several
Scripture-arguments, which
will prove that Jesus the son of
<hi>Mary</hi> is very God.</p>
            <p>And First, There is none but
he that is the true God, can
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102699:73"/>
satisfie the justice of the true
God for the breach of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Law: But if you compare
<hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 6. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17.
you shall finde, that Jesus the
sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> did give God
a full and compleat satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the breach of his holy
Law; therefore Jesus the son
of <hi>Mary</hi> must needs be the great
and true God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He that hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of his own to lay down his
life, and hath power of his
own to take it up again, mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
needs be the true God; but
this did Jesus the sonne of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Virgin; therefore h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
must needs be the true God, <hi>Job.</hi>
10. 8. <hi>Rom,</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">If all the Quakers and Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the world,: were but under the guilt of one sinful thought, it would make them to cry out with <hi>Cain</hi> my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is greater then I can bear, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13.</note> There was never
any able to bear the sins of all
the believers in the world, that
ever were, now are, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
shall be, but the true God
But Jesus, the sonne of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary,</hi> did bear them all,
in his own body on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:102699:73"/>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53 6. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Jesus the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sonne of <hi>Mary</hi>
must needs be true God as well
as man.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There was never
any meer man able, by his
own power, to overcome the
Devil in all his temptations,
but he that is also the true God
(for <hi>Adam</hi> in his state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
was overcome by them,
and fell under them:) But Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
the sonne of the Virgin did
overcome them all by his own
power; there ore (see <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
15. <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 5. <hi>Matth.</hi>
4. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.) he is very God as
well as very man.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There was never
any that did call himselfe the
true God (and was not) which
did please God in so doing,
But Jesus the sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> did
call himselfe the true God, or
account himselfe equal with
God (which is all one) yet
God was well pleased with
him,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Phil.</hi> 2, 6, 7. <hi>John</hi> 8. 29.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102699:74"/>
And therefore Jesus the sonne
of <hi>Mary</hi> must needs be true
God as well as man.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, There was never
any that had all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and in earth, but the true
God. Jesus the sonne of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who was espous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Joseph,</hi> hath all power
in Heaven and in Earth in his
own hand. Therefore, <hi>Matth.</hi>
28. 18. he is the true and great
God.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any able to keep poor souls
from falling from God, saving
he that is that is the true God.
Jesus the sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> did,
and doth this, <hi>John</hi> 10. 27, 28,
29, 30. <hi>John</hi> 17. 12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Never could any
justly call himselfe the first and
the last, except the true God,
nor truly (as the Lord did say)
<hi>I am.</hi> But these did Jesus the
sonne of <hi>Mary, Rev.</hi> 1. 1. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 8.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102699:74"/>
and <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 58. Therefore Jesus
must needs be true God as well
as man.</p>
            <p>9. Never was there any that
could absolutely forgive sinnes
but God, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 7 <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 21.
But Jesus the sonne of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary,</hi> can forgive sinnes,

               </hi> 2. 5. Therefore
Jesus the son of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <p>Tenthly, The Scriptures ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
call any the true and living
God; but he that is the true
God. The Scriptures call Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,

the true God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whether they be Thrones

<hi>John</hi> 2. 24, 25. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

Jesus the sonne of the Virgin is

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102699:76"/>
by whom God hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to us, by him also he made
the Worlds. And <hi>Col.</hi> 1. the
Apostle speaking of the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Saints, saith, <hi>Who
hath delivered you front the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of darknesse, and translated
you into the Kingdome of his dear
Sonne, in whom we have Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
through his blood, even the
forgivenesse of sinnes.</hi> And is
that all? No, but <hi>He is</hi> (also)
<hi>the image of the invisible God,</hi>
ver. 15. <hi>The first born of every
Creature.</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17.
<hi>By him were all things created
that are in heaven, and that are
in earth, visible and invisible,
whether they be Thrones, or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
or Principalities, or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
all things were created by
him and for him. And he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all things, and by him all
things consist.</hi> Also <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10.
it is thus written of this Sonne
of God, Christ Jesus the sonne
of <hi>Mary, And then Lord in the
beginning hast laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102699:77"/>
of the Earth, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
are the work of thy hands.</hi>
And again, <hi>John</hi> 1. and the first
nine verses, the Evangelist or
Apostle, speaking of the Son,
saith, <hi>In the beginning was the
Word,</hi> which Word was the
Son, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 12, 13. This Word
or Son was with God, and the
Word was God. All things
were made by him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him was not any thing
made that was made. <hi>In him
was life, and the life was the
light of men; And the light shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the darknesse, and the
darknesse comprehended it not.</hi>
But in the ninth verse of this
first Chapter of <hi>Joh.</hi> it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>That was the true light,
which lighteth every one that
cometh into the world.</hi> Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord hath brought me
thus farre; and because the
<hi>Quakers</hi> by wresting this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
do not onely split them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon it, but endeavor also
to split others, I shall therefore,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102699:77"/>
before I proceed any further'
speak a few words to it; and
they are these that follow.</p>
            <p>The Apostle in these nine
first Verses, or most of them, is
speaking of the Divinity, or
Godhead of the Sonne of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and shewing that he made
the World: Now in this ninth
verse he speaketh of Man as he
is in his comming into the
world, and not as he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
person. Now every
man, as he comes into the
world, receives a light from
Christ as he is God, which
light is the Conscience, that
some call Christ, though falsly.
This Light, or Conscience, will
shew a man that there is a
God, and that this God is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. This light
doth discover this Eternal God,
by his works in the world; for
saith the Scripture before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>The invis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble things of him</hi>
(meaning God) <hi>from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world are clearly seen,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102699:78"/>
being understood by the things
that are made; even his eternal
power and Godhead.</hi> This light
also will reprove of sinne, or
convince of, and make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
sins against the Law of this
Eternal God: So, that man,
before he is regenerate, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by that light to know that
sins against the Law, are sins
against God, as is manifested
in the unconverted Pharisees,
who, (as Christ told them)
had neither the love of God,
nor the word of God abiding
in them, <hi>John</hi> 5. 38, 42. yet
knew sins against the Law to
be sins; for they were offended
at a woman for committing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
which act was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 27, 28. by the Law;
and ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> said also, they were
convicted of sinne by their own
consciences, <hi>John</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Again, the Apostle writing to
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

them to walk or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. turnes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102699:78"/>
them to nature it selfe, saying,
<hi>Doth not even Nature it self teach
you &amp;c.</hi> This Light surely is that
wherewith Christ as he is God,
hath enlightned every man
that commeth into the world,
which doth convince of sins
against the law of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi>
1. 20. <hi>They are left without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.</hi>
That is, they have their
own conscience that doth shew
them there is a God; and that
this God is to be served and
obeyed: and the neglect of
this will be sure to damn them,
though the obedience to the
Law will not save them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not able to make
a full recompence to God for
the sins that are past; neither
are they able for the time to

            <p>But now, though Christ, as
he is God, doth give a light
to every one that cometh into
the world, which light is the
conscience (as they themselves
confesse) yet it doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow that this conscience
is the spirit of Christ, or the
work of grace, wrought in the
heart of any man whatsoever;
for every one hath conscience,
yet every one hath not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ: For <hi>Jude</hi> speaks
of a company of men in his
days, who had not the spirit
of Christ, <hi>Jude</hi> 19. <hi>These be
they who separate themselves,</hi>
(saith he) <hi>sensual, having not
the spirit.</hi> Yea, Heathens, Turks,
Jewes, Pagans, Atheists, have
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102699:79"/>
that also that doth convince
of sinne, and yet are so farre
from having the spirit of
Christ in them, that it is their
great delight to serve their
lusts, this world, their sinnes;
whereas the Apostle saith
plainly, <hi>If Christ be in you, the
body is dead because of sinne, but
the spirit is life for righteousnesse
sake.</hi> So that those who are
alive to their sinnes,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 10</note> have not
the spirit of Christ. Nay, let
me tell you, the very Devils
themselves,<note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> who were thrown
from their first state for sinne,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. have such a taste of
their horrible sins, that when
they did but suppose that Jesus
was come to put an end to their
tyrannical dealing with the
world, and to bring them to
judgement for their sinnes (to
which they know they shall be
brought) it made them cry out,
<hi>Art thou com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>the time? James</hi> doth

us, where he saith, <hi>The

James 2. 19. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of theirs is not a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Christ to save them;
for they know he did not take
hold on their Nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.
but they do beleeve that Christ
will come to their everlasting
torment; and the belief of this
doth make these proud Spirits
to tremble.</p>
            <p>Again, Man at his coming
into the world hath this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
given him, which
doth convince of sinne, <hi>John</hi>
1. 9. <hi>John</hi> 8. 9. yet man as he
commeth into the world, hath
not the spirit of Christ in him;
for that must be received after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
by the preaching of the
word, which is preached by
the Ministers and servants of

And again, in <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. <hi>verse</hi>
2. &amp; 5. compared together, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ye the spirit by the works
of the Law.</hi> (saith the Apostle)
<hi>or by the hearing of Faith? or
the Gospel, which is the word of

Spirit, as Christ saith, the world
cannot receive, because it seeth
him not, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ither knoweth him,
though his children shall have
fellowship with him, to the
great comfort of their owne
souls, <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>But now, this mercilesse but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherer
of men, the Devil, that
he might be sure to make the
soule fall short of glory, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
endeavours to perswade
the soule, that its state is good;
that it hath the spirit of Christ
in it; and for a proofe of the
same, saith he, turne thy mind
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102699:81"/>
inward, and listen within, and
see if there be not that within
thee that doth convince of sin:
Now the poor soule, finding
this to be so, all on haste (if it
be willing to professe) through
ignorance of the Gospel, Claps
in with these motions of in
own conscience, which doth
command to abstain from this
evil, and to practice that good;
which if neglected, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
and torment for the same
neglect of others, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15)
both now and hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now the soule seeing that
there is something within that
convinceth of sinne, doth all
on a sudden close with that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
supposing it is the spirit of
Christ, and so through this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
is carried away with the
teachings and convictions of
its owne Conscience (being
misinformed by the Devil) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the works of the law; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which, though it work all

               </gap>ys, and labour with might
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102699:81"/>
and maine, yet it never will
be able to appease the wrath
of God, nor get from under
the curse of the Law, nor get
from under the guilt of one
sinful thought the right way,
which is to be done by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what another man hath
done by himselfe,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3.
without us on the crosse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the gates of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> See
for this, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.
12. The one saith he bare our
sins in his own body on the
tree; the other saith it was
done without the gate.</p>
            <p>And thus the poor soule is
most horribly carried away
headlong, and thrown down
violently under the curse of the
Law, under which it is held
all its dayes, if God of his
meer mercy prevent not; and
at the end of its life doth fall
into the very belly of Hell.</p>
            <p>Again, that the Devil might
be sure to carry on his design,
he now begins to counterfeit
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102699:82"/>
the work of grace: Hence he is
very subtil, and doth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
himselfe into an Angel
of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. Now
he makes the soule beleeve that
he is its friend, and that he is
a Gospel-Minister; and if the
soule will but be led by what
shall be made known unto it
by the light (or conscience)
within, it shall not need to fear,
but it shall do well.</p>
            <p>Now he counterfeits the new
Birth, perswading them that
it is wrought by following the
light that they brought into
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>world with them. Now
he begins also to make them
run through difficulties; and
now like <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, they must
lance themselves with knives,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now they must wear no
hatbands; now they must live
with bread and water; now
they must give heed to seducing
spirits, and doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
which bids them abstaine
from marriage, and commands
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102699:82"/>
them to abstain from meates,
which God hath created to be
received with thanksgiving, of
them which love and know the
truth, as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3.
Now they must not speak, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
their spirit moves them,
(I doe not say the spirit of
Christ) though when it moves,
they will speak such sad blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
and vent such horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Doctrines, that it makes me
wonder to see the patience of
God, in that he doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
either the ground to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
her mouth, and swallow
them up, or else suffer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
to fetch them away alive,
to the astonishment of the
whole world.</p>
            <p>Object. But you will say, Doth
not the Scripture say that it is
the spirit of Christ that doth
make manifest or convince of sin?
<hi>John</hi> 16. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, it doth so. But
for the better understanding of
this place, I shall lay downe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102699:83"/>
this; namely, That there are
two things spoken of in the
Scriptures, which doe manifest
sin, or convince of sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, the Law, as saith the
Apostle,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. Therefore
by the deeds of the Law shall no
flesh be justified in his sight, viz.
<hi>Gods sight:</hi> For by the Law is
the knowledge of sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2. The Spirit of Christ doth
make manifest, or reprove of
sinne, as it is written,</hi> John 16.
8. 9. And when he (<hi>the Spirit</hi>)
is come, he will reprove the world
of sinne, of righteousnesse, and of
judgement; of sin, because they
believe not on me, <hi>saith the Son
of</hi> Mary, <hi>which is Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, the Law doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by its own power mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
sin without the spirit of
Christ;<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3, 4, 5. He hanged himselfe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> as in the case of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
who was convinced of the
sin of marther, which made
made him cry out, <hi>I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;</hi>
yet at that time he was
so farre from having the spirit
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102699:83"/>
of Christ in him, that he was
most violently possessed of the
Devil, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Again, Sometimes the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ takes the Law, and
doth effectually convince of
sin, of righteousnesse, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quaer.</hi> But you will say, How
should I know whether I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by the Law alone, or that
the Law is set home eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctually by
the Spirit of the Lord Jesus upon
my Conscience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Unto this I answer.
First, when the <hi>Law</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
by its own power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of the spirit of
Christ, it doth only convince
of sins against the Law; as of
swearing, lying, stealing, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
adultery, covetousness,
and the like. I say it doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make manifest sins against
the Law, pronouncing an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
curse<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10</note> against thee, if thou
fulfill it not, and so leaves thee;
but it gives thee no strength to

thy own strenth being insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for these things, having lost
it in <hi>Adam,</hi> thou art a breaker
of the Law. Here the Law finds
thee in the Sins, and condemns
thee for thy sins: but gives thee

of them: neither doth it shew

thee from them<note n="*" place="margin">For a proo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Apostle there speaks on this

obedience to the law, <hi>For when
the Gentiles which have not the

Which work of the law, Christ
as he is God, hath enlightned
every one withall, that cometh
into the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 19. which

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102699:85"/>

light, or law; for <hi>the law is light,</hi>
Prov. 6. 23. and gives <hi>the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Sin,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. And
therefore as I said before, so say
I now again, If thy convictions
are not other then for the sins
against the Law, though thy
obedience be the strictest that
ever was wrought by any man
(except the Lord Jesus, the son
of <hi>Mary</hi>) thou art at the best but
under the Law, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

how thou shouldest know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Spirit of Christ doth
effectually set home the law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

therefore to speak directly to it;
If the Spirit of the Lord Jesus,
the Son of God, doth set home
the Law effectually; then the
same Spirit of Christ shewes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102699:85"/>
thee more sin then the Sinnes
against the Law. For first it
shews thee, <hi>That all thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
is but as filthy-rags,</hi> Isa.
64. 6. Thou seest, all thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
meditation, hearing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
almes-deeds, fasting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and whatsoever else
thou hast done, doest, or canst
doe being an unbeliever, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
at the hands of God his
curse, and condemnation, and
that for ever: And therefore
thou art so far from trusting to it
that in some measure thou even
loathest it, and art ashamed of
it, as being a thing abominable,
both in Gods sight, and thine
own.<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> Thou countest thy own

to wrap thy selfe in,</hi> Isa. 28.

            <p>And these things thou seest
not overly, or slightly, and as at
a great distance, but realy, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102699:86"/>
seriously, and the sense of them
sticks close unto thee. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it shews thee that thou hast
no faith in the man Christ Jesus
by nature, and that though thou
hadst no other sins, yet thou art
in a perishing state because o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the Spirit, thou hast seen
that thou hadst no faith in

It shews thee also, that
thou canst not believe in thine

wouldst never so willingly, yea
though thou wouldst give all
the world (if thou hadst it) to
believe,<note place="margin">Because, faith is the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29.</note> thou couldst not. In

that if thou doest not believe in
the Man Christ Jesus, And that
with the faith of the <hi>operation
of God,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Col. 2. 12.</note> thou wilt surely perish,
and that without remedy. Also
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102699:86"/>
it shews thee that if thou hast
not that righteousnesse, which
the Man Christ Jesus accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
in his own person for
sinners, I say if thou be not
clo thed with that, in stead of
thine owne, thou art gone for
ever and therefore saith Christ,
(speaking of the Spirit) <hi>when
he is come, he shall reprove the

too,</hi> That is, The Spirit shall
convince men and women of
the sufficiencie, of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
that Christ in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature hath fulfilled: So
that they need not run to the
law for righteousness; <hi>for Christ
is the end of the law for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to every one that believeth,</hi>
Rom. 10. 4. Again, if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Jesus set eth home the
Law upon thy conscience, thou
wilt freely confesse, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the law curseth, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
thee for thy sins, and
gives thee no power either to
fulfill it, or to come out of thy

sins: yet God is just in giving
that law, And <hi>the Law is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

again, and again. And thus
have I briefly shewed you, First,
how Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> as he is God, doth
enlighten every man that comes
into the world. Secondly,
what this light will doe, <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
shew them that there is a God
by the things that are made;
and that this God must be
worshipped Thirdly, I have
shewed you the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that light, and the Spirit
of Christ the Saviour. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102699:88"/>
I have also shewed you how
you should know the one from
the other, by their several effects.
As first, the first light convinces
of sins, but of none other then
sins against the Law; neither
doth it shew the soul a Saviour,
or deliver (for that is the work
of the Spirit) from the curse
vvherevvith it doth curse it:<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 44.</note>
But I shevved you,<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 24</note> that vvhen
the Spirit of Christ comes, and
vvorkes effectually, it doth not
only shevv men their sinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Lavv; but also shevvs
them their lost condition, if
they believe not in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
<hi>blood, death, resurrection,
and intercession of Jesus Christ
the Son of Mary, the Son of God.</hi>
And thus much I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be spoken at this
time,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note> touching the nature of
Conviction.<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 9.</note>

thing to this thing already,
namely, concerning our Lord

            <p>For answer hereunto. First,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note>
when the fulnesse of time was
come wherein the salvation of
Sinners should be actually
wrought out, <hi>God sent forth his

made under the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 1.</note> (that is, he

            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:102699:90"/>
From whence take notice,
that when the salvation of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
was to be actually wrought
out, then God sent forth the
everlasting son of his love into
the world, cloathed with the
humane nature, according to
that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.
And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 16. which saith,
<hi>God was manifested in the flesh,</hi>
that is, took flesh upon him.</p>
            <p>2. This Sonne of God, which
is equal with the Father, did in
that Flesh, which he took upon
him, compleatly fulfill the
whole Law: So that the Apostle
saith, Christ is the very end of
the law for righteousnesse to
every one that believes.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4</note> This
righteousness, which this Christ
did accomplish, is called <hi>the
righteousnesse of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 22.
This righteousnesse of God, is
by the faith of Jesus Christ,
unto all, and upon all them that
believe: my meaning is, it is
imputed to so many as shall by
faith lay hold on it. This is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102699:90"/>
also part of the meaning of that
speech of the Apostle:<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 22</note> 
               <hi>As many
as were baptized into Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note>

have put on the righteousnesse
of Christ, with the rest of that
which Christ hath bestowed
upon you, having accomplished
it for you. This is also the
meaning of the Apostle, <hi>Col</hi> 2.
9, 10. where he saith, <hi>For in him</hi>
(that is, the sonne of <hi>Mary, chap.</hi>
1. 13 14.) <hi>dwelleth all the fulness
of the Godhead bodily. And ye
are compleat in him.</hi> That is, in
his obedience, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Which also the Apostle
himselfe doth so hard presse
after, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8. saying,
<hi>Doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lesse, I count all things but
losse, for the excellency of the
knowledge of Christ Jesus my
Lord, which Lord</hi> was crucified
by the Jews, as it is 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 2. 8.
<hi>for whom,</hi> that is for Christ, <hi>I
have suffered the loss of all things</hi>
(as well the righteousness of the
Law, in which I was blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102699:91"/>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 3. 6</note>as all other things) <hi>and
doe count them but</hi> dung. <hi>that I
may win Christ: And be found in
him, not having on mine owne

but that which is through the
faith of Christ, the righteousness
which is of God by faith;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 3. 22.</note> which
is unto all, and upon all them
that believe. That place also
in the ninth of <hi>Daniel, v.</hi> 24,
25. holdeth forth as much,
where prophecying of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,
he saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is he that

               </gap>y,
and to bring in everlasting
righteousness. Now that the
righteousnesse of the Sonne of
<hi>Mary</hi> is it, mind the 26. <hi>verse;</hi>

Threescore and two weeks shall
<hi>Messiah</hi> be cut off, That is, <hi>Christ
shall be crucified.</hi> But not for
himself, That is, not for any sin

committed none. Then surely,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102699:91"/>
it must be for the sins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 50. as the high Piest
said, It is expedient that one

And the sonne of God, <hi>Mat.</hi>
3. 17. And also the true God,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. And this Messias,
this son of the virgin, this sonne
of God, this tree God, did not
die for himself, for he had not
offended; Neither did he fulfill
the Law or finish transgression,
and bring in everlasting righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
for himself, for he had
not sinned, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

therefore see that place, <hi>Matt.</hi>
27. <hi>v.</hi> 57. and so forward. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that Jesus the Son of God
had been crucified a while, he
gave up the Ghost; that is, he
died; and after he had been a

went in to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

<hi>Joseph</hi> took the bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Also in <hi>Luke</hi> 24 51, 52, 53 The

Again, in <hi>Acts</hi>

And so much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>In the next place I am to

That very man, with that they
body wherewith he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
upon the crosse, did rise
again out of the grave in
which he was laid. And this
I shall prove by Scriptures, by
the testimony of Angels, by

was risen, and by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102699:94"/>
of the Apostles in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
First therefore cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him Master; which signifies
that he was risen, and that she
knew him after his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for he was come out of
the grave; see <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
another Scripture is that
in <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 1, 2, 3. The Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Jesus comming to the
Sepulchre, thinking to anoint
the body of Jesus, found the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102699:95"/>
stone that was on the mouth

               </gap>
in, they found not the body
of the Lord Jesus; and at
this they were troubled and
perplexed, <hi>v.</hi> 4. But as two of
them went up to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> and
were talking of what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
to Jesus, Jesus himselfe
drew near, and went with
them, <hi>v.</hi> 15. Another Scripture
is that in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 9. which
saith on this wise, Now when
Jesus was risen early the first
day of the week, he appeared
first to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of
whom he had cast seven devils.
Where take notice how the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost layes it down in these
words, Out of whom he had
cast seven Devils. To intimate
to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the certainty, that it was
the same Jesus that was born of
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who did many
miracles, and cured many
diseases, who did also cast se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Devils out of <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:102699:95"/>
that did rise again. Yea,
saith the holy Ghost, it was
the same Jesus that did work
such a wonderful miracle on
<hi>Mary,</hi> he appeared to her first,
out of whom he had cast seven
Devils. And let these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
suffice to prove the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the son of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you shall have the
testimony of the holy Angels
also by the Scriptures. And first
look into <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 3, 4, 5, 6,
and 7. <hi>verses,</hi> the words are
these, <hi>And they</hi> (viz the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples)
<hi>said among themselves,
Who shall roll away the stone?</hi>
They had a good mind to see
their Lord, but they could not,
as they thought, get away the
stone which covered the mouth
of the Sepulchre. And when
they looked (that is, towards
the Sepulchre) they saw the
stone rolled away, for it was
great; and entring into the
Sepulchre, they saw a young
man, that is, an Angel, sitting
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102699:96"/>
on the right side, cloathed with
a long white garment. And
they, the disciples, were affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And he said unto them,
be not afraid (you have no
cause for it) you seek Jesus of
<hi>Nazareth</hi> which was crucified;
He is is not here, he is risen,
behold the place where they
laid him. What Scripture
can be plainer spoken then
this? Here is an Angel of
the Lord ready to satisfie the
Disciples of Jesus, that he was
risen from the dead. And lest
they should think it was not
the right Jesus he spoke of,
yes, saith he, it is the same Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
that you mean; you seek
Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> do you not?
why, he is risen, he is not here.
But doe y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u speak seriously,
and in good earnest? Yea
surely, if you will not believe
me, behold the place where
they laid him. This Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or Testimony, is very
clear to our purpose. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102699:96"/>
the next place is in <hi>Mat.</hi>
28. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. In the third
<hi>verse</hi> there is an Angel (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
bearing witnesse of the
resurrection of Jesus. His
countenance was like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and his raiment white
as snow, and for fear of him
the Keepers did shake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
as dead men. And the
Angel answered and said unto
them (<hi>viz.</hi> to the women who
came to seek Jesus) Fear you
not: but let them that seek to
keep the Lord in his grave fear
<note n="*" place="margin">They are they that had need to fear and tremble; for they deny faith of the son of God.</note>if they will; for you have
no ground of fear, who seek
Jesus who was crucisied; He is
not here, for he is risen; he
cannot in be body here and
risen too: If you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
me, come, see where the
Lord lay, and go quickly and
tell his Disciples that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
from the dead, and behold,
he goeth before you into Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,
there shall you see him.
But shall we be sure of it? yea,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102699:97"/>
saith the Angel, Loe, it is
that have told you. See how
plainly this Scripture also doth
testifie of Christ his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Here, saith the Angel,
you seek a Saviour, and none
will content you but he, even
the same that was crucified:
Well, you shall have him, but
he is not here. Why where is
he then? He is risen from the
dead. But are you sure it is the
same that we look for? yea, it is
the same that was crucified, <hi>v.</hi> 5.
But where should we find him?
why he goeth before you into
Galilee, where he used to be
in his life time, before he was
crucified: And that you might
be sure of it there to find him,
know that he is an Angel of
God that hath told you, <hi>ver.</hi>
7. And thus have you in brief
the testimony of the Angels of
God, to witnesse that Jesus the
Son of the Virgin, the Son of
God, is risen from the dead.</p>
            <p>Object. But you will say, might
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102699:97"/>
they not be deceived? Might
not their eyes da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le, and they
might think they did see such a
thing, when indeed there was no
such matter?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Well, because it is so
difficult a matter, to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the truth of this thing,
that Christ is raised againe out
of the grave, that very man, with
that very body; though these
things that have been already
spoken, might be enough
(through grace) to satisfie, yet
because of the unbelief of some,
we shall turne to some more of
those infallible proofs that are
spoken of in <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3. to prove
the point yet more cleer. And
therefore First of all, do but see
how the Lord doth deale with
an unbelieving Disciple, <hi>John</hi>
20, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. You
shall see in the 23. <hi>ver.</hi> Christ
after his resurrection, is talking
with his Disciples, but <hi>Thomas
was not with them.</hi> But when
the Disciples saw him againe,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102699:98"/>
they said to him, <hi>We have seen
the Lord,</hi> ver. 25. but <hi>Thomas</hi>
would not believe them. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time Jesus comes to his
disciples again, and then <hi>Thomas</hi>
was with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then so soon
as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ord had said, Peace be
unto you, he turned himselfe to
<hi>Thomas,</hi> and said to him. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
Reach hither thy finger, and
behold my hands, and reach hither
thy hand, and thrust it into my
side, and be not faithless but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi>
v. 27. As<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much as if
the Lord should have said,<note n="*" place="margin">O how doth the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend! to the end he might streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the faith of one that is weak.</note>
Come <hi>Thomas,</hi> thou hast doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the truch of my resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
very much; Thou saiest
that thou wilt not believe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thou doe feel with thy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
the print of the nailes, and
doe thrust thy hand into my
side. Come <hi>Thomas,</hi> reach hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thy finger, and behold my
hands, and see if there were not
the nayls driven through them;
And reach hither thy hands
and thrust them into my side,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102699:98"/>
and feele if I have not the very
hole in it still, that was made
with the Speare that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
did thrust into it, and be
not so full of unbelief, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that my resurrection is a
glorious truth.</p>
            <p>Another in fallible proofe, is
that in <hi>Luke</hi> 24. from the 36.
to the end of the 44. <hi>verse.</hi> In
<hi>v.</hi> 36 it is said that the Lord,
(even while they were talking)
<hi>stood in the midst of them, and
said, Peace be unto you:</hi> But they
were so far from being at peace,
that <hi>they were terrified, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eet a Spirit.</hi>
And Jesus said to them, <hi>Why are
ye troubled, and why do thoughts
arise in your hearts?</hi> what, doe
you thinke that I am a spirit?
Do you think your eyes dazle?
<hi>behold my hands and my feet.</hi>

great miracle, so it did also
shew his power and authority

            <p>I shall now briefly touch two
or three Scriptures which hold
forth the Disciples testimony of
his resurrection. And the first
is in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 40, 41. In which
place, the Apostle speaking of
the Lord Jesus, saith, <hi>

the dead.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I am to
prove that this very man, Christ
Jesus, the Son of the Virgin, in
his very body, the same body
that was crucified is above the
clouds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the heavens. And
though this is made light of by

some say</hi>) Ephes. 4. 10. he that
descended, is said to be the same
that ascended: Now there was
no humane nature with God in
heaven before the world was;
Therefore if he be but the same

you will find it so to be. Now
in the <hi>v.</hi> 9. after he had spoken

that is, he was taken up from

and a cloud received him out of
their sight. And while they
looked up stedfastly towards
heaven, as he went up (which
heaven, was not within them; if
it had, they needed not to have
looked toward the clouds and
the heaven without them)
behold two men stood by them,
not in them, in white apparrel,
which also said (that is, the
two men, or Angels which
stood by them said) Ye men of
<hi>Galilee,</hi> why stand ye gazing up
into heaven? Here again, they
did not look within them, but

if he come againe in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he must come againe with
the same body wherewith he
was crucified.</p>
            <p>Object. But you will say, The
Scripture saith, he that descended
is the same that ascended, which
to me (say you) implies, none but
the spirits ascending.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> For answer, We doe
not say, (as I said before) that
it is another that ascended, but
the very same. That is, the very
same Christ, that was with the
father from everlasting, did
come down from heaven. That
same Christ also that came
down from heaven did ascend
up thither again: only, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
without a body from
heaven, and took flesh and blood
upon him from the Virgin.
And though he descended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a body, yet (he) the very
same Christ, that descended
without a body, the same did
ascend again with a body, even
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102699:103"/>
that very body that he took of
the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 30. 31.</note> See <hi>Luke</hi> 24.
from 39 to the 51. <hi>verses.</hi> Now
let me give you a Similitude,
for it is warrantable; for both
Christ and his Apostles did
sometimes use them,<note place="margin">Joh 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> to the end,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 24. 25.</note>
soules might be the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmed.
The similitude is this.
Suppose there come into thine
house a man that is naked, and
without clothing, though he
go out of thy house againe well
clothed; yet the same man that
came in without clothing, is the
same man also that go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s out of
thy house, though very well clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed.
Even so it is in this case.
The Lord Jesus came into the
wombe of the virgin, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Spirit,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 18. but he came out of
the womb clothed with a body,
and went up into heaven again
clothed with a body. Compare
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 39. with <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11. and
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 30, 31.</p>
            <p>Now also I shal lay down some
few things to be considered, for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102699:104"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the better clearing of it, 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that he did say to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that he would go away
from them: (<hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7.
yea,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 19</note> saith he, I go and prepare
a place for you) and then I will
(after a long time) come again
and take you to my selfe, that
where I am, that is, whither I
am going, there ye may be also.
Now I say, If Christ had not
gone from his Disciples (for
that was his meaning) touching
his bodily presence; I say if he
had not gone away from them,
in respect of his bodily presence,
he had said more then he had
performed; which is horrible
blasphemie once to assert;
Which going of his, is his going
into heaven. See, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, consider, that there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it was that he was to receive</hi>
the promise of the father, <hi>Luke</hi>
24. 49. 50, 51. <hi>which promise
was the shedding forth in an

Holy Ghost. And for this see</hi>

received of the Father the promise
of the holy Ghost, he hath sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. For David is not ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

himselfe, The Lord said unto my

Therefore let all the house

that <hi>same</hi> Jesus whom you have

that he is above the clouds and

12. 1, 2, 3, 4. I knew a man in
Christ (saith <hi>Paul</hi> there) caught
up into the third heaven: now,</p>
            <p>Heaven in Scripture, is taken
sometimes metaphorically, and
sometimes properly. First, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically
it is taken for the
Church and people of God; as
in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. Secondly, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is taken for the material
heaven, where the Sun, Moon,
and Stars are placed; as in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102699:106"/>
               <hi>Genesis</hi> 1. <hi>v</hi> 8, 14, 15, 16, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
together; above which
heaven. Jesus the Son of Mary
is ascended.</p>
            <p>Therefore I pray you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with me a little:<note place="margin">John 14. 2, 3.</note> and first,
that when he went into this<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 7.</note>
heaven into which he is gone,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 9, 10, 11.</note>
he went AWAY from his
Disciples, as it is written, If I go
not away, the comforter will
not come; so that he did not
go into a heaven within them
in his person, and humane
nature. If so, he must needs
go into that heaven without
above the clouds and the Stars,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 8, 5, 16.</p>
            <p>2. Consider, he was caught
away in a cloud, yea and was
caught upwards from them, as
it is <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11. and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away into heaven, yea,
and his disciples stood gazing
or looking up after him into
heaven, which heaven must
needs be that above the clouds.
1. If you consider the posture of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102699:106"/>
the Disciples, they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
after the cloud that did
take him away. 2. Consider
the manner of his going, it was
in a cloud. 3. He was received
out of their sight. 4. And so
received up into heaven; which
heaven must needs be above
the clouds,<note place="margin">Job 22. 12, 13, 14.</note> where God is in
his special presence. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
            <p>3. Consider, that those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
that are alive at this
day in the body, <hi>are absent
from the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. but
now, if the man Christ were
ascended into that heaven
within them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would neither
be <hi>absent from them,</hi> nor they
from him; but in that he is
<hi>absent</hi> from them touching his
bodily presence, and they <hi>from
him</hi> touching the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that that heaven into
which he is ascended, must
needs be without above the
clouds.</p>
            <p>4 Consider, that that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102699:107"/>
into which the man Christ
is ascended, must contain him
till the time of restitution of
All things, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21.
into which heaven he hath
been ascended above sixteen
hundred years by computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And I am sure there is
not a Saint that doth live in
this world half so long, before
he fall asleep, and be gathered
to his fathers; so that that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he is? scended,
is not within, but must needs
be that above the clouds. But,</p>
            <p>5. Consider, that he that
ascended from his Disciples,
was a man, with flesh and
bones, not a spirit only; <hi>for
handle me, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> (saith he) <hi>for
a spirit hath not flesh and bones,
as ye see me have, Luke</hi> 24. 39,
50, 51. <hi>verses.</hi> Now let the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
shew by the Scriptures
that there is any place in them
called heaven, that is able to
contain a man of some four or
five foot long, the space of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102699:107"/>
fifteen or sixteen hundred years;
besides that, therefore, it must
needs be that heaven without
which is above the clouds and
Stars.</p>
            <p>6. Consider, That heaven
into which the Lord Jesus that
man is ascended, must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him alwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>The
Lord himself shall descend from
heaven with a shout, with the
voice of an Archangel.</hi> So that
there is another descending
from that heaven into which
he is ascended; and his descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from that heaven is to
this end, namely, to take his
people to himself, as it is <hi>v.</hi> 17.
so that it is clear, that it is not
any heaven within thee, into
which the Man Christ that was
born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is
ascended, but it must needs be
that heaven without which is
above the clouds. 1. If thou
consider, that the place into
which he is ascended, even the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102699:108"/>
heaven into which he is entred,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 22.</note>
is the same place where all the
the deceased Saints are in their
Spirits: Therefore saith <hi>Paul,
I desire to depart, and to be
with Christ which is better.</hi> Now
<hi>Paul</hi> did not in this place, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

1. 23. mean the enjoying of
Christ only in the spirit; for
that he enjoyed in a great
measure when he spake these
words; but he speaks of a dying,
and a being with Christ after
this life is ended; as is clear
if you compare the 20, 21, 22,
23, 24. 25, and 26, <hi>verse,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being absent from him
while he was here in the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the body, we are absent from the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that that heaven into<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5</note>
which the Man Christ is ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 6, 7.</note>
is not into his Church on
earth;<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 1, 2, 3.</note> but into heaven without
above the clouds and the Stars.
And this <hi>David</hi> doth prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie
of, <hi>Psal.</hi> 47. 5. where he saith,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102699:108"/>
               <hi>God is gone up with a shout, the
Lord with the sound of a Trumpet.</hi>
Now Christ, as God meerly
could not go up, being no lesse
in one place then in another;
but as God man, or in his
humane nature he went up;
as will clearly appear, <hi>Epes.</hi> 4 8,
9, 10. where he speaketh of his

               </gap>h over all the enemies
of his people at his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and ascension into heaven
above the clouds.</p>
            <p>8. When Christ doth descend
from that heaven into which
he is now ascended, his Saints
and he will meet one another,
just in the air, according to
the Scripture, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16, 17.
<hi>for</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Lord shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the Archangel,
and with the trump of God, and
the dead in Christ shall rise first,</hi>
(that is, they shall come out of
their graves) <hi>and then we which
shall be saved alive</hi> (at that day)
<hi>and remain, shall be caught up
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102699:109"/>
together with them in the clouds
to meet the Lord in the air, and
so shall we ever be with the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray mark here a little, and
see what heaven the man
Christ is ascended into, and
see if it be not the heaven
without, above the Sun, Moon,
and Stars.</p>
            <p>When Christ and his Saints
do meet the second time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the one ascends and the
other descends; the one is
caught up in the clouds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heaven, the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
from heaven towards
the earth, and they must needs
meet one another just in the
air,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> that is, between the heaven
and the earth. So then,<note place="margin">1 Thes 1. 10.</note> the
one coming from heaven, and
the other from the earth, and
their meeting being in the air,
which is between heaven and
earth, is an undeniable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
that that heaven into
which the man Christ is ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102699:109"/>
must needs be that heaven
without above the Sun, Moon
and Stars And thus much
touching the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> his
ascending up into the heaven
without above the clouds, <hi>Acts</hi>
1. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21, &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
3 22</p>
            <p>In the next place,</p>
            <p>Now I shall prove the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the man Christ Jesus,
to be in the heaven that I have
been speaking of; though some
have mocked at it and others
have called it jugling, whose
names here I shall not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntion;
only I shall admonish them that
they doe not blaspheme the
truth and Sonne of God in his
intercession</p>
            <p>I shall quote some of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
that hold out this truth,
and so passe on,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And first of all, see</hi> Psal. 16. 4.
<hi>where</hi> David <hi>prophesying of
the intercession of Christ, saith,</hi>
their sorrowes shall be multiplyed,
that husten after another God,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102699:110"/>
(<hi>speaking of the wicked</hi>) their
drink offerings of blood will I not
offer, nor take up their names
into my lips. <hi>Now, compare
this with</hi> Heb. 8. 4. <hi>where he
saith,</hi> If he were on earth, he
should not be a Priest. <hi>And</hi> Heb.
9. 24. For Christ is not entred
into the holy places made with
hands (<hi>meaning the temple
which</hi> Solomon <hi>built</hi>) which are
figures of the true: but into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it selfe, now to appear in the
presence of God for us. Wherefore
he is able to save to the uttermost,
them that come to God by him:
seeing he ever lives to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for them, Heb. 7. 25</p>
            <p>But you will say, is there a
man made mention of here?
Yes; for the Scripture saith,
<hi>Ther is one God, and one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
between God and men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>the
Man Christ Jesus.</hi> And in that
8. to the <hi>Heb.</hi> made mention of
before; where the Apostle is
speaking of Christs priestly
office, as he is in the heavens,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102699:110"/>
compared with other Priests
that are on earth; he saith <hi>v.</hi> 3.
<hi>for every high Priest is ordained
to offer gifts and Sacrifices;
wherefore</hi> (speaking of Christ)
<hi>it is of necessity that this man
have somewhat also to offer: For
if he were on earth he should not
be a Priest, seeing there are
Priests that offer according to the
Law,</hi> (which law was the law
of <hi>Moses, Chap.</hi> 9. from 19. to 23.
where also he is speaking of
the Priesthood of the Priests
under the law, and their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the blood of Bulls and

of the Lord Jesus the high
Priest of Saints, and of his
blood (<hi>verse</hi> 14. compared with
<hi>verse</hi> 24.) Now as men under
the Law did offer up the blood

               </gap>lls and Goats, so the man
Christ Jesus did offer up his
own blood to his father; and
this you may clearly see, if you
compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. where he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102699:111"/>
saith, <hi>How much more shall the

under the Law could not live
ever in this world, because it
was appointed to all men once
to die.) But when he speaks of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102699:111"/>
Christ Jesus, he saith on this
wise, <hi>But this man, because he
continueth ever, hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
Priesthood; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he</hi> (this man) <hi>is able to save
to the uttermost them that come
to God by him, seeing he</hi> (this
man) <hi>ever liveth to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for them.</hi> And thus in
brief have I proved through the
assistance of the Lord, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
of the son of <hi>Mary,</hi>
which is also the son of God.
And this concerning Christs
Priestly office, might serve also
for a proof of his being in the
heaven without above the Stars.
But all men may see (unlesse
they be blind) that these are
the truths of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and of God his father;
and that those men that oppose
them (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do) are
very violently possessed of the
Divel, and beside themselves;
and have neither the truth of
God, non his spirit in them,
2 <hi>Joh. vers.</hi> 9, 10, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 38. 42.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:102699:112"/>
And now through the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Lord, I shall come
to the last that I promised, and
that is to prove, That this very
man Christ, will come to
judge the quick and the dead.</p>
            <p>And first, I shall prove the
truth it self, <hi>viz.</hi> that that man
shall come again to judge the
world, quick, and dead.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I shal shew you
that his coming will be very
shortly.</p>

               </gap> his coming.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Who shall stand
when he shall come, and who
not. For the first,</p>
            <p>That that man that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orn
of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> shall come
again to judge the quick and
the dead, read 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>l</hi>
(saith <hi>Paul) charge thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and Kingdom.</hi> Now if
you would know who this
Lord Jesus is, look into <hi>Acts</hi>
10. 38. and you shall see it was
Jesus of <hi>Nazareth;</hi> would you
know who that was? read <hi>Mat.</hi>

Jesus of Nazareth; <hi>him God
raised up the third day, and
shewed him openly, not to all the
people, but unto witnesses, chosen
before of God; even to us who did
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and drink with him, after
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102699:113"/>
he rose from the dead. And he
commanded us to preach unto the
people,</hi> (that is, God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us) <hi>and to testifie</hi> (that is,
to be bold in our preaching)
<hi>that it is he</hi> (namely, Jesus of
<hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom the Jews did
thus crucifie) <hi>which was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of God to be judge of quick
and dead.</hi> This is he also
that is spoken of in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30,
31. <hi>The times of this ignorance
God winked at</hi> (meaning mens
being without the Gospel) <hi>but
now commandeth all men every
where to repent, because he hath
appointed a day</hi> (which day, is the
day of judgement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 36.)
<hi>in the which he will judge the
world in righteousness, by that
man</hi> (namely, Jesus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth)
whom he hath ordained,</hi>
(compare this with that in <hi>Acts</hi>
10. 38, 39, 40, 41, 42. <hi>whereof
he hath given assurance to all
men,</hi> (that is, hath given a
sure sign unto all men) <hi>in that
he hath raised him</hi> (that is, in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102699:113"/>
that he hath raised Jesus of
<hi>Nazareth) from the dead.</hi> This
also is Christs own meaning,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. where speaking of his
second coming, he styleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the son of man, saying, And
then shall appear the sign of
the son of man, and so shall
the coming of the son of man
be, <hi>v.</hi> 27. So shall also the
coming of the son of man be,
<hi>v.</hi> 37. So shall also the coming
of the son of man be, <hi>v.</hi> 39.
Where by the way it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
to see how the Lord of
life and glory, doth in this
Chapter, where he speaketh of
his second coming, for the most
part style himself the son of
man. Surely he doth it to this
end, because he would not
have his humanity and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
thereof, to be rased out
from under heaven; For he
knew, that in the last daies,
there would come mockers
walking, after their own lusts,
and saying, where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102699:114"/>
of his coming, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3.
I could multiply Scriptures to
prove this doctrine of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
coming, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> last
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 7, 12.
and the last, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi>
14. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will shew you
that his coming will be shortly.
It is true, no man can tel neither
the day nor the hour, yet so far
as the Scriptures will give us
light into the neernest of his
coming, so far we may go. And
therefore I shall shew that his
coming draws nigh by those
signs that he himself said should
be forerunners of his coming.
And if you read <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. you
shall see many signs of his
coming spoken of.</p>
            <p>First, there is a falling away
from the faith spoken of. And
that hath been fulfilled and is
fulfilling every day.</p>
            <p>2. Wars and rumors of wars
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s another sign that his coming
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102699:114"/>
doth draw nigh even at the
doors</p>
            <p>3 The love of many waxing
cold, is another signe that it is
nigh, even the comming of
Christ: And how cold is the
love of many at this day? They
that were hot two or three year
agoe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are now grown lukewarm
and cold. They are cold in
love to the Lords appearing:
they are cold in the profession
of the Gospel. They are cold
in love to the Saints, they are
cold in the worship of God;
Yea, very cold, which is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Demonstration that the
comming of the Lord draweth
nigh.</p>
            <p>4. The Stars falling from
heaven; (That is profe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ors fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from the faith which once
they professed) is another signe
that the comming of the Lord
is at hand: And how many
professors doe you see now a
dayes, fall from the doctrine of
God, and his Son Jesus Christ,

as though there were no such
thing as a world to come, and
no such thing as a Lord Jesus
Christ, and his second coming.</p>
            <p>5. Many poore souls will go
on in their profession with
lampes without oyle,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 6, 7.</note> just before
his second comming. And the
Lord knowes that most of the
professors of this generation,<note place="margin">These thinges I doe but hint in, though I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them Luke 18 8.</note>
are such kind of professors, yea,
very foolish professors, which
is another sure signe, that the
comming of the Lord drawes
nigh.</p>
            <p>6. When the time of Christs
second comming is at hand,
there will be but a very little<note n="*" place="margin">lay 1 Jo. 3. 3. to thy heart, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy condition with it, &amp; thou wilt find this a glorious truth.</note>
faith in the world. And the
Lord knowes, that there be
many, who are now as high as
<hi>Lucifer,</hi> that at that day for
want to faith will be thrown
down to the sides of the pit:
even into the very belly of
Hell.</p>
            <p>7. Another signe of Christs
second comming, is the carnall
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102699:119"/>
mindednesse of the most of the
world; and the very carriages
of almost all men now living
do discover this truth to be at
this day fulfilled, and know that
when they shall say peace and
safety, then sudden destruction
comes, and they shall not
escape, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>8. Before Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 24.</note>
there shal come many fals
Christs,<note place="margin">Mar. 13. 22.</note> and false Prophets, and
shall shew great signes, and
wonders, to seduce if it were
possible the Elect. And is not
this more cleerly fulfilled in our
daies then ever it was, especially
among those men called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
who being as persons,
whose consciences are seared
with an hot iron, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sealed up unto destruction,
do some of them call themselves
Christ, and shew great signes,
(as their <hi>Quaking</hi>) and such a
legall holiness, as makes the

Read, and the Lord give thee
understanding. But because I
would not have thee think that
I speake at randome, in this
thing. Know for certain, that
I my self have heard them blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme;
yea with a grinning

countenance, at the doctrine of
that mans second comming
from heaven above the stars,

<hi>Mary.</hi> Yea they have told me

what I preached was
according to the Scriptures. I
was also told to my face, that
I preached up an Idoll, because
I said, that the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> was
in heaven, with the same body
that was crucified on the Cross;
And many other things have
they blasphemously vented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Lord of life and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and his precious Gospel. The
Lord reward them according
as their work shall be.</p>
            <p>I could have hinted in many
other things which Christ and
his Apostles have shewed to be
signes of his comming But I
shall commend the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
unto thee, which are able
to make the man of God perfect
in all things,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16. 17.</note> through faith in
the Lord Jesus.</p>

               </gap> in
a few things touching it; as

peace and safety, then sudden

2, 3, <hi>which sudden destruction
will be at his second commin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> for
that is it which the Apostle
spake of in those three <hi>verses,</hi>
Then will all the world be
caught at such an unexpected
time that it will come upon
them, even as a snare commeth
upon those creatures that are
caught in it. As it is written,
<hi>Luke</hi> 21. 35. <hi>For as a snare shall
it come on all them that dwell on
the face of the whole ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h.</hi> Which
is all on a sudden, before they
are aware.</p>
            <p>2. He commeth with all his
saints and Angels. Then will
the Lord descend from that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102699:121"/>
heaven into which he now as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
as it is written in
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Then will be come
and all his Saints with him, as
Jude saith in his Epistle, v.</hi> 5.
Then shall <hi>Abell,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,
Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham, David</hi> and
<hi>Job, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul:</hi> together
with all the Saints which have
been, now are, or hereafter shall
be, and they shall sit on the
throne with the Lord Jesus
Christ, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. Before
whom shall all the Nations of
the world be gathered, as it is

down to the valley of Jehoshaphat;
for there will I sit to judge all the
heathen round about.</hi> Which
never was yet accomplished,
though it shall certainly be, in
in Gods time: to the astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

of all those that shall continue

God and his Christ.</p>

3. <hi>He shall come in flaming
fire, (when he doth come again:
he will come in such a manner,
as will make all that shall be
found in their sins rather seeke
to creepe under a mountaine,
then to meet the Lord of Glory,</hi>
Rev. 6. 15,) <hi>(As</hi> Esay <hi>saith,</hi> For
behold the Lord will come with
fire, and with his Charets like a

execute judgement upon all, and
to convince all that are ungodly
among them, of all their ungodly
deeds which they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and of all their hard speeches
which ungodly sinners have spoken
against him. Jude 15. <hi>as I shall

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore in the next
place, I shall shew you, what
shall be done when he is come.</p>
            <p>First, When Christ is come
the second time, they that are
in their graves shall arise, and
come forth of their graves (as I
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102699:122"/>
said before) in which they have
laine according to that in <hi>Job.</hi>
5. 28. Where Christ saith,
<hi>Marvell not at this, for the houre
is comming in the which all that
are in the graves shall heare his
voice, and shall come forth: they
that have done good unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of life; and they that
have done evill unto the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of damnation.</hi> You will
say, Are these graves spoken of
here, the graves that are made
in the earth? yea, that they
are, and for a further proof of
the same, look into <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.
2 <hi>Daniel</hi> there speaking of
the same thing, saith, <hi>And many
of them that sleep in the dust of
the earth shall arise,</hi> or awake,
<hi>some to everlasting life, and some
to everlasting contempt,</hi> or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>I shall not stand here to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
any distinctions of the
resurrections, only prove that
the dead shall arise; and that
is a clear truth from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102699:123"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20 11

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52. <hi>the dead shall be

            </p>
            <p>2. He shall call all men and
women to an account for all
their close sinful thoughts,
words, and actions; then will
the secrets of all hearts be made
manifest. Then shall all thy
adulterous, and theevish, and
covetous, idolatrous, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous

that is, all those cunning,

close, hidden wickednesses, that
thou in thy life time hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
yea, he will make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
the counsels of the heart;

secret things that are contrived
and plotted by the sons of

such sins as thou wouldst
not have thy Neighbour, thy
father, thy wife, thy husband,
or any one else know of for
thousands, then thou shalt have

And ah, my friends! if the

what will his blows be,
think you? Then if all thy idle
words shall be accounted for,
as it is written, <hi>But I say unto

and all that have not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ upon them
shall be as stubble. Ah friends

burn and destroy the other.</p>
            <p>3. When Christ doth come
the second time, another end
of his coming will be to purge
out all things that offend in
his Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 41, 42.
<hi>Then shall the son of man send
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102699:125"/>
forth his Angels and they shall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of his Kingdom all things
that offend, and them that doe
iniquity, and shall cast them into
a furnace of fire; there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.</hi>
There are many things that doe
offend in his Kingdom now:
namely, the lukewarm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,
he doth offend first the
Lord, secondly, his people.
But then thou lukewarm offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
professor shalt offend the
Church of God no more. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the loose professors do
also offend God, Christ and his
Church. First, he scandals the
Gospel by his loose walking,
and naughty carriages. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he doth make the
world blaspheme the name of
God by the same. Thirdly,
he grieves the hearts of Gods
people, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18. But know
that thou also shalt be taken
away from offending any more,
God, Christ, and his Saints;
and thou shalt have weeping
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102699:125"/>
and gnashing of teeth for thy
thus offending, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 6.

            <p>4 Another end of Christs
second coming is to cut of all
the ignorant persons that are
in the world. There is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of poor souls that do
think to be excused for their
ignorance: Alas saith one,<note place="margin">Men see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to get en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, doe more harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in sin, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

am a poor ignorant man, or
woman, and therefore I hope
that the Lord will have mercy
upon me: We cannot, say o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
do as such and such, and
will the Lord condemn us?
And thus poor souls, as they are
in the broad way to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
least they should misse of
the way to hell; do swallow
down by clusters, that which
will poyson them body and
soul for ever, and ever.</p>
            <p>But you will say, What, will
not the Lord have mercy on
ignorant soules? <hi>Ans.</hi> Not on
those who live and die in their
ignorance. He himselfe hath
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102699:126"/>
said, <hi>Esay</hi> 27. 11. Because it is
a people of no understanding,
therefore he that made them
will not have mercy on them,
and he that formed them will
shew them no favour. Again,
<hi>Paul</hi> also in that 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 8.
saith, that when Jesus Christ
shall come to judge the world,<note place="margin">This 27 of Isaiah and the 11 verse is a nota<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the ignorants hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall hope, where he saith, <hi>He that made them will have no me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note>
he doth come to take vengeance
on all them that know not God,
and that obey not the Gospell
of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>But ye will say, who are those
ignorant persons, that shall
find no favour at that day? or
how doth the ignorance disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it selfe?</p>
            <p>I shall only mention three
or four sorts of men, and leave
thee to the Scriptures, which if
thou read them diligently, will
further lay them open before
thee.</p>
            <p>And first, the prophane scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
who makes a mocke at the
truths of God, and so goes on in
his sins, for this see in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:102699:126"/>
3. which the Apostle attributes
to their ignorance <hi>ver.</hi> 5. And
therefore he likens them to
bruit beasts, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 10. and
12. <hi>verses,</hi> who walke after the
flesh, in the lusts of uncleanness,
&amp; speak evil of the things they
understand not, and shall utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perish in their corruption;
who because they understand
not the Scriptures, nor the
power of God in them, speake
evil of the truths therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and think the Lord like
unto themselves, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the formal profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
who hath onely a notion
of the Gospell, and some see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
holiness, but wants Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
faith: Such are called foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
virgins, <hi>Mat</hi> 25. 2, 3. to
whom Christ will say in that
day, Verily, I know you not.
Adde hereto, those that think it
enough to confess Christ with
their mouthes, and profess that
they know God, but deny him
in their works; such notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102699:127"/>
all their profession,
shall, if they so continue, perish
eternally, being abominable,
disobedient, and to every good
work reprobate, or void of
judgement, that is ignorant, <hi>Tit.</hi>
1. <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>3. The legal righteous man
or woman, though they walke
blameless as touching the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
that is in the law:
For they being ignorant of
Gods righteousness, go about to
establish their own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as reading, hearing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
prayers, publique or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
peaceableness with their
Neighbours, Fasting, Almes,
good works as they count them,
just dealings, abstinence from
the grosser pollutions of the
world, stricter obedience to the
commandments of the first and
second table; all which with
many other things may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in <hi>their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi>
and it is grounded on
their ignorance, and goes on
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102699:127"/>
in rebellion; and such ignorant
persons shall in that day perish,
not <hi>submitting through ignoranco
to the righteousness of God, Rom.</hi>
10. 3. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 19.
27. where Christ saith that
when he shall come the second
time, he will command those
his enemies, <hi>who submitted not
themselves to him, who is called
the righteousness of God, Esay</hi> 46.
13. or would not have him to
reign over them, to be slaine
before his face.</p>
            <p>4. Those whose hearts are set
upon the world, and follow the
alluring perswasions of it; the
Lord calls such fools, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.
20 and <hi>Pro.</hi> 7. 7. who go after
it (<hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

marke, it is through ignorance,
<hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>A fift end of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
is, that his righteous
ones might shine as the Sun in
the glory, or Kingdom of their
Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 43. there are
many things that do hinder the
People of God from shining
forth as the Sun now. As first,
they have a body of death
which makes them fetch many
a groane in their journey to
<hi>Canaan, Rom.</hi> 7. 24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2.
They meet with many a sad
temptation, which also makes
them in heaviness many a time,
1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 1. 6. They have also
many other things that doe
hinder their shining now; but
then the body of death shall be
left off. My meaning is, that
sin shall be no more in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Gods people then:
Their bodies that are now so
vile, <hi>shall then be made like unto
the glorious body of the son of God,
who shall change our vile bodie,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102699:128"/>
that it may be like unto his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
body, according to the working
whereby he is, able to subdue all
things unto himself, Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi>
21.</p>
            <p>6. Another end of Christs
coming shall be to take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his children, how
they have laid out their talents,
that he hath committed to their
trust, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 12.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <p>7. Another end of his coming,
is, to set up his Kingdom, which
will be glorious indeed at his
appearing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
19, 20, 21. I do but touch these
things, because I would hasten
towards a conclusion; many
other things might have been
spoken to, but at this time I shal
forbear.</p>
            <p>But you will say, Who shall
stand when he appears? why,
I told you before, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
shall not stand in the
judgement, nor sinners in the
congregation of the righteous,

               <hi>Psa.</hi> 1. 5. let him be close or

now, all shall be laid open;
all shall be made manifest, all
shall come into judgement.</p>
            <p>Ah poor soul! it is not then
thy brave words will save
thee; it is not thine eloquent
tongue that will then do thee
any good; if thou be without
the wedding garment, thou
wilt be speechlesse, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.
12. But thou that art a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>But how shall I know that I

                  </gap>ry</hi> the Virgin,
is a right doctrine, 2 <hi>Joh</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>7. Then also thou lookest for

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102699:130"/>
yet if the Lord set them home
upon thy conscience, may be
profitable both to thee and me.
Therefore let us examine the
matter a little. And first,</p>
            <p>Thou thinkest that thou art
a Christian; thou shouldst be
sorry else; well, but when
did God shew thee that thou
wert no Christian? when didst
thou see that? and in the light
of the spirit of Christ see that
thou wert under the wrath of
God because of original sin?
Nay, dost thou know what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
sin means? Is it not the
least in thy thoughts? and dost
thou not rejoyce in secret that
thou art the same that thou
ever wert?<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 5. 12</note> If so. then know
for certain that the wrath of
God to this very day abideth
on thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. And if so,
then thou art one of those that
will fall in the judgement, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thou art born again, and
made a new creature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:102699:130"/>
But secondly, thou thinkest
that thou hast been born again,
('tis well if thou hast) but
least thou shouldst deceive thy
poor soul, I pray thee consider,
when did the spirit of the Lord
Jesus shew thee that thou hadst
no faith in thee by nature? and
when did the spirit of Christ
convince thee of sin, because
thou didst not believe in him?
It may be thou hast been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of sins against the Law,
by the Law, and thy own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as the Pharisees were,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 9. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. I, but
when didst thou see thy self a
lost creature for want of faith
in the son of <hi>Mary?</hi> if not,
thou hast not yet been savingly
convinced by the spirit of
Christ; for that when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
effectually of sin, it
convinceth of unbeliefe; though
thou hast been never so much
convinced of sins against the
Law, if thou hast not seen thy
self under the power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102699:131"/>
guilt and punishment
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>in because thou didst not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ, thou hast not
yet been savingly convinced;
for thats one work of the spirit
to convince of sin, <hi>because they
believe not on me;</hi> saith Jesus,
the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> who was
espoused to <hi>Joseph</hi> the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
But on the contrary, dost
thou not say in thy heart, thou
never hadst thy faith to seek,
but hast alway believed with
as good a faith as any one alive;
If so, then know for certain
that thou hast no faith of the
operation of God in thee, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods ordinary
working; and if so, then know
that if the Son of man should
come to judge the world at
this moment of time, that thou
with all thy faith (thou thinkest
thou hast) wouldst fall in the
judgement, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>3. Art thou born again? then
thou seest that thy great sin
was want of faith in the Son
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102699:131"/>
of <hi>Mary.</hi> Then thou seest that
it is he that was sent of God

            <p>4. Art thou born again? then
thou seest all true peace and joy
comes through the blood of the

guilt of sin goes off, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
go off any other way
then by the blood and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the man Christ Jesus,
thy guilt goes off not right, but
wrong, and thy latter end

            <p>7. Art thou borne againe?
Then thou knowest that the
doctrine of the Son of God, the
son of <hi>Mary</hi> is a right doctrine,
which is this.</p>
            <p>First, that the Son of God
which was with his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world was (<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1.
<hi>John</hi> 17. 5.) came into the
world in the fulnesse of time,
and was made in the likenesse
of Men, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. being made
of a woman or virgin, made
under the Law, to redeem them
that were under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi>
4. 4. And that was done in this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102699:134"/>
wise. What the law could not
do in that it was weak through
the flesh, that is through our flesh,
God sending his own Son in the
likenesse of sinful flesh, and for
sin, condemned sin in the flesh,
that is condemned him in the
flesh for the sins of poor sinners;
For this, compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.
and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
13. and it will appeare clearly
to be the truth of God: Also,
that this Son of God, which is
the true God, as well as the Son
of <hi>Mary,</hi> did bear our sins in
his own body on the tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 24. and did spill his own
blood, which is also the blood
of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. that he
died, and was laid in <hi>Josephs</hi>
Sepulchre, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 38, 39, 40, 41.
and rose again the third day,
<hi>Acts</hi> 10. 40. that very man, <hi>Luk.</hi>
24. <hi>v.</hi> 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44.
and ascended up into heaven in
a cloud, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9, 10. and 11.
and there ever lives to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
for us, that very man

10. 12.</p>
            <p>And in the last place, If thou
art a Christian, then thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
for that very Jesus againe,
whom the Jewes did crucifie,
<hi>John</hi> 19. whom God raised
again as it is, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. I say
thou lookest, thou waitest, thou

and wean thee from this world,
and the things thereof; and if
it is not from this principle,
that is, if thy obedience do not
flow from this faith, which is
the faith of Gods elect, as I
have proved at large, thy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
thy zeal, thy self-denial,
thy holiness, righteousness, yea,
all that thou canst doe, is but
sin in the sight of the great God
of heaven and earth.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> For

<hi>But ye are washed, but ye are

            <p>Well then, seeing this is a
truth of so great concernment,
I beseech you, seeke to be
throughly rooted into it by
faith. And that thou maiest so
be, examine thy heart; yea, beg
of God to help thee to examine
it, and to throw out all that

not deceive thy selfe with a

will be many.</p>
            <p>1. It will comfort thy heart

2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10, 11.) to judge the
world?</p>
            <p>3. Hereby thou wilt be able
to Judge of all doctrines what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
though they come never
so nigh the truth, yet if they
be not indeed the very truth,
thou wilt find them and their

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p>4. If thou beest throughly set
down in this doctrine, even in
the faith of this doctrine which
I have held forth unto thee,
thou wilt not be taken with
any other doctrine whatsoever.
What is the reason I pray you,
that there are so many giddy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
professors in these daies
that do stagger to and fro like a
company of drunkards, but this,
They were never se led in the
doctrine of the Father, and the
Son? They were never enabled
to believe that that child that
was born of the <hi>virgin Mary,</hi> was
the mighty <hi>God, Is.</hi> 9 6. No, saith
Christ, he that is built upon this
rock (meaning the faith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
which is to believe that
the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is the Christ of
God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16.) the gates of
hell shall not prevaile against
him, <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>5. The faith of this doctrine,
will make thee labour in the
work of God in the world.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102699:137"/>
Oh, how it will liven thy heart
in the work of the Lord; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
if thou livest in the faith
of thy interest in Christ, it will
make thee labour to be found
watching when thy Lord shall
returne from the wedding; that
when he doth come, thou maiest
open to him immediately.
<hi>Luke</hi> 12. 35. 36.</p>
            <p>Now seeing the comming of
the Lord Jesus Christ is so nigh,
even at the doors, what doth
this speak to all sorts of people
(under heaven) but this? first,
to see whither they have oyl in
their lamps or not; that is, to
search, and see, whither the
spirit of the man Christ Jesus
be in them or no; for <hi>he that

as in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
            <p>2. Then what will become
of all the prophane, ignorant,
scoffers, self-righteous, proud,
bastard-professors in the world?

ungodly and the sinner appear?</hi>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.</p>
            <p>3. Then what will become of
all those that creep into the

a wedding garment on?
why, it will be said unto them,
Friends, how came you hither?
take them, and bind them hand

weeping and gnashing of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ,</hi> as do the <hi>Ranters, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kere,
Drunkards,</hi> and the like?
why read their doom in <hi>Mat.</hi>
24. 50, 51. The Lord of that,

of these servants, shall come in
a day when they look not for
him, and in an hour that they
are not aware of, and shall cut
them asunder &amp; appoint them
their portion with hypocrites,
and there shall be weeping and
gnashin of teeth.</p>
            <p>5. Then what doth this speak
to the Lords own people? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, that they should be in
a watchful posture, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.
37.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Watch therefore over your

<hi>Eie,</hi> so your minds should be
corrupted from the simplicity
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102699:138"/>
that is in Christ: And the rather,
because at this day he is very
busie with his doctrines, and
his ministers; trying all waies,
if by any means he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you with fair speeches,
and inticing carriages; with
a fair shew in the flesh, yet
denying the Lord, and refusing
to be justified by the blood
of Jesus the son of <hi>Mary,</hi> the
son of God: Watch I say over
the Divel, touching doctrines,
for he labours as much this way
as any way, for he knows if he
can but get you to lay a rotten
foundation he is sure of you, live
as godly in your conceit as you
will, and therefore, it is worth
your observation, in that 24 of

of the signs of his coming, he
breaks forth with a warning
word to his Disciples, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of false teachers, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.
the very first words that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to a question that his

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102699:139"/>
               <hi>Take heed that no man deceive

            </p>
            <p>3. Take heed that he doth
not deceive you in point of
worship, that he make you not
slight any of the ordinances of
God; for if he do, he will
quickly make way for another
temptation.</p>
            <p>4. Take heed that you also
have not your lamps to trim
when the bridegroom comes;
if you have, you many parad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture

your selves with a profession of
Christ, and no more, for the

many time. And if he will
deceive a professing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he must come in this
manner; first, under the name
Christ; secondly, with a fair
shew in the flesh of outward
holinesse, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12. Thirdly,
he must come with good words
and fair speeches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 18.
Now though he come to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
swearers, whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,

party, he must appear like an
Angel of light. And the reason
why souls are deceived by him
in these his appearances, is,
because they are not able to
distinguish betwixt the Law
and the Gospel, the conviction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

again, <hi>All we like sheep have gone

in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. where that 53.

righteousnesse, by whose stripes we

did prepare this body, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

should be a sacrifice for sins,
wherefore he saith, <hi>Sacrifices

Heb. 10. 5. In this body which

            <p>Ans. <hi>No,</hi> there is none other
name under heaven given among
men whereby we must be saved,
<hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. <hi>And Jesus himselfe,
that was borne of the virgin</hi>
Mary <hi>said,</hi> I am the <hi>Way,</hi> the
truth, and the life: <hi>No man</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the father, but by me, Joh,
14. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> And where is this man, that
was borne of the virgin, that we
may come to the father by him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He ascended away from
his Disciples in a cloud, into
heaven, as we may read <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9,
10, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What doth he there?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. He ever lives to make
intercession for all that come unto
God by him, Heb.</hi> 7. 25. That
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102699:145"/>
is, they that shall come out of
themselves to him, and venture
their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> soules on what he did and
suffered when he was on earth,
&amp; is doing now in heaven; shall
certainly be saved: For he ever
lives to save them, that doe thus
come to the father by him. And
it is, because, he spilt his blood
for all that shall by the faith of
Gods elect lay hold upon him:
and thus it is written where he
saith, <hi>we are justified freely by
his grace, through the redemption
that is in Christ Jesus.</hi> Mark it,
<hi>whom God hath set forth to be a
propitiation, through faith in his
blood; to declare his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi>
that is, to declare Gods
righteousnesse, <hi>for the remission
of sins that are past, through the

            <p>Q. <hi>How?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, from that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
in <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 37, 38, 39, 40.
where Christ himselfe after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he
was crucified appeared to his
Disciples, (who having seen
him) supposed they had seen
a Spirit. But he said, Why are
ye troubled, and why doe
thoughts arise in your hearts?
behold my hand and my feet,
that it is I my selfe, and doe
not think you see a spirit; han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
me, and see, for a spirit hath
not flesh and bones, as ye see me
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:102699:146"/>
have. This he spake after he
was crucified, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 33. and
buried, <hi>v.</hi> 53. and rose againe
from the dead, <hi>chap.</hi> 24. 6, 7.
Many other Scriptures could I
give for the proof hereof, as
<hi>Acts</hi> 10. 39, 40, 41, 42. And
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 28, 29, 30, 31. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi>
1. 10. only read <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 29, 30,
31. where the Apostle proveth
the same, bringing in the words
of the Prophet <hi>David</hi> for a
testimony thereof, saying, <hi>He
being a Prophet, and knowing
that God had sworn with an oath
to him, that of the fruit of his
loynes according to the flesh he
would raise up Christ to sit on his
Throne</hi> (saith) <hi>he seeing this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
spake of the resurrection of
Christ, that his soul was not left
in hell, neither his flesh did see
corruption.</hi> Mark it, his flesh did
see no corruption, <hi>v.</hi> 31. But if
he had not risen againe, his
flesh had seen corruption. But
he rose again from the dead,
that very man, that very body;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102699:146"/>
for his flesh did see no corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>
            <p>Q. Why did he rise againe
from the dead with that very
body?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because it was not
possible he should be holden of
death. 2. Because in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature he suffered for
sin;<note place="margin">Act. 2. 24.</note> and if he had not recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himselfe from that very
curse, even from under death,
and all other things that lay on
him, which he had through
the sins of his children subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
himselfe unto, he had not
overcome sin, hell; death, the
law, and the devil; but had
been overcome by them; and
if so, then had not redemption
been obtained for sinners; for
it was at his resurrection from
the dead, that God said unto
him, <hi>Thou art my sonne, this day
have I begotten thee:</hi> (As saith
the Apostle) <hi>And we declare
unto you glad tidings, how that
the promise made unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

33, 34, 35. And it is this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the resurrection of that man
from the dead, that doth give
us ground of hope; as in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. &amp; 3. where he saith, <hi>He hath

by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

these our bodies that we doe

the Scripture saith, flesh and
blood shall not inherit the

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Flesh in Scripture is
taken more wayes then one;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 25. 50.</note>
as first, it is taken for the
workes of the law; where
the Apostle saith, Received ye
the spirit by the workes of
the Law, or by the hearing
of faith? Are ye so foolish,
having begun in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
are ye made perfect by the
flesh? By flesh here, he meanes
the Law; as is clear, if you

compare <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. with
<hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. 12. Again sometimes
flesh is taken for sinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.

for the bodies of the Saints,*
as subject to distempers, to pain,
sicknesse, corruptions, to death,
by reason of sinne, * 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
in that place, where he saith
flesh and blood shall not inherit
the Kingdome of Heaven, or of
God, his meaning is, sinful flesh
and blood, or the sin, with any
imperfection that is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Saints, shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the Kingdome; and that
you shall find to be the mind
of the holy Ghost, if you read
with understanding the latter
end of the same verse, where
he saith, <hi>Neither doth corruption
inherit incorruption.</hi> That is,
sin, or any imperfection of the
body, shall not inherit eternal
life; for saith he in <hi>ver.</hi> 53.
<hi>This corruptible must put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption,
and this mortal must

put on immortality.</hi> Mark here
I pray you, though he saith flesh
and blood shall not inherit the
Kingdom of God, yet he saith
this corruptible must put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrution:

that Scripture <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. 21

<hi>He shall change our vile body.</hi>
Mark it, it must be our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that must be changed. But
if it be changed, then how can
it be the same? Not the same
in respect of sinne, or bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
infirmities, but the very
same in respect of substance:
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102699:149"/>
For, saith he, it is our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that must be changed, And
it, the very same, <hi>it shall be

And if you ask, how is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

doubt what way to take.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Therefore, I will speak
a few words to you by way of
discovery of the falsity of such
opinions; and a word of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102699:150"/>
how you should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the truth. First, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he that cries up a Christ
within, in opposition to a
Christ without, that man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of having the spirit of
Christ in him, is possessed with
a spirit of delusion; for where
the spirit of Christ is in truth,
that spirit causeth the soul to
look to the Christ that was
born of the Virgin, for all
justification; as it is written,
<hi>Howbeit, when he, the spirit of
truth is come, he shall lead you
into all truth; for he shall not
speak of himself, but what soever
he shall hear, that shall he speak,
and he will shew you things to
come,</hi> mark the next verse <hi>he</hi>
(saith the son of the Virgin)
<hi>shall take of mine and shall shew
unto you, Joh.</hi> 16. 13, 14. he shall
take of mine; what is that?
why surely it is, he shall take
of my Godhead, my humanity,
my birth, my righteousness, my
blood, my death, my resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102699:150"/>

my Kingly, Priestly,
and prophetical offices, and
shall shew you the life, merit,
and value of them. And this
was it which was revealed to
<hi>Paul</hi> by the holy spirit, here
spoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2. to the 8.
<hi>Moreover brethren, saith he, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
unto you the Gospel which

ye have received, and wherein
ye stand. By which also ye are
saved, if ye keep in memory what
I preached unto you, unlesse ye

is this doctrine? why, <hi>I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to you first of all, that which
I also receive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> What was that?
why, <hi>How that Christ died for
our sins according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And that he was buried,
and that he rose again the third
day according to the Scriptures,</hi>
(there is his death and resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
preached) <hi>And that he
was seen of</hi> Cephas, <hi>then of the
twelve; after that he was seen of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102699:151"/>
above five hundred brethren at
once, of whom the greatest part
remain unto this present, but some
are fallen asleep. After that he
was seen of</hi> James, <hi>then of all
the Apostle. And last of all he
was seen of me (saith</hi> Paul) <hi>as of
one born out of due time.</hi> This
is it I say, that the spirit of truth
doth hold forth to poor sinners,
a Christ crucified without the
gates of Jerusalem, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 32,
33. buried in <hi>Joseph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there ever liveth, that very man,
with that very body, to make
intercession for all that receive
him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24, 25. This is I
say the doctrine of the spirit of
truth, whatsoever is the spirit
of errour.<note place="margin">Col. 1 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But do not the Scriptures
make mention of a Christ within?
2 Cor. 13 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, <hi>And he that hath not
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:102699:151"/>
the spirit of Christ is none of his,
Rom.</hi> 8. 9. But he that hath it,
is led out of himself by it;
and as I said before, it shews
the soul, what the blessed son
of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> hath done
and suffered, and is a doing
for it. Therefore <hi>hereby know
we the spirit of truth from the
spirit of errour. Every spirit
that doth confesse that Jesus
Christ is come in the flesh, is of
God;</hi> That is, that spirit that
doth confess that Jesus Christ
took flesh upon him, and in
that flesh did bear our sins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
3. 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1. and after he was
taken down from the cross, and
laid in a sepulcher, rose again
from the dead; that very man,
with that very body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was crucified: That
spirit that doth believe and
confess this is of God, and is
the blessed spirit of Christ,
whereof h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> spake, when he was
yet with his Disciples touching
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102699:152"/>
his bodily presence: for he (saith
the Son of <hi>Mary</hi>) shall glorifie
me, for he shall take of <hi>Mine</hi> and
shew it to you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>I have answered this already
in my Epistle to the first trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
Therefore believe not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
spirit, but try the spirits
whether they be of God, for
many false spirits and prophets
are gone out into the world,
therefore have a care how thou
receivest the voice that speaks to
thee, but try whether they are
according to the truth of Gods
word as it is written, <hi>To the law,
and to the testimony, if it be not
according to this word, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is no light in them,</hi>
Isa. 8. 20.</p>
            <p>Therefore try a little, Doe
they flight Gods Christ which
is the Son of the virgin, that
spirit is of the Devil, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
            <p>2. Doe they say that that
blood of his which was shed
without the gates of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
doth not wash away sin, yea all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102699:152"/>
sin from him that believes? that
is a spirit of Antichrist, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p>3. Doe they say, that that
man that was crucified without
the gates of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is not
risen again (with that verybody
wherwith he was crucified out
of the Sepulchre) <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 38, 39.
That is a Spirit of Antichrist.</p>
            <p>4. Do they say that that very
man that was crucified with
that very body, is not now in
the presence of his father, absent
from his people touching his
bodily presence, though present
in spirit? I say who ever they
be, that say he is not there, they
are of the Divel: for the proof
of this see <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 30. and 31.
and compare it with <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24.
25. <hi>The God of our fathers</hi> (saith
the Apostle) <hi>raised up Jesus.</hi> But
what Jesus? <hi>Whom ye slew</hi> (saith
he to the Jews. Him, the very
same whom ye slew) <hi>hath God
exalted with his right hand to be
a prince and a Saviour, to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
unto Israel and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sins.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:102699:153"/>
And indeed, here is my life,
namely the birth of this man,
the righteousnesse of this man,
the blood of this man, the death
and resurrection of this man;
the ascension intercession of this
man for me, and the second
comming of this man to judge
the world in righteousness, <hi>Acts</hi>
17. 31. I say here is my life, if I
see this by faith without me,
through the operation of the
spirit within me; I am safe, I am
at peace, I am comforted, I am
encouraged, and I know that my
comfort, peace, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is true, and given me from
heaven, by the father of Mercies,
through the Son of the virgin
<hi>Mary, Mat.</hi> 1. 21. who is the way
to the father of Mercies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.

all that come to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

he, that very man; with that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body wherwith he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
is ascended into heaven,
<hi>Acts</hi> 1, 9, 10. 11. and there, ever
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102699:153"/>
lives to make intercession for
them that come to God by him.
This is the rock, sinner, upon
which if thou be built, the gates
of Hell, nor <hi>Ranter, Quaker,</hi> sin,
law, death, no nor the Divel
himself, shall ever be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
against thee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16, 17.
18. And here I leave thee to the
wisdome of the great God, who
if he hath chosen thee in his
Son, and brought thee to him;
and hath made thee by faith to
lay hold on him, thou needst not
fear the divel with his siftings,
snares, wiles, and fiery darts,
wherewith he doth destroy
thousands; but mayest with the
Apostle (if thou live in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

towards thee) cry out, <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that neither death, nor
life, nor Angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor height, nor

the things that appearto be the

thy soul, and thou doest not care
for that comfort that doth not

that Christ, that was borne without

nature without thee; spilt his blood
without thee, is risen againe and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
without thee, and maketh
intercession without thee: And that
he, that very man that was borne of
the Virgin, will come againe in the

must thou receive by that Spirit that
he hath promised to send and give to
them that aske him: And that shall
dwell in thy heart, and shall shew
thee what the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> the virgin
the Son of Man, the Son of God, the

thou receive him in truth, then
though thou doe not boast, nor brag

wilt do more worke for God in one

that was in which he did bear the

I ask you further, whither that body
