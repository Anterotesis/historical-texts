            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Who can imagine by this industrious course of Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what an vnexpected progresse from a despised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning hath beene suddenly made to the height of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse! The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> quickly founded <hi>Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Tirus,</hi> so much renowned both by sacred, and humane writers, and a few <hi>Tirians</hi> builded <hi>Carthage,</hi> which had first no more ground allowed her than could be compassed by the extended dimensions of a Bulls hide, which for acquiring of the more ground they diuided in as many sundrie parts as was possible, yet in end that Town became the Mistresse of <hi>Afr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

which they could not encrease, nor subsist, till they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished the daughters of the <hi>Sabins,</hi> by a violent match at first, portending their future rapins, and what a furious off-spring they were likely to ingender. And when that haughty Citie beganne to suffer the miseries which she had so long beene accustomed to inflict vpon others, the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Citie of <hi>Venice</hi> (keeping for so many ages a spotlesse reputation) was first begunne by a few discouraged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who fleeing from the furie of the barbarous Nations that then encroached vpon <hi>Italie,</hi> were distracted with feare and (seeking for their safety) did stumble vpon a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious dwelling.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Graecians</hi> were the first, at least of all the Gentiles, (who joyning learning with armes) did both doe, and write that which was worthie to be remembred; and that small parcel of ground whose greatnesse was then only va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by the vertue of the inhabitants, did plant <hi>Trapizonde</hi> in the East, and many other Cities in <hi>Asia</hi> the lesse, the protecting of whose liberties was the first cause of warre between them and the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchs; then besides all the adjacent Iles they planted <hi>Siracusa</hi> in <hi>Sicile,</hi> most part of <hi>Italie,</hi> which made it to bee called <hi>Graecia maior,</hi> and <hi>Marseills</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> O what a strange alteration! that this part, which did flourish thus, whilest it was possessed by vigorous spirits, who were capable of great enterprises, did so many braue things should now (the seate of base seruile people) become the most abject and contemptible part of all the Territories belonging to the barbarous <hi>Ottomans,</hi> whose insolent Ianissaries (as the Pretorian Guards did with their Emperours, and Mamalukes of <hi>Egypt</hi> with their Soldans) presume at this time to dispose of the Regall power, vpbrayding the miserable follie of Christians, who dangerously embarqued in intestine warres, though inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an encountring occasion, neglect so great, so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and so easie a conquest.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanos</hi> comming to command a well peopled World, had no vse of Colonies, but onely thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4583:5"/>
such old deseruing Souldiers as (age and merit plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an immunitie from any further constrained trauell) had brauely exceeded the ordinary course of time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for military seruice, which custome was vsed in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, France, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and likewise that the Townes erected in this sort might serue for Citadels impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vpon euery conquered Prouince, whereof some doe flourish at this day, and of others nothing doth remaine but the very name onely, their ruines being so ruined, that wee can hardly condiscend vpon what solitary part to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe the fame of their former being.</p>
            <p>I am loth by disputable opinions to dig vp the Tombes of them that more extenuated then the dust are buried in obliuion &amp; will leaue these disregarded relicts of greatnesse to continue as they are, the scorne of pride, witnessing the power of time. Neither will I after the common custome of the world, ouerualuing things past disualue the present, but considering seriously of that which is lately done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> doe finde a Plantation there inferiour to none that hath beene heretofore. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> hauing conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Israelites</hi> did transplant them as exposed to ruine in a remote Countrey, sending others of their owne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (that they might be vtterly extirpated) to inhabite <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mvria</hi> in their places. And our King hath only diuided the most seditious families of the <hi>Irish</hi> by dispersing them in sundry parts within the Countrey, not to extinguish, but to dissipate their power, who now neither haue, nor giue cause of feare. The <hi>Romanes</hi> did build some Townes which they did plant with their owne people by all rigour to curbe the Natiues next adjacent thereunto, And our King hath incorporated some of his best <hi>Brittaines</hi> with the <hi>Irish,</hi> planted in sundry places without power to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, but onely to ciuilize them by their example. Thus <hi>Ireland</hi> which heretofore was scarcely discouered, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irritated by others, prouing to the <hi>English</hi> as the <hi>Lowe-Countries</hi> did to <hi>Spaine,</hi> a meanes whereby to waste their men, and their money, is now really conquered, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4583:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a strength to the State, and a glorie to his Majesties gouernment, who hath in the setling thereof excelled all that was commended in any ancient Colonie.</p>
            <p>As all first were encouraged to Plantations by the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the conquests that were proposed vnto them, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring onely want of people, and not of land, so in after ages when all knowne parts became peopled, they were quickly entangled with the other extremitie, grudging to be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within their prospect, and jarring with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for small parcels of ground, a strife for limits limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the liues of many who entring first in controuersie vpon a point of profit though with the losse of ten times more, valuing their honour by the opinion of others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued to proceed as engaged for the safety of their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Then richesse being acquired by industrie, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by employments, these two did beget auarice, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which lodging in some subtile heads vpon a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike consideration to vnite intestine diuisions did transferre their splene to forraine parts, not seeking to rectifie the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but to busie them abroad where least harme was feared, and most benefit expected, so that where they had first in a peaceable sort sought for Lands onely wherewith to furnish their necessity, which conueniency, or sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, did easily accommodate, now ayming at greatnesse the desires of men growne infinite, made them strangers to contentment, and enemies to rest.</p>
            <p>Some Nations seeking to exchange for better seates, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to command their neighbours, there was for many ages no speach but of wrongs and reuenges, conquests and reuolts, razings and ruining of States, a continuall reuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion determining the periods of Time by the miseries of mankind, and in regard of the populousnesse of these ages during the Monarchies of the <hi>Assirians, Persians, Graecians,</hi> and <hi>Romanes,</hi> the world could not haue subsisted if it had not beene purged of turbulent humours by letting out the bloud of many thousands, so that warre was the vniuersall Chirurgeon of these distempered times: And thereafter

O what monstrous multitudes of people were slaine by huge deluges of barbarous armies that ouerflowed <hi>Italie, France</hi> and <hi>Spaine!</hi> and the Christians haue long beene subject to the like calamities wanting a commoditie how they might (not wronging others) in a Christian manner employ the people that were more chargeable then necessary at home, which was the cause of much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe among themselues, till at that time when <hi>Spaine</hi> was striuing with <hi>France</hi> how to part <hi>Italie,</hi> as <hi>Italie</hi> had formerly done with <hi>Carthage</hi> how to part <hi>Spaine.</hi> Then it pleased God hauing pitie of the Christians who for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of small importance did prodigally prostitute the liues of them whom hee had purchased with so pretious a ransome, as it were for diuerting that violent kind of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to discouer a new world, which it would seeme in all reason should haue transported them with designes of more moment, whereby glory and profit with a guiltlesse labour was to bee attayned with lesse danger whereunto they are as it were inuited, and prouoked with so many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent aduantages palpably exposed to any cleare judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I thinke (this obuious facilitie vilifying that which a further difficulty might the more endeare) the easinesse of the prey hath blunted the appetite.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Christopher Columbus</hi> had in vaine propounded this enterprise to diuers Christian Princes, <hi>Isabella</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile</hi> against the opinion of her husband (though so much renowned for wit yet not reaching this mysterie) did first furnish him for a Voyage, as if it were fatall that that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should owe the greatest part of their greatnesse to the female Sexe, And if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would sincerely, and gratefully haue bestowed the benefits whereby God did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure them to possesse this Land for the planting of it with Christians enclined to ciuilitie, and religion, it had at this day considering the excellency of the soyle, for all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that nature could affoord; beene the most singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly accomplished place of the world, but it hath infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly fallen out farre otherwise, that the treasures that are

drawne from thence (mynes to blowe vp mindes and rockes to ruine faith) doe proue the seed of dissention, the sinewes of the warre, and nurcerie of all the troubles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christians.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were so happie as to chance first vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this new World, were of all others (hauing but a vast mountainous Countrey) in regard of their scarcity of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, most vnfit for planting thereof, and could not but soone haue abandoned the same, if they had not so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encountred with the rich Mynes of <hi>Mexico, New Spaine</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> which were once likely to haue beene lost for lacke of wood, till the way was inuented of refining Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by quicksiluer, which may bee easily done out of any oare that is free from Lead, and (all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> disday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning worke as a seruile thing belowe their abilities) their greatest trouble is the want of workmen: for the Natiues that are extant, suruiuing many vexations, if they become ciuile out of an indulgency to libertie, and ease, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the <hi>Americans</hi> (liking better of a penurious life thus then to haue plenty with taking paines) are naturally encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they may haue a secure ease warranted by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, doe betake themselues to Cloisters, so that they haue no meanes to prosecute these workes but by drawing yeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great number of <hi>Negroes</hi> from <hi>Angola,</hi> and other parts, which being but an vnnaturall merchandise, are bought at a deare rate, and maintayned with danger, for they once of late, as I haue heard from one that was there at that time designed to murther their Masters, by a plot which should haue beene put in execution vpon a Good-friday, when all being exercised at their deuotion were least apt to apprehend such a wicked course, and it is alwaies feared that to reuenge what of necessitie they must suffer, and to procure their libertie hating most what they feele for the present, and hoping for better by a change, they will joyne with any strong enemy that landing there dare attempt the conquest of that Countrey.</p>
            <p>I will not here insist in setting downe the manner how
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4583:7"/>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made themselues Masters of so many rich and pleasant Countries, but doe leaue that to their owne Histories, though I confesse (like wisemen) they are very sparing to report the estate of these parts, and doe barre all strangers from hauing accesse thereunto, wishing to enjoy that which they loue in priuate, and not inconsiderately vanting by the vanitie of praises to procure vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the vexation that they might suffer by the earnest pursuit of emulating riuals, but as they did brauely begin, and resolutely prosecute their Discoueries in <hi>America,</hi> so hath it justly recompenced their courage, prouing the ground of all that greatnesse which at this time (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause) doth make them (as able, or willing, to conquer others if not both) so much suspected by euery jealous State. And <hi>Henry</hi> the Seuenth the <hi>Salomon</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had his judgement onely condemned for neglecting that good occasion which was first offered vnto him by <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> yet did he presently seeke to repaire his errour by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth <hi>Sebastian Chabot</hi> a <hi>Venetian</hi> who did discouer the Ile of <hi>Newfound-land,</hi> and this part of the Continent of <hi>America</hi> now intended to bee planted by his Majesties Subjects vnder the name of New <hi>England,</hi> and New <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> so that the fruits of his happie raigne still growing to a greater perfection and now ripe to bee gathered by this age, as he made way by the marriage of his eldest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for vniting these two Nations at home, so did hee the same likewise by this discouerie abroad, but the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of both was reserued for his Majestie now raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and no Prince in the world may more easily effectuate such a purpose since his Dominions affoord abundance of braue men singularly valued for able bodies and actiue spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits whereof the <hi>English</hi> haue already giuen good proofe of their sufficiency in forraine Plantations; but before I proceed further in that which doth concerne them I must obserue what the <hi>French</hi> haue done in this kind.</p>
            <p>All such aduentrous designes out of ignorance, or enuie (either contemned, or doubtfully ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sured) are neuer appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,

nor imitated, til they be justified by the successe, &amp; then many who had first been too distrustfull falling in the other extremitie of an implicite confidence, to redeeme their former neglects, doe precipitate themselues in needlesse dangers. After that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were knowne to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper, and that it was conceiued by the Voyage of <hi>Chabot</hi> what a large vastnesse this new Continent was likely to proue, <hi>Francis</hi> the first did furnish forth <hi>Iohn Verrizzon</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> who did discouer that part of <hi>America</hi> which was first (and most justly) called <hi>New France,</hi> and now <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Florida.</hi> And vpon his returne he affirming it to be (as it is indeed for all the excellencies of nature) one of the most pleasant parts of the world, This was the cause that after a long delay (during the space of two Princes whole raignes) some new Discoueries reuiuing the memory of this, in the yeere of God 1562. <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth (hauing a haughty mind, and being so rauished with a desire of glorie, that he was sometimes tempted by sinistrous suggestions in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after it to goe vpon wrong grounds) was quickly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured with the eminency of such a singular designe, wherein hee did employ <hi>Iohn Riba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The dangerlesse returne, and plausible hopes of <hi>Ribaut,</hi> assisted by the serious perswasions of the Admirall, (the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued opinion of whose not questioned wisedome was enough to warrant any thing that had his approbation) did moue the <hi>French</hi> King to send out a great number of men with a competent prouision of all things requisite vnder the charge of Monsieur <hi>Laudonier,</hi> who had a prosperous Voyage, and a congratulated arriuall at the <hi>French</hi> Fort by the Sauages in <hi>Florida,</hi> but immediatly thereafter hee was extremely perplexed with the vnexpected, mutinies and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious offers of some whom he had carried with him, who had not gone thither intending what they pretended, out of a cleare resolution to inhabite that bounds, but did one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flee from some inconueniences that had vexed them at home, such men as hating labour they could not industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously serue by their endeauours in a mechanike trade, so were they not capable of generous inspirations that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke magnanimitie, but habitually bred to vice were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally enemies to vertue, which made thirtie of them taking away a Barke that belonged to the Plantation betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Seas in hope (continuing as they had beene accustomed in naughty courses) to seize vpon a prize whereby they might incontinent bee made rich; and their designe in some measure had the projected issue, but in place of raising their fortunes (the Lord neuer blessing

Hereupon (the vmbragious aspersions of enuie so darkening reason that it could not discerne merite at least out of a depraued opinion with a derogatory censure cancelling all naturall ingenuitie, could not or would not acknowledge what was due thereunto) a report was spread in <hi>France</hi> by some that <hi>Laudoniere</hi> liued like a Prince disdayning the condition of a Subject, and the <hi>French</hi> out of a preposterous policie fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what they should haue wished that one of their owne Nation could be too great abroad, they sent backe <hi>Ribaut</hi> with a new commission to succeed him in his charge, (sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereby the first foundation of a growing greatnesse) who seeking to steale priuately vpon him to preuent aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements that hee might take him at vnawares did hardly escape to haue beene sunke at his first entrie.</p>
            <p>Immediatly after that <hi>Ribaut</hi> was admitted Gouernour <hi>(Laudoniere</hi> hauing shewed himselfe as dutifull to obey as he had beene skilfull in commanding) intelligence was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them that sixe <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships were riding at an anchor not farre from thence, and he ambitiously aspiring to grace his beginning with some great matter against the aduice of all the rest with an obstinate resolution would needs goe and pursue them taking the best of the companie with him, and so left the Fort weakely guarded, which made it

to proue an easie prey for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of whom the most part leauing their Ships (a minde transported with hope not thinking of paine) did march thorow the woods whence no perill was expected, and in a maruellous stormy night, as if the very Heauens (accessarily culpable) had conspired with the malice of men for the working of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. When the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> (too much affecting their owne ease) had neglected their watch, surprizing their Fort did put them all to the sword, which extreme crueltie of theirs was brauely reuenged by one Captaine <hi>Gorgues</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> who out of a generous disposition being sensible of this publike injurie whereby all his Nation was interested, as if it had only in particular imported the ruine of his owne fortunes, went of purpose to this part, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly before his comming was knowne contracting a great friendship with the Sauages who did hate the austere coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and rigorous gouernment of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when it came to be compared with the insinuating formes of the <hi>French,</hi> he found the meanes by a stratagem that he vsed to entrap the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by the death of them all expiating that which they had made his Countreymen formerly to suffer, yet after the manner of many being more apt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire then to preserue (acting greater things when carried with the impetuositie of a present fury then hee could confirme with the constant progresse of a well setled reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution) he made no more vse of his victorie, but returned back to <hi>France,</hi> flattering himself with the hope of a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall welcome, in place whereof by some meanes made Court he was proclaimed a Rebell, as a sacrifice appointed to appease <hi>Spaine.</hi> This was the last thing that the <hi>French</hi> did in <hi>Florida.</hi>

but a kind of large prison, they resolued to returne vnto Port <hi>Royall,</hi> whereof I will giue a particular Description, because it was the place of their residence, as I intend it to be for the chiefe Colonie of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, grounding that which I am to deliuer vpon such Discourses as the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> haue written, and vpon that which I haue heard reported by sundry others who haue seene the same.</p>
            <p>The entry in Port <hi>Royall</hi> is from the South side of a great Bay, which doth make the South part of <hi>New Scotland</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an Ile, and hath the passage at first so narrow, with a current so violent, that Ships can hardly enter if they take not the Tide right, and may easily be commanded by any Ordnance that is planted on either side, where there are parts fit for that purpose; As soone as they are within the Bay, it doth enlarge itself to the bredth of seuen or eight miles, and doth continue so as if it were square for the like bounds in length; There are within the same two Iles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of them extending itselfe about three miles in circuit, and both are well garnished with trees, and grasse; Diuers Riuers and Brookes doe fall within this large bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some on euery side, of which the chiefe is one that doth come from the South, being discouered to be aboue fortie miles portatiue, and it hath all alongst on euery side for the bounds of a mile, or halfe a mile at least, very faire mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes which are subject to bee ouerflowed at high tides, and there is Land fit to be laboured lying betweene them and the woods, which doe compasse all about with very faire trees of sundry sorts, as Oakes, Ash, Playnes, Maple, Beech, Birch, Cypresse, Pinc and Firre; The great Riuer doth abound exceedingly in Salmon and Smelts during their season, and euery little Brooke in Trouts. One Lake within this Bay hath yeerely a great quantitie of Herrings, which by reason of a strict way which they passe are easie to be taken, and all the yeere ouer they neuer want shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish, such as Lobsters, Crabs, Cockles and Mussels. The chiefe beasts that inhabite the Woods there, are Ellans, Hart, Hind, and fallow Deere, with store of other wilde
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4583:12"/>
beasts, such as Wolues, Beares, Foxes, and Otters, but the most vsefull of all is the Beauer, both for his flesh that is esteemed to be very delicate for eating, and for the skinne that is of good value; as for wild foule, there is great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and store, of Partridges, Plouers, Woodcockes, Larkes, Wild Geese, Wild Duckes, Heron and Crane, with many other sorts peculiar to that part of the World, and not knowne here.</p>
            <p>Vpon the East side of this Port the <hi>French</hi> did entrench themselues, building such houses as might serue to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate their number, and a little from thence <hi>Monsieur Champlein</hi> did cut a walke through the Woods, where they delighted to repaire in Summer to shroud themselues from the heate, and the rather that they had a sweet Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie which was made by the varietie of voyces, of singing Birds which without any affectation did affoord them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Musicke.</p>
            <p>Some sixe miles further vp that side of the Riuer they built a Barne, and laboured ground for Wheat; ouer against which they made a Water-mill vpon a Riuer, that doth fall in on the West side, the Damme of it beeing there where the Herrings haunt most, and they did likewise try some ground neere by for Wheate, whereas their owne Writers make mention, they reaped aboue fortie for one, but what they did was rather trying the nature of the soile to satisfie their curiositie then to haue a qantitie fit for their maintenance, which they trusted to bee sent vnto them by two Merchants from the <hi>Rochell,</hi> and were that way well furnished so long as they keeped their skinnes to giue them in exchange (but the Merchants either by some priuate conueyances) or by the comming in of some <hi>Flemmings</hi> to traffique, being disappointed by the Planters as soone as they missed their present Commoditie did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise frustrate them of the prouisions that they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Whereupon <hi>Monsieur de Montes</hi> betaking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to trade for Furres. <hi>Monsieur Poutrincourt</hi> resolued to prosecute the Plantation at that place, and sent for his Son
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4583:13"/>
               <hi>Biencourt</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> to bargaine with some that would send them a supply, such as was requisite for establishing of that Colony.</p>
            <p>The first that embraced his Propositions were the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites who as they haue ordinarly good wits which made them the rather capable of so aduantagious a proiect, so they were the more animated thereunto (by vpbrayding the lazinesse of our Clergie) to shew with what feruencie they trauell to propagate the Gospell in doing whereof (whither it be ambition or deuotion that prouokes them sparing no paines) they haue trauelled both to the East and West <hi>Indies,</hi> and to that admired Kingdome of <hi>China;</hi> their Societie in <hi>France</hi> preuayling with all that had any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation either to religion, or to vertue did easily gather a voluntary contribution for the furthering of so commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable a purpose, thereafter they sent away two Fathers of their company with a new supply of all things necessarie to the Plantation at Port <hi>Royall,</hi> but shortly after their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall (their predominant disposition hardly yeelding to any Superiour, specially if it be a Secular power) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beganne to contradict <hi>Poutrincourt,</hi> in the execution of these Decrees which had beene giuen forth by him as Ciuil Magistrate of that place. Whereupon the Gentleman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely discontented, and wearie of contesting with them, hauing said that it was his part to rule them vpon earth, and theirs onely to guide him the way to Heauen, he returned backe to <hi>France,</hi> leauing his Sonne <hi>Biencourt</hi> in his place, who being a youth at that time of more courage then circumspectnesse, disdayning to be controlled by them whom he had inuited thither, and scorning their insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table presumption, and imperious kinde of carriage, vsing Spirituall Armes for Temporall ends, whose spleene had excommunicated and branded him with a Spirituall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, hee threatned them by his Temporall power with a more palpable punishment, so that after much controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, resoluing to separate themselues, the two Iesuites ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a part of the company with them, went from thence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4583:13"/>
to a place in <hi>New England,</hi> called by them Mount <hi>Desert,</hi> where they seated themselues, and hauing a supply from the Queene Mother, did plant sundry fruit trees of the most delicate kinds in <hi>France,</hi> such as Apricockes and Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches neuer intending to remoue from thence.</p>
            <p>At this time Sir <hi>Samuell Argall,</hi> who hath beene Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of <hi>Virginia,</hi> coasting alongst <hi>New England,</hi> to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, discouer, or to acquire things necessary for the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Colonie in these parts, where the Lands are reputed to be more fertile, and the Seas more frequented, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by a description made vnto him by the Sauages, that there were some come from this part of the World to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit there, and being iealous of any thing that might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the honour, or prooue preiudiciall to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Nation, whereof their interest in this was easie to be apprehended, hee went whereas hee was informed that they were, and his vnexpected arriuall, as it would seeme, not onely amazing the mindes of the <hi>French,</hi> but likewise preuenting their preparation, and resolution, he approched so neere to a ship that lay before their Fort, that hee beate them all that were within, with Musket shot, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any vse of their Ordnance, and killed one of the two Iesuites, who was giuing fire to a Peece; hauing taken the ship he landed and went before the Fort, summoning them that were within to yeeld themselues, who at the first made some difficultie, asking a time to aduise, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refused, they priuately abandoned the Fort, stealing out by some back way into the Woods, where they stayed one night, and the next day comming backe rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, giuing vp the Patent they had from the <hi>French</hi> King to bee cancelled, hee vsed them courteously, as their owne Writers doe make mention, suffering such as had a minde to goe for <hi>France,</hi> to seeke out fishers ships wherein they might bee transported, the rest that were willing to goe for <hi>Virginia,</hi> went thither alongst with him, no man hauing lost his life, but onely that one Iesuite who was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led whilest they made resistance during the time of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4583:14"/>
conflict, thereafter Father <hi>Biard</hi> the other of the Iesuites comming backe from <hi>Uirginia,</hi> with Sir <hi>Samuell Argall,</hi> out of the indigestable malice that he had conceiued against <hi>Biencourt,</hi> did informe him where he had planted himselfe offering (as hee did) to conduct him thither. As soone as they were entred within the Port, neere the vppermost of the Ilands, Sir <hi>Samuell</hi> directing the ship to ride at a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable distance to attend occasions before the Fort, did land himselfe with fortie of the best of his men vpon a Medow, where immediatly they heard a Peece of Ordnance from the Fort, and he conceiuing since it was shot whilst it could do no harme that it was done either but to giue terrour to them, or to warne some that might happen to bee abroad, Did make the greater haste towardes the Fort, where hee presently entred, finding it abandoned without any men at all, left for the defence thereof, hee went vp the Riuer side fiue or sixe miles, where hee saw their Barnes and the ground where a great quantitie of Wheate had growne, which he carried with him to serue for Seed in <hi>Virginia,</hi> he saw likewise their Corne Mill very conueniently placed, which together with the Barnes hee left standing vntou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. As for the Fort it selfe he destroyed it downe to the ground, razing the <hi>French</hi> Armes, and leauing no monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remayning, that might witnesse their being there.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Biencourt</hi> who had beene some where abroad trauelling through the Countrey, comming home desired to conferre with Sir <hi>Samuell Argall,</hi> who did meete with him apart from the Company vpon a Medow, and after they had expostulated a space for what had past contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting concerning the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Title to these bounds, at last <hi>Biencourt</hi> offered (if hee might haue a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) to depend vpon our King, and to draw the whole Furres of that Countrey to one Port, where he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide them with him, As likewise he would shew him good Metalls, whereof hee gaue him pieces, but the other refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to ioyne in any societie with him, protesting that his Commission was onely to displant him, and that if hee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4583:14"/>
found him there, after that time hee would vse him as an enemy. <hi>Biencourt</hi> labouring earnestly to haue had the Iesuit (as he confessed) with a purpose to hang him. Whilst they were discoursing together, one of the Sauages came sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly forth from the Woods, and licentiated to come neere, did after his manner earnestly mediate a peace, wondring why they that seemed to bee of one Countrey should vse others with such hostilitie, and that with such a forme of habit and gesture as made them both to laugh.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Biencourt</hi> remoouing from thence to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, <hi>Monsieur Champlein</hi> who had liued long here, did carrie a company with him from <hi>France,</hi> of some fortie persons or thereabouts vp the Riuer of <hi>Canada,</hi> whom hee planted on the North side thereof, with a purpose to serue for a Factorie, drawing all the Trade of that farre running Riuer (which a Plantation would haue dispersed in many parts) within the hands of a few whom he doth command otherwise if his desires had beene bended that way, hee might haue planted many people there ere now, the place is called <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4583:15"/>
               <hi>China,</hi> which hath beene so many sundry wayes with so great charges so long sought-for, howsoeuer in regard of the season, and for want of necessary prouisions, <hi>Champlein</hi> did returne backe at that time with a purpose to goe againe another yeere, which if he hath done is not yet knowne, but this is most certaine, that the Riuer of <hi>Canada</hi> hath a long course and through many goodly Countreyes, some of these great Lakes by sending forth, or by receiuing great Riuers, do affoord meanes of commerce as farre as to some parts of <hi>Terra Florida,</hi> as may bee gathered by <hi>Champleins</hi> Discouerie. And now hauing giuen a breuiarie of all that is done by the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> I will next report of that which hath beene done by some others.</p>
            <p>I will not here make mention of the many and braue Voyages that at the Sea haue happily beene performed by the <hi>English,</hi> which fame by eternall records hath recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to be applauded by the best judgements of euery age, but I will only shortly touch that which they haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by way of Plantation, beginning with the <hi>New-found Land</hi> which was first discouered, and doth lie neerest to this Countrey. Sir <hi>Humfrey Gilbert</hi> hauing a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did take possession of it in her name at Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Harbour, and thereafter purposed to haue seene <hi>Canada,</hi> but encountring with some vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted crosses as hee was returning from thence, seeking to condemne an opinion (malice or enuie ordinarily taxing all aspiring spirits whose vertue by way of reflection doth vpbraide the basenesse of others) that had beene conceiued of him as wanting courage, he precipitated himselfe vpon an other extremitie, not to seeme fearefull, prouing despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; for in the tune of a storme, out of a needlesse braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to shew a contempt of danger, being in a little small Pinnace, and refusing to come to his best Shippe that was of a large burden, hee was suddenly swallowed vp by the waues neere to the Ile of <hi>Sablon,</hi> and his death did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe great hopes of a Plantation that by the generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his minde might justly haue beene expected from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4583:15"/>
him, but long before his time and euer since the <hi>English</hi> had vsed to fish vpon the Banke, and within the Bayes of <hi>Newfound Land,</hi> and the sweetnesse of the benefit ar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The first houses for a habitation were built in <hi>Cupids</hi> Coue within the Bay of <hi>Conception,</hi> where people did dwell for sundry yeeres together, and some well satisfied both for pleasure, and profit, are dwelling there still, finding small difference betweene the seasons of the yeere in that Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and here. There is another Plantation begunne at Harbour <hi>a Grace</hi> within the same Bay by the Citie of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> called <hi>Bristols Hope,</hi> whereas by the sowing and rea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing of some Cornes of sundry sorts doth appeare what further may possibly be expected, And within these three yeeres Master Secretary <hi>Caluert</hi> hath planted a companie at <hi>Ferriland,</hi> who both for building and making triall of the ground haue done more then euer was performed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by any in so short a time, hauing already there a brood of Horses, Kowes, and other beastial, and by the industry of his people he is beginning to draw back yeerly some bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from thence already: which course howsoeuer at first it proue good, or bad for his particular, is by example benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall for the publike.</p>
            <p>Last, I heare that my Lord Vicount <hi>Falkland</hi> now Lord Deputie of <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath this last yeere sent a companie to inhabite at <hi>Reno<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The first Patentees for <hi>Newfound-land</hi> haue giuen mee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4583:16"/>
a grant of that part thereof which doth lie North-west from the Bay of <hi>Placentia</hi> to the great Gulfe of <hi>Canada</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against <hi>New Scotland,</hi> where I had made a Plantation ere now, if I had not beene diuerted by my designes for <hi>New Scotland,</hi> but I purpose to doe it as soone as conueniently I may. The most part of the bounds whereupon any hath planted as yet in <hi>Newfound Land</hi> is found to be rockie and not fit to be manured: it may be these that made choice thereof (neglecting the Land) had onely a regard to dwell commodiously for making vse of the Sea, the present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits whereof doth recompence the losse of that which might be expected by the other, but there can be no hope of any constant dwelling where the people that inhabite doe not take a course to maintaine themselues by their owne Cornes, and pasture, as all there might doe, if they would respect their posteritie more then the present time.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the Continent I must remember the Iles of the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> whose Discouerie and Plantation was procured by so strange a meanes, for a Ship happening to perish vpon their Coast, her passingers seeking the next Land for a refuge, they were compelled to doe that out of necessitie whereunto in good reason, both for honour and profit, they might more warrantably haue beene inuited; Thus doth benefit flowe from losse, safety from ruine, and the Plantation of a Land from the desolation of a Shippe: they found at the first store of Hogs, which in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had their beginning from some such an accident as theirs was, and the Fowles were there in abundance so easie to be taken that they could scarcely be frighted away, these first people by repairing of their Ship which was cast away vpon the Land, or by building some other Vessell out of her ruines, comming backe to <hi>England,</hi> and reporting what was past, some joyned together in a companie after they had taken a Patent thereof from the King, and did send people of purpose to inhabite there, who trusting too much to the goodnesse of the soyle, and neglecting their owne industrie, or not gouerning that well which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4583:16"/>
with them, were reduced to a great distresse for want of victuals, so that, if they had not beene confined within an Iland (more sensible of a present suffering then capable of future hopes) they would willingly haue retired from thence, but a great quantitie of Ambergreece hauing been found by one by chance, and sent backe in a Ship that was going for <hi>London,</hi> their Merchants finding it to bee of a great value, were so encouraged by such a substantiall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that they presently dispatched away a new supply of persons and all prouisions necessary, who arriuing there, and hauing considered what a gulfe of famine was likely to haue swallowed their fellowes, they improuing their judgement by the others experience, by betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to labour in time did preuent the like inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience; there is no Land where men can liue without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nor none so barren whence industrie cannot draw some benefit, All <hi>Adams</hi> posteritie were appointed to worke for their food, and none must dreame of an absolute ease, which can no where subsist positiuely, but onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiuely, according to the occasions more or lesse.</p>
            <p>This Plantation of the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> a place not knowne when the King came to <hi>England,</hi> hath prospered so in a shore time, that at this present, besides their ordinary (and too extraordinarily valued) commoditie of Tobacco, they haue growing there Oranges, Figs, and all kind of fruits that they please to plant, and doe now intend to haue a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar worke. These Iles being about twentie miles in bredth can onely be entred into but by one passage, which is forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and easily commanded by Ordnance, so that, hauing no Sauages within, and fearing no forces without, it is esteemed to be impregnable; and the number of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants there, being neere three thousand persons, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the ground that they possesse, This part may proue exceedingly steadable to this State, if euer it happen to haue (as it hath heretofore had) any designes for seruice in these Seas.</p>
            <p>The first Plantation that euer the <hi>English</hi> intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4583:17"/>
was in <hi>Uirginia,</hi> which was first discouered and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med so by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> who in the time of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did place some persons to inhabite there, who not being supplied in time, or out of ignorance, or lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, not vsing the ordinary means (the vsual fault of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners) were brought by famine to a great extremity. And Sir <hi>Francis Drakes</hi> comming by chance that way did trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them backe with him to <hi>England,</hi> whilest at the same time there was another companie furnished forth by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> who missing them whom they expected to haue found there, did remaine still themselues; but what did become of them, if they did remoue to some other part, perish, disperse, or incorporate with the Sauages (no monument of them remayning) is altogether vnknowne; This noble worke hauing so hard a beginning after a long discontinuance was reuiued againe in the Kings time by a companie composed of Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who (joyning priuate purses with publike supplies) did send thither a sufficient Colonie, well furnished with all things necessary, who after their first comming had a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall warre with the Natiues, till it was reconciled by a Marriage of their Kings sister with one of the Colonie, who hauing come to <hi>England,</hi> as shee was returning backe, died, and was buried at <hi>Grauesend.</hi> Thus euen amongst these Sauages (libertie being valued aboue life) as they were induced to contest in time, before that power which they suspected, could come to such a height, that it might haue a possibilitie of depressing them, so was their malice with their feares, quickly calmed by the meanes of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; Lawfull allyances thus by admitting equalitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue contempt, and giue a promiscuous off-spring extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing the distinction of persons, which if that People become Christians, were in some sort tolerable, for it is the onely course that vniting minds, free from jealousies, can first make strangers confide in a new friendship, which by communicating their bloud with mutuall assurance is left hereditary to their posteritie.</p>

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:4583:17"/>
This longed for peace, though it bred a great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the time, was attended by wrapping them that apprehended no further danger (too common an inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient) vp in the lazie remissenesse of improuident securitie. For a number leauing the seate of the mayne Colonie, did disperse themselues to liue apart, as if they had bin into a well inhabited Countrey, which (as perchance) it had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened the Sauages to imbrace the first occasion of a quarrell, so did it giue them an easie way for executing the mischiefe that they intended, by killing two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred persons before they could aduertize one another, farre lesse, ioyne to oppose them in a company together, which course might not onely then haue made them able to resist, but preuenting the others resolution had kept them from being pursued: yet I heare of late, that they haue reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this iniury (though (as some report) not after a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable manner) by killing their King, with a great number of the chiefe of them whom they suspected most.</p>
            <p>This Plantation of <hi>Uirginia,</hi> if it had not beene crossed by the Incursion of the Sauages abroad, and by the diuision of their Owners at home, had attayned to a great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ere now, hauing had Inhabitants from hence to the number of neere three thousand persons, and if some of them who are there, being Lords of reasonable proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ground, and hauing people of their owne, owing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but due obedience to a Superiour Power, and the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a life conforme to the Lawes, had no care but (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Lands to maintayne themselues) how to build, plant, and plenish in such sort as might best establish a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune for their Posteritie, they might quickly make vp a new Nation, but it is a great discouragement vnto them who dwell there, that they must labour like the Seruants of a Family, purchasing their food and rayment from <hi>England,</hi> in exchange of Tobacco, as they are directed by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, many whereof are strangers to the estate of that bounds, and intending to settle none of their Race there,

haue no care but how the best benefit may presently bee drawne backe from thence, the number of voyces at their assemblies preuayling more then the soundnesse of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, otherwise that Countrey before this time for Wine, Oyle, Wheate, and other things necessary for the life of man might haue equalled for the like quantitie any bounds within <hi>Europe,</hi> to which the soile of it selfe lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nothing but the like industry is no way inferiour.

            <p>As soone as my Patent was passed, resoluing to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Lands, that were granted vnto me, I proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my selfe of a ship at <hi>London,</hi> in the moneth of March, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1622. but that the businesse might beginne from that Kingdome, which it doth concerne, whereby some of my Countrimen might be perswaded to goe, and others by conceiuing a good opinion thereof, to depend by expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4583:19"/>
vpon the reports of such of their acquaintance, as were to aduenture in that Voyage, I directedher to go about by S. <hi>Georges</hi> Channell, to <hi>Kirkenbright,</hi> where she arriued in the end of May; Some Gentlemen of that country, vpon whose friendship I reposed most, happening at that time to bee out of the Kingdome, I encountred with sundry vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted difficulties: the prizes of victuals beeing within the space of three monethes, since I had parted before from <hi>Scotland,</hi> suddenly tripled, and yet so scarce as I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in haste bee well furnished, yet since I was so far aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, lest I should loose that which was done, if I did not the rest, I vsed the best diligence I could to prouide the shippe with all things necessary. Then the very people specially Artizens, of whom I stood in need, were at first loth to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke for so remote a part, as they imagined this to bee, some scarce beleeuing that there could bee any such bounds at all, and no wonder, since neuer any in that part had euer trauelled thither, and all nouelties beeing distrusted, or disualued, few of good sort would goe, and ordinarie persons were not capeable of such a purpose.</p>
            <p>At last, in the end of Iune, they parted from thence to the Ile of <hi>Man,</hi> and after some stay there, in the beginning of August, leauing the sight of his Maiesties Dominions, did betake themselues to the Sea. Though by reason of the latenesse of their setting forth, they had the windes very contrary about the middest of September, they discouered Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Ilands, and were neere to Cape <hi>Bretton,</hi> but yet were beaten backe againe by a great storme to <hi>New-found-land.</hi> And as they passed by the Bay of <hi>Placentia,</hi> neglecting the occasion to place themselues in some part of my bounds, there as they might haue done, they went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Harbour, where they concluded to stay that Winter, and sent the ship home for a new supply of such things as were needfull.</p>
            <p>Though it might haue discouraged mee much, that they had retired to <hi>New-found-land,</hi> foreseeing that what they had with them might be wasted, and that it would bee as

chargeable and difficult to furnish them forth from thence, as if they were to goe of new from <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet rather then they should bee in danger for want of prouision, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me any way guiltie of their losse, that had aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their liues, trusting to my care, I fraughted a shippe of purpose furnished with such things as were required in a Note, which they sent home with their Messenger. This shippe was dispatched by mee from <hi>London</hi> in the end of March 1623. but shee happened to stay so long at <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> first, vpon some necessary occasions, and last by contrary winds, it being the eight and twentieth of April, before shee parted from thence, hauing no good windes at all, that they arriued not at Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Harbour, till the fift of Iune. At their comming they found the company not fit for a Plantion which had first by an vnexpected cause been deuided in two during the Winter, and in May some doubting of a supply, had engaged themselues to serue Fishermen, by which meanes they gained their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and some meanes beside, so that they could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be gathered together againe, and their Minister and Smith (both for Spirituall and Temporall respects, the two most necessary members) were both dead, so that seeing no hope to plant themselues in any good fashion that yeere, ten of the principall persons concluded to go alongst with the ship to <hi>New Scotland,</hi> to discouer the Countrey, and to make choice of a fit place for a Habitation against the next yeere, considering very well, that they could not doe so much good by staying there with so few a number, as they might doe at their returne, by reporting the truth to their friends, of that which they had seene, whereby a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie might be encouraged to set forth well furnished, and instructed according to that which might bee learned by their experience.</p>
            <p>The three and twentieth of Iune, they loosed from Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Harbour, and sayled towards <hi>New Scotland,</hi> where for the space of fourteene dayes, they were by fogges and contrary winds kept backe from spying Land till the eight of Iuly, that they saw the West part of Cape <hi>Bretton,</hi> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4583:20"/>
till the thirteenth day, they sayled alongst the Coast, till they ranne the length of Port <hi>de Mutton,</hi> where they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered three very pleasant Harbours, and went ashore in one of them, which after the shippes name, they called <hi>Lukes</hi> Bay, where they found a great way vp a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Riuer, being three fathom deep at a low water at the entry thereof, &amp; on euery side of the same they did see very delicate Medowes, hauing Roses white and red, growing thereon with a kind of wilde Lilly, which had a daintie smel, the next day they resolued (coasting alongst the land) to discouer the next Harbour, which was but two leagues distant from the other, where they found a more pleasant Riuer then the first, being foure fathome deepe at a low water with Medowes on both sides thereof, hauing Roses and Lillies growing thereon as the other had, they found within this Riuer, a very fit place for a Plantation, both in regard that it was naturally apt to be fortified, and that all the ground betweene the two Riuers, was without wood, and very good fat Earth, hauing seuerall sorts of beries growing thereon, as Goose-beries, Straw-beries, Hind-beries, Rasberies, and a kind of red Wine berie, as also some sorts of graine, as Pease, some Eares of Wheate, Barly and Rie growing there wilde; the Pease grow in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance alongst the Coast, very bigge and good to eate, but did taste of the fitch, this Riuer is called Port <hi>Iolly,</hi> from whence they coasted alongst to Port <hi>Negro,</hi> beeing twelue leagues distant, where all the way as they sayled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longst, they spied a very pleasant Countrey, hauing grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery where such things as were obserued in the two Harbours where they had beene before. They found like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in euery Riuer abundance of Lobsters, Cockles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shel-fishes, and also not onely in the Riuers, but all the Coast alongst, numbers of seuerall sorts of Wild-foule, as Wild-goose, blacke Ducke, Woodcocke, Crane, Heron, Pidgeon, and many other sorts of Fowle which they knew not. They did kill as they sayled alongst the Coast great store of Cod, with seuerall other sorts of great fishes.

The Countrie is full of Woods not very thicke, and the most part Oake, the rest are Firre, Spruce, Birch, with some Sicamores, and Ashes, and many other sorts of Wood which they had not seene before. Hauing discouered this part of the Countrie, in regard of the Voyage their ship was to make to the Straits with fishes, they resolued to coast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longst from <hi>Lukes</hi> Bay to Port <hi>de Mutton,</hi> beeing foure leagues to the East thereof, where they encountred with a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> that in a very short time had made a great Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for though he had furnished one ship away with a great number of fishes, there were neere so many readie as to load himselfe &amp; others. After they had taken a view of this Port, which to their iudgement they found no waies inferiour to the rest they had seene before, they resolued to retire backe to <hi>New-found-land,</hi> where their ship was to receiue her loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of fishes. The 20. of Iuly they loosed from thence, and the seuen and twentieth thereof they arriued at Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Harbour, and from thence sailed alongst to the Bay of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> where they left the ship, and dispatched themselues home in seuerall ships that belonged to the West part of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>This is no wonder, that the <hi>French</hi> beeing so slieghtly planted, did take no deeper roote in <hi>America,</hi> for they as onely desirous to know the nature and qualitie of the soile, and of things that were likely to grow there, did neuer seeke to haue them in such quantitie as was requisite for their maintenance, affecting more by making a needlesse ostentation, that the World should know they had beene there, then that they did contiuue still to inhabit there, like them, that were more in loue with glorie then with vertue, then being alwaies subiect to diuisions amongst themselues, it was impossible that they could subsist, which proceeded sometime from emulation or enuie, and at other times from the lazinesse of the disposition of some, who (lothing labor) could bee commanded by none, who would impose more vpon them then was agreeable with the indifferencie of their affections and superficiall endeuours.</p>

            <p>I haue neuer remembred any thing with more admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then <hi>America,</hi> considering how it hath pleased the Lord to locke it vp so long amidst the depths, concealing it from the curiositie of the Ancients, that it might be discouered in a fit time for their posteritie, they were so farre of old from apprehending it by any reach of reason, that the most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men (as they thought) by infallible grounds, in regard of the degrees of the Heauen, did hold that these Zones could not be inhabited, which now are knowne to include the most pleasant parts in the Word. This neuer came to the knowledge of any Hebrew, Greeke, or Roman, who had the most able mindes to haue found out such a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and howsoeuer some would glose vpon that Fable of <hi>Platoes</hi> Atlantick Iland, I haue neuer obserued any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ancient Writers tending to such a purpose, if it be not these lines of <hi>Seneca</hi> the Tragedian, whereby hee might (if not with a prophetick, yet with a poetick rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) deliuer that which he had a mind to make the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie expect, and was in possibilitie to happen.</p>

            <p>And it is a thing not yet comprehended by the course of naturall reason, how these parts of the World came first to be peopled: We must grant (according to the grounds of Diuinitie) their people to be descended from <hi>Noah,</hi> and it is not long since that (the Loadstone being found out) the best Saylers (scorning as in fomer times to be only coasters) haue brought the Art of Nauigation to that perfection, that they durst resolutely aduenture to search the most remote

parts in the Ocean, and if any had gone thither of purpose to inhabite, they would haue carried with them the most vsefull kindes of tame Cattle, such as Horses, Cowes, and Sheeps, whereof neuer any was found in these parts, till they were transported thither of late yeeres; but onely such wild beasts as of themselues might haue wandred any where through vast Forrests, and Deserts: so that I doe thinke there must bee some narrow passage vpon the East, towards <hi>Terra Australis Incognita,</hi> not yet discouered, from whence people by time might haue come (crossing the Straits of <hi>Magelane)</hi> to inhabite <hi>Brasile, Chile,</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> or rather I should thinke that there were some Continent, or Narrow Sea towardes the North, about the Straits of <hi>Anien,</hi> from whence the first Inhabitants in <hi>America</hi> might haue come; because the wild beasts that are there are creatures most peculiar to the North, such as Elkes, Beares, and Beauers, which are knowne to bee ordinary with the <hi>Russians,</hi> and <hi>Tartarians;</hi> and I am the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this opinion, when I remember of the Mountains of Ice that come floting euery Spring alongst the Coast of <hi>New-found-Land,</hi> which (as it is likely) may dissolue from some Sea that hath beene frozen during the Winter time, ouer which people, and wild beasts might haue commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to passe; but this is a matter that can hardly bee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by demonstration or reason, therefore (all men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that which they know not, according to the square of their owne conceits.) Wee must leaue this to the vnli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited libertie of the imagination of man.</p>
            <p>But the thing most wonderfull of all is this, though now it bee cleerely discouered, that so few are willing to make vse therof; This doth chiefly proceed from want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, few being willing to aduenture vpon that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are not acquainted by their owne experience, and yet those who haue not made triall themselues, if they will trust others, may bee abundantly satisfied by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of a number, who to Plant and Traffique doe yeerely
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4583:24"/>
haunt these parts. If the true estate of that which might bee done at this time by the ioyning of some reasonable company together were rightly vnderstood, then so many would not liue at home as they do, losing their time, where they can make no benefit, and burdenable to them to whom they are not vsefull, rather admitted, then welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the one thinking that their seruice should deserue a reward, and the other that their maintenance is an vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary charge, neither gaining, and both discontented: then would not so many aduenture their liues for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of strangers, whereby they scarce can acquire that which doth defray their owne charges, and howsoeuer the hope of Honour may flatter a generous spirit, there is no great appearance by this meanes to prouide for a Family, or for a Posteritie. And if we rightly consider the benefit that may arise by this enterprise abroad, it is not onely able to afford a sufficient meanes for their maintenance, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conueniently liue at home, by disburdening the Countrey of them, but it is able to enable them to deserue of their Countrey, by bringing vnto it both Honour and Profit.</p>
            <p>Where was euer Ambition baited with greater hopes then here, or where euer had Vertue so large a field to reape the fruites of Glory, since any man, who doth goe thither of good qualitie, able at first to transport a hundred persons with him furnished with things necessary, shall haue as much Bounds as may serue for a great Man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon hee may build a Towne of his owne, giuing it what forme or name hee will, and being the first Founder of a new estate, which a pleasing industry may quickly bring to a perfection, may leaue a faire inheritance to his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, who shall claime vnto him as the Author of their Nobilitie there, rather then to any of his Ancestours that had preceded him, though neuer so nobly borne elswhere, and if the vastenesse of their hopes cannot bee bounded within their first limits, as soone as they haue strengthned

themselues for such a designe, either by Sea or by Land, (in regard of the large Countries next adiacent hereunto) there doth alwaies rest a faire possibilitie of a further encrease, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for them, or for their successours; and so euery one of inferiour sort may expect proportionably according to his aduenture: The Merchans that are giuen to trade, where can they haue a fairer ground for gaine then here; and that besides that which may bee expected from so fertile a Land by industry or husbandry hereafter, in present commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, such as Cod fishes and Herring in the Seas, Salmonds in the Riuers, Furres, Pype-staues, Pot-ashes, and all that may arise from the plentie of good Wood, Mineralls, and other things though not knowne to strangers that onely coast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longst the Lands, that may bee discouered hereafter by them that are to inhabite the Bounds.</p>
            <p>Here those that are so disposed, without making a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall retreate (free from a multitude of troubles) may inioy the pleasures of contemplation, being solitary when they will, and yet accompanied when they please, and that not with such company as (pressed by importunitie) they must discontentedly admit, but onely by them of whom they haue made choice, and whom they haue carried with them, with whom (as partners of their trauells) by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall discourses they may remember their former dangers, and communicate their present ioyes: heere are all sorts of obiects to satisfie the varietie of desires. I might speake of the sport that may bee had by Hunting, Hawking, Fishing, and Fowling, where all these creatures haue had so long a time for increase, without being destroyed or frighted, as likewise of the great contentment that must come by daily discoueries of new Fieldes and Riuers, with the diuersitie of things not seene before that may happen to bee found in them: but I would rather haue all at first to thinke of the paines they must indure, in bringing of so notable a Worke to perfection, since no good thing can be had with ease, and all the sonnes of men are borne to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4583:25"/>
But leauing these worldly respects, the greatest incouragement of all for any true Christian is this, that heere is a large way for aduancing the Gospel of Iesus Christ, to whom Churches may bee builded in places where his Name was neuer knowne; and if the Saints of Heauen reioyce at the conuersion of a Sinner, what exceeding ioy would it bee to them to see many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Sauage people (who doe now liue like brute beasts) conuerted vnto God, and I wish (leauing these dreames of Honour and Profit, which doe intoxicate the braines, and impoyson the minde with transitory pleasures) that this might bee our chiefe end to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a new life, seruing God more sincerely then before, to whom we may draw more neere, by retyring our selues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from hence.</p>
            <p>As I would haue no man that hath a mind for this course, to abuse his iudgement, by trusting too much to the ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the bounds where he is to goe, and too little to his owne prouidence, and industrie, whereby he may be made to neglect the preparing himmselfe for this Voyage after such a manner as is requisite, So I altogether dislike them that possessed with the preposterous apprehensions of feare (like the lazie man of whome <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh, that pretending difficulties to preuent trauell, would say there was a Lion in the way) will needs imagine the worst that is in possibilitie to happen: for such a man (too inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously subtill in coniecturing danger) doth both by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicated opinions disable himselfe, and discourage them, who not being duely informed, are confirmed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of other vndertakers, that professe to haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there is no man at home where he was borne, so free from the accidents of fortune who may not quickly by a publike, or by a priuate calamitie be brought in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to suffer, and much rather should wee arme our selues with a high resolution against all inconueniences that can occurre in such a forraine enterprise (being circumspectly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4583:25"/>
prouident, but not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded with a deiecting feare) where the greatnesse of so well grounded hopes for vs and for our Posteritie should make vs (hoping for pleasure) to disgest any present paine, with a courage greater then can bee bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by any apprehended trouble. And because the Lord in such eminent Exploits doth commonly glorifie himselfe by a few number, I wish that all such whose hearts doe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them portending any disaster (like them of <hi>Gideons</hi> troupes that bowed downe like beasts to the water) should retire in time, ere the contagiousnesse of their infirmitie come to infect them that are more soundly disposed. There is no iust cause for a reasonable man to feare any worldly thing, but onely disgrace and want of necessary maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: A man can hardly fall in the first here, since an honourable intention what euer the successe prooue must acquire prayse, and the other by ordinary meanes, is easie to be auoyded, but I am so farre from painting out a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed facilitie to snare weake minds, that I would haue none (with whom it is not fit to communicate more then they be capeable of) to imbarke in this busines, but only such as do resolue against the worst, for I professe as <hi>Cato</hi> did, when he was to enter the Deserts of <hi>Arabia.</hi>

not onely in the East <hi>Indies</hi> by seuerall Habitations appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated large Territories to themselues, but likewise to the great preiudice of their Neighbours, improouing their owne profit, haue engrossed the generall Commerce by consequence depending thereupon.

(Securely exacting a due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) may enable them for greater matters; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining with the very Springs whence the streames flow that entertayne the power of their enemies (exhausting their substance both by Sea and Land) they haue a maruellous faire occasion offered to aduance then selues by depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the opposed partie whose prosperous and desired successe (whilest the adding to one doth derogate from another) if not emulated in time, will bee enuied here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>I know that many of my Nation if they had beene as willing as they are able had beene more fit then I am for this purpose, but yet it hath oftentimes pleased God to doe the greatest matters by the meanest Instruments. And as no one man could accomplish such a Worke by his owne priuate fortunes, so if it shall please his Maiestie (as he hath euer beene disposed for the furthering of all good Works more for the benefit of his Subiects, then for his owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) to giue his helpe accustomed for matters of lesse moment hereunto, making it appeare to be a Worke of his own, that others of his subiects may be induced to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre in such a common cause, no man could haue had my charge that with more affection and sinceritie should haue vsed his endeuours for discharging of the same, but I must trust to be supplyed by some publike helps, such as hath beene had in other parts, for the like cause whereunto, as I doubt not, but

many will be willing out of the noblenesse of their disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the aduancing of so worthy a Worke, So I hope will some others, the rather out of their priuate respect to me, who shall continue as I haue heretofore done, both to doe and write in so farre, as so meane an abilitie as mine may reach, what (I conceiue) may proue for the credit or benefit of my Nation, to whom I wish all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
