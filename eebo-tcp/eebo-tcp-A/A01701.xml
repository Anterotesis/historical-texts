            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The reaſon and
<pb facs="tcp:12461:4"/>
cauſe that mooued him thereto, is becauſe in thoſe times, the pureneſſe of the Goſpell was hindred, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, whereby manye erroures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſpreade and allowed: and therefore in great Wiſdom it pleaſed the holy Ghoſt, not onely to wryte a faithfull, ſure, and perfect ſtorye: but alſo to offer and preſent the cuſtodye and defence of the ſame, to one of Religion and povver. The verye ſame cauſe partly, hath mooued mee at this time, to be ſo bolde as to offer and Dedicate this poore and ſimple teſtimonie of my trauaile to your Honours. For although I doe confeſſe, vve lyue vnder a Gracious Prince (whome the Lorde long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to his glorye, to the ſhame and confuſion of his enemies, and to the dayly profit of his Church) although (I ſay) we liue in ſo peaceable, happy, and gratious a time, vnder the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate of the Goſpell: yet true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the deareſt Children of God, and the ſinceritie of religion, is ſubiect to bitter perſecution. Theſe wordes at
<pb facs="tcp:12461:4"/>
the firſt maye ſeeme very greeuous, hard and haynous, and yet they are moſt certaine &amp; true. The holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle S. Paule, writing to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> 4 29. ſpeaketh on this maner: <hi>As he that was borne after the fleſhe, perſecuted him that was borne after the ſpirite:</hi> euen ſo is it now: he ſpeaketh of <hi>Iſmaell</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and yet we doe not reade in the ſcripture of any perſecution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, neither did <hi>Iſmael</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his brother <hi>Iſaac,</hi> with hande or ſwoorde, but that which is worſe, proudly &amp; arrogantly, he raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſte him, mocking him, and as it were, treading vnder feete the promiſe of God. And this dealing by the Apoſtle is called a perſecution, &amp; in deede there is not any perſecution more greeuous to the Children of God then this. Now who doth not dayly ſee, that the beſt Chriſtians, and the pureneſſe of religion are greatly perſecuted, by Papiſtes, Atheiſtes, and Hipocrites, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iſmaell.</hi> And of all matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I thinke there is ſcarce anye in

theſe dayes more generally hated of ſuch kind of men, then that, which is moſt altogether, &amp; almoſt only hand led in this ſimple Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For theſe &amp; ſuch like men, many of them can bee content vvith a common ordinarye profesſion, to heare Mattins and Euenſong, and ſometimes a Sermon, by ſuch men as they like off, but that there ſhould be any continuall courſe of the pure preaching of the worde of God, they can in no wiſe allowe or like of. This I ſay, is hated, reiected and perſecuted ſo farre as may bee, of the greater ſorte, and therefore not without cauſe haue I atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this my labor, to your honors as ſpecial patrons, &amp; defendors of the Lords cauſe, and tried Friends and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorers of God and his truth. But yet this attempt may ſeeme very raſh and needles: For who am I, that I ſhoulde take vppon mee to ſet foorth and to publiſh any thing? The vnworthieſt I confeſſe of many hundreths, and the vnableſt of many thouſands, and yet ſeeing many things more ſimple, leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:12461:6"/>
needefull and profitable, are not only ſuffered, but alowed to come abroad: I am not altogether diſcouraged: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath anye man iuſte cauſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me in this my ſimple enterpriſe. I know theſe be dayes of knowledge &amp; learning, there be greate ſtoore of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and learned diuines in our land (whom I beſeech the Lorde to bleſſe, that they may aſsiſt their weake bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in the defence of this, and ſuch good cauſes,) and yet the two mites of the poore widow caſt into the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, amongeſt the great giftes of the wealthy, are not to be refuſed. I know your Honours be dayly hearers of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and learned men, both in your houſes and abroad: you are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſermons of profound &amp; deepe diuines, and ſuch as are mighty in the ſcriptures: notwithſtanding ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in my ſelfe ſufficient trial &amp; expe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rience of your honors moſt curteous, humble, &amp; fauorable dealing towards me, and alſo of ſome liking of my ſimple and poore trauelles in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching heretofore: I am not aſhamed
<pb facs="tcp:12461:7"/>
or afrayd after ſuch triall and proofe, to offer this ſo ſmall and ſimple a thing vnto your honours. The great neceſsitye of the matter I deale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the care of Gods glory, the zeal of his houſe, the benefit that his church may haue by it, hath eſpecially moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me that it ſhould be publiſhed &amp; come abroade. Let not therefore hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites bee too raſhe in iudging, the Lorde the ſearcher of the hearts and reynes, knoweth my purpoſe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in preaching and publiſhing this matter. The cauſe that hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to preſent it to your Honors, rather then to other, is the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g proof and acquaintance of your honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courteſies, and friendly good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards me, which for my part, I am neuer able to requite, for the which I thinke my ſelfe as long as breath is in me, moſt bounde and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to your Honours. And here I offer this poore fruite of my trauaile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſome teſtimony of goodwill and thankfulneſſe. And whereas we are wont commonly to offer and preſent
<pb facs="tcp:12461:7"/>
to our deareſt friendes, ſome gyftes, as tokens of good will, or elſe of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall duety: Amongſt many great and preſcious preſentes, which are no doubt giuen and preſented to your honours, I alſo offer this ſimple mite, and yet I hope more pleaſant and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the receiuers, then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of gold or ſiluer, or any earthly thing whatſoeuer. And in deede, can there be any matter more ſweete and pleaſaunt, to the cheefe Patrons and defenders of the Godly preachers, &amp; the worde of God, then to heare of the neceſsitie, profite, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye of preaching: which things are ſet foorth plainely &amp; largely in this little ſermon. For howſoeuer manye men hate &amp; abhorre this matter, and can in no caſe diſgeſt it: yet your honors zeale, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rage, liking, good will and countenance, to this and other good cauſes, is comonly known and ſpread abroad. A further reaſon why I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe this Sermon, is becauſe there is ſome matter in it, for the which I haue beene in the country where I dwel, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
<pb facs="tcp:12461:8"/>
ſlaundered and euill ſpoken off, and therefore to cleare my ſelfe from ſuch falſe reports, to ſatisfie my friends which are ready to anſwere in my cauſe: to let the enemies knowe, I haue ſpoken nothing wherof I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, but dare put it to the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and teſtimonie of the Chriſtian reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo to reſolue moreful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the weaker ſort, in ſuch thinges as at the firſt ſeeme ſtrange and abſurde: For theſe and ſuch like cauſes, I ſaye, I am content and willing, that this my trauell come to light: although the whole or moſt part of this Sermon is vnſauorie &amp; vnpleaſaunt to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort, and ſpecially to the ignorant people, to the hipocrite, to the idol or dumb miniſter: yet this is that, which chiefly miſliketh and greeueth them: becauſe, both in the place where I preached this Sermon, and alſo elſe where, I ſayd &amp; affirmed, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter which preacheth not, and hath not thoſe giftes which the lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in his Miniſters, that ſuch a one is no Miniſter, approoued of GOD,
<pb facs="tcp:12461:8"/>
neyther hathe any right and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from the Lorde, to miniſter his Sacramentes. Which matter, hovve ſtraunge and abſurde ſoeuer it ſeeme to ignoraunte and carnall men: yet I hope it is heere ſufficiently confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by authoritye and examples of the holy Scripture. I coulde alleadge further, the allowaunce and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſte famous and pure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, and ſuch as are generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and allowed of all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Maſter <hi>IOHN CALVIN,</hi> aboute the latter ende of his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, which is allowed by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties authority, ſaythe in playne wordes, that the miniſtration of the Sacramentes belongeth to them, who haue the charge to preache openlye in the Church. For the preaching of Gods word, and the miniſtration of the Sacraments, be things ioyntly belonging to one kind of office: theſe be his very words which are as plaine as may be.

For although amongeſt many good workes, there is not a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent or better work, then the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word of God (which was done moſt purely, effectually, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently by the Apoſtle) yet he is ſo farre from accounting it meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that he ſayeth, a neceſſitie is laid vpon him, that duetie bindeth him to do it. In the former verſes from the beginning of this Chapiter: S. Paule ſheweth, and that with diligence and large copie of wordes, that beeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to giue place to his owne right, to forbeare that which he might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doe, to take no maintenaunce at all from them, leaſt be ſhould giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of cauilling to the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: as though hee vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the calling of an Apoſtle, ſhould ſeeme to ſeeke his owne gaine and lurre.

And therefore it might bee ſayde? What now <hi>Paule?</hi> What needes all this? Thou art wont to glory in Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, &amp; doeſt thou now glory in thine owne doinges? To ſuch a queſtion or obiection the Apoſtle aunſweareth, qualifiyng his former ſpeach, as if he ſhould ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And if I doe it not, I prouoke and procure the anger of God, and the ſentence of his curſſe and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Woe be to me if I preach not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:</hi> Of theſe words, being but a part of the verſe, I haue taken vpon me to
<pb facs="tcp:12461:12"/>
ſpeake at this time. From whence I meane by Gods grace to ſpeake o<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe three pointes. Firſt I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome deſcription of preaching, that you may know what it is. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I meane to prooue the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of preaching, and that euery mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is bound to preach.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will ſhewe what they ought to preach. The firſt point, as in manye other places, ſo here it is named, but not fully ſet downe what it is, but in other places we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gather what it is. The ſecond is here named and prooued. For <hi>Saint Paule</hi> beeing a miniſter, and ſaying: <hi>Woe be vnto me if I preach not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> doth plainely affirme as much. The third is here ſet downe moſte plainely, the matter that we muſt preach of, namely the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>As touching the firſt, let vs ſee how the Scripture ſpeaketh of it, as it is particularly and ſpecially applied to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publique office of the miniſter, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I know this worde prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, to haue a further and more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb facs="tcp:12461:12"/>
ſignification: But I ſpeake of it, as Chriſt and the Apoſtles do, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to the miniſters. <hi>Saint Paule</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor 14. 3.</note> ſayth, <hi>He that prophecieth, ſpeaketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men to edifiyng, to exhortation, and to comfort.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle charging <hi>Timothy</hi> and in him euery miniſter, to preach the worde, addeth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, <hi>Improoue, rebuke, exhort, with all</hi>

               <hi>long ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> The bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> as he receiued of his<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 2.</note> maſter a charge to <hi>feed his flocke,</hi> ſo he exhorteth al other to do the ſame.</p>
            <p>The holy Euangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> ſayeth,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 16.</note> that Chriſt taught or preached in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> He firſte read, then ſhut the booke, afterwarde he expounded that ſcripture which he read: and ſo appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the hearers.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and ſuch like places, we may gather, that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching properly as we ſpeake of it, is an expoſition and application of the ſcriptures, by the liuely voyce of the miniſter, to the edifiyng of the people: whereby it may eaſily appeare that reading is not preaching, nor yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in a miniſter approued of God.
<pb facs="tcp:12461:13"/>
               <hi>Saint Paul</hi> wil haue him apt to teach.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2.</note>

            <p>The Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> affirmeth, that the Prieſtes lips muſt preſerue<note place="margin">Mala. 2. 7.</note> knowledge. Chriſt after reading ſhut the booke and expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and yet ſome are not aſhamed to count ſimple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſufficient: ſaying, it will ſerue the turne, and there may be as much good done by it, as by preaching. As for reading, we ſpeake not againſte it, we diſalow it not, but account it a holy, lawfull, neceſſarye, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meane, wherby great good and benefite is wrought to the Church of God: but yet, it doth not followe that it is ſufficient in a miniſter, that it will ſerue ſimply of it ſelfe in the publique congregation. The Lorde hath ſet d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>n an other order, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth greater thinges at the hands of his ſpeciall ſeruauntes. But this matter ſhal appeare more plaine in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes following: For my purpoſe in this part is, onely to ſhew you by ſome circumſtances and deſcriptions what preaching is, &amp; that reading is not preaching, or at leaſt that kind of
<pb facs="tcp:12461:13"/>
preaching which the Lord requireth in his miniſters, as may appeare by comparing them together, and by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome apt ſimilitudes for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of this matter. The ſmell or ſight of meat doth good to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie man, but it will not feede him, except he taſte of it: So by reading, men may haue ſome ſmell of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they ſhall neuer throughly taſte of it, without preaching, and therefore it is called a feeding, as we heard before, and Preachers are counted Paſtors and féeders. Again, meat that is rawe and fatte, maye bee called good, but it is not to bee eaten before it be made readye and dreſſed: ſo are the Scriptures read, good holy and pure, but not ſufficient food, for the people, without preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Againe, bare reading is as thogh one ſhoulde caſt a whole loafe, before<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 15.</note> them which want ſtrength to cut it, Preaching is a cutting and diuiding of the breade of life, that euery one may haue his ſeueral portion. Again bare reading without preaching, is
<pb facs="tcp:12461:14"/>
euen as the huſbandman ſhould caſt whole ſtrikes and buſhels of Corne, on his land together on heapes, not ſcattering of it: preaching is a ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th. 13.</note> and a ſowing of the ſeed. Again bare reading is, as though the Fiſher ſhould ſhuffle his nets on heapes, not opening them: Preaching is a wiſe opening, laying and handling of the Net.</p>
            <p>Bare reading is as one ſhoulde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer good treaſures, and yet ſuch as were hid, ſhut vp and faſt locked, and coulde not be come by: Preaching is an opening of the treaſures, to the ioy of Gods children. Reading is like to fire couered with aſhes, which doth ſmally profite them that ſtand by it: Preaching is an opening and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of the fire. Let vs conſider one example amongſt many, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explaning of this matter. The Chamberlaine that noble treaſurer of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> going to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to<note place="margin">Act. 8. 27.</note> worſhippe God as he went, read the Scriptures: if reading woulde haue ſerued his turne, <hi>Philip</hi> needed not to
<pb facs="tcp:12461:14"/>
haue come to him, but he vnderſtoode not before he had a guide: he was not conuerted, neither had he faith ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſaluation, before he hearde the preaching of the worde, which in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed is that eſpeciall, effectuall, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and excellent ordinarye meane of faith, as it appeareth more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and fully in the next part of our text.</p>
            <p>Which beeing rightly waighed, confirmeth the great neceſſitye of preaching, and prooueth that euerye miniſter ought to preach. <hi>Woe be to me if I preach not the Gospell.</hi> And why ſo? becauſe I am called to it, becauſe I am a miniſter, becauſe the Lorde requireth it of me. Although Saint Paule and the other Apoſtles had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and prerogatiues, which we haue not: although we haue not fullye ſo large a Commiſſion, as he and they had: although they did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye thinges, which we neither may, nor can do: yet as touching the office of preaching, it appertaineth as well to vs, as to them. And for the further
<pb facs="tcp:12461:15"/>
proofe of this matter I will rehearſe ſome argumentes, which before I haue vſed in this place, adding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others to them.</p>
            <p>1 It is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Chriſt and the holy Apoſtles, therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Chriſt ſaide to his Apoſtles, <hi>Goe preach the Gospell.</hi> The which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,<note place="margin">Mar. 16. 15.</note> in this behalfe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all the miniſters of God. <hi>Saint Paule</hi> ſtraightly chargeth the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Epheſus. <hi>Take heede vnto your</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20, 20.</note> 
               <hi>ſelues, and to all the flocke, whereof the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt hath made you ouerſeers, to feede the Church of God, which he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his own bloud.</hi> And moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily of all, he requireth it in the place already alleadged, he leaueth it not as a thing indifferent, that may bee done, or vndone, but ſpeaketh with a wonderful and mighty proteſtation, hee ioyneth the Scripture and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching togeather. For hauing before in the former Chapiter, ſet foorth the great profit of the ſcriptures, ſtraight waye hee neceſſarilye addeth this<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 1.</note> forecible exhortation. <hi>I charge thee</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12461:15"/>
               <hi>therefore before God, and before the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which ſhall iudge the quicke and the deade at his appearing, and in his kingdome: preach the worde, be instant, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, improoue, rebuke, exhort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 It is an argument and token of the loue the miniſter oweth vnto Chriſt and to the people, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>Iohn. 21. 15.</hi> where Ieſus Chriſt ſayth to <hi>Peter</hi> after his reſurrection. <hi>Simon ſonne of Iona, loueſt thou me more</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 21. 15. 16. 17.</note> 
               <hi>then theſe? He ſayde vnto him, yea Lorde, thou knoweſt that I loue thee: he ſayde to him, feed my Lambes.</hi> He ſaid vnto him the ſecond time. <hi>Simon the ſonne of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, loueſt thou me? He ſayde vnto him, yea Lorde, thou knoweſt that I loue thee: he ſayd vnto him, feed my ſheepe.</hi> Chriſt ſaid to him the third time. <hi>Simon the ſonne of Iona, loueſt thou me? Peter was ſory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſayde to him the third time, loueſt thou me, &amp; ſaid vnto him, Lord thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt all thinges: thou knoweſt that I loue thee. Ieſus ſayd vnto him: feed my ſheepe.</hi> Whereby it is euident, that thoſe which feed not, loue not Chriſt: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:12461:16"/>
then that feeding or preaching, is ſo plaine a token of the loue that the miniſter oweth to Chriſte: it is moſt neceſſarily required, if any do preach and yet not vpon this loue, they haue their condemnation,</p>
            <p>3 The church of God is begunne and grounded, by the preaching of the worde: and therefore neceſſarie. <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth, <hi>Faith commeth by the word</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17</note> 
               <hi>preached.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, he counteth his preaching amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> a planting<note place="margin">1. Co. 3. 6.</note> of them in faith and religion. <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſayth: <hi>We are borne a new, not of mortall ſeed, but of immortall, by the worde of God,</hi>

               <hi>who liueth and endureth for euer.</hi> And preſently addeth. <hi>This is the worde which is preached among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 By preaching, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of God is not onelye begunne, but alſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 1. Heb. 5. 12. &amp; 6. 1.</note> builded and enlarged. It will not onely make vs Babes in Chriſt, but ſtrong and ſpirituall men.

<pb facs="tcp:12461:16"/>
to the beginning of Chriſte, and firſte rudimentes of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but alſo we are ledde forwarde vnto perfection. The holye Apoſtle affyrmeth this, when as he ſayeth, that <hi>Ieſus gaue ſome to be Apoſtles, and Prophetes, and ſome Euangelistes, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 11. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>ſome Pastours and Teachers, for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Saintes, for the worke of the Miniſterie, and for the edification of the bodie of Chriſt vnto a perſect man, and vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 The Church of God begun and brought to that perfection which can be in earth, is alſo ſtayed, ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, vpholden and preſerued, by the preaching of the word, againſt ſinne and errour. And therefore for theſe cauſes alſo, the preaching of the word is moſt neceſſary, yea and that dayly and continually, becauſe ſome are weake, and haue neede of dayly ſtrengthning, ſome fall into errours, and ſome into greeuous ſinnes, from the which they are to bee drawne
<pb facs="tcp:12461:17"/>
out by the effectuall preaching of the worde. This doth the holy Apoſtle confirme, whereas he ſaith, that <hi>The whole Scripture is profitable to teach, to</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 16.</note>

            </p>
            <p>6 Againe, to the pure preaching of the worde, the Lorde hath promiſed a bleſſing, the miniſter ſhal be bleſſed, the people alſo bleſſed thorough it: <hi>They that bee wiſe</hi> ſayth <hi>Daniell, <hi>ſhall</hi>

            <p>7 On the other ſide, without this, both the miniſter and the people are accurſed, the bloud of the people ſhall be required at his handes, becauſe he hath not as a faithfull watch-man,<note place="margin">Eze. 3. 17</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:12461:18"/>
forewarned them of daunger, and yet they ſhall dye in their owne ſinnes.</p>
            <p>The Lorde complayneth by his Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> ſaying, <hi>My people</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſea. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>are deſtroyed for lacke of knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt refuſed knowledge, I will alſo refuſe thee, that thou ſhalt be no prieſt to mee.</hi> To this agreeth our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 13.</note> Chriſt. <hi>If the ſalt haue loſt his ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is good for nothing, but to be caſt out, and to be troden vnder foote of men.</hi> And if theſe miniſters which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haue had ſalt in them, zeale, and knowledge to ſeaſon the people, and by negligence and careleſneſſe, decaye and looſe it: If theſe I ſay be worthie to be caſt out, how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and curſſed are they which neuer had, nor yet haue any Salt in them. It muſt needes be fulfilled of them which our Sauiour ſpeaketh in an other place: <hi>They be blinde leaders of the blinde, and if the blinde lead the blind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 14.</note> 
               <hi>both ſhall fall into the ditch,</hi> that is, both the ignoraunt Miniſter, and the ignoraunt people ſhall periſhe.
<pb facs="tcp:12461:18"/>
And in an other place it is ſayde, <hi>Caſte that vnprofitable Seruaunt into</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 30</note> 
               <hi>vtter darkneſſe, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> And here it is ſayde, <hi>Woe be to me if I preach not the Goſpell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then, that euery way there hangeth ſo many greeuous curſſes, both vppon the miniſter and people, where the worde is not preached, it is moſt requiſite and neceſſarie, that euery miniſter looke to this, euen as hee will eſcape the fearefull and heauie curſſe of God.</p>
            <p>8 Moreouer the chiefe ende and<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4. 1. Cor. 14.</note> vſe, why the Scriptures were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, doth require preaching. They are left for our comfort, inſtruction, and edifiyng. But we are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, inſtructed, and edified, if they be opened and applyed vnto vs, and therefore moſte neceſſarie that they be ſo vſed.</p>
            <p>9 Alſo the corruption and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our nature, requyreth the ſame. We are dull, ignoraunt, and careleſſe: wee pleaſe our ſelues in
<pb facs="tcp:12461:19"/>
our owne ſinnes, the Deuill goeth about continually to deuour vs, and therefore we haue neede to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall preaching of the worde. The naturall man perceiueth not the<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14.</note> thinges that are of Gods ſpirit. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> after he had ſinned, continued in<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> his ſinne, vntill the Prophet reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him for it, yea, and woulde not take it to him ſelfe, although <hi>Nathan</hi> ſpake a verye plaine parable, till it was particularly applyed to him. Seeing then there is in our nature ſuch corruption, ſuch blindneſſe, ſuch ſlouthfulneſſe, and alſo forgetfulnes: what can be more neceſſarye for the curing of theſe ſo great diſeaſes, then the continuall and dayly preaching of the word?</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, it hath beene an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall order in the Church of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lawe, by Chriſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, not onely to reade, but alſo to expound and apply the Scriptures, and therefore the ſame order is to be<note place="margin">Nehe. 8. 8.</note> obſerued of vs. It is ſayde of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites</hi> that they red in the booke of the
<pb facs="tcp:12461:19"/>
lawe of God diſtinctly, and gaue the ſence, and cauſed them to vnderſtand the reading. Chriſt as we haue heard already, continuallye preached and commaunded the ſame to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who as they obeyed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues their maiſters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, ſo they required it as a continuall and vſuall rule to bee obſerued for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, of all the miniſters of God in his Church.</p>
            <p>And moſt ſpecially the Apoſtle in thoſe Epiſtles which he wrote vnto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> very largely and effectually vrgeth this matter. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you alſo vnto the 14. chapter of his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> wherin ſo highly he commendeth the gift of Propheſiyng, interpretation or preaching, that he preferreth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other giftes, and accounteth it ſo neceſſary, that he would haue it continually obſerued in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Againe, Chriſt commaundeth vs, and we dayly pray for the enlarging of his Kingdome, whereas hee hath
<pb facs="tcp:12461:20"/>
taught vs to ſay, <hi>Thy kingdome come:</hi> Now, the ſingular &amp; excellent means to eſtabliſhe the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, is, by the pure and effectuall preaching of the word, and therefore he ſaith in an other place, <hi>Pray to the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 9. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Lord of the Harueſt, to ſend foorth labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers into the harueſt.</hi> And how can they pray with any ſafe conſcience, for the enlarging &amp; eſtabliſhing of the king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, which by their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce and careleſnes, do altogether hinder it? Furthermore, all and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the names, which are giuen by the holy Ghoſt to the miniſters, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, do neceſſarily require at their handes preaching. They are called the light of the worlde, the ſalt<note place="margin">Math. 5. 13. Ezech. 34. 2. 1. Cor. 4. 1.</note> of the earth: They are called Paſtors and ſheepheards: they are called huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, Guides, Stewards &amp; Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, beſides many other excellent titles giuen to them. Now, how can they be called lightes, which haue no light in them, which either are in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce and darkneſſe themſelues, or elſe hide their candle vnder a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel?
<pb facs="tcp:12461:20"/>
How can they be called the ſalt of the earth, which cannot or wil not ſeaſon the vnſauorie and ſinfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with the heauenly and wholſom doctrine of eternall life: How can they be called Paſtors and teachers, which do not feed, or haue no foode at al to giue to the flocke? How can they be called the Lordes Huſbandmen, which haue no ſkill at all in tilling his ground, and ſowing his ſeed? how can they be called Guides vnto other, which either know not the way them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues, or elſe will not vouchſafe to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and declare it to other? How can they be called ſtewardes, which haue no care of the houſhold, which either can not or will not feede them? And how can they be called the Lordes meſſengers, which are not able to do their meſſage, or haue no care at all to doe it. If the miniſter be a light to the people, of neceſſitie he muſt needs goe and ſhine before them in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and doctrine. If he bee the Salt, he muſt needes ſeaſon. If he be a Paſtour or Sheepehearde, he
<pb facs="tcp:12461:21"/>
muſt needes feed. If he be a huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he muſt needes haue a care of the lords huſbandry. If he be a guide, he muſt needes ſhew the way. If he be a Stewarde, he muſt prouide for the houſhold. If he be a meſſenger, he muſt be willing and able to doe his meſſage: nay, I ſay more, it ſtandes for the Lordes glorye and credite to haue ſuch Paſtors, and ſuch huſband men, ſuch Stewardes &amp; meſſengers, as haue wiſedome and knowledge. The poore people of the countrie wil not hire him to be a Sheephearde to their ſheepe, whome they know to be ignorant and careleſſe: and ſhall the Lord chooſe ſuch to gouern and guide his ſtocke? The Gentleman and the Yeoman, wil not hire any to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of their huſbandrie, except they know them to haue ſufficient diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and experience: and wil he think ye be content with ſimple, fooliſh, and rechleſſe ouerſeers of his ſo deare and precious a huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry? The noble man for his honors ſake, wil ſeeke to haue ſuch a one to be the Stewarde of his
<pb facs="tcp:12461:21"/>
houſe as is truſtie, wiſe, &amp; of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie to guide and gouerne a whole houſhold: and ſhall the Lorde be leſſe careful of his honour? ſhal he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with vnwiſe and vnfaithful ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes? The Prince wil haue a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care to ſende ſuch to be his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers and Ambaſſadors, as be moſt wiſe &amp; faithful, &amp; are able diſcreetely and cunningly to doe their meſſage: and ſhall the Lordes meſſengers bee without knowledge? What can bee more to the diſcredite and diſhonor of his holye name? This argument I amplifie the more, becauſe it is verie plaine and effectuall. Marke I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you wel: al theſe &amp; other names giuen to vs in the holy ſcripture, doe require of euery miniſter of god, that he preach the worde. As we haue a care to anſwere to our names, and a care of the glorye and credite of our God: euen ſo let vs be carefull in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſo neceſſary a duetie. What ſhal I ſay more, the end and purpoſe of our calling &amp; miniſtery requyreth at our handes preaching. The Lord
<pb facs="tcp:12461:22"/>
hath ordained Paſtors &amp; teachers, for the gathering together of his ſaints, and to the edification of the bodye of chriſt: ſéeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are called to this ende, ſéeing we are ordayned to this purpoſe, there is no remedie, we that are the miniſters of God, muſt needs of neceſſity preach his worde. For a further proof &amp; concluſion of this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, I cal you to recorde, I appeale to your own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, which are now won to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord, which haue ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledge, which are called out of darkeneſſe to light, from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to knowledge: yee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſometime haue béen content with reading mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, &amp; quarter ſermons, but now hunger and thirſt for the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: I cal you I ſay, as witneſſes in this cauſe, what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort you feel, what profite, what power in the effectuall preaching of the word? how careleſſe how prophane, how ignoraunt, how leud you were before, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the dayly and the ordinary readings which diligently you had? what hath wrought in you y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meaſure of faith, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12461:22"/>
heauenly knowledge which you now haue? What is it, that hath wrought in you ſuch a ſorrowe of your former life, ſuch a griefe &amp; hatred of ſin and ſuperſtition, both in your ſelues and others, ſuche an earneſt zeale of the word, ſuch a conſcience &amp; a care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your ſelues &amp; your houſholdes: What (I ſaye) hath wrought theſe things in you? how came you by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? What is it that hath ſo altered your mindes, déedes &amp; affections: Let your conſcience be witneſſe to me in this matter. I am ſure you wil approue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I haue ſpoken, &amp; acknowledge the profite, the power and neceſſity of the worde preached.</p>
            <p>All &amp; euery one of theſe arguments do prooue and confirm, as I think, that euery miniſter neceſſarily ought to preach, and otherwiſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is no mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter approoued of God. Al &amp; euery one of theſe, or moſt of them do quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and condemne, all dumb, idle &amp; careleſſe miniſters whatſoeuer. One day they ſhall know, what account he maketh of the ſoules of his people:
<pb facs="tcp:12461:23"/>
for ſeeing the word of the Lord, in ſo many places, requireth in a miniſter preaching, yea, diligent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carefull preaching: in what a miſerable and damnable ſtate doe theſe men ſtand. The Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>Woe be to me if I</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 16.</note> 
               <hi>preach not the Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Well, it may be, whatſoeuer I haue yet ſpoken will be granted, it is neceſſary that euery miniſter preach: but what ſhall all thoſe be condemned which haue not ſuch ful meaſure of knowledge as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue, which be not accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted and allowed for publique preachers? God forbid: I know there is difference in gifts, there was ſo amongſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but they all ſufficiently prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Amongſt vs and ſuch others as vſe this place, and ſuch like places, there is difference, euerye one of vs haue not the like meaſure: but for my part I ſpeake as I thinke, our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is ſmal ynough, yet the Lord be thanked for that we haue, &amp; giue vs grace to vſe it to his glorye, &amp; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his church. In my ſelfe, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and grant very ſmal and weake
<pb facs="tcp:12461:23"/>
meaſure, inſufficiency, and lacke of giftes, and the Lorde the ſearcher of the hearts knoweth, that the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this hath and doth make me to feare and tremble oftentimes, to ſigh and lament, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſo greate a charge, and ſo waighty a burthen is layd vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, ſo ſimple and weake a wretch.</p>
            <p>To you that haue any meaſure of thoſe giftes which the Lord requireth in his miniſters: to you (I ſay) quench not the ſpirite, vſe the meanes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your meaſure, if you be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, carefull, watchfull, and faithfull in your Miniſterie, with a holye and pure affection, the Lorde will bleſſe<note place="margin">Math. 25. 29.</note> you. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be giuen,</hi> wee cannot at the firſt come to perfection.<note place="margin">Acts. 18. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Appollos</hi> a learned Doctor, feruent in the ſpirite, and mighty in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet was he ignoraunt in ſome things, and receiued inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s from <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla.</hi> Some haue more then others, ſome haue ten talentes, ſome fiue, and ſome but one, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remember, and let it neuer ſlip out of your minds, that the ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:12461:24"/>
and vnprofitable ſeruaunt ſhall bee caſt into vtter darkneſſe, there ſhall bee weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. Againſt ſuch I ſpeake, which in deede neuer had any one Talent, or any giftes of Miniſters, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any, doe either abuſe them, or at leaſt doe not put them ſoorth to any profitable vſe. Conſider a little the ſtate of our miniſtery. There be ſome amongeſt vs ſacrificing and Maſſing Prieſtes, full of manifeſt ſuperſtition and hypocriſie, and in trueth ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſts religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Others there be altogether ignoraunt, vnlearned, very Idoles, they can do what? Euen iuſt nothing. Others there be, which may haue ſome grounde of learning, but in deede they vtter verie little, neither is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people bettered by them. Some are idle, ſome careleſſe, ſome altogether lewd and prophane: ſome ioyne liuing to liuing, and take more vpon them, then they can diſcharge, although it may bee they ſpeake in one place, yet are they dumbe in an other. All theſe and ſuch like are
<pb facs="tcp:12461:24"/>
worthie of blame, to bee openlye ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken agaynſte, becauſe they openlye commit offence. All theſe ſtande dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a miſerable and damnable ſtate without repentaunce. But my chiefe drift at this time in this part of my Text, is, to prooue as you haue heard, that euerye Miniſter approoued of God muſt preache, that is, hee muſt féede the people, he muſt cut the word<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Let vs not take vppon vs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointe him what he ſhould do. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath ſet downe preaching, as the moſt excellent, &amp; ordinarie means to ſaluation: let vs not ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reading will ſerue the turn: Séeing that he requireth that his Miniſters be apt to
<pb facs="tcp:12461:25"/>
teach, let vs not count them his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters which neuer taught, nor euer had any aptneſſe in them. If he may bee counted a lawfull Miniſter and teacher that onely readeth the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Seruice, and ſometime heareth a fewe Children to ſay a Catechiſme without booke, as it is ſet downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, then may the Cleark alſo of the Town be counted a miniſter, and teacher: then may euery huſbandma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Seruingman, nay, euery boy or child that can do aſmuch, be ſo counted. Let not ſome ſay for defence of ignoraunt miniſters, that if they do that, which they can do, it will ſerue the turn: for in the building of an houſe, as there be ſome Maſter builders which bring timber and Stone, ſo other there bee, which bring morter and fillings, and ſerue to neceſſarye vſe, but let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euerye Myniſter in his charge, is, or oughte to be a builder, yea a maſter builder, and if the cheefe builder bring nothing but fillinges, how ſhall y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lords building in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> place goe forward? The Apoſtle in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> place
<pb facs="tcp:12461:25"/>
which hath bene already twiſe allea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged, ſaith, <hi>That the Lorde hath ordained the Minister for the gathering together of his Saincts, and for the edification of the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 12. 1.</note> 
               <hi>body of Christ, till we all meete together in the vnity of fayth &amp; knowledge of the Son of GOD, vnto a perfect man, and vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> Oh theſe be no ſmall things: theſe are no trifles, this is no vile, ſimple, and drudgery worke, no ſmall meaſure, but very greate, weightye, high, and moſt excellent. The holy ghoſt in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place ſayth: <hi>Leauing the doctrine of the beginning of Christe, let vs be led for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> 
               <hi>vnto perfection, not laying againe the foundation of repentance from dead workes, and of fayth towarde God, of the doctrine of baptiſme and laying on of hands, &amp; of the reſurrection from the deade, and of eternall iudgement.</hi> Marke I beſeech you theſe wordes: There be many people, yea and Miniſters alſo, that are ignorant of the firſt rudiments of Chriſte, that of repentaunce, of Baptiſme, of the reſurrection, of eternall iudgement, are able to ſaye nothing to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
<pb facs="tcp:12461:26"/>
but yet let it be ſo, that ſome can doe this: they can teach as they ſay in ſome meaſure: they can Catechiſe, &amp; lay the grounds of Religion, yet this will not ſerue the turn, there muſt be building after the foundation, there muſt be a leading to perfection. The Lorde in building the materiall Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, did chooſe men of ſinguler wiſedome, and vnderſtanding: and will he be content, with euery drudge and bungler in the building and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of his ſpirituall Tabernacle? But herein cheefly, haue ſome gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red offence and griefe, becauſe I haue ſaide in this place before, and alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where, that ſuch Miniſters haue no righte to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>This ſeemeth a ſtraunge and hard doctrine: yea, ſome are not aſhamed to count it erronious and hereticall. If I would ſtand vppon the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men, I could alleadge for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Chriſtians are receiued and allowed, as the beſt, moſte learned, and moſte pure diuines, that euer were ſince the time of the Apoſtles, but this I hope ſhall not neede. For, if of neceſſitie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie miniſter ought to preache: or if all the former arguments will ſerue to prooue this: then alſo that other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, how ſtrange and abſurd ſoeuer ſome count it: muſt, I ſay, needes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly follow, that none ought of right, to deal with the Lords ſacraments, but his Miniſters.

inſtruct them in the ſame. If any wil ſay that this is donne by the dumbe miniſter in reading the words of the inſtitution: he preacheth: he ſheweth and publiſheth Ieſus Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo may I ſay, that he or any other doth the ſame, and that more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if they do but ſay their beliefe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly before the congregation, but we ſpeake of a ſingular, of an effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, of an excellent and liuely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his death, which is by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.

This is the power of preching, this is the duetye of the miniſter, plainely and effectuallye to diſcribe and ſet ſoorth the merite of Chriſt his paſſion, ſo that it may be ſeene as it were before the eyes.</p>

Chriſte, although there were ſundry cauſes why he woulde not Baptiſe, yet hee miniſtred the Supper to his<note place="margin">Mark. 1. 38.</note> Apoſtles, but Chriſt was a preacher, yea, he preached then of his death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Math. 26. 20.</note> the firſt miniſtration and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of that ſacrament, leauing vs an example to doe the like.</p>

            <p>Conſider further I beſeech you, the great inconueniences which followe in theſe places where the word is not preached, the people are ſtill in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce and blindeneſſe, and kept ſtil

And is it not then moſt fit and conuenient, when the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is to bee miniſtred? but we are ſo farre from hauing any vſuall preaching before the Sacrament, that ther be many thouſands, which neuer heard any preaching at all of

            <p>Nowe Repentance is a part of the Goſpell, and that wee may repent, it is needeful to knowe our ſinnes, and as the ſinns of al men muſt be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and the iudgementes of GOD threatened againſt them, ſo eſpecially the ſinnes of publique perſonnes, as Magiſtrates and Miniſters: And if this in no caſe will be borne, but hee that doth it, is ſtraight way blamed, alaſſe, what ſhall we doe? If we ſpeak againſt the people, they are greeued, they ſay we deale hardly with them, but looke not to our ſelues or to the higher powers.

daungerous a thing it is to preache the Goſpell, yea euen amongſt them that glorie in the Goſpell, ſo that as our ſtate ſtandeth, it may bee ſaid cleane contrarie to the ſaying of the Apoſtle in this place: Woe to them that preache the Goſpell: and happy are they which preache not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and they are counted wiſeſt which either holde their peace, or elſe meddle not with this parte of the Goſpell.

And to aunſwere them ſomewhat which blame vs for dealing ſo hardly and openly againſt the ſinnes of the miniſters: Is it not a part of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reprooue their ſins which doe meſt hurt, and are the cauſes of many other ſinnes? this is that diſcretion which was vſed by the holy prophets euery wher.

no light, ſmall or eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grieuous curſe of god in this life, and that feareful condemnation in the life to come. Can they be too ſharpely reprooued, or can any ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be too hard for them, which are ignoraunt and careleſſe in ſo great a light of the Goſpel, after ſo long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion? which ſhoulde be guides to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which haue ſo many excellent meanes, ſo great helps of knowledge, offered to them by the Lorde, in theſe dayes which we liue in? Can they be too much or too often ſpoken againſt, which are ignoraunt, and will be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, which miſlike thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue them, which hate all that are not like them ſelues, which ſeeke to deface the painfull miniſter, yea, and ſtande in defence of their owne wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe? Is not this to bind ſinne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Cart-ropes? Sinne not twiſe, ſaith the wiſe man, for one ſin ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, and therfore take heed in time and amend, or elſe you periſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſay what you wil, thinke what you will, the Lord is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

I ſpeake the truth. I know I might be better thought of to paſſe ouer ſuch matters, but <hi>Woe be to me if I preach not the Gospell.</hi> But it may be yet that ſome will ſaye, although this be true that you haue ſpoken, yet all truth is not to bee ſpoken at all times, in all places, and to all perſons. The miniſter muſt cut the worde of God aright: Like a wiſe Stewarde, he muſt giue meat in due ſeaſon. To theſe men I aunſwere, that no neceſſarie truth is to be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from the Church of God. And to ſpeake more fully and directly to the purpoſe, as touching this matter of the neceſſitie of preaching, of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate of them that be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and of ſuche miniſters as preach not: This matter I ſaye in my conſcience, with wiſedome and diſcretion may be ſpoken priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or openly, whereſoeuer, when ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, &amp; before whomſoeuer: there is no place, but it hath need of this doctrin, no time but it requireth it, no perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that it is not meete for. It is moſt fit

and conuenient, moſt profitable and neceſſary for all eſtates and degrees of men, high and low, rich and poore, ſtrong and weake, learned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, Princes, Nobles, Byſhops, Preachers, dumbe Miniſters and people, all haue neede of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. They which haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, haue neede of it, that they may knowe what they haue beene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they maye ſee what they are, and bee thankfull to God. The ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt ſorte haue neede of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that they may feele their miſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table eſtate, and ſo ſeeke for help and remedy. Princes, Nobles and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, haue neede of this doctrine, and it is fit and neceſſary to bee preached before them, that knowing the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and worthines of preaching, they may be more carefull and liberall to maintaine it, and with better conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence beſtow their liuinges. The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Biſhops haue neede of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>rine, it is chiefly to be vrged before them, and they are continually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, leaſt they lay hands raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:12461:37"/>
on anie man, and ſo be partakers of other mens ſinnes. The wiſe and godlie Preachers haue neede of this doctrine, that they may be comforted and ſtirred vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to greater zeale and trauaile: ignoraunt miniſters haue néede of this doctrine, that they may ſee the damnable ſtate they ſtand in: and ſo either amend if it will bee, or els giue themſelues to ſome other cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, more fit and profitable for them. Let this doctrine be ſtayed: let men be perſwaded, as they are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they are in good ſtate without the word preached, that bare reading will ſerue the turn, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple waxe careleſſe, and make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of preaching. For they thinke they are well inough, and beſt of all without it, the people of God ſhall lacke their ſtrengthning, their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in faith and knowledge: Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Gentlemen wil make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (as they do but little already) how, or on whome they beſtow their liuinges. The preachers ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſet by, the Idoll miniſters en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb facs="tcp:12461:37"/>
the famous vniuerſities decayed and ouerthrowne: and in a word, the concealing, hindring, and withſtanding this doctrin, is the next way to caſt downe all religion and learning: to bring Princes, Nobles, rich and poore, Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to hipocriſie and Atheiſine. The Lorde therefore open the mouthes of his faithfull Miniſters, to the daily vrging of this ſo neceſſary a doctrine, that the prince may be ſtrengthened, the Nobles ſtirred vp, all good mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters encouraged, the poore people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, ignoraunce and idolatry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, Religion and knowledge of God, may flowe thorow the whole lande, that at the length, all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt and careleſſe miniſters may be aſhamed, and euery congregation may haue a faithfull, ſeuerall, and a reſident Paſtor. Thus wee haue ſeene at large, that whoſoeuer will preach the Goſpel faithfully and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, he muſt firſt of all, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vrge the doctrine of repentaunce, which men can neuer haue, before
<pb facs="tcp:12461:38"/>
they know their ſinnes by the law of God, and therefore the ſinnes of all men muſt be thoroughly and ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprooued, and cheefly the ſinnes of them which do moſt hurt, and giue greateſt occaſion of offence: as the ſin of the Magiſtrate and the miniſter.</p>
            <p>Now indéed to repentance, ther muſt be ioined alſo the doctrine of remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes through Chriſt. But this belongeth onely to them that repent, that are humbled and caſt down, that feele in their conſcience the torment of ſinne and condemnation, to ſuch belongeth remiſſion of ſinnes, to ſuch it is to be offered and preached, but it doth not appertaine to ignoraunt and ſenceleſſe men, to Hypocrites, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, Atheiſts, Iuſticiaries, prophane and carnall men: theſe haue nothing to doe with the doctrine of remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this age is altogether ſecure and careleſſe, full of iniquitie, of ignorance, diſobedience, vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and contempt of the worde: it is vnworthy of the doctrine of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb facs="tcp:12461:38"/>
and remiſſion of ſinnes, ſo much the more worthy, as the benfites of God in ſo great meaſure, and ſo long a time haue beene receiued without anye profite at all, ſo that in manye there is nothing ſtil, but ignoraunce and idolatrie, in others leſſe zeal and religion, leſſe Godlineſſe of life then was in them many yeares agoe: and are theſe men worthy of mercy? Is remiſſion of ſinnes to bee preached and offered to them, nay the former doctrine of repentance, of the lawe of reproouing ſinne, of denouncing the iudgements of God againſt al ſtates and degrées. This part of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, I ſay, is moſt fit and néedfull for ſuch an age. And <hi>woe bee to vs, if wee preach not the Gospell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider alſo, I beſéech you here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we goe to an ende, the excellency and worthineſſe of the preaching of the goſpel. It is ſmall accounted of in the worlde, it is thought a vile and a ſimple office, it is contemned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moſt part: But if theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knew the ſweet and excellent things

               </gap> is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of preaching, they would alſo know the worthineſſe of this ſo high a calling, and that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency thereof may more clearelye appeare, let vs ad ſome ſurther proofe of this matter. And firſt remember, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this calling of the miniſtery &amp; preach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of the worde, is no deuiſe of any mortall man, but the ordinance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing God. It was he that ordeined <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. <hi>The Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy came not in the olde time by the will of</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> 
               <hi>man, but holy men of God spake as they were mooued by the holy ghoſt.</hi> The Lord Ieſus himſelfe, called, appointed, and<note place="margin">Mark. 3. 13.</note> ſent foorth into the worlde his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to preach the Goſpell: It is the holy Ghoſte, which ordayneth ſayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> ouerſeers to feede the Church of God. It is Chriſte alſo at this day, which appointeth Paſtors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 11.</note> for the gathering together of his ſaints. It muſt needes be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and an honorable calling, which hath ſo worthy authors, euen God him ſelfe, his ſonne Chriſte Ieſus,
<pb facs="tcp:12461:39"/>
and the holie ghoſt: yea, and not only ſo, but as worthy haue exerciſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and practiſed this calling. The firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that euer was in the world was God him ſelfe, he preached to <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe that comfortable Goſpel, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall deſtroy the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi>
               <note place="margin">Geneſ. 3.</note> 
               <hi>head.</hi> After that he ſtirred vp <hi>Noe,</hi> and <hi>Lot, Moſes</hi> &amp; the prophets, men of ſingular credite and authority. Nay what ſhall I ſpeak of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> of the which, the one was a moſt victorious prince, and the other moſt wealthy, &amp; yet they haue gotten more glory and credite, by their doctrines and inſtructions, then by all their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; triumphes. Theſe are gone and they are gone, but their good counſel, their Prouerbes, their Pſalmes, and Preachings, remaine and abide for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for their euerlaſting memorie, to the glory of God, and dayly profite of his church. The firſt miniſter &amp; Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the new Teſtament, was <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, of whom Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith, there was not a greater<note place="margin">Mark. 2.</note> Prophet amongſt womens children.
<pb facs="tcp:12461:40"/>
Nay Chriſt himſelf was alſo a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Goſpell, &amp; witneſſeth that he came into the worlde euen to that purpoſe. After him, the Apoſtles alſo were ſent into the world, euen to this end. Seeing then that God himſelfe, &amp; his ſonn Chriſt Ieſus, haue vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to preach the word: ſeeing ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men as the Prophetes &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were ordained to this purpoſe, it muſt needes follow that the office of preaching is moſt famous, worthy and excellent. The worthineſſe alſo of our calling moſt euidently appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the worthineſſe and price of the things committed vnto vs, which is the people of God, the Church of chriſt, his deare ſpouſe, the very price of his bloud: If ſo great thinges be committed to vs: If the Lorde put vs in truſt with ſo deare and precious thinges, our calling muſt needes be worthy and notable. Remember the notable effect and fruite of this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the winning of ſoules, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and ſaluation of the faithful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It pleaſed GOD by the fooliſhneſſe of</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:12461:40"/>
               <hi>preaching to ſaue them that bleeue.</hi> And further, the worthy matter of preaching, is both here &amp; other where ſet downe, namely the goſpel, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of reconciliation, the worde of grace, the good newes and glad tidinges of ſaluation, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtimony of Ieſus chriſt, repentaunce and remiſſion of ſinnes. O that al men woulde conſider this, that the glorye of Gods miniſterys might appeare. If princes, noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Patrons, would remember this, they woulde haue more care &amp; conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in beſtowing their liuings, and in defending the good miniſter. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> king of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the time of<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 22.</note> famine, had ſuch a care to prouide for his idolatrous prieſts, that he would not ſuffer them to ſell their land, but gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſufficient ordinary to liue vpon. This example of an idolater in prouiding for idolatrous prieſtes ſhal condemn many chriſtian gentlemen. which haue a great deal leſſe care for true &amp; chriſtian miniſters, which are ſo far from adding any thing of their owne to their maintenaunce, that
<pb facs="tcp:12461:41"/>
rather dayly by deceit or violence, they take that from the Miniſter, which long agoe was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by others. Let the Papiſt, the Atheiſt and hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite remember &amp; conſider the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy calling of the miniſter, that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide all contempt, ſkoffing, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine &amp; railing, they might in heart, reuerence and honor the Lords ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: and let al people reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber this, that they may chierfully yéeld honor, obedience, reuerence &amp; maintenance to the faithfull miniſter, remember that his calling is of the Lorde, that he hath to deal with your ſoules, that his purpoſe is to win you to the lord, that hee preacheth no leſſe a thing then the holy goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt. Now theſe things rightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, is he not worthye to be obeyed and maintained? <hi>How beautiful are the feet</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> 
               <hi>of them, that bring the glad tidinges of peace:</hi> And read al which is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the chapter, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you may know that he which preacheth the Goſpell, by right and equity ought to liue of the Goſpel. Let al good miniſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb facs="tcp:12461:41"/>
this for their comfort, and inſtruction, that howſoeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world thinke of them, they haue a worthye and high calling, and let them not faint, but make their miniſtery fully knowne, and ende their courſe with ioy: and let al ignorant and careleſſe miniſters, eſpecially remember this doctrine, that ſo they maye either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, or elſe come to ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. If the Lord be the authour of the miniſtery, the ſoules of the people are committed to vs: If the effect of our calling be to ſaue the ſoules of the people: if we haue to deale with the goſpel of Chriſt: if ſo famous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table men haue alwaies been in this calling, what a man ought the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to be? what care? what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience? what knowledge? what zeal and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye conuerſation is required at his hands? you may ſee and witnes with me, I ſpeake nothing to the defaring and diſcredite of the miniſter of God, but rather to his great credite &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: his calling is moſt worthy &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, he is worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb facs="tcp:12461:42"/>
he is to be obeyed and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently maintained, he is the ſtewarde of the lords houſe, and the meſſenger of the lord of hoſtes. But as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſter is to haue his credit and commendation: ſo the ignoraunt and careleſſe ſort, as we haue ſufficiently already prooued, are to be caſt downe &amp; defaced, becauſe by their ignorance, idleneſſe and leud conuerſation, they greatly diſhonour the Lorde, &amp; deface his glory. I conclude and ende with the holy Apoſtle: <hi>I beſech you brethren, that you know them which labour among you, and are ouer you in the Lord, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh you, that you haue them in ſingular loue for their workes ſake.</hi> By the which place, we ſee that ſuch as labour not, admoniſh not, and worke not (ſuch I ſaye) are not worthye of any loue or honor, but rather to be thruſt out and baniſhed, as vnprofitable members out of the church of God. The which the Lord of the harueſt, graunt for his tender mercies, in Ieſus Chriſt. Amen.</p>
