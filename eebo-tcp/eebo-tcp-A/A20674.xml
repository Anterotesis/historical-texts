            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

they had by cuſtome of ſinne loſt the very principles
of reaſon: doing thoſe things (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which
are against nature.</hi> Rom. 1. 26. But now at length
through an eſpeciall calling by God's grace, they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10637:4"/>
were well rid of that wretched eſtate in which they
lay; being inſteed thereof indued with many rare gifts
both of the will &amp; vnderſtanding; like men therefore
newly recouered from out the dungeon into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
ſunſhine, they doe not moderately enioy this
ſo vnwonted a light, but with too much exultancie:
they wax proud and high minded: Before they ſinned
in not knowing God or what was right, &amp; now they
take an occaſion of tranſgreſſing from the abundance
of their knowledge; As the Apoſtle ſpeakes of leaven
1. Cor. 5. that <hi>a little of it leaueneth the whole lumpe:</hi>
ſo here chiefly by a little ſelfe-conceipt of knowledge,
all their other graces are in danger to be corrupted.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> therefore to coole and allay this heat of
ambition is very diligent: firſt he adviſeth them in the

Out of the ſecond generall, whereas it is denied that

(ſaith <hi>Lactantius) nec quaeri debet:</hi> if myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
cannot be ſounded by vs, neither ought they at all
to be diſcuſſed; It is true that whatſoeuer may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to our happineſſe, the Lord hath revealed moſt
gratiouſly; he hath giuen vs his word to bee our guid
and comfort; For as the Iſraelites were in the vaſt
Wilderneſſe, ſo are we beſet with ſinnes and errours
in this world: as they then iournied towards the
earthly Canaan through conduct of thoſe two <hi>pillars</hi>
Exod. 13. v. 21. ſo may we walke ſafely on towards the
heauenly by the guidance of his double Teſtament;
Nothing there is that may help to further vs, but it is
either in both, or in one of them imparted: But as for
high and ſublime <hi>myſteries</hi> the Lord hath greatly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10637:5"/>
concealed them; hee hath as it were cloſe lockt them
vp: For ſuppoſe he did communicate and lay them
open, they would not ſo much inſtruct our faithes, as
amaze our iudgements. Flaſhes and ſtrictures of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
doe indeed enlighten the eye, but by reaſon of
too ſubtile a nature they doe alſo hurt it: euen ſo my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
too abſtract are apt to dazle the weakneſſe of
reaſon, if they were preſented vnto vs.</p>
            <p>There are I confeſſe degrees of knowledge: the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
man vnderſtands a great deale more then the
carnall: his eyes be newly <hi>vnſcaled</hi> by grace, as once
<hi>S.</hi> Pauls were: but it is touching matters of ſaluation
or faith: as for theſe hidden and abſtruſe points he is
ſtill dim-ſighted. In the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the Apoc. v. 2. tis ſaid,
<hi>who is able to open the booke?</hi> who <hi>but the Lyon of the
tribe of Iuda?</hi> It is meant of the booke in which ſuch
ſecrets lie coucht, and infolded; where you may note,
that wee, nay the beſt of God's Saints, are ſo vnfit to
expound the contents, that wee may not ſo much as
vntie the claſpes.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon of this may be, both mans dulnes,
and the abſtractneſſe of theſe points; as for man, he is
of an vnderſtanding much darkned: what it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fall, whither as of a <hi>Viator,</hi> or a <hi>Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi>

matters not: but certainely he did not then apprehend
ſupernaturall things more fully, then ſince hee doth
ſearcely and with dimneſſe; As the earth is, ſo are the

vrge by way of ſimilitude from the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
memory, and will, doth but badly illuſtrate the
cauſe; for if the <hi>Father</hi> begot the <hi>Sonne</hi> as the power
of the vnderſtanding produceth its act, them muſt the
<hi>Sonne</hi> beget another <hi>Sonne</hi> as being with the ſame
power indued: likewiſe as the <hi>Spirit</hi> is produced by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10637:6"/>
loue, ſo ſhall it produce againe a <hi>Spirit</hi> by loue;
wherefore this inſtance fals ſhort of a due reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance:
Yet is it I confeſſe the beſt helpe and ſhadowe
for expreſſion that either here wee haue or may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect:
Whilſt <hi>Moſes</hi> kept vnvailed,<note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> the Iſraelites could
not indure to look vpon his face it was ſo bright; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may wee behold this myſtery vnleſſe it bee
through ſuch ſhadowes and that but weakly; So then
that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath here defined, is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
true:<note place="margin">Apolog.</note> 
               <hi>Deum aeſtimari facit dum aestimari non
capit:</hi> wee doe beſt apprehend God either in his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
or in the Trinity, if we confeſſe that we cannot.</p>
            <p>Come now to thoſe attributes of his power, his
will, and ſuch like; what man is able poſſibly to reach
them? Who doth not ſtreight acknowledge his dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
So long as the vnderſtanding meets with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
equall and befitting it's ſtrength, it doth well
enough; but the hand you knowe cannot graſpe a
thing bigger then it ſelfe: neither can a finite appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
throughly conceaue thoſe properties, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infinite: it doth well conceaue that they are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
but not the infiniteneſſe; <hi>hee is as high as heauen
what can'ſt thou doe? deeper then hell what canſt thou
knowe?</hi> Iob. 11. v. 8. By the power indeed of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
was this round world framed; his arme and
ſtrength laid the foundation of it, no man doubts: but
cleerely to apprehend the manner of its production,
requires more then a finite capacity; our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is not able to paſſe ouer ſo vaſt a diſtance, as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
betweene an vtter nothing, and the newneſſe of a
being. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes it an act of faith to perceiue
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10637:6"/>
this, <hi>Through faith wee vnderſtand that the worlds
were framed,</hi> Heb. 11. 3.</p>
            <p>Yet eſpecially are thoſe myſteries of his will and
decree moſt abſtruſe; for they be not only abſtract in
their owne nature, but alſo concealed by God of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>No man knoweth the things of a man ſaue the
ſpirit of man which is in him,</hi> 1. Cor. 2. <hi>And a prudent
man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) concealeth his knowledge,</hi> Prov.
12. v. 23. Now God is all wiſdome, and for this muſt
be as ſecret in his determinations, as he is iuſt and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
whither he reprobates men abſolutely, or vpon
a preſuppoſed fall, ſeemes a queſtion of a perplext dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty:
Againe, whither he allowes ſufficiency of
grace to all or not, 'tis eaſier to argue, then finde out
wherevpon to pitch a ſetled aſſent. The Aegyptians
to declare the abſtruſeneſſe of their rites did place
vpon the forefront of their Temples the picture of a
<hi>Sphynx:</hi> how much more iuſtly may wee doe ſo? So
many ſcruples doe occurre in the bulke of diuinity,
which if they be ſearched vnto the bottome, they far
ſurmount humane reach.</p>
            <p>I let paſſe here that <hi>great myſtery</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paule</hi>
calls it) of Chriſt's being incarnate; that of the <hi>laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing</hi>
of our bodies, both which for their ſeeming
impoſſibility, were points in times paſt which ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
profeſſors of the Chriſtian faith did moſt hardly
digeſt; humane reaſon proued ſo incapable to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them, that they became vnto it a rock of offence:
Neither ſtand I to inlarge thoſe diſputes of the
<hi>worlds conſummation,</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> with others, not
ſo rightly to bee tearm'd doubts as riddles; Not the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10637:7"/>
Angels themſelues perchance do comprehend them,
as being of that rancke into which they doe but <hi>peepe</hi>
as before they did into that of the redemption of man
kinde. <hi>Mirandula</hi> in his Apologie much extolleth
certaine <hi>Cabalisticall</hi> volumes which he had, as if in
them all ſuch myſterious doctrines had beene darkly
comprized; for (ſaith he) beſides the holy writ, God
did ſo provide that whatſoeuer is to be known, might
out of theſe be collected by the more wiſe and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Iewes: which his opinion he groundeth vpon Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras.
Eſdr, 2. 14. This is but a meere fancy, yet ſo farre
it agreeth to right, that by it is intimated the abſtruſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of diuine truthes; <hi>Out of whoſe womb commeth
the yce</hi> (ſaith the Lord) Iob. 38. or, <hi>haſt thou entred
into the treaſures of ſnowe?</hi> If not into thoſe naturall
ſtorehouſes of yce &amp; hayle, much leſſe can we aſcend
into thoſe ſpirituall ones of which I ſpeak: Doubtleſſe
they are more remoued, and being heauenly they as
farre exceed the compaſſe of mans wit, as the heauen
is diuided from the earth.</p>
            <p>Neither bee theſe alone of chiefeſt moment ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volued,
but leſſer alſo and thoſe which we perhaps do
iudge our ſelues to vnderſtand compleatly; But that
of <hi>Gods prouidence</hi> &amp; the adminiſtration of the world,
may ſeeme to haue ſtagger'd the kingly Prophet: how

occaſion long ſince to the blaſphemous Pagans to
deride it as a groundleſſe fabricke of the braine: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues
much and knoweth little, yea knowledge it
ſelfe here is but a kinde of practicke beleife: <hi>If any man
will doe (Gods) will, hee ſhall knowe of his doctrine,</hi>
Iohn 17. v. 17. Take but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for an inſtance, a
man of rare excellency; one who had beene wrapt vp
aboue the heauens and himſelfe: yet (as himſelfe doth
imply) he heard thoſe things in his rapture, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10637:8"/>
he did not well conceaue; nay in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Iewes reiection, and calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
when he hath driuen it to a head as neere as hee
can, he meets with a ſea vnfordable; hee is faine to ſit
downe as it were vpon the banke, and cry out, <hi>O the
depth of the wiſdome and knowledge of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will conclude this point with the words of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian;<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note>
that which he ſpeaks of ſtate miſteries, may of
theſe be more fitly pronounced, <hi>Non aliter ratio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat,
quàm ſi vni reddatur:</hi> it is the priuiledge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
myſteries, that they be vnderſtood of God alone.
As for others, a bold enquiry here, is not more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent,
then full of <hi>danger</hi> and hazard, Which is my
ſecond point.</p>
            <p>When men walke vpon prerupt and ſteepe places,<note place="margin">2.</note>
they are ſubiect to fall; and ſo here by medling with
theſe high points, an errour or hereſie is quickly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred;
yet ſuch is the intemperate deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that men cannot bee bounded in the ſearch
thereof; Even our firſt parents in Paradiſe were not
free from this itch;<note place="margin">De orthodox, religione. L. 4.</note> where when all the trees beſides
were granted them for vſe, they muſt needs taſt the
excepted fruit, which (as <hi>Nicetas Chomates</hi> imagineth)
was nothing but an allegory or figure of knowledge.
Hence in their poſterity ſuch luſting after nouelties:
ſuch an vnſatiate curioſity. In truth to aſſwage this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in part, the Lord hath wholly expoſed all the
creatures to mans diſquiry; as it is ſaid of the Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
Pſalm. 104. that God hath made the <hi>wide Sea</hi>
for him to <hi>play in,</hi> that is to expatiate and take his
ſwinge; ſo hath he as it were made this lower world
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10637:8"/>
for mans delight and contemplation; he may roue as
he liſt, and not only reſt in the outſide of things, but
alſo lawfully diue into the inmoſt eſſence.</p>
            <p>But for <hi>Divine myſteries,</hi> if we preſſe too farre, we
become obnoxious to errors &amp; ſlips; for from whence
ſprang hereſies of old in the Chriſtian world, but
from this fountaine? Whilſt men in the ſearch of
truth were directed rather by too much ambition,
then an aduiſed modeſty; whilſt they would needs be
tampering beyond their skill in points of the chiefeſt
moment. Hence is it that wee finde more hereſies to
haue ariſen concerning thoſe two greateſt myſteries
of the <hi>Trinitie</hi> and <hi>incarnation,</hi> then about all the
reſt: Arians, Neſtorians, yea moſt ſects did ſtumble at
theſe blocks: The ſtomacke when it meeteth with
meats hard and not well to bee digeſted, it ſends vp
noxious vapours into the braine: euen ſo theſe men
lighting vpon points which were too knotty for
them, and not being guided by diſcretion, inſteed of
doctrines broached their wild conceipts: For this
cauſe wee finde the Fathers euermore cautelous and
very retir'd. Read but S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Hilary</hi> in his 2. l. See before
the entrance of his diſpute concerning the Trinity,
how he puts on, and then falls backe, venters againe
and recoyleth as faſt: <hi>mihi</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in ſenſu labes, in

aſtoniſht. The good Father may ſeeme rather to
haue feared a ſurreptitious curioſity,<note place="margin">Gelaſius Cucycenu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </note> then if he ſhould

they would to proue the myſterie, but for the manner

            <p>Such was their religious diffidence in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
and ſuch others alſo; to whom I could wiſh that
the Schoolemen were not vnlike. But contrariwiſe
what arrogancy doth wholy poſſeſſe them? How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectleſſely
doe they thruſt into the moſt hidden ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets?
It was a time when the Lord gaue command,
Exod. 19. v. 12. that none, neither man nor beaſt ſhould
<hi>touch</hi> the mount where himſelfe was. And ſurely
there is great reaſon why the ſame edict ſhould bee
proclaim'd againe: this boldnes of ſome wits calling
too nicely into diſpute, thoſe myſteries, which are
more iuſtly to be adored; Euer and anon they diſcuſſe
the abſoluteneſſe of their makers power: what may be
effected by it, and what not: ſometimes they argue his
freedome and will, and happily limit it with ſome
vaine diſtinction: Nay ſo audacious are many, that
except they ſport themſelues in theſe myſteries they
be not contented; witneſſe for inſtance ſake thoſe
queries, whither God be <hi>materia prima,</hi> and, whither
<hi>Chriſts divinitie might not ſuppoſitate a fly:</hi> which &amp;

            <p>Neither in this are the Arminians leſſe to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:

they ſoare vp on high euen into the boſome of the
Almighty: men oftimes of greater reach in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,
then of wiſdome or diſcreetneſſe. Our Saviour
once tooke vp <hi>Peter,</hi> Ioh. 21. 21. but for that frivolous
queſtion: <hi>What ſhall this man doe?</hi> Hee is offended
with the Diſciples for inquiring too narrowly after
the <hi>reſtauration</hi> of the Iewiſh eſtate, Act. 1. 6. how
much more is it to be feared that hee will ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
thoſe forenamed intruders, if they learne not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to curb their knowledge; <hi>Auſtin</hi> in one of his

recouer our ſelues: let vs examine rather by our courſe
of life our hopes of bliſſe or not, then curiouſly looke
it in the firſt decree. Our ſinnes and miſeries require
the goodneſſe of a mediatour: as for a Sophiſter to
diſpute the occaſion we need not; eſpecially ſince, as
<hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe concludeth, theſe points be not

            <p>Yet are they ſtill ſo fraught with ſubtilties, that the
very pervſall may ſeeme of greater danger, then it can
be of profit. How often ſee wee many here to ſuffer
ſhipwrack, whilſt they couet to goe farther then their

<hi>David</hi> Pſal. 36. compareth the iudgements of God

can finde footing, we be well and ſafe: but if that faile,
a feare ſtreight ſeizeth on vs of being plunged: thus
in abſtruſer myſteries, as long as we can haue the help
of reaſon too, wee may wade the more ſecurely on:
but when that once is ſwallowed vp,<note place="margin">Et de Orpheo etiam Hygin Poet. &amp; Aſtro. nom. L. 2.</note> a mazeleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion

forgoe many difficulties, if wee can percance vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
any. But ſo it is, that thoſe who meddle here, do
for the moſt part exceed their limits; as it happeneth
in ambition of ſtate, they neuer deeme themſelues
high enough, till they touch vpon danger. God in
many places of Scripture is ſaid to be <hi>a fire,</hi> as Deut.

a iewell ineſtimable: yet ſo apt are men to bee miſled

their own wit, then the iuſtneſſe of the argument they
haue in hand; for this reaſon you may note how er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

ſame ground perhaps alſo the word <hi>infrunitus</hi> of
the ancient latines, doth as well imply an inſolent
man, as one that is void of ſence; when the limbs
ſwell and wax ouerbig, it is no ſigne of health in the
body, but rather of a dropſie, or ſome diſeaſe: ſo tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this arrogancy proceedeth moſt commonly from
an vnſoundnes of the braine, as not comprehending
yet but what the vaſtneſſe of knowledge is.</p>
            <p>Hence, thoſe bitings and cenſures againſt others:
ſuch malignant vndervalewing, whereby wee leſſen
our brothers name that wee may encreaſe our owne;
<hi>livor</hi> (ſaith <hi>Petrarch) Semper lippus est:</hi> this humor

augment their repute who practiſe it. The
moone may darken and eclips the ſunne, but withall
it looſeth its owne light: and they by deprauing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

            <p>But now on the other ſide, men of growth and

ſuch doe well conceiue the length and breadth of

of this point doth but lead vs into the ignorance of
another; how the infinitneſſe of learning groweth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs in the very getting of it. If men walke abroad the

opens forthwith as they haue left behinde; thus in the
courſe of learning; vpon any purchaſe of ſome little

we ariue there farther difficulties ariſe before vs; ſtill
there remaineth ſomething behinde vnſcand; <hi>For as

then we can be wiſe and learned.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe thou haſt attained to the higheſt top

            <p>it muſt be ſomething of their owne induſtry and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuement
that pufs them vp: now knowledge, it is
chiefly a gift of Gods benevolence: hee giueth to one
the power of tongues: to another the vnderſtanding
of artes; and to all as beſt him pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake not of an infuſed ſcience; not of the ability
which the Prophets and Apoſtles had: but that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of the common ſtraine may ſeeme in a peculiar
manner to proceed from God; Neither yet know I,
how far forth here he affordeth his influence, by what
concurſe: onely I am perſwaded that he doth concur
vnto this by a more ſpeciall aide, then to other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the like ranke;<note place="margin">Vid. ad initia. 7.</note> Euen the Philoſophers concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
this,<note place="margin">L. de artibus.</note> had there deities (as <hi>Capella</hi> alſo alludeth)
to whom ſeuerally they did attribute each art; who,
if hee doth conſider thoſe prime fathers of the
Church: how powerfully they withſtood troopes of
hereſies out of the copiouſneſſe of their knowledge:
who can imagine but that they were thus helpt? Yet
not by inſpiration, but by a particular and vnknowne
aſſiſtance; <hi>Euery good gift, &amp; euery perfect gift is from

               </gap>
a gift of God; Now there is no endowment of the
minde more excellent then this of knowledge; it is
the eye and guide of the reſt, if wee doe not abuſe it
through ſelfe-conceipt: if, as venemous beaſts wont
to doe by nutriture, we turne not that to poyſon and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10637:13"/>
our hurt, which of it ſelfe is good.</p>
            <p>I will end this point with the words of the Apoſtle:
<hi>If any man thinke that hee knoweth any thing, hee
knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know:</hi> he knoweth
not according to ſobriety: not according to the rule
of holy <hi>writ</hi> and <hi>reuealed</hi> grace, which is my laſt
point.</p>
            <p>Since mans ſpeculations and fancies of themſelues
are ſo extrauagant, God hath wiſely prouided lawes
to binde them withall. Now lawes (ſaith the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>)
bee either <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

namely forcible cuſtomes,<note place="margin">Inſti<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> but no where inrowled:
and ſo is the rule wherewith God guideth our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in divine myſteries, partly deſcribed in his
word, and ſometimes reuealed beſides the holy writ.</p>
            <p>As for the word it is a treaſury full of moſt rare
knowledge. There are who hold no art or ſcience to
be extant, which is not at leaſt wiſe implicitly contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in it: for, ſay they, ſome clauſes doe here appeare
of each faculty: ſome prints and footſteps. On this
manner haue <hi>Criticks</hi> likewiſe thought all Philoſophy
to ly hid in <hi>Homer,</hi> and iudge him as various an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
as an excellent Poet. Either opinion I let paſſe,
though not as vnprobable, yet as remote from my
purpoſe; Certaine it is that whatſoe're may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
beget, or encreaſe a divine knowledge, the
Lord hath amply ſet downe in his word; For he hath
not giuen it alone to conforme our wils, but alſo to
enrich the tables of our vnderſtanding; <hi>to make vs
wiſe 2 Tim.</hi> 3. It is confeſt to be a kinde of ſcience, as
farre ſurpaſſing the reſt in worth, as divinity doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10637:13"/>
fraile nature. Dauid though a prophet proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that hee grew thereby more <hi>wiſe,</hi> then were his
teachers: How often doth he pray and entreat to bee
fully inſtructed in it.</p>
            <p>So then, that conceipt of the Cardinall <hi>L. 4. De
verbo Dei,</hi> is but a meere figment; as if things of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
need, were comprized therein, and not matters
of peculiar &amp; ſecret vſe. It is ſaid to be as a <hi>light that
ſhineth in a darke place 2. Pet.</hi> 1. a <hi>Candle put on a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick
Mat.</hi> 5. 15. Now a light ſo placed, doth not
lighten only the open rooome, but every nooke and
corner thereof. Nay I will adde, it is an <hi>armory</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
the zealous diſputer with proofes againſt ſo
blaſphemous tenents; a <hi>garden</hi> out of which the holy
diſpenſer may decke vp his diſcourſe into a Prophets
phraſe; what things are of neceſſary and a ſauing vſe
be there moſt plainly diſcloſed; others indeed but
dimly; whereas the word growes obſcure, ſo ſhould
our ſearch bee more cautelous and circumſpect; wee
muſt not vent our coniectures for oracles at all, leaſt
whilſt we annex ſuch gloſſes, we corrupt the text. The
good <hi>Samaritan</hi> in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Luke</hi> deliuered <hi>two
pence</hi> to the hoſt for the wounded traueller:<note place="margin">L. 6. Et Ambroſius in exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one advirgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. L.</note> 
               <hi>two
pence</hi> (ſaith <hi>Optatus</hi>) that is Chriſt hath bequeathed
vnto vs for our ſoules health both lawes, the old and
the new; He promiſeth there that what ſhould be laid
out more, if not lauiſhly perchance, or idely, he would
ſee it diſcharged: ſo may wee for our ſober diſputes,
either vpon or beſides the word expect a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
but if they appeare ſuperfluous or repugnant,
they be no longer deſcants, but ſinfull deviſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:10637:14"/>
Humane inuentions then come ſhort of a diuine
authority: they may ſerue vs for illuſtrations, but not
for a ground and rule: vpon the <hi>word</hi> as touching
that efficacy which they haue, muſt they be builded
alſo; either <hi>expreſse,</hi> as there apparent, or at leaſt, <hi>eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citiuè,</hi>
as being thence fairely and handſomly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
If wee containe within this compaſſe wee ſhall
bee as wiſe as ſafe: but if wee fly out and follow our
fancies, it remaineth that we ſtraight vaniſh in them.
For euen thus did that lewd rable of the <hi>Gnoſtici:</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 2. c. 46. 47. &amp;c.</note> they
ſet the ſcriptures aſide (ſaith <hi>Iraeneus</hi>) betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to their proper coniectures: The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> oft'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
likneth the word of God vnto a path or <hi>way:</hi>
nay it is <hi>via Regia,</hi> as one ſtyleth it: the <hi>high way</hi> to
bliſſe: now moſt commonly vpon each ſide of ſuch
waies there bee ditches and miery bogs: ſo here on
either hand the word ly hereſies and numberles er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
dangerous to bee ſlipt iuto; it is beſt then to
keepe the beaten and trodded way, the word,</p>
            <p>But againe; ſometimes the Lord ſpeaketh as well
by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> as hee doth in the written
word: for he hath not tied himſelfe ſo ſtrictly vnto the
word, but that hee can, if he pleaſe, vary the manner
of his communication with his beloued Saints. Our
<hi>Fathers</hi> in the firſt nonage of the Church, well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the benefit of this; a dreame or viſion to them
did as eaſily cleere each doubt, as either their owne
weakneſſe, or the occurrency of buſineſſe could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
it. But to auouch the truth, now in theſe later
dayes, ſuch extraordinary meanes of grace bee well
nigh out of late; Prophecy, &amp; reuelation, &amp; tongues,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10637:14"/>
with other gifts, we finde conioyn'd 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Since
as there appeareth no miracle of tongues or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
neither is it to be beleeued that revelations are
very frequent; Hauing <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> wee
may not expect new meſſages from the dead, nor yet

may ſeeme to credit them ouermuch; ſo apt are men
to rely on the ſlights of fancy, raiſing miracles out of

as into a ſect of Hereticks, termed the <gap reason="foreign">

ſo muſt we be carefull that contrariwiſe we entertaine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10637:15"/>
not ſome crotchet of mans braine for a diuine <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, if hauing examined ſuch
inſpirations by the touch of ſacred <hi>writ,</hi> wee finde
them accordingly; a <hi>rule</hi> they may be; yet here againe

vs in matters of fact, not encreaſe the Canon of
our faith: ſuch alone may be the guide of the <hi>wiſdome</hi>

            <p>The ſumme of all that hath beene ſpoken hitherto
is this. It is to be wiſhed that we had no occaſion to
deale vpon ſuch deepe <hi>myſteries</hi> at all; ſince our life
is fraile, and our ayme eternall bliſſe, it were expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that we endeauoured more to become pious, then

complaine of his time; whereas (ſaith he) there be
two parts of <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> the firſt and more eſpeciall

               </gap> a practiſe of wholſome precepts

               </gap>; a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue
and curious diſquiry; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we haue
quite inuerted the courſe. How many now a daies
frame their diuiner ſtudies after this method? How
doe they chiefly intend ſublimer, though fruitleſſe
controverſies; yea and moreouer, which is as bad, oft
times thoſe here vndertake theſe points, whoſe ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for ſuch a burden be moſt vnfit. <hi>Fight ye not with

they can but ſpell in diuinity, faſten alone vpon the

that they cleere not the doubts which they take in
hand, but rather betray their owne weakneſſe.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, ſince by reaſon of our inſulting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
on either ſide, ſome muſt needs looke into
theſe points, it is meete that wee diſpoſe our ſelues

with muſicke and abſtinence; I vrge not this for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
ſake, but only to ſhew with what reuerence
we ſhould addreſſe our ſelues to ſo diuine a taske: not
rudely ſetting vpon it, but with mature aduice: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
in the enterprize it ſelfe, let vs vſe great ſobriety,

            </p>
            <p>And thus I haue, though weakly, made vp a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

of them. A <hi>Text</hi> in my indgement, as befitting
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10637:16"/>
this auditory, as my ſelfe, for this my firſt aſſay. Wee
ſit all here by the well-ſpring of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and ſcience,
&amp; moſt of vs may hereafter ſerue at the altar in Gods
owne houſe. It is not amiſſe that we know our limits,
as alſo conſider our ſtrengths. Vnder the old law the
<hi>Levite</hi> might goe farther into the Temple, then the
<hi>Lay,</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt</hi> then the <hi>Levite:</hi> ſo in theſe points
concerning the <hi>mysticall</hi> temple, Apoc. 21. 22. One
may wade farther then another: but as there none
could enter into the chiefeſt ſanctuary, ſaue onely the
high <hi>Prieſt:</hi> ſo neither here hath any full acceſſe, into
the ſecrets of theſe <hi>myſteries,</hi> but only our high <hi>Prieſt</hi>
and Saviour Chriſt: <hi>In whom are hid all the treaſures
of wiſdome and knowledge,</hi> Coloſ. 2. 3. As for vs as
long as we abide in this life, we muſt be ſatisfied with
a meaner knowledge of ſuch things: with certaine
glympſes at moſt: like benighted travailers, who if the
moone hap to be ouerclouded, are content with ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
Now to the only <hi>wiſe</hi> God, who is able to doe
aboue that which we can either ſpeake or imagine,
be aſcribed all glory, power, praiſe, and dominion
this day and foreuer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

the matrix or fountaine within which
all things be originally concluded; Except in nature

here the elements did combine thus louingly as they
doe, ſo ſtately a fabricke could not long ſubſiſt; it muſt

In matter of policy conſent of minds legally
diſpoſed makes a ſtate: without this it remaines no
longer a ſtate, but a rude and vngoverned deſart. To
ſpeake in the phraſe of moderne Philoſophy, mutuall
concord is, <hi>forma totalis;</hi> that which wholy giues a
body politicke both life and beauty; But aboue all in
the houſe or Church of God ſeemes this vnitie of
greateſt value. <hi>One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme,</hi> wee
finde commended, Epheſ. 4. 5. As in the ſtructure of
the old tabernacle, by loopes &amp; taches were the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
aptly conioyned: ſo in the antitype, namely the
Church, doth this ſpirit of <hi>Vnity</hi> diffuſing it ſelfe

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:10637:18"/>
This being ſo; ſithence each where a concord is ſo
requiſite, but moſt in the Church, how fowly doe they
treſpaſſe that breake this bond? with what ſharpneſſe
deſerue they to be handled who breed diuiſions? The
Fathers amidſt their writings doe preſſe no one point
more frequently or eagerly then this; Every where
they take occaſion, after S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

condemne all rents and <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> as extoll a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

<hi>Summum malorum,</hi> a crime ſo heinous, as that
none can match it. And indeed if you rightly weigh
the examples of Gods wrath and puniſhments, you
will not much miſlike his iudgment. In the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
Gen. when <hi>Cain</hi> had ſlaine his brother, God onely
markes him and lets him goe: nay hee is iealous leaſt
any might <hi>kill Cain,</hi> v. 15. To that great and ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
city of <hi>Ninive</hi> what doth he? Only <hi>Ionas</hi> is ſent
to teach and warne them. Inſteed of ruine comes a
gentle embaſſage. But for <hi>Corath</hi> and his complices,
thoſe mutiners in the tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> behold a ſuddaine
deſtruction: the earth openeth and entombes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue;
whence it followes not without ſome ſhew of
probability, that <hi>Church-Schiſmes</hi> more diſpleaſe the
Lord, then either murther or ſacrilege. <hi>Austin</hi> yet
goes farther; for in his 50<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ep. diſcourſing about the
obſtinacy of the factious Donatiſts, he chargeth them
with no leſſe a ſinne, then with that of the holy ghoſt.</p>
            <p>But the heinouſneſſe of <hi>diviſions</hi> will better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,

But it is religion, that prop of mans conſcience, and

Chriſtian religion although no perfect ſcience, yet
likewiſe it ſuppoſeth certaine principles: a few

Now as wee ſpeake in Philoſophy of a double mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;

and in it ſelfe; againe, there is <hi>menſura paſsiua;</hi> ſuch a

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10637:20"/>

            <p>Firſt the <hi>Heretique,</hi> as ſubornde with a bolder ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
is wont more directly to oppoſe the very text.
In former times we finde them ſo impudent as that
they durſt change and mangle it as ſeemde them beſt;
witneſſe the <hi>Cerinthians, Marcioniſts,</hi> with the reſt
of that franticke crew; not enduring ſo pure a light
ſhould ſhine vpon their monſtrous blaſphemies, they
either wrongfully concealed it vnder a <hi>buſhell,</hi> or

            <p>Secondly by this, as they conceaue, they much

of ſmall and narrow extent; But as for errors, they ly
in multitudes and troupes round about; If then in ſo
vaſt a number of faſhoods, they pitch vpon one what
glory is it? If miſſing the center they pricke each part
of the circle elſe? To bolt an errour then is no hard
exploit; And as its beginnning is thus prompt
and eaſy, ſo alſo is the maintaining of it once begun;
Inſooth falſhhood in point of religion commonly
ſomeway toucheth vpon the deepeſt myſteries; it will
be ſure of a cauſe pregna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enough wherein to deale:

            <p>A laſt incentiue here may bee an itching deſire in

            <p>Another way they haue of intermingling truth

            <p>A third deviſe is by faigning of ſome good intent;
whilſt they labour a breach in chriſtianity,<note place="margin">Orat. de com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponendo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionis diſſidio inter Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anos.</note> to make

the Church and ſtabs it.</p>
            <p>More ſhifts beſides they skill of to obſcure their

            <p>Not in vaine then are we bid to marke: obſerue we

whereſoer'e they goe; neither yet is this enough; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>It may be in former times there appeared greater

was then moſt buſie, that he might choak vp the word
before it tooke ſure root. Thus Mat. 13. 25. the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

            <p>Neither doe I (miſtake me not) preſcribe ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame

Looke but into the courſe of former ages, and you
will eaſily grant as much. Concerning the Apoſtles
time, what ardency of good will finde we there? with
what affection did they mutually imbrace? Lands and
goods lay then in <hi>common:</hi> the whole Church may
ſeeme no other then one great family. As in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of <hi>Solomons</hi> temple not any <hi>hammer</hi> or <hi>iron
toole</hi> was vſed that made a noiſe; 1. Reg. 6. Thus they
labour'd iointly in founding the Goſpell, wihtout all
malice or clamorous ſtrife. Afterwards wee finde this
holy zeale no whit abated; ſtill in ſucceeding times, as
perſecutions waxt hotter, the Chriſtians loue grew
more enflamed. To manifeſt which, leaſt it might lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
if conceal'd, how many ſignes of expreſſion had
they? witneſſe there <gap reason="foreign">

their <hi>panem vnanimitatis,</hi> as <hi>Paulinus</hi> to <hi>Auſtin</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth;
a token commonly annext and ſent with
their letters to expreſſe their ioint conſolidation into
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10637:26"/>
the ſame body of Chriſt; As for hatred and malice,
ſuch vngodly motions, they may ſeeme as free, as we
their of-ſpring now ſtand guilty.</p>
            <p>Yet what wonder is it if thus reciprocally they
maintained charity? For firſt (you know) among all
virtues this takes place: without it <hi>martyrdome</hi> it ſelfe
availeth not, 1. Cor. 13. <hi>Lumbard</hi> ſo farre extols it, as
to make it touching the exerciſe an immediate act of
the ſpirit: whereas other divine graces acknowledge
their proper habits. How truely he doth this I meane
not to examine; only you ſee what a glorious conceit
he had of this vertue aboue the reſt.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſuch loue greatly ſtrengthens each where
the Chriſtian zeale: it conſerues as it were religion
warme and frolick. <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
diſcourſing to this purpoſe, tells them that it
would keepe them more ſecure euen from Satans aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults;

of thoſe ſpirituall enimyes be this way leſſened: ioine
they but hearts, ſinne it ſelfe would finde an harder
inlet.</p>
            <p>Once more, no marvaile if <hi>orthodox</hi> Chriſtians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
this concord, ſince our Saviour himſelfe ſo much
commends it; whenas hee who is the author of peace
appeares ſo vrgent a teacher thereof. In the 13. of Io.
he makes it the very marke and badge of his: <hi>By this

In the 14. C. being now to ſuffer, he bequeaths it them
for their only legacy, <hi>My peace I leaue you,</hi> v. 27. with

was commended to the Church vnder a type; <hi>Noahs

doue</hi> hauing circled the waters too and fro, returnes
not empty; yet brings ſhee for a token of the floods
decreaſe, no other teſtimony into the arke, the figure
of the Church, then an <hi>Oliue</hi> leafe; a leafe which is the
vſuall ſigne of loue and concord; hence the Apoſtle
more expreſly, Rom. 10. 15. deciphers the Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
name of the <hi>Oliue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You perceiue by this a little better the fowlneſſe of

            <p>Firſt then, it were well if men did meddle leſſe in

            <p>But ſuppoſe a <hi>Schiſme</hi> be once on foote, the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt
way for redreſſe may ſeeme; Firſt a ſerious yet
ciuill debatement: when men ſhall enter the liſts as
willing to yeeld, if pechance convinc't, as to refuſe
the aſſaylant; hot and furious diſputes doe ſeldome
good; amidſt the noiſe of ſuch conuiciating iarres, the
the truth is ſcarcely heard. The diſcuſſion of doubtfull
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10637:28"/>
points reſembles much the ſmiting of a <hi>flint;</hi> a gentle
and well poys'de ſtroke procures ſome ſparkes;
whereas a boiſterous colliſion, gets no fire, but
breakes the ſtone; Iuſt ſo in point of controverſie: a
civill hadling brings it to an iſſue ſtraight; contrariwiſe
an impetuous wrangling inflicts happily ſome ſtaine
on either party, yet nothing cleeres the argument.
Vnwiſely then deale they who fly out into ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered
vehemency; Inſteed of a ſober and vſefull
debatement they raiſe a perſonall brawle; they tta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
not at length the truth, but their owne cauſe.
It was the noted fault of <hi>Marcellus</hi> a <hi>Rhetoritian</hi> that
lighting on a figure,<note place="margin">Sucton.</note> hee would purſue it ſo farre, till
he had forgot the matter in hand: likewiſe doe theſe
if once they fall into a calumniating &amp; iarring vaine;
nay farther, oft times, they ſtrangely miſinterpret the
aduerſary; either to extend their diſcourſe, or elſe of
malice they impoſe a meaning farre wide from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
drift. Thus as <hi>Zebul</hi> told <hi>Gaal, Thou ſeest the

ſuch notions as themſelues haue fram'de amiſſe. But
a way with ſuch miſpriſion: ſuch rouing encounters;
it is a more probable courſe, if, as I ſaid, they neither
ſhall ouer roughly diſpute the cauſe, nor yet ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

            <p>A ſecond helpe here may bee the vſe of <hi>Synodicall</hi>

falſhood, then eſtabliſh a receiued truth in the mindes
of people. The Romans of old when any more fatall
danger approached, did wontedly maintaine their

appeares ſome like proiect needfull: where ſinne and
error make a daily inrode. Our forefathers therefore
of the primitiue Church, may ſeeme indeede in ſuch
meetings very frequent; euery yeare twice, about
<hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>antumne</hi> they ordained councels provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to be held. Hereby they weeded as it were and
cut vp errour in its firſt appearance: no ſooner could
it ſprout forth, before it procured ſtrength, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
or other ſtraight waies cropt it; Satan you know
that old <hi>Serpent</hi> is the father of ſchiſmes: nay he was
by a voluntary diſceſſion from God ſimply the prime
<hi>Schiſmaticke;</hi> A ſnake or ſerpent if he can get but his
head into a crany, ſcrues &amp; wreaths in his whole body
after with no hard paine: on this manner error; by
reaſon of its <hi>Serpentine</hi> nature, vnleſſe at firſt repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
threatens a dangerous progreſſe; Councels then
in this caſe be greatly available; of ſoueraine helpe, if
thus ſeaſonably applied; ſuch a meeting of reuerent
ſages muſt needs if not refell, at leaſt diſcountenance
a crept in falſhood.</p>
            <p>The laſt remedy ſhall bee a ſerious aduiſe; That
