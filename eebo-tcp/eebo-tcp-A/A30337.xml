         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch is the Force
and Tyranny of
<hi>Custome,</hi> that
Somewhat must
be prefixed to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Occasion was told
in the preceeding Page:
At which time Love and
<pb facs="tcp:105529:3"/>
Regrate, were bringing
to the Authors <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi>
many Instances of
that <hi>Excellent One</hi> his
Worth and Virtue.</p>
            <p>He feared least in that
Croud, many precious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi>
of his dear Friend
might be lost. He thought
therefore, that to digest
them into a Regular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure,
would be the surest
course to preserve them.</p>
            <p>In which attempt, He
had also an eye at the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb facs="tcp:105529:3"/>
of some Others,
but did intend nothing lesse
than the Presse. Else may
be He would have been
more Backward in it.</p>
            <p>It was in hast He wrote
it: and you have it here
with the same defects,
which at first dropt with
it from the Authors Pen:
for neither his Leisure, nor
his Humour, could well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him a serious <hi>Review</hi>
of it. Only some <hi>Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
were made by the
<pb facs="tcp:105529:4"/>
Pen of another: Yea, He
could heartily wish, it had
been guilty of greater Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and Faults; That
so, both It and He might
have been excused from
this <hi>Pennance,</hi> which the
Importunities of Others, to
whom neither the Design
nor Discourse was unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
hath enjoyned.</p>
            <p>If the Vndertaking be
thought <hi>Unusual,</hi> all the
Answer intended for That
is, <hi>The Person was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105529:4"/>
Some will, may be, say
<hi>too Much</hi> is said of Him.
Well! But Others think
there is <hi>too Little.</hi> And
I know, with great Truth,
<hi>More</hi> might have been
said.</p>
            <p>Some will call it <hi>too
Flaunting,</hi> Others, <hi>too
Flat:</hi> The Author knows
of a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> from all
Censures, that is, a <hi>Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Indifferency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May be it will find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Reception with
<pb facs="tcp:105529:5"/>
some, if it be not more Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
in <hi>Print,</hi> than it
was in <hi>Writ.</hi> Sure it
will not be unwelcome to
those to whom that <hi>Rare
Person</hi> was not Vnknown.
For as in the absence of
the Sun, these Rayes
which are reflected, though
from the uneven and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
surface of the Moon,
are not ungratefull: So
that shining Soul being
now gone from our Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
This Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:105529:5"/>
of Him, although the
<hi>Rude Essay</hi> of an unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht
hand, will not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
except in spight
that so good a <hi>Them</hi> should
be ill managed. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
will detain you no
longer: but leaves the
Discourse to your Perusal,
and Himself to your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
And so bids you <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>

loseth in strength though
it abound in Chanels:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105529:7"/>
So <hi>Mankinde</hi> becoming
fruitful, hath multiplied,
by those many producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
&amp; diffusions of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;
mean while the
Vigour of the Rational
Soul, hath suffered great
Decaies, and by a daily
and lasting Degeneracy
is mouldred almost to
nothing. So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

Swarmes of Men; Yet
most of them are of that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105529:7"/>
Temper, that nought but
their Shape doth entitle
them <hi>Such.</hi> Their <hi>Spirits</hi>
are so emasculate, their
<hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> so
effoeted: That save a
<hi>Skelete,</hi> nothing of a Man
shall be found amongst
whole <hi>Droves</hi> of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
Yet in this Rable,
there are some <hi>Erected

Shall One of these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in the search of more
of his Kind, long will he
weary himself with fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
labour, ere he espy a
person truely Virtuous:
But if He discover any
such, Suddenly that sight
will snatch him to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and anon fix
him to Attention. With
what pleasure will He
consider all the Treats of
these wel-featured souls?
Whose Beautified looks
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105529:8"/>
will quickly conquer the
hearts of all true Judges
thereof. Hence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
such an Union of
Noble Minds, that no
Force nor Craft can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the Knot, which their
entangled Affections co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating
have sublimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
beyond the Bond of
ordinary friendship, into
that of Indissoluble love.
Whence flow the truest
Joyes that Frail Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is capable of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105529:9"/>
But while this <hi>Pair
of Souls</hi> (or rather <hi>One</hi>

does grasp one another
in the closest Embraces,
and with a Disdainfull
Smile laughs at Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun,
as not within its

boisterous storms, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the swelling
Billows of an inraged
Sea, will force those,
whose hopes had set them
beyond danger, to their
<hi>Long Home</hi> amidst the

Providence,</hi> not allowing
us Repose while <hi>here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>

cut it: The <hi>Halfed Soul</hi>
finding it self fallen from
its rest and Felicity, into
a gulf of misery, will fill
Heaven and Earth with
the doleful resentments
of its Desolation and
Woe.</p>
            <p>BEing now, by a sad
Arrest, widowed of
Him, whose Charming
Conversation hath so oft
relieved and refreshed
us, by the delights of
many a pleasant hour: It

up: But novv the
Soul is dislodged, the
House unfurnisht, and

searching eye, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

while He was in His tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
cloaths; Sure

While he sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here on Earth vvith

sequestred for Heavens
service: and hating Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege
too much, he
would not invade Gods
Propriety, nor bestow it
on prophane uses; But
payed his Love and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
in a constant
Annuity to Him whose
right it was. And having
the stock, His Soul, ever

when demanded, The

the sum payed, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105529:12"/>

<hi>Great:</hi> Begin we then
with the latter of the two.
If we consult the <hi>Lyon</hi> of
the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> He
will tell us that in true
Heraldry the noblest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent

vanity, all is vanity;</hi> being
a borrowed light, as that

Action in it self not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable,

degenerating Descents,

to any? Whence doth
the Root of Earthly
Honour spring, but
from Earth? What
though the <hi>Pretenders to

Sure, there would
they terminate, even <hi>in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105529:13"/>
red Earth.</hi> But to be the
<hi>Son of God</hi> is an Original
so noble and sublimely
Divine, that the desire of
being accounted such, did
make the Heathens so to
<hi>begod themselves,</hi> that
could they but derive
their descent from a God
they were content to do
it by Histories, that not
only degraded them from
the dignity of being such,
but immersed them into
a gulf of Eternal Infamy
and imprinted on their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105529:14"/>
Memories such <hi>Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Disgrace,</hi> as, in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ages could never
be defaced. In what a
<hi>Goatish shape</hi> do the fables
represent their <hi>ador'd Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter?</hi>
Did not the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Conquerour</hi> conquer
his Reason by his Pride,
in conceiting himself the
<hi>Son of Iupiter Hammon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Christianity</hi> hath
taught us that as <hi>all Souls</hi>
are first the <hi>Breathing of
the Divine Spirit,</hi> So by
the power of that same
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105529:14"/>
Eternall Spirit vve are
born again, not of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Seed,</hi> but of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible</hi>
by the Word
of God, <hi>which liveth and
abideth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spirit of this <hi>Iust
Man now made perfect,</hi>
would stoop to no Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
state: But by a raised
and noble Ambition, did
choose for his Branch,
Him that <hi>growes out of
the roots of Iesse.</hi> Which,
as it taught him such a
Contempt of that which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105529:15"/>
the World calls <hi>Honour,</hi>
as being but a <hi>Gilded
Ratle</hi> for Children to
play with; So it scarce
permitted him to bestow
on the <hi>Worlds greatnesse,</hi>
so much as a <hi>Reverent
Thought.</hi> Yea, it was to
him a <hi>Pennance,</hi> and that
none of the least, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with those, to whose
state and rank Civility
commanded respect to be
payed, when a Virtuous
and Rational Soul did
find nothing in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105529:15"/>
that merited esteem.
This he often complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
off, as one of the great
Toiles of his life, to find
discourse and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
suitable to the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen
and bedwarfed
souls of our Gentry.
Who like <hi>Vmbrelloes</hi> of
true Worth swarme eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, and bate foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Gaming and the Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
affairs of the world,
understand nothing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their <hi>Maker,</hi> or
of his <hi>Works.</hi> But how
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105529:16"/>
pleased was he in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with and cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of such as carried
<hi>Heavens Liveray,</hi> and
were begotten to the
<hi>Image of God:</hi> Those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Ones were They,
in whom was all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
how mean soever
their Condition in the
World had been. In such
company <hi>Time</hi> did seem
to fly, howbeit at other
occasions it seemed to
craul like a Snail. With
<hi>Them</hi> Midnight was past,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105529:16"/>
ere he would believe it
to be <hi>Late.</hi> With others
the first approaches of
<hi>Darknesse</hi> were taken for
Night. With those he
complained of <hi>Night,</hi> as
the <hi>Interrupter</hi> of his
Quiet; willing rather
to deny his body <hi>Rest</hi>
than his Mind <hi>Repose.</hi>
With <hi>These</hi> he waited
for the shadows of the
Evening; even more
than the <hi>Watchman</hi> doth
for the dawning of the
Day. And therefore it is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105529:17"/>
but just we conclude,
That, <hi>There is a Prince
and a great Man fallen
this day in Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no grosser
<hi>Soloecism,</hi> than an <hi>Ignoble
Prince:</hi> To be the <hi>degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
brat</hi> of an <hi>Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Parent,</hi> is as great a
<hi>Reproach</hi> as the foulest
mouth can devise. A <hi>low
and mean Soul,</hi> set in a
<hi>high rank,</hi> is, as an <hi>Ape</hi>
upon a <hi>Pole.</hi> Yea, as a
small Imperfection, in an,
otherwise rare and <hi>Well-featured
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105529:17"/>
Beauty,</hi> will be
espied by all; when the
same, if not a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
would in an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
face passe unregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
And the <hi>Stumblings
of Princes</hi> will be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in History, when the
<hi>falls of their Subjects</hi>
will be ingulfed in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion:
So, when a
Soul, by the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, comes to be
exalted into a <hi>Higher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
How unseemly will
it be for <hi>such a one</hi> to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105529:18"/>
trip? especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that thereby, the
Wicked get occasion to
Blaspheme the Name of
God, and load Virtue
with obloquy; And the
<hi>sincere and tender hearted
Christian</hi> is much scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized.
Nor is it only
<hi>Vnbecoming</hi> but questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse
perilsome, seeing
the <hi>Iealous</hi> God by His
All-seeing eye observes
well the Motions of his
own, and accounts those
errours, which by a holy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105529:18"/>
connivance, he may wink
at in others, in Them,
<hi>crimes deserving chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>true Grandieur</hi> of
a Soul then, is <hi>the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merging
thereof from the
sink and Kennel of Passion,
Interest and Self-love,</hi> and
<hi>the fixing of it on God and
Divine Objects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Passion</hi> is a <hi>Feaver in
the Soul,</hi> which having
agitate the Vigour of the
Minde into <hi>Fainting
Heats,</hi> maketh the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105529:19"/>
               <hi>Thoughts,</hi> the Pulses of
the Soul, move Quick,
High, and Unequally:
for <hi>Reason</hi> being dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
every <hi>Paultry Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in its tour will usurp
the Chair, and according
to its Imperious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
make that Faculty
lacquey up and down,
Which, in the <hi>Strictest
Iustice</hi> deserveth the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency:</hi>
Thus Folly is
set in <hi>great dignity,</hi> and,
<hi>Servants are on horses
when Princes walk as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:105529:19"/>
               <hi>Reason</hi> is the <hi>Supream
Power</hi> of a Man, on
which, in <hi>Legible Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
is engraven the <hi>Image
of God.</hi> And although
it be crusted over with a
grosse and <hi>foeculent Film</hi>
on which is stamped the
visage of the <hi>Foul Fiend
of Darknesse;</hi> yet is it
much like that of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
who imbossed his
Masters Name with Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
but had underneath,
engraven his Own in
Stone: knowing that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105529:20"/>
               <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Tempests</hi> would
wear of the one, whereas
t' other would weather
out all Periods of Time.
For after the <hi>dew of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
hath washed of that
<hi>superscription of Satan,</hi>
then will the goodly and
glorious <hi>Image of God,</hi>
conspicuously appear in
a <hi>purified Reason.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that, as that skilfull
Statuary did engrave his
Name in <hi>Pallas</hi> Shield,
with so deep a stroak, as
could not be defaced
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105529:20"/>
while the whole Statue
were undone: So God
did Imprint so lively
treates of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
on the <hi>Soul of Man,</hi>
as the remaines thereof
are yet to be seen even in
the <hi>greatest Monsters</hi> of
Mankinde, which the
Earth doth bear. But
Man since that <hi>first fall</hi> is
so unplum'd and so robt
of that gayety, which at
first did adorn him, that
all his Faculties are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
soft and languide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:105529:21"/>
A company of Passions,
like so many <hi>Birds of
Prey,</hi> having divided the
<hi>dominion</hi> of the soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves.</p>
            <p>Reasons <hi>first work</hi>
then, is to vindicate her
Liberty from the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of these insulting
slaves. And even <hi>Lame
Nature</hi> in the unhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Heathens hath made
strange attempts for the
<hi>re-enthroning Reason</hi> and
regaining that <hi>undisturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
tranquillity of minde,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:105529:21"/>
which man was once in
possession of: But alas!
Man though mounted
on his tiptoes, will not
reach this fruit of the
Tree of Life, it hangs too
high for him; and it is
<hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder only by
which we must essay to
climb up to Heaven.
<hi>Our Heros</hi> was behind few
Mortals in this atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Did we not see
an unclouded <hi>sweetnesse</hi>
and <hi>serenity</hi> so possesse
his <hi>Looks,</hi> that easily we
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105529:22"/>
might conclude, how
little his thoughts were
disturbed? For being
<hi>ever the same,</hi> the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Joy did not
transport him, neither
could the depressions of
sorrow crush him. <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
pleasures</hi> had not so
mastered his Soul, as to
make him neglect the <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he owed his God.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the death of his
deservedly beloved chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
imbarasse his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:105529:22"/>
Those who by <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Him</hi> intended his
<hi>disturbance,</hi> missed of
their Design; for he
knew that no man could
wrong him, and that
Malice and Revenge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bricole on the Doer,
without prejudging the
Party against whom they
are directed. For then
only doth one <hi>suffer</hi>
when he permits himself
into a Passion; and
<hi>Wrongs</hi> done us in this
world, are rather the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:105529:23"/>
than the <hi>Causes</hi> of
our Misfortune: Which
he was so fully perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, that, if at any time
Passion peeped, it did but
give opportunity for the
exercise of Reason in the
quelling so strong an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>He wisely considered
the <hi>Tongue</hi> to be that
whose <hi>intemperate speeches</hi>
do give Rise, Growth
and Continuance to <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi>
It being the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which, when dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105529:23"/>
managed, holds
us in an even and steady
Course: but if let loose
makes us fluctuate and
move at randome. His
<hi>thrift of discourse</hi> was
<hi>great,</hi> but his <hi>sparingnesse</hi>
in Censuring, Rebuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Reproaching, and
Detracting was such, as
perhaps in all his life, he
was never accus'd by any;
yea, I believe, scarce by
himself (the most severe
Critick upon his ovvn
Actions) of this fault.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105529:24"/>
So <hi>studious was he to evite
every occasion of affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Reason.</hi> So that
justly we may say there
is <hi>a Prince and a Great
Man fallen this day in
Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
Reasons, first
<hi>Triumph</hi> over <hi>Passion:</hi> Its
<hi>next Conquest</hi> is the <hi>Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the cares and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of this Life.</hi>
Our Bodies are the Case
which contains the Jewel.
The Shrine for that Stem
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105529:24"/>
of Divinity. So the
Cares and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Body must
never come in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but as <hi>Vassals</hi> to our
Souls. But now this
order is inverted. Are
not mens Bodies become
the <hi>Prisons,</hi> if not, the
<hi>Tombs</hi> of their Souls.
The Caring for the One
is accounted a <hi>Debt,</hi> but
Thinking on the other,
is thought an <hi>act of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Benevolence.</hi>
How many impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105529:25"/>
Souls are lodged in
Bodies, whose cabinets
are well stored with
Riches? Many a <hi>Plump
body</hi> is the Receptacle of
an <hi>Hunger-starved Mind.</hi>
Me thinks they resemble
<hi>Egypts Temples,</hi> whose
Outside had a <hi>tearing
show:</hi> but when admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the interiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of that Idol-house,
with the wan light of an
half extinguish'd Torch,
they could discern an
<hi>Ape.</hi> So what a sight
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105529:25"/>
should it be, if we could
unfold the Plicatures of
the Garments wherein
many souls are invelopt?
Within these Cloutes
vvould vve see pitifull
Brates: on whom if one
look, he will be at a losse,
whither he shall have, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Contemn or account
them Unworthy of all
his thoughts. Is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that so <hi>Sublime a
being</hi> as the soul of Man,
made and shaped <hi>for high
things,</hi> can be drencht in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105529:26"/>
the dirt of sensuality and
luxury, or grovel on this
Earth? Far different
from this are the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of a <hi>transformed
Spirit,</hi> which laboureth
to forget its being <hi>detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Body,</hi> when it finds
it self <hi>hailed to</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed</hi>
in Earthly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
doth with
Sorrrow and Pity regrate
the distance it is at, from
the Object of its <hi>Ioy</hi> and
Desire: the <hi>smart</hi> of
which the Body will feel
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105529:26"/>
in severe <hi>Mortifications;</hi>
being denied the wanton
Jolleties and unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Flatterings which are
craved by a luxurient
temper. Yea the former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>bewitching pleasures,</hi>
become more bitter than
Gall and Wormwood.
And even <hi>Life</hi> it self, <hi>the
Preservation whereof car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
away the Supremacy
of our Affections and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,</hi>
doth prove a <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
since it detaineth
from that which the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105529:27"/>
Soul so vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
longeth for. And
while the <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth,
what time they
bestow on humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
is rather <hi>Complying</hi>
with the <hi>Providence of
God</hi> (who ordereth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one to their Post and
several Imployments in
this world) than out of
any <hi>Pleasure</hi> they have
in it, or any <hi>Desire</hi> of
self-satisfaction. And
when their Occasions
and Hours of <hi>Divine
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105529:27"/>
employment</hi> do avocate
them, they quickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage
Themselves, and
their Craving Appetites
(unsatisfied with every
thing beneath God) will
with an <hi>unexpressible sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi>
suck in those
comforts that are sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to them than the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or the Honey comb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With how little <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
what I have been
saying, may be ascribed
to Him, who now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth
what he much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105529:28"/>
               <hi>His freedome from
Covetousnesse,</hi> did disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it self in the pain he
was at when <hi>Crouding
Affairs</hi> did invade many
<hi>Portions</hi> of his <hi>Time:
Careful was he to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of that Load.</hi> And
though he was dexterous
enough, so to order his
affairs, as to throw away
nothing <hi>Vnnecessarily,</hi>
which may be occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mistakes in some, Yet
these to <hi>whom His Soul
was known</hi> could well
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105529:28"/>
discern it flowed from
no <hi>sordid ground.</hi> And
his frank and large Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
did fully discover of
what <hi>Mettal</hi> he was. Yea
a <hi>Resolution of his</hi> (which
his modesty keeped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to all, save those
who shared in the secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
motions of his Soul)
<hi>never to have encreased
his Estate,</hi> but to offer
what improvements he
could make of it to God,
by <hi>relieving</hi> the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Wants of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105529:29"/>
Poor and Needy: Such
a design, I say, to those
who knew what a <hi>Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Fortune</hi> he enjoyed,
and what <hi>Children he
had,</hi> will make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that <hi>he counted the
things of this world but
Dung.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Little did they know
of him, who know not
how <hi>regardlesse he was of
his Body.</hi> He was notar
for his <hi>Temperance, spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in the enjoyments of
his <hi>lawful pleasures.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105529:29"/>
could the weaknesse
of his Body, extort from
him Care and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but rather draw
from him Pity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
The <hi>Society of
Drunkards</hi> he hated and
shunned, as much as a
<hi>Toad.</hi> Yea so little force
had all the <hi>Enjoyments of
this life</hi> (although even
of these God had bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him a large Share)
on his Spirit, that <hi>he was
ever desiring to be rid of
them all,</hi> and to be where
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105529:30"/>
no Affair could avocate
him from that he so much
desired: That being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed
of his vile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
he should be fred
from Grosse and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Conceptions</hi> of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things;</hi> from the
Tribute he owed his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and from the trouble
he was at with businesse:
but most of all, from the
<hi>dregs of corrupted nature</hi>
which <hi>pinch</hi> the Soul and
make it <hi>long</hi> to be with
<hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:105529:30"/>
               <hi>Some dayes ere he died,</hi>
being desired not to
wrong himself with the
<hi>Apprehensions of Death,</hi>
his Answer was: <hi>That
having exercised himself
so long with the thoughts
of it, He did not apprehend
it with fear as an enemy:</hi>
and therefore with Joy
did he receive the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of it.</p>
            <p>It was the last morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his life that He said
(even in the midst of
high and furious raving,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105529:31"/>
occasioned by a Feaver
of which he died) <hi>O my
most adorable and glorious
Lord God, to thee I come,
and with thee shall I be for
ever.</hi> Who can then
blame me when I say,
<hi>There is a Prince and a
great Man fallen this day
in Israel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason,</hi> having made a
<hi>foul fray</hi> among the <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and trampled the
<hi>Body</hi> underfoot, it carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on its Conquests, and
at length Combates <hi>it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105529:31"/>
self,</hi> and Beats down any
<hi>good opinion</hi> it is tempted
to have of its Self. It
fares with many, as with
those <hi>Vapours,</hi> which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Suns active
beams agitated into a
<hi>subtile thinnesse,</hi> mount
up; but because they had
not layed down their
<hi>earthinesse,</hi> reach no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the <hi>Regions</hi> of
the <hi>Air:</hi> where, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toss'd too and again,
they fall down in big
drops, more grosse than
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105529:32"/>
when caught up. So the
<hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>some,</hi> by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
impressions of some
heats are caught up from
worldly, carnal, yea and
passionate courses: But
there being no true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation</hi>
of heart, they
mount no higher than
the Aery Regions of
<hi>Vanity.</hi> Self-love being
the Root of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
though they may
appear Specious, being
set of with Canting and
Dissimulation; yet, their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105529:32"/>
depth being sounded,
prove in effect nothing
but <hi>profound Venerations,
payed to the shrines of their
adored selves.</hi> This is the
<hi>Last Battery</hi> of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of our Salvation.
Other engines failing,
he insinuats himself into
the more retired Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Soul, and by
this deadly venome, he
poisons and leavens the
whole Soul, making it
forget that dependance
upon God by which it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105529:33"/>
lives; and cease to praise
that unbounded Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to whom it owes
more, than Seraphims
can expresse. As also the
<hi>active vigour</hi> of the Soul
in every duty of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
growes <hi>remiss,</hi> when
it conceits it self Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
over all its Enemies.
This is the <hi>Tympany of
the Mind</hi> which often, if
not ever, proves deadly
and irrecoverable.</p>
            <p>But <hi>true Greatnesse,</hi>
will quickly evacuate the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105529:33"/>
Mind of all those <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
by representing as
well the <hi>Frailties</hi> of its
<hi>Nature,</hi> as, the <hi>Miseries</hi>
of its <hi>depraved State.</hi>
The <hi>One,</hi> by remembring
it is a Creature started
out of nothing by the
Omnipotent Power of
its Adored Maker: <hi>The
other,</hi> by discovering
how Weak and Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
our <hi>Souls</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
How Short sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Dim our <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings:</hi>
how lame and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105529:34"/>
unactive our <hi>Wills.</hi> How
furious and undaunted,
our <hi>Passions.</hi> As also
by reflecting on the great
and frequent <hi>errours of
our Life,</hi> and our ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
<hi>imperfections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is by the <hi>Like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,</hi>
that Man
comes to be <hi>undeceived,</hi>
and doth perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that He is an <hi>Empty
Nothing,</hi> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in Self-degrading
Thoughts, and, with
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> doth <hi>Glory in his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105529:34"/>
infirmities,</hi> that the <hi>power
of Christ</hi> may rest upon
him.</p>
            <p>It is now time to <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi>
what hath been said
to Him who hath <hi>finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Course and hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Crown.</hi> But I
suppose all, to whom He
was not wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
could spare me
the labour. It were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a puzling Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Whither his <hi>Worth</hi>
or his <hi>Humility</hi> was
greatest. He took more
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105529:35"/>
pains to <hi>conceal</hi> what he
really had, than, may be
the <hi>Proudest</hi> do to <hi>set of</hi>
what they have not at
all. His shunning all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of any <hi>Publick
Appearance,</hi> and his great
<hi>Silence and Sparingnesse
of Discourse</hi> (which were
too well known to insist
on, yea it were a difficult
work to instance, unlesse
there were produced a
Catalogue of all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Life) were
pregnant proofs of what
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105529:35"/>
hath been said. Neither
did this <hi>nonpareiled Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,</hi>
flow from either
<hi>natural Retirednesse</hi> of
Temper, or the <hi>Contempt
of Others,</hi> which makes
some retreat from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
of Men; account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it below them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with Persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
whom <hi>Self-conceit</hi>
hath far advanced them.
No, on no such ground
He withdrew himself
from the too much bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
road of Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105529:36"/>
But he did so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
himself, as to be
ever regrating those <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections</hi>
(Judged to be
in him by none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
he found depressing
his Spirit. He talked
much of his <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:</hi>
Yet was he well
known both in <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in the <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
especially. Neither
was he a stranger to the
other <hi>Oriental Tongues;</hi>
not to mention his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the <hi>Latine</hi> &amp; seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105529:36"/>
               <hi>Europaean Languages.</hi>
Language being a Heap
of words, connected by
no string of Method,
<hi>(People being taught to
speak, by Custome and not
by Philosophy)</hi> there is
nothing that more racks
and overcharges the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
A memory then
so well twisted, as to be
able to retain <hi>Singled
words,</hi> cannot be thought
so treacherous, as to let
slip <hi>Connected things,</hi>
when commanded to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105529:37"/>
such an imployment by
Inclination. Truth was,
he was ready enough to
forget any <hi>Pedling affair:</hi>
but the impression such
stuffe could make on a
Mind so much alienated
from the World, was so
overly; that no wonder
it was not lasting.</p>
            <p>Should we also take
his <hi>Own testimony</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
we should believe his
Mind was <hi>Shallow</hi> and
<hi>Purblind.</hi> But a whiles
conversation would have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105529:37"/>
forced any to change
their opinion.</p>
            <p>He was deeply skill'd in
the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> thogh
he was well <hi>advanced in
years</hi> before he began that
<hi>Study:</hi> and his distracting
affairs, did never allow
him that Time, which an
exactness in those <hi>Sciences</hi>
doth require. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he was well seen
in most of them. It was
the <hi>Science,</hi> and not the
<hi>Art</hi> in them, most pleased
him. <hi>His dexterity in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridling
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105529:38"/>
the most Knotty
Theorems and Problems
was singular.</hi> His <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
was <hi>unwearied.</hi> So
that I stick not to say,
that had his Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
permitted him that
Study, as much as His
Genius and Inclination
would have led him to
it, he had been inferiour
to few of his Age.
Which, many of his
Papers would make no
hard labour to prove.</p>
            <p>He gave himself also
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105529:38"/>
much to <hi>Philosophicall
Studies,</hi> but could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
satisfie himself with
that <hi>empty Scelet of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles
Philosophy.</hi> Which
being by the <hi>Trifling way
of Logick,</hi> digested into
some Order, hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
so long upon the
World, and hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
them into an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of their own
Great Knowledge, when
notwithstanding, they
could never extricate one
Difficulty in all Nature:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105529:39"/>
and yet they would bear
the World in hand, that
Wisdome shall die with
them, But <hi>was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
with the late Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Attempts to unmask
Nature.</hi> And as the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Subtility of these
Designs <hi>delighted him,</hi> So
he was much <hi>pleased with</hi>
the Ingenious Candor
of these Mechanical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
<hi>and expected
Great Things, from the
Honourable and Truely
Royal Society of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105529:39"/>
in England.</hi> For he
believed <hi>That Design,</hi> to
be the strongest Attempt
the World had seen, to
rescue it from <hi>Ignorance</hi>
and <hi>Vncertainty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was also a <hi>great
Friend of Chimistry,</hi> and
being no stranger to it,
was purposed to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
himself seriously
thereto: Hoping by <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
Key</hi> to have disclos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nature.</p>
            <p>He had also studied
<hi>Mechanism,</hi> and all such
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105529:40"/>
things as might improve
a <hi>Society.</hi> But <hi>the more
he knew, the more he was
perswaded of the Defects
of Humane Knowledge.</hi>
Neither was he like these
Globes, wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
rather than acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his Ignorance, will
fill up these wast and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
spaces, with
Lands designed and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
only in his Conceit:
But he choosed rather,
to Mantle over that
which he knew, by a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105529:40"/>
than, to pretend to
that which he had not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In fine</hi> rare was it to
see so much <hi>Worth</hi> vailed
under so much <hi>Humility.</hi>
Which keeped him so
from the Knowledge of
Others, but most of all
from himself. Yet as the
<hi>Sun beams</hi> when stopped
in their even course, and
refracted in a Cloud, do
appear in that <hi>rare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of Light and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
the Rainbow:</hi> so the
<hi>Vail of Humility,</hi> though,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105529:41"/>
it a little <hi>interrupted,</hi> yet,
it had not the force to
<hi>keep up</hi> the Glancing
light of that <hi>shining Soul,</hi>
but rather, as a <hi>Shadowed
Picture,</hi> appeared he with
advantage. And as the
<hi>rare endewments of his
Mind,</hi> did not intoxicate
him; so the <hi>Virtues of
his Soul,</hi> however valued
by others, were ever
counted <hi>few</hi> and <hi>mean</hi>
by himself. For he had
<hi>Perfection</hi> in his eye. His
Aimes &amp; Designs stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105529:41"/>
no lower. Whence
the recurring defects of
the daily imperfections
which annoyed him in
his Pilgrimage, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
alwayes himself,
in the blackest shape <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain</hi>
could set him in.
And there was nothing
more grating to his Ears,
than his <hi>own praises.</hi> Is
there not then a <hi>Prince
and a great Man fallen
this day in Israel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soul of Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the <hi>Power</hi> of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105529:42"/>
               <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> rescued
from the bondage of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi>
is brought into
the <hi>Glorious Liberty of
the Sons of God.</hi> For
these staining Tinctures
of <hi>Passion, Lust</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi>
are not done of, that He
should continue as a
whited Wall or a Fleece
of Wool. Nor are these
Divels only cast out,
that <hi>the house be empty
Sweeped and Garnished:</hi>
No, we need not fear so
great preparations shall
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105529:42"/>
end in <hi>Nothing.</hi> We are
uncloathed of our Filthy
Garments, in lieu where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we receive <hi>Change</hi>
of <hi>Raiment:</hi> And the
Treats of the Image of
God are drawn on the
Soul. Thus the <hi>Mind</hi> is
<hi>Transform'd,</hi> by that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of the Divine
Nature,</hi> whereby it is
united and knit unto
God, with that bond of
Perfection, <hi>Love:</hi> which
having consum'd, all that
fewel of Lust and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105529:43"/>
which had so long
smothered the Divine
Life, but becoming Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
it inflameth the
whole Pile, and offereth
it up in one Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God: And the
Soul being agitated by
the Love of God, shed
abroad in it, as by an
Active Principle of Life,
is ever in its Desires and
Meditations mounting
thither, where it hopes to
be for ever. <hi>Our Saviour</hi>
compared this establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105529:43"/>
of the Minde on
God to Hungering and
Thirsting: <hi>Which is not
caused by Reason but by
Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Supream Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation</hi>
of the Soul, is
in being so <hi>fixed on God,</hi>
that we need not be jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
up to it by <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
but, by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and unforced emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Spirit, to be ever
Breathing after, and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for <hi>Communion</hi> with
God. This is to have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105529:44"/>
our Fellowship with the
Father, and with the Son.
To place our whole Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
and Confidence on
God, who through the
Mediation of his Son, is
become Our Mercifull
and Gracious Father.
To bestow on him the
Supremacy of our Love
and Affections; and by
uncessant Motions to be
springing towards Him.
Thus the Soul, maugre
the Load of its Body,
that separateth it so far
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105529:44"/>
from Heaven, will not
be delayed of its Glory,
untill <hi>Vnbodied;</hi> but
will be snatching the
<hi>Summer-fruits</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Harvest</hi> come.
Which, though they be
not ripened, to the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctableness
of <hi>Angels-food;</hi>
yet, that <hi>Antepast</hi> of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
will yeeld the Mind,
such sweet Solaces and
Pleasures, so Sublime
and Highly Divine, as
will beget a Loathing of
the most unmixed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105529:45"/>
Earth can afford.
For that Original sin,
<hi>that they be of the Earth,</hi>
will sufficiently discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
them.</p>
            <p>The Soul having now
found an Object, that
will both deserve and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
its more Fixed
Thoughts, With what
silent Admiration will
it be considering these
<hi>Divine Adorable Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,</hi>
wherewith the
Glorious Lord God is
cloathed, as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105529:45"/>
which will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
choak them, to a
stillnesse next to <hi>Ecstasie;</hi>
and at other times will
burst forth in <hi>Halelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs</hi>
and Thanksgivings.
Could we trace the steps
and Sacred <hi>Soliloquies</hi> of
a Devout Spirit, in those
blessed retreats it makes,
from the Loud distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
of the World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Presence of Him,
who is its <hi>Hiding place,
and strong Habitation</hi>
whereunto it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105529:46"/>
resort: We
should see it with delight
sum up, all the passages
of the <hi>Power, Providence</hi>
and <hi>Goodnesse</hi> of God:
whereby it rouseth it
self and all that is in it,
<hi>To blesse his Holy Name,
and to forget none of his
Benefits.</hi> And, if the
World offer it self to its
View, It will quickly say
with S. <hi>Paul, These things
that before were gain to
me, are now become losse
through Christ.</hi> Yea,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105529:46"/>
               <hi>doubtless, I count all things
but losse for the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Knowledge of
Iesus Christ my Lord.</hi>
Yea, <hi>I will account them
but dung that I may win
Christ.</hi> Thus are the
<hi>Meditations of God,</hi> sweet
unto it: Neither is this
only the <hi>Holy-dayes Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment</hi>
of the Soul. <hi>For
God doth not come to a
Soul, as a way-faring Man
to tarry for a night; But
he dwelleth and abideth in
it.</hi> The Soul is Acted,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105529:47"/>
Moved and Directed by
Him, in all its goings.
And when its Station,
to which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it in the world,
calls it from these imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Adorations, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
quickly to return
again, <hi>and leaves the
Heart with God in Pawn.</hi>
So that however it may
be busied, yet all passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
fervour is blunted
and quenched. And it
is so exactly regulated,
by the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> into
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105529:47"/>
which its own is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it Cares, Desires,
Joyes and Sorrows for
<hi>Nothing Earthly:</hi> But
all the Methods and
Steps of the <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
are by it judged
to be, both Wise, Good
and Just: as flowing from
an unerring <hi>Skill,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
<hi>Goodnesse,</hi> and a
spotlesse <hi>Iustice.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Patience doth it
possesse it self, and, with
an Unreserved Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
equally welcomes as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105529:48"/>
well the <hi>Ebbings,</hi> as the
<hi>Flowings</hi> of Earthly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions.
As being
none of them of a nature,
capable of promoting or
retarding, that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it expects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
from God alone.
Thus <hi>with open face as in
a Glasse, beholding the
Glory of the Lord, we are
changed into the same
Image from Glory to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as by the Spirit of the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Order</hi> of this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:105529:48"/>
doth call for the
<hi>Applying,</hi> what hath been
spoken to the <hi>Glorified
Saint</hi> that hath now left
us. In doing whereof,
several <hi>Instances</hi> must be
disclosed, which in his
life were <hi>unknown</hi> to all,
save to, his other self, his
<hi>Friends.</hi> His Soul was
even fraughted, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring
and Magnifying
thoughts of his Maker.
His Frequent and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
entertaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with <hi>Divine Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:105529:49"/>
did let us all know
wherein he placed his
<hi>Happinesse.</hi> Every day,
many Hours of his
Time, were spent in the
Outer Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in those approaches
to God. No Company
was so bewitching, as to
make him forget him,
who had inhanced all his
desires and delights. But
when the entertainment
of Friends, did seem to
hinder him from that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment:
yet still He
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105529:49"/>
either found or made a
shift to excuse himself
for a while, <hi>that he might
converse with his God:</hi>
Which an ingenious
Modesty did so contrive,
that it was not so much
as suspected, to be done
upon design. Yea when
he was so pressed, that he
could get no time in the
Day stollen, He made it
up in the Night. Often
he used to be <hi>Eight hours</hi>
a day in the immediate
Service of God: beside
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105529:50"/>
His diligent observance
of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> which
was indeed Singular.</p>
            <p>He used a constant
Method in <hi>reading Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
wherein he was
much conversant. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the <hi>Translation</hi>
satisfie him, but He
searched the <hi>Original</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
For he could
quot, the <hi>New Testament</hi>
and <hi>Psalter,</hi> as easily, in
the first Language, as
most can do in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Tongue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:105529:50"/>
In his <hi>daily Reading,</hi>
he did still choose some
place, which he fixed in
his Mind. To the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
whereof, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected
his Thoughts,
all that day when ever
he found himself at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Which he used to
say, was his <hi>Sanctuary</hi>
whither he retreated,
from the Persecution of
Idle Thoughts.</p>
            <p>Many such Methods
used he to wing up His
soul to the work of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105529:51"/>
               <hi>ever to behold
the Face of his Heavenly
Father.</hi> Yea a Radiant
Splendor which posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Looks, when he
returned from his <hi>Closet,</hi>
could make us, easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
what joyfull and
pleasant work he had
been about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He used often, to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
whole dayes, for the
Worship of God,</hi> wherein
He denied himself any
other <hi>Refreshment,</hi> save
what was ministred to
his Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:105529:51"/>
He performed himself,
the <hi>duties of his Family</hi>
constantly at two returns
each day: where you
might have heard both
<hi>Reading, Singing</hi> and
<hi>Prayer,</hi> and that with
such a true and unaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Devotion, as disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<hi>how little Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be in the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of Forms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>first arrest</hi> of that
Fatall sicknesse, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
the <hi>Active Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of his Spirit</hi> so far,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105529:52"/>
that the Keennesse and
Fervour of his Soul was
somewhat blunted, which
drew him into <hi>Sadnesse,</hi>
judged <hi>Melancholy</hi> by
Beholders; For he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
that then when
these <hi>Attaques</hi> of God,
did alarum him up to a
greater diligence, He was
become more <hi>languid</hi> and
<hi>tepid:</hi> This Trouble was
but of <hi>short continuance,</hi>
for he found the <hi>union of
his soul</hi> to his God, as
close as ever, though a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105529:52"/>
               <hi>Mistuned Body,</hi> could
not bear up in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The last Lords Day of
his Life, was he diligent
in the search of his Heart,
and earnest in wrestling
with God:</hi> the <hi>Issue</hi>
whereof was, a <hi>Quiet</hi> and
<hi>Composed</hi> Mind. Which
was, apparant, in the
<hi>Cheerfulnesse of his Spirit,</hi>
which was greater that
Night, than it had been
all the while of his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Two dayes after,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105529:53"/>
he was seized with a <hi>spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Feaver,</hi> or rather, His
Sicknesse did evidently
discover it self to be such.
Which having in a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>disturbed</hi> his Fancy,
what, after that, came
from him <hi>like himself,</hi>
was rather <hi>Curt</hi> (though
raised and Divine) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
than any
<hi>fixed</hi> and well ordered
conceptions.</p>
            <p>Often did He pray,
often did He speak of the
<hi>Glory of His God,</hi> and of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105529:53"/>
His <hi>Redeemer:</hi> Yea never
mentioned he <hi>either,</hi> but
his Soul seemed <hi>to go out
with Fervour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Last Night</hi> of his
Life, <hi>Five times,</hi> did he
direct his desires to God,
in the words of the <hi>Lords
Prayer.</hi> About the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
His Raving seemed
to have taken leave of
Him: for about a <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an Hour,</hi> did he,
with great seriousnesse,
and in well fitted words,
<hi>call upon the Lord</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105529:54"/>
his aid. Neither
did he forget His <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi>
the <hi>Church,</hi> His
<hi>Nation</hi> or His <hi>Family.</hi>
He had no sooner end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when the Fury of his
distemper, as if it had
<hi>given him Truce,</hi> only for
that blessed work, did
again invade him. It
was a few hours after
that (for he scarce spoke
any more) that the Cords
of his Tabernacle, begun
to be slackened: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were awar, <hi>He
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105529:54"/>
gave up the Ghost and fell
asleep,</hi> passing into Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Is there not then, <hi>a
great Man fallen this day
in Israel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus viewed
the <hi>Greatnesse</hi> of that
Soul, wherein I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
no <hi>Hyperbole</hi> hath
been used; neither hath
ought been said but what
I certainly knew to be
<hi>true,</hi> Those who are little
acquainted with <hi>True
worth,</hi> and who Imagine
there is no such thing in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105529:55"/>
the World (but that it
is a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> contrived
to amuse and overaw the
sons of <hi>Adam)</hi> will, may
be, look on what hath
been said, as a <hi>Flaunting
Story.</hi> But it will gain
<hi>credit</hi> with such, as are,
neither strangers to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
nor to <hi>Him.</hi> What
was <hi>seen</hi> of him was so
fair and alluring, that
every one will not stick
to believe, the <hi>Vnseen</hi> and
<hi>Hidden</hi> parts of him must
be the most <hi>Glorious: All
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105529:55"/>
will believe the Closet of
a Palace to exceed the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Walls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is a <hi>Sad Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
to say, <hi>There is a
great Man</hi> FALL'N, I shall
rather invert the words,
<hi>There is a Great Man</hi>
RAIS'D <hi>up.</hi> The Soul and
Body are wreathed into
unity by such a <hi>Congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Life,</hi> that forgetting
the Difference of their
Natures, they come to
be so linked, in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
one of another, as
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105529:56"/>
to <hi>move joyntly</hi> in all their
<hi>Operations.</hi> Whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
such an <hi>Eccho</hi> of
the <hi>One,</hi> to all the <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
of the <hi>Other,</hi> that
they both <hi>gain</hi> or <hi>losse,</hi>
according as their <hi>Yoak-fellow</hi>
is <hi>Pleased</hi> or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged.</hi>
Which being
a <hi>Riddle</hi> too hard for
the <hi>crazed Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of Man, whose sight
hath not yet reached the
<hi>inside</hi> of Beings, their
Natures; some take a
Compendious way to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105529:56"/>
extricate themselves, by
saying, <hi>It is but agitated
and subtile Matter that
keeps us in Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How well this may be
applied to such Agents
as are devoid of <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination,</hi>
and to the <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi>
and <hi>Animal Actions</hi>
of a Man, I am not now
to examine. But that
<hi>Cogitation</hi> can be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Matter, even when
it acts on <hi>Immaterial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
and in <hi>Self-reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
will be found a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105529:57"/>
difficulty, than that
they intended to shun.</p>
            <p>And sure in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of a <hi>Cogitating
Being</hi> there is no greater
<hi>Absurdity,</hi> than in that
of an <hi>Extended One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Soul hath
lodged in the Body, that
space of <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> and
<hi>Probation,</hi> appointed it
by God; Then the time
of its <hi>Dissolution</hi> draweth
nigh. When it is to be
<hi>unfettered,</hi> then, through
the dark <hi>shades</hi> of <hi>Death</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:105529:57"/>
must we passe to <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi>
And though there
be nothing more <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
to them whose Leud
and Atheistical life, doth
fill them with just appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of <hi>approaching
Miseries;</hi> Yet the Lord
God, who can out of the
<hi>Eater bring forth Meat,</hi>
and out of the <hi>Strong</hi>
give <hi>Honey,</hi> hath ordered
that to be the <hi>Fore-runner</hi>
of a Blisse, so far elevate
beyond the mean and lo
apprehensions, we Frail
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105529:58"/>
Mortals can conceive,
that the most Fluent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence,
can do it no
Right. May we but
Imagine, what an <hi>Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
a Holy Soul will be
struck in, when it finds it
self, of a suddain freed
from, the <hi>Depressions</hi> of
a Grosse and Terrestrial
Body, the <hi>Allurements</hi> of
a <hi>Debauched Mind,</hi> the
<hi>Entisements</hi> of a <hi>Foolish
World,</hi> the <hi>Contagion</hi> of
<hi>Evil Company,</hi> the <hi>Stings</hi>
of <hi>Sicknesse</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105529:58"/>
from an Unactive <hi>Tepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi>
of Mind in the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
and <hi>Converse</hi> with
God. And in stead of
all This, it <hi>Enters Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
Where it is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and welcomed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Companies of
<hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Spirits of Iust
men made perfect;</hi> and is
by them led into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of that <hi>King of
Saints,</hi> Who is <hi>Glorious
in Holinesse,</hi> whose <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Greatness,</hi> being then
clearly discovered by the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105529:59"/>
Purified Soul, will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the greatest <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi>
of <hi>Ioy,</hi> the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Nature is capable of.
For, We shall then see,
with the <hi>Evidence of
Sense,</hi> the <hi>Brightnesse of
the Fathers Glory,</hi> the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begotten Son of God,</hi>
whom, while on Earth,
we behold in the <hi>Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Faith.</hi> Believe me,
<hi>This Glory</hi> were too daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a sight to us while
we are in the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses,</hi> when he saw
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105529:59"/>
but the <hi>Outside</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Glory,</hi> yet such a
<hi>Brightnesse,</hi> from that
<hi>Passing View,</hi> was imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his Looks, that he
must needs vail himself:
What Eye could then
behold an <hi>Vnvailed God?</hi>
And if a <hi>Passing Sight</hi> of
that Exalted Prince, did
so swallow up the Spirit
of the <hi>Apostle of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
What could resist
the Ecstasies and Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
a <hi>Fixed Looking</hi> on
the <hi>Sun of Righteousnesse</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:105529:60"/>
would occasion? If the
One made S. <hi>Paul forget</hi>
his Body, T'other would
have made <hi>him abandon</hi> it.
But in Glory, those Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
Objects shall not
<hi>consternate</hi> the Beholders
into a languishing faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but, being Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
it will <hi>Rouse</hi>
them into a Vigorous
Activity and Spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of Blessing, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring,
Loving and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
in their Maker,
that <hi>Fountain of Life.</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:105529:60"/>
And this by no <hi>Short</hi> or
<hi>Passing Returns,</hi> but by a
<hi>Constant Efflux of Soul.</hi>
So the <hi>Creature</hi> is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
swallowed up of, and
overwhelmed by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of its <hi>Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now into the Number
of that <hi>Coelestial Quire</hi> is
received the <hi>Soul</hi> of Him,
who, while on Earth,
having seen the <hi>Glory of
that Land which is a far of</hi>
and tasting some of the
<hi>Grapes of Canaan,</hi> did
<hi>Run his race with joy and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105529:61"/>
Pressed forward toward
the mark, even the Prize
of the high Calling of God
in Iesus Christ.</hi> And <hi>hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
now <hi>finish'd his Course,
he hath entered into His
Masters joy, and and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that Crown of
Righteousnesse, which is
Incorruptible and fadeth
not away.</hi> Now, being
uncloathed of all Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and Frailty, doth
his Soul as an unsullied
Mirrour, yeeld a bright
Reflexion of that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105529:61"/>
Light, with
whose beams he is irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated:
And, in that
Purest Light of <hi>Divine
Illumination,</hi> doth he <hi>see
light, seeing Him that is
Invisible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If an <hi>Vnknown Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
did by a Secret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
<hi>warm the hearts</hi>
of the two Disciples,
while He talked with
them; Sure then the
Hearts of <hi>this Disciple,</hi> is
now <hi>inflamed</hi> with Love
and Zeal, while He close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105529:62"/>
embraceth and Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
converseth with
an <hi>Vnmasked Redeemer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
O how much doth He
rejoyce and blesse himself
in the Possession of that
Glory: the <hi>meanest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
whereof he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to the <hi>Empire</hi> of the
World. What <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs</hi>
is he now singing?
With what delight doth
He <hi>keep his Part</hi> in those
Heavenly <hi>Anthems?</hi>
With what Pleasure
feels he himself beyond
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105529:62"/>
the Assaults of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
How doth it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
him, that He needs
no further Incentive of
the Love of God, and
that no Cloud doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb
or darken the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and Magnificent
Glory; no Drowsinesse
of Mind doth steal him
into sleep? For <hi>there is
no Night above:</hi> But <hi>day
and night do they see the
Face of God.</hi> Know ye
not then <hi>there is a Great
Man raised up this day in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105529:63"/>
the New Ierusalem?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It followeth to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
<hi>Where</hi> hath this
<hi>Great man fallen.</hi> Even
in <hi>Scotland</hi> our <hi>Israel:</hi>
A <hi>Nation</hi> of which it
may well be <hi>doubted,</hi>
Whither its <hi>Mercies</hi> or
<hi>Ingratitude</hi> be greatest.
And though at some
time it might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with any round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
being barren in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the <hi>Soil;</hi> But
now indeed <hi>the case is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi>
To instance it in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105529:63"/>
               <hi>one thing.</hi> It not the
<hi>Power of Godliness,</hi> whose
Effects should be, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of our Spirits
into a Likeness and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
with our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Master and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
turned into
<hi>Formes</hi> and <hi>Words?</hi>
With what violence and
eagernesse, may we daily
see Inconsiderable and
Controverted Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
pressed and advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
What severe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surings,
bitter Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105529:64"/>
and scurrilous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives,
are we daily
forced to hear? And we
are become so keen on
such stuff, that the Great
and Indispensable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the Law of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
<hi>Holinesse, Charity</hi>
and <hi>Obedience</hi> are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but mean and sorry
Doctrines. What Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
are made upon the
Failings and Errours of
those that differ in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
though such had no
truth in them, and are
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105529:64"/>
but the Forgeries of Gall
and Despite? And how
well pleased are we, when
we get the Inglorious
Advantage of Crushing
and Ruining These,
whom <hi>Blind Zeal,</hi> tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
with Malice, and
Revenge makes us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
our Enemies?
Thus for all our <hi>Canting,</hi>
if one should give a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of us by our Lives
and Conversations, He
should not miss of calling
us <hi>Christned Heathens.</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:105529:65"/>
We are called <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and professe our
selves to be such, and do
wisely in so doing; for
there is Nothing that
would make any suspect
us <hi>guilty of Religion,</hi> save
our <hi>Outside.</hi> Are we not
Covetous, Proud, Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and Self-conceited?
Thus have we flatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
the <hi>Great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Gospel.</hi> Which
<hi>Doctrine</hi> was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the World by the
<hi>Wisedome of God,</hi> not to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105529:65"/>
disturb our heads, with
<hi>Harsh</hi> and <hi>unprofitable
Questions;</hi> But to Prick
our hearts with a <hi>sorrow
and hatred of Sin.</hi> Not to
make us <hi>Talk big,</hi> But to
<hi>Live Sublimely</hi> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>like</hi> unto his <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Self.</hi> Yea, How
degenerate by such work
are we become, and what
<hi>Loathing</hi> this hath begot
of the <hi>great Truths of
Religion</hi> in the Hearts of
our Supernumerary <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
I should rather mask
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105529:66"/>
with a silent Sorrow,
than with a Brisk For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse,
discover the
Nakedness of my Parent,
my <hi>Countrey.</hi> But their
detestable and impious
Lives, their Irreligious
and Blasphemous scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
at Piety and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and their daily fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off to the Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Idolatry of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do give
too evident a testimony
what kind of <hi>Cattel</hi> they
are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:105529:66"/>
Neither hath this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion
only corrupted
the <hi>Morals</hi> of this People,
but their very <hi>Spirits</hi> are
become <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>sordid.</hi>
And how receptive their
Vitiated Minds are, of
the <hi>worst impressions</hi> may
appear from the Great
footing that French Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion
of <hi>Atheism</hi> (more
to be abominated even
then the <hi>sicknesse which
goeth under that name)</hi>
hath among us. The fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
wits of some ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105529:67"/>
               <hi>Hectors,</hi> who having
immersed themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all brutalism, and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized
from that <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
nature,</hi> conceive the
<hi>deepest hatred</hi> against the
<hi>adored Deity;</hi> and with
a monstruous arrogance
proclaim an open feud
against God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And if they can
with Blustring and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry
elude those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where with some,
lesse experienced with
their cursed Arts, do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105529:67"/>
them, and with a
wide-mouthed impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
run down the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dester:
Thence do they
conceit themselves, <hi>the
only sons of Wisdom;</hi> of
whom, I dare boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
we have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Instance of their so
eagerly contended for
principle, that <hi>a man hath
no real Preheminence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or Difference from
brutes.</hi> Which if now
they so much desire, what
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105529:68"/>
wil their wishes be when,
with their Master <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan,</hi>
they shall be shut
up in that Lake of Fire
and Brimstone.</p>
            <p>Their Triumph is,
that <hi>no argument can reach
them;</hi> for, they deny the
Certainty of all those
Principles whence any
Argument can be drawn:
And yet in the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their own Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses,
how many <hi>Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities</hi>
are they driven to
suppose? which could
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105529:68"/>
never have captivated
any mans <hi>Reason,</hi> but his
who hath consented to
that slavery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves,
<hi>to believe any thing
but Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, if <hi>all things</hi>
be <hi>uncertain;</hi> Then, <hi>that
there is no God,</hi> must be
so likewise; and as their
Principles yeeld to this,
so they could never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to any positive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for this <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous
tenet.</hi> If it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
then, that for ought
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105529:69"/>
they know, <hi>there may be
a God,</hi> it will be easie for
every one to collect
hence, whether <hi>Atheism</hi>
or <hi>Religion</hi> be the safer
Course.</p>
            <p>How much these <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Doctrines</hi> begin to be
received among us, is too
notar, the daring bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of those blasphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rascals, telleth us,
they fear <hi>Man</hi> no more
than they do <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Great Person</hi> that
is now fallen, although,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105529:69"/>
He needed no such foil
to set off his Glory; Yet
it cannot choose, but
make <hi>Him</hi> the more <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,</hi>
and his <hi>Fall</hi> the
more <hi>Lamentable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of This Nation
grieved him hath been
touched already. Great
was his Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that divellish crew
of Atheists: that one
should thought so <hi>Calm
a mind,</hi> could not be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to so much spight.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105529:70"/>
Much was he incensed
against some Pretenders
to the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> who
ranked themselves under
<hi>Leviathans</hi> Banner: for
He believed that from
these <hi>Sciences,</hi> more then
<hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two</hi> arguments
could be brought for the
<hi>Principles of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, He judged the
greatest <hi>Right</hi> could be
done to <hi>Reason,</hi> was <hi>the
belief of Christianity,</hi>
which is in all things so
proportioned to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105529:70"/>
that the very
<hi>proposing</hi> of them will
gain credit, from any
<hi>unstained mind,</hi> which is
freed from the polluting
tinctures of <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
and, converseth
much with its own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
in still and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Reflections</hi> upon it
self.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Spirit</hi> was too
large to shrink into the
narrow Orb of a <hi>Party</hi>
or <hi>Interest.</hi> No, His <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
taught him to dispise
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105529:71"/>
none of his Brethren.
For though he believed
his <hi>Conscience</hi> to be his
<hi>own Rule,</hi> which he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and followed, yet
he judged it an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
peice of <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Arrogance,</hi> to assume
<hi>Authority</hi> over the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi>
of <hi>Others,</hi> and to
dictate to them.</p>
            <p>In Fine, he judged
none of our <hi>Debates,</hi> to
be about matters <hi>essential
to Religion:</hi> but found
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105529:71"/>
himself oblieged to all
Love and Kindnesse for
those, that lived Holily
and whose Souls had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
on that Light and
Easie yoak of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and
had stouped to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
however they
might disagree about the
<hi>Outside</hi> and model of
<hi>Church-Polity.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
He was of Opinion,
that, <hi>Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
moderating over
but regulated by <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi>
might have as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105529:72"/>
strong a Plea for the
Chair as any other <hi>Form;</hi>
yet He judged <hi>Forms,</hi> to
be but <hi>Forms,</hi> which, of
their own nature, are
neither so <hi>Good</hi> as to
make Men <hi>Good;</hi> nor so
<hi>Evil,</hi> as to make men
<hi>Evil:</hi> But would prove
<hi>Succesfull</hi> according to
their <hi>skilful management:</hi>
or <hi>Vuneffectual</hi> by the
<hi>furious overdryving</hi> of
These, to whose care that
work was trusted.</p>
            <p>By this <hi>Description,</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:105529:72"/>
the Truth whereof was
so fully known to all
perswasions (yea the last
morning of His Life, did
He cordially pray that
the Lord would <hi>heal our
Breaches,</hi> and <hi>poure out
the Spirit of Love and
Meeknesse on this divided
and furious People,</hi> and
fell out in a noble <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick</hi>
on the Power and
Exaltedness of the <hi>Great
Truths of our Religion;</hi>
and concluded, that God
who had not denied us
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105529:73"/>
the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of his
<hi>Son,</hi> would never have
envied us a clear Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of these <hi>Opinions,</hi>
had they been <hi>Necessary</hi>
for His <hi>Church.)</hi> Hence
we must conclude, that
Now his <hi>Advantage,</hi> is
our great and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Losse:</hi> For He was
<hi>one of a Thousand, a Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and a Shining Light,
blamelesse and harmlesse as
a Son of God, in midst of
a Crooked and Perverse
Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:105529:73"/>
O <hi>Scotland!</hi> Doth
None of you lay it to
heart, that this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Mercifull Man
is <hi>taken away:</hi> And who
knows, but it is from the
<hi>Evil to come.</hi> Hath not
the Loud Cry of the
<hi>Iudgements</hi> of God awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
you? And doth
not the <hi>Musick</hi> of his
<hi>Mercies</hi> Charm you?
Hath not the <hi>Preaching
of His Word</hi> Converted
you, nor the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>His
Servants,</hi> wrought upon
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105529:74"/>
you? Yet let the <hi>Death
of his Saints</hi> Allarum
you. Know! that the
<hi>Lord God</hi> is <hi>angry:</hi> And
that the <hi>Cry of your abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
is going up to
Heaven:</hi> and a <hi>Cousump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Lord, is come
out upon you.</hi> The Power
and Vitals of Religion
are daily decaying, and
the <hi>True Seekers</hi> of God
are melting away as
Snow before the Sun.
They are the <hi>Pillars of
the Earth,</hi> and it is for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105529:74"/>
their sakes, that the <hi>End
of Time</hi> is not already
come. Justly may we
then <hi>Fear,</hi> that the Lord
shall be gathering in
those <hi>Excellent Ones</hi> to
himself, and so <hi>His Fury
shall run out upon us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a stop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore let me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
you to notice this
great losse. And so I say
to you, <hi>Know you not
that there is a great Man
fallen this day in Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is offered to our
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105529:75"/>
Consideration, what
kind of <hi>Notice</hi> the <hi>Death</hi>
of such a <hi>Great Person</hi>
doth call for. Which
that we may the better
Understand, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
that <hi>Great Errour</hi>
of many, who think <hi>the
Violent Touches of a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
Sorrow to be a
Debt they owe the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their deceas'd Friends:</hi>
wherein they so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
That their Wit
and Spirit is put to task
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105529:75"/>
to Defend and Justifie
these daily Affronts they
receive. And if the <hi>Force
of Reason</hi> or <hi>Length of
Time</hi> be rescuing them
from that Vassalage, then
their <hi>Vitiated Minds</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>incensed</hi> against
themselves: and they
wil challenge their hearts
of Insensibility and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnesse.
Shall we then
see how <hi>Iust</hi> their <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
is. Will we step in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Gallery of Heathens,</hi>
there shall the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:105529:76"/>
teach us Wisdom. From
them may we Learn to
look upon <hi>Nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, as our own;</hi> but
count them of a lower
nature, and to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them, that can
render Us <hi>truely Happy,</hi>
but to be so <hi>Fluctuating</hi>
that when we think our
selves most secured in the
Possession of them, we
are to remember, they
may be <hi>removed from Vs:</hi>
And so we are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Our Minds from
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105529:76"/>
the Bondage of Passion
and Fondnesse on ought
that is Earthly. For an
Opinion of <hi>Excellency</hi> in
any thing, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of that to be
<hi>Ours,</hi> doth make the losse
of it unsupportable.</p>
            <p>They will also teach
us never to be <hi>troubled,</hi>
For that we <hi>cannot Help;</hi>
For they Believed All
Things to be Governed
by a <hi>Fate,</hi> which was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable:
They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
judged it Irrational,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105529:77"/>
to be busied in a Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Labour, since that
nor Tears nor Sorrow
can recall the Life that
is gone. Thus <hi>Vnchrist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Reason</hi> taught these
Philosophers to argue.
And sure if they <hi>Lived</hi>
as they <hi>Talked,</hi> they shall
rise in Judgement against
many called Christians,
who see a <hi>Clearer Light,</hi>
and yet walk in <hi>Greater
Darknesse</hi> and <hi>Disorder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no <hi>Disgrace</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Our <hi>Religion,</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:105529:77"/>
nor to the <hi>Grace</hi> of God,
to magnifie the <hi>Morality</hi>
and <hi>Worth</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>
Methinks it saith
and that strongly for the
<hi>Honour</hi> of it, to find, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Rubbish of
Ruined Nature, still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
some Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Virtue.</hi> But if we
attempt a Comparison
betwixt that <hi>Sacred Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
delivered in the
<hi>Bible</hi> and the <hi>Writings</hi>
of the more <hi>Moralized
Heathens,</hi> you may as
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105529:78"/>
justly compare a <hi>Fish eye</hi>
to a <hi>Pearl,</hi> or a <hi>Diamond</hi>
to a <hi>peece</hi> of <hi>Christal: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Light</hi> being as the
<hi>First Dawning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of the
<hi>Morning,</hi> pleasing to
One wearied with the
Blacknesse of Night,
which may well delight
the Eye with its Beauty,
but will hardly guide the
Traveller on his way.
But the <hi>Divine Light,</hi>
like the <hi>Noon Beams,</hi>
which clearly discovers
all things here below,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105529:78"/>
and maketh us easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
every Object save it
self, not for any dimness
in its Self, but an Exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Brightness. So after
one hath been vexed,
with looking on the
Darknesse of <hi>Heathenish
Idolatry,</hi> and finds in
<hi>Greece</hi> something of a
higher strain, He cannot
choose but be somewhat
satisfied: But will find
himself little furthered.
Their <hi>Doctrine</hi> being
able excellently to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105529:79"/>
how he is to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged,</hi>
but Prescribing
no foundation to <hi>fix on,</hi>
nor furnishing any helps
towards such an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievment.
This is Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the glory of the
<hi>Latter House,</hi> whose radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
splendour doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to us, all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of our Duty,</hi> and
fills our Hearts with
true Understanding, for
the perfect knowledge of
every thing in our
course. Only <hi>He</hi> whose
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105529:79"/>
Glory it is to be <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible,</hi>
cannot be
found out to Perfection.
The truth whereof shall
be now <hi>applied,</hi> to the
Affair in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> then teacheth
us, That in this life, we
are but <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and
<hi>aiming at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Happinesse:</hi> and that
the very <hi>Essence</hi> of all
Earthly Enjoyments, is
to be <hi>Transitory.</hi> For <hi>we
have no lease of Life, nor
of the Comforts thereof.</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:105529:80"/>
There is a <hi>wildernesse</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
and <hi>Canaan,</hi> in
which we must <hi>Sojourn.</hi>
We must not then fret,
although we have no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at every Station:
But with all cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
ought we to follow
every Remove of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Guidance; For
Here we live in Hope,
and expect that after we
have walked through the
<hi>Valley of Baca,</hi> we shall
<hi>appear before the Lord in
Sion, in that Rest that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105529:80"/>
for the People of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus in the
<hi>Gospel</hi> assur'd of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Glory, How
Irrational is it, to Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
upon our Present
Troubles, which last but
for a moment. No Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
will deeply resent
the losse of Company he
encountered on the way,
much lesse if he be assur'd
to find them at home be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: Why should
the Death of an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105529:81"/>
Person be accounted
a losse, when we know
the Separation shall last
but a few hours, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the Boundlesse
length of that Eternal
fellowship wherein we
shall enjoy one another.</p>
            <p>Further the <hi>Gospel</hi> tells
us, that, all things here
below are managed by
the exactest Skill, and a
well ballanced <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
The most despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
of Creatures, are
no forgot by Him, much
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105529:81"/>
lesse, the <hi>Masterpeece</hi> of
his work, <hi>Man,</hi> in the
greatest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concernment
thereof, <hi>Life.</hi> The <hi>hairs
of our head are numbered,</hi>
much more the <hi>years</hi> of
our <hi>Life,</hi> the End where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
never approacheth but
in the fittest and best cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
time. For we are not
exposed, to the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Chances of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
nor folded under
the <hi>Fatality of Stoicks,</hi> or
the <hi>influence</hi> and <hi>aspects</hi>
of <hi>Stars;</hi> but led by an
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105529:82"/>
unerring <hi>Wisedome</hi> that
doth all things in <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Weight</hi> and <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
It is then but a
well set off <hi>Blasphemy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Wisdom of God,</hi>
to be offended with his
Government of the
World.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>Christianity</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us well <hi>what Death
is:</hi> That it is no <hi>Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Soul,</hi> nor
doth it carry us to still
and dark Caverns,
where, in an unactive
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105529:82"/>
Drowsinesse, we shall
sleep over our Time;
much lesse to any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
though Temporal
pains, as some dream:
But the Instant of a
Christians Dissolution
is the time He shall be
invested with all <hi>Glory</hi>
and <hi>Dignity</hi> and possess'd
of all <hi>Blesse</hi> and <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
How strong a curb
must this be to any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
sorrow, when,
without being Criminal
in a Secret Envying their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105529:83"/>
deceas'd Friends Glory,
they dare not regrate his
Death. For all their
Complaints do carry in
their bosome, so many
wishes that the Ground
of their trouble had not
been: and <hi>Self-interest</hi>
and <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the unspeakable
<hi>Advantage</hi> of him that
is <hi>Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Even</hi> true Friendship
<hi>would command one to
say,</hi> Since my Happinesse
cannot come at any other
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105529:83"/>
rate than my friends being
detained from His, which
is a good degree of Misery,
with all contentednesse of
mind shall my losse redeem
my friends Gain.</p>
            <p>Further there be <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi>
and <hi>Delights</hi> of the
<hi>Mind</hi> of a Higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than those of the
<hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> which
can never be shaken, by
any thing <hi>without us:</hi>
These <hi>true Delights,</hi>
which a well grounded
assurance of the Love of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105529:84"/>
God doth bring into the
Mind, are so far beyond
all the <hi>World</hi> can <hi>promise,</hi>
much more <hi>give,</hi> that,
when weighed in a true
Ballance, they prove
<hi>lighter</hi> than <hi>vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord God out of
his <hi>Love</hi> to Man, doth
use all means, leaving
none unessayed, that He
may obtain the <hi>Mastery</hi>
of the <hi>Soul:</hi> when <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Satisfactions</hi> do <hi>carry
on</hi> this Design, they are
allowed us: But if they
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105529:84"/>
prove <hi>Retardments,</hi> the
same reason doth call for
their Removal. An ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Belief of the <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
of the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
who <hi>maketh all things
work together for good to
them that Love Him,</hi> will
secure the Peace of the
Soul so entirely, that
none of all the Batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Passion will
brangle it. And it is
by these <hi>scorchings of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction</hi>
that God draws
in many to dwell under
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105529:85"/>
the <hi>shadow</hi> of his <hi>Wings,</hi>
where they are in safety;
whereby they come more
actively to attempt, and
carry on a Triumph
over all the Entangl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Thus the <hi>Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of our Joys and
Hopes <hi>(the Love of God
in Christ)</hi> remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
however the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi>
of our Condition,
which is but our <hi>Exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
happinesse,</hi> may be
subject to Change.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:105529:85"/>
It is by these <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
(of the Truth
whereof, by the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded)
That the <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Fear</hi> of God, doth
<hi>guard</hi> our <hi>Minds</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them in <hi>Perfect

comforts of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
by the Force whereof
and the <hi>Assistance</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
they at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Proof</hi> to all the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105529:87"/>
of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Hither to have we
seen, that a <hi>Raging Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
is not the <hi>Debt</hi> we
owe to the <hi>Memory</hi> of
the <hi>Dead.</hi> Neither did
<hi>David</hi> (whose Practise
upon the removal of His
beloved Childe, doth
clearly discover his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions)
intend any such
thing when he saith,
<hi>Know ye not that there is
a great Man fallen this
day in Israel.</hi> Neither is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105529:88"/>
a <hi>sullen negligence</hi> of the
<hi>Providence</hi> of God, the
<hi>Stilnesse</hi> Virtue requires.
Betwixt these two doth
the <hi>Writer to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
direct, our course.
For he wrote, <hi>My Son,
despise not thou the Chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Lord, nor faint
when thou art corrected of
Him.</hi> When therefore
the <hi>Fall</hi> of a <hi>Great Person</hi>
doth allarum us, we
should diligently heed
and Observe the Voice
of it. We should hear
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105529:88"/>
our selves thereby called
to an <hi>Elevation of Soul</hi>
beyond all Earthly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
and to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how little our Hearts
should be fixed on such
things. May be that
<hi>Love</hi> hath made us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
our Work, and the
Lord by <hi>snatching</hi> it from
us doth <hi>court our Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi>
Yea, forceth us to
it, by the retiring us,
from the bewitching en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
of Subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Contentments; that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105529:89"/>
so being beaten of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Desire,</hi> He
may be unrivall'd in the
Possession of our Heart.
The least slip of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Love, will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
unpardonable
and quench all the others
kindnesse, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
it into a Fury and
Revenge. Thus the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Eye of God, if it
find us gadd a whoring
after strange Loves, and
give the <hi>Highest</hi> of our
Love to the <hi>Creature,</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:105529:89"/>
then an Incensed <hi>Creator</hi>
removing His <hi>Rival,</hi>
doth <hi>loudly call us back to
the duties of our wedlock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Further, then
must we also have a just
value of the Worth and
Virtue of Him who is
fallen, by numbering up
his severall <hi>Excellencies</hi>
which will never shine so
bright as Then. While
the Person is <hi>alive,</hi> His
present Worth doth so
choak us with Joy and
Complacency that scarce
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105529:90"/>
have we leisure to run
over the foregoing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of his Life: which
when He is <hi>Gone;</hi> being
summed together in Our
<hi>Remembrance,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared
to us, by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our equally
Beloved and Admired
friend, cannot but High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encrease our esteem
of Him, That so when
Dead He may <hi>live in
our Memories:</hi> as that
<hi>Queen,</hi> who, thinking no
Tomb worthy of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105529:90"/>
King and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
did <hi>drink over</hi> over
his <hi>ashes,</hi> and so buried
him in her own Bowels.</p>
            <p>And sure those <hi>Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
which are <hi>outlived</hi> by
the <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>worn</hi> off by
<hi>Separation</hi> or distance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
were never <hi>real,</hi> or,
at most, <hi>Skindeep.</hi> For <hi>the
Character of true Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is indelible.</hi> A Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chick
Fury, or Flouds of
Tears, or Languishing
Fits do well prove the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105529:91"/>
               <hi>Strength of Passion;</hi> but
only a <hi>Lasting Esteem</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrateth
the <hi>Reality</hi>
of <hi>Love.</hi> Neither ought
such resentments to be
expressed only with <hi>Sad
Face</hi> and <hi>Doleful Voice,</hi>
But chiefly by propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such a <hi>rare Person,</hi>
as an <hi>Example</hi> both for
our own and others <hi>Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sun</hi> is in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
not to be <hi>gazed
at,</hi> but to Guide: and
Beacons are Lighted not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105529:91"/>
for <hi>show</hi> but <hi>service.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
run <hi>his Fate,</hi> who
looking to the <hi>Stars</hi> did
not mind his way, but
fell into a <hi>Ditch.</hi> So their
diligent <hi>attention</hi> to the
<hi>Virtues</hi> of Another, is so
far from <hi>provoking</hi> them
to endeavour a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of them, that it
proveth but a <hi>Scandal,</hi>
while that remembrance
galls them, either fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them into agonies
of Grief and Sorrow, or
benumming them into
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105529:92"/>
Idle Heavinesse. Thus
as the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi>
proposed for a <hi>Cure,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
an <hi>Occasion of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi>
So an <hi>Exalted
Soul</hi> lifted up to <hi>Glory,</hi>
being set forth to draw
us after it, doth indeed
prevail over many to
<hi>draw them away,</hi> not <hi>to,</hi>
but <hi>from</hi> their <hi>Duty.</hi> So
<hi>Corrupt man can suck poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
from the sweetest
flowr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is now time to bring
what is set <hi>down</hi> in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:105529:92"/>
to our <hi>Occasion.</hi>
Let not then the Death
of this <hi>Great Person,</hi>
choak our Hearts with
that Pusillanimous and
sordid Passion of <hi>Sorrow.</hi>
He is not <hi>Dead,</hi> but is
<hi>Asleep:</hi> Neither hath
Death <hi>triumphed over
him,</hi> but He hath obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the <hi>Victory.</hi> What,
though in the Heat of
the Combat He hath
thrown his cloaths from
Him, and striped himself
of such burdensome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105529:93"/>
which yet will be
rescued from the Jawes
of Death, in the last scene
of His Triumph, The
<hi>Morning</hi> of the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
Then shall He
shine as the Brightnesse
of the Firmament. Let
Us not therefore <hi>Envy</hi>
his <hi>Glory,</hi> but rather <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate</hi>
his <hi>Happinesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither should the
Apprehension of Our
<hi>Misery</hi> in his being Torn
from us Possess our souls
with an <hi>uncomforted Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:105529:93"/>
The Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the
Supreamest of all <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Comforts,</hi> was, when
removed, made up to
their advantage that
were blessed with that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Mission</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
Upon which Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
did our <hi>Saviour</hi>
say, <hi>It is expedient for
you that I go away.</hi> So
ought we believe that no
Satisfaction on <hi>Earth</hi> is
so great, but can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by these <hi>inward
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105529:94"/>
Ioyes,</hi> which the Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Lord God will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
on us, in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that is most fit and
expedient for us. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
we therefore seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
a subjection of
Mind, to the Good, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
and Perfect will
of God.</p>
            <p>Let his <hi>Memory</hi> also
be dear and precious to
us, and we stirred up to
Active Attempts after
those Virtues He pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed.
Was He <hi>Meek,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105529:94"/>
Humble, Temperate, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
Patient, Pious</hi>
and <hi>Devout:</hi> Let Us
not onely flauntingly
<hi>Talk</hi> of those <hi>Excellent
Graces,</hi> but silently <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
the <hi>Practice of them.</hi>
Let the <hi>Impious</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
<hi>Wicked</hi> be
<hi>ashamed,</hi> and be <hi>You</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
by the death
of this <hi>Great Man,</hi> that
<hi>you must all once die, and
after that come to Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Me thinks this
Thought should start
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105529:95"/>
you and stop your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer,
lest you drive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these unquenchable
<hi>Flames</hi> ere you be aware.
Learn you that are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the Praise of
<hi>being no ill men,</hi> from the
Example of this <hi>Great
One,</hi> not to <hi>Halt betwixt
two Gods. You must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
love God or Mammon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was said by Him,
that spoke never amisse,</hi>
He that is not with me is
against me. Be therefore
Holy, as your God is Holy:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105529:95"/>
               <hi>and be ye</hi> Followers <hi>of
this</hi> blessed Disciple, <hi>as he
was a</hi> Follower <hi>of</hi> Christ.</p>
            <p>You also that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into the <hi>School of
Christ,</hi> Be not as <hi>Babes,</hi>
ever <hi>Learning,</hi> and never
coming to the <hi>Knowledge</hi>
of the <hi>Truth:</hi> But go on
to <hi>Perfection.</hi> Be not
Cripled with, or detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under, the Pedagogy
of <hi>Forms;</hi> but Imitate
this <hi>Great Man,</hi> by <hi>Tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Feeling</hi> the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:105529:96"/>
transforming and unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Souls unto
God. And Love one
another, and let nothing
be done through Strife
or Vain-glory. Learn
that <hi>Wisdom</hi> that is <hi>from
above, which is first pure,
then peaceable, gentle and
easie to be entreated, full
of mercy and good fruits,
without partiality and
without hypocrisie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for these whose
Souls have not overly
tasted of the</hi> Waters of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105529:96"/>
Life, <hi>but are vigurously
wrought upon by the</hi>
Mighty Power <hi>thereof,
seeing this</hi> Great Soul
<hi>with that</hi> Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
that are passed into
Glory, <hi>they will be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
to</hi> run with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that race, that is set
before them. <hi>Forasmuch
then as</hi> Your Labour is
not in vain in the Lord, be
ye stedfast, unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
abounding in the
Work of the Lord.</p>
            <p>It is now time to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:105529:97"/>
for I doubt not but
upon such a <hi>Speaking Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current</hi>

themselves, with such fit

as may most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
toward that End
we all ought to aim at.
So that I shall need to
say no more, but know
ye not, <hi>That there is a
