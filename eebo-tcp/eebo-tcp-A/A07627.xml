            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now all kinde of Cattle being for twentie foure miles in length, and foure in breadth, were drowned: R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kes and mowes of corne torne out of their places and carried away. Againe, the Sea hath beaten down at the foreſaid times, a great multitude of houſes, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and diſperſing the poore ſubſtance of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable perſons. So that the damage done in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid places, both in cattel and other goodes, is ſuppoſed to amount vnto the value of aboue an hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds.</p>
            <p>But alas, a man wil giue all that hee hath, ſo that his life may bee preſerued &amp; this is it which wee eſtéeme of aboue all worldly treaſures: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, as one ſaid well of olde, it being nothing but a bridle and miſerable fetter, which chaineth the pure and euerlaſting ſoule, vnto the vile, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and corruptible bodie. But ſurely there is none eyther ſo greate an Oratour, or elſe ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie an Enchaunter as life is; for it doeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs vnto the contrarie of that which wee both ſée &amp; féele: for although we know our owne frailty, and
<pb facs="tcp:10553:10"/>
that we muſt needes die, yet what wrongs, what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, what labours, &amp; what vnſpeakeable wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will men endure, rather then leaue theſe their clay houſes, wherein they are but Tenants at Will, ſubiect to be diſpoſſeſſed at Gods pleaſure. Wel, ſaide the Roman wiſe man: That ſéeing the flowers of life be but luſts and pleaſures, falſe ſhewes, ſhadowes, and vanities, the fruites thereof but labour, care, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and tediouſnes, yea the trée it ſelfe but corruption and frailety? Oh what reaſon haue men to doate vpon it? why ſhould death be ſo fearefull vnto them: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when hauing their portion in Chriſt Jeſus, they are well aſſured that their felicity is not in this life to be expected, but in the world to come. Into the which, Death is our Ferriman: and conſequently our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage: as the Scripture tearmeth him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, ſéeing life is precious, as Natures bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, left with vs by the Lord in truſt, and to be rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him, and obediently yéelded vp by vs at his pleaſure, for his glory: how happy woulde thoſe that endured the foreſaide loſſes haue thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb facs="tcp:10553:10"/>
if ſo bee that they had but eſcaped away with their liues. But poore wretches, the moſt of them were drowned, by the foreſaid invndation: not as though I did iudge them all miſerable who did die therein. For as <hi>Koper</hi> ſaith touching the flood which did ſurpriſe the olde worlde: in the firſt iudgement, wherein the tranſgreſſing Angels were to be cenſured, and in the laſt day of Aſſizes generall: onely the reprobate haue beene and ſhal be condemned, the elect ſaued. But in iudgements that fal out betwéene; neyther the elect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are preſerued, nor the reprobate onely are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And yet no doubt many of them, yea the moſt were prophane, as the reſidue of all our Countrey is, in reſpect of the multitude: for pride, gluttony, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, the very Metropolitane City of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, of vices, fornication, and all ſortes of vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the which the Lord threatneth to puniſh where he findeth them, in a feareful manner: doe euen walke vp and downe like Rulers in all places. And what ſhall I ſay concerning the contempt of the Miniſterie of the word, and the manifold wrongs continually of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb facs="tcp:10553:11"/>
euen vnto the moſt reuerend and faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the ſame. Is the couetouſneſſe of our yron hard hearted age, vnknowne to any man? doeth it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and corrupt daily more and more, both Church and Common weale among vs? hath it not ſtollen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt into euery corner, and crept wei neare into eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart, maring all where it commeth? But hee is blinde who noteth not the ſeuerall kindes of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery where practiſed: and the lying and diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion euery where vſed. In a word, ioleneſſe, one of thoſe ſinnes which cauſed <hi>Sodome</hi> to bee deſtroyed, is moſt palpably to bee noted in all ſtates and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men among vs: both in Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale: while the Cleargie doth nothing but looke for liuings, and leaue the labours of their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and the Gentry eſtéeme more of their Hawkes, Howndes, and other their vainer pleaſures, then the godly diſcharging of their offices wherein the Lord hath ſet them? And ſhal wee then imagine that they were onely good that are gone in this calamity of waters? Certainely, as I make no queſtion, but
<pb facs="tcp:10553:11"/>
God hath had his faithful ſeruants among them: ſo I doubt not, but that the greateſt part of them were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the reſt of our Nation is at this daye: lewde and prophane wretches, whom the Lord hath thus plagued, for to recall vs if it be poſſible from our filthy practiſes: leſt at once hee be prouoked to poure downe the ful vialls of his wrath vpon vs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if wee be wiſe, let other mens harmes make vs warie, leſt cuſtom in vice make it grow euen another nature to vs. Wherefore aboue all things, let vs take héed that long eſcape of puniſhment, or the vaine hope of long life do not delude vs, &amp; make vs run on ſtil into our ſins like the hard horſe into the battel: for our life is but like the Gourd of <hi>Ionas,</hi> or the pilgrimage of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> the daies whereof <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

But to return vnto our foreſaid narration.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:10553:12"/>
The foreſaid waters hauing gotten ouer their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted limittes, are affirmed to haue runne at their firſt entrance with aſwiftneſſe ſo incredible, as that no Gray-hounde coulde haue eſcaped by running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. And they yet couer twenty foure miles in length, and foure and more in breadth: which it the water were quite gone againe, be not to be recouered within the ſpace of fiue or ſixe yeares, to bee ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable ground as formerly they haue béene: yea, and there is no probabilitie that that part of the Countrey, wil euer be ſo inhabited againe in our age as it was before this floud, howſoeuer it hath heretofore bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, the richeſt and the fruitfulleſt place in all that Countrey.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the land ouerflowed with the Seuerne ſea, is valued at aboue fortie thouſand pounds by the yeare, only in the ſaid Country of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> which is yet vnder the waters, and to hee recouered againe from them at the Lords good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Further, among other matters, theſe things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as certaine truths. As that a certaine man and a
<pb facs="tcp:10553:12"/>
woman heuing taken a trée for their ſuccour, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpying nothing but death before their eyes: at laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things which were carried along in the ſtreame, perceyued a certaine Tubbe, of great large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to come néerer and néerer vnto them, vntill it reſted vppon that Tree wherein they were: Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which (as ſent vnto them by GODS pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence) committing themſelues they were carryed ſafe, vntill they were caſt vppe vppon the drie ſhoare.</p>
            <p>Againe, of a maide ceilde, not paſſing the age of foure yeares: it is reported, that the mother thereof, perceiuing the waters to breake ſo faſt into her houſe, and not being able to eſcape with it, and hauing no clothes on it, ſet it vpon a beame in the houſe, to ſaue it from being drowned. And the maters ruſhing in a pace, a little Chicken as it ſéemeth, flew vp vnto it, (it being found in the boſome of it, when <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s helpe came to take it downe) and by the heate thereof, as it is thought, preſerued the childes life in
<pb facs="tcp:10553:13"/>
the middeſt of ſo colde a tempeſt.</p>
            <p>An other little childe is affirmed to haue bene caſt vpon land in a Cradls, in which was nothing but a Catte, the which was diſcerned as it came floating to the ſhore, to leape ſtill from one ſide of the Cradle vnto the other, euen as if ſhe had bene appointed ſtereſman to preſerue the ſmall barke from the waues furie.</p>
            <p>Moreouer one Miſtreſſe <hi>Van,</hi> a gentlewoman of good ſorte, whoſe liuing was an hundred pound and better by the yeare, is auouched, before ſhe could get vppe into the higher roomes of her houſe, hauing marked the approach of the waters, to haue bene ſurpriſed by them and deſtroyed, howſoeuer, her houſe being diſtant aboue foure miles in breadth from the ſea.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe thinges in <hi>Monmouth-</hi>ſhiere, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſpecified: One Miſtreſſe <hi>Mattheus</hi> of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daffe</hi> in <hi>Glamorgin</hi> Shiere, dwelling ſome foure miles in breadth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sea, is ſaid to haue lost foure
<pb facs="tcp:10553:13"/>
hundreth Engliſh Ewes. Much corn is likewiſe there deſtroyed in that Countrey, many houſes ruinated, and many other kindes of Cattell periſhed. The number of men that are drowned, are as yet not knowne to exeéede abaoue twentie hundred. A mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude more then did, had periſhed for want of foode, and extremitie of colde, had not the right Honourable the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> ſonne and heire to the Carle of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and ſir <hi>Waltar Mountague,</hi> Knight, brother vnto the Recorder of London, who dwell neare vnto the foreſaid places, ſent out boates, (fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched tenne miles compaſſe vpon Waines) to reléeue the diſtreſſed.

And theſe are the things touching theſe foreſaid places, which haue béen deliuered as truthes vnto vs, of vndoubted veritie. And there we leaue them.</p>
            <p>As for our ſelues, ſéeing we are all of vs ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the like ſinnes that others are: and that theſe when wée dayly fall into them, doe like the bloud of <hi>Abell,</hi> ſollicite the wrath and vengeance of the Lord to be powred downe vpon vs. Let vs thinke vpon the iudgementes which God hath inflicted vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their vices, that ſo wée may be the more auerted from the like offences. Thus did <hi>Dauid</hi> doe. And the Prophet <hi>Hab:</hi> doth witneſſe, that the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous plagues which euen in a viſion hée did ſée ſhould came vpon the Chaldeans, did make him to quake and tremble: what would he haue done, it ſo be that hée had ſeene the very actuall execution of them? would not hée haue applied them vnto his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, remembring that his miſerie by nature was as great as any others? But no man-careth to knowe himſelfe and his owne deſeruings: euerie one dalighteth to marke his brethren, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, being therein like vnto thoſe <hi>Lamiae</hi> or Faicies: concerning which, <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaketh, who when they went abroad, filled their heads with
