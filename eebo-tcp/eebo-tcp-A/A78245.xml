            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE <hi>Creditors of Sr. Robert Vyner,</hi> Occaſioned by the new Subſcribed Project.</head>
            <p>THE Propoſals which are lately Subſcrib'd by Sir <hi>Robert Vyners</hi> Creditors, are, that <hi>thoſe Creditors ſhall agree to what ſhall be done by Seven Refferees, or any Three of them, And Sir</hi> Thomas Meres (who acted vigorouſly for Sir <hi>Robert Vyner,</hi> to get the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krupts Bill paſſed in 1685.) is now a Refferee, and acts very Zealouſly in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; <hi>And theſe Refferees, are to adviſe with Five Council, or any Two of them; and one of thoſe Two Council who act, is Sir</hi> Francis Pemberton, who was of Council for <hi>Sir Robert Vyner</hi> in his life-time, and is row Council for the Executor, and for that reaſon ought not to be of Council in this Caſe for the Creditors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Agreement is that the Executor ſhall have Seven thouſand pounds in Mony, when the Creditors are paid Thirty pounds per Cent. for their Principal, and then the Executor to come in as a Creditor for Three thouſand pounds more,</hi> And if the Acting Refferees, and Council, prove Friends to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, there will be many Contrivances for the Executor's benefit, but few for the Creditors; and herein is couch'd a deſign, to get all Judgments and Incumbrances, levelled with other Debts, although they have taken the due Courſe of Law, and have been at great Charges for obtaining the ſame.</p>
            <p>☞ If the Commiſſion of Bankruptcy can be renewed and proceeded upon (The Major part of the Commiſſioners the laſt time of their Sitting before Sr. <hi>Roberts</hi> Death, declaring that Sr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was not proved a <hi>Bankrupt,</hi>) Then was Sr. <hi>Roberts</hi> Will of no effect, and the Executor is onely an Intruder, and in the Laws againſt Bankrupts there are ſufficient ways and methods forthwith to compell a diſcovery from the Executor and all other perſons concerned without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Executor a Gratuity, but if a Commiſſion cannot be now taken out and proceeded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Then thoſe which have Incumbrances ought to be firſt ſatisfied, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> having made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proviſion alſo for them in his Will in theſe words, <hi>viz. <hi>Out of which the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances being firſt ſatisfied,</hi>
               </hi> &amp;c. And the Executor hath <hi>ſworn</hi> duly to execute that Will, And after the Incumbrances paid, All the Eſtate Real and Perſonal ought to go to ſatisfie the remaining Debts, and after the Debts ſatisfied, then the overpluſs to be diſpoſed of according to Sr. <hi>Roberts</hi> Will, and for a diſcovery of the Eſtates, ſeveral are already known, <hi>viz.</hi> Eſtates in <hi>London, Middleſex, Leiceſterſhire, Surry, Warwickſhire, Cheſhire,</hi> an Eſtate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and a Mortgage for a great Sum upon a Noblemans Eſtate, and it is needleſs to give any thing for diſcovery of what is already known, but as for diſcovery of what private Eſtates, what Plate, what Jewels, what Money, what Debts due to Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> which the Executor claims, or hath poſſeſſed himſelf of, the Executors Propoſal implies a great concealment, but he Proved the Will the 4th of <hi>October,</hi> 1688. And hath yet put in no <hi>Inventory,</hi> nor Anſwered any Bill in Chancery for Diſcovery, but ſtands in Contempt, and intends to make this advantage by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the law whereby to inforce the Creditors to Comply with thoſe ſtrange propoſals, it will be a fine Example and Encouragement for Executors, for the future, to keep cloſe the Teſtators Eſtate, to ſtand in contempt of the Law, and to force the Creditors to comply with their humours, but the Executor and ſeveral other perſons concerned will be quickly forced to diſcover upon Oath what Eſtates or Effects they know of Sr. <hi>Robert Vyners,</hi> and ſuch diſcovery ſhall be made publick for the general good of the Creditors, and perhaps will reach further than what will be diſcovered by their giving Ten Thouſand Pounds to the Executor: However, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all that which is already known, or ſhall be by ſuch means diſcovered, ſhall be divided; If a further Diſcovery can after be made, let ſomething in the Pound be given for ſuch further <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> but to give ſomething for nothing is very hard, or eſpecially to give ſuch a great Sum as Ten thouſand pounds for that, which about Ten pounds will procure, ſeems unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. If the Executor pretends Debts owing to him out of the Eſtate, the Statute which Sir <hi>Robert Vyner</hi> confeſſed to him, the 27th. of <hi>January</hi> 1686. for Twenty thouſand pounds, payable in Six days time is Vacated; and the Sham Incumbrances which are Charged on the Houſes in <hi>London,</hi> are already detected in Chancery: And if any ſuch Things ſhall be attempted hereafter, they will be eaſily found out.</p>
            <p>☞ There is now a Bill brought into the High Court of Parliament relating to Bankrupts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to compell Creditors to accept of ſuch an Agreement, as the Major part ſhall agree to: And the Executor of Sir <hi>Robert Vyner</hi> intends to take advantage of this Bill and deſigns thereby to compell the Creditors to make him an Allowance; The Creditors therefore of Sir <hi>Robert Vyner,</hi> ought to Petition the High Court of Parliament, that if the ſaid Bill paſs, a <hi>proviſo</hi> may be therein incerted, for Excepting the Creditors of Sir <hi>Robert Vyner;</hi> and that Sir <hi>Robert's</hi> whole Eſtate, real and Perſonal, may be diſpoſed of to Truſtees, to be by them Sold, and that the Incumbrances may be firſt paid, and the Remainder equally devided amongſt the reſt of the Creditors, and that the Overplus after the Debts ſatiſfied, may be diſpoſed to ſuch Charitable and other Uſes, as are directed by Sir <hi>Robert Vyners</hi> Will.</p>
