            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Reader.</head>
            <p>REading not long ſince in the
<hi>Lipſick Tranſlations,</hi> I
therein met with ſo Fair
a Character of this <hi>Author,</hi> and
this <hi>Piece</hi> of his, that I preſently
procured the <hi>Book;</hi> and, having
Read it over, I was ſo well pleaſed
with the <hi>Argument,</hi> and the Way
of handling it, That (having
ſome Spare-time upon my hands)
I thought it might not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeleſs Diverſion, to try
how that would appear in <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54201:3"/>
which gave me ſuch Satisfaction in
<hi>French;</hi> and which the <hi>Editors</hi> of
the <hi>Lipſick Tranſactions</hi> wiſh'd to
ſee in the <hi>German Tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A work of this Nature is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and yet ſo very difficult, that
ſeveral, who (convin't of the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it) have attempted it; yet
being Diſcouraged in the Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or elſe unfit for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
have either left us only ſome
<hi>Models</hi>-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfiniſh'd, or ſome <hi>Gothick
Platforms</hi> more agreeable to the
Barbarous Ages of Learning, than
to the State of that wherein we
Live. Some have been too Subtle
and Scholaſtical in their <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
others too groſs and material:
The one ſeem to ſuppoſe their <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
to be meer Intelligences; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Treat them, as if they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
Material: and both have
too much reſtrain'd their Rules, to
ſome particular ſorts of <hi>Studies</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:54201:3"/>
               <hi>Profeſſions.</hi> As if all Men beſides
had either no Thoughts, or were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no Obligation to order them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the beſt manner, and apply them
to the moſt proper Subjects.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> therefore thought
himſelf oblig'd to extend his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to all Mankind; and conſider
all Reaſonable Creatures (who have
Minds to Improve) as <hi>Students</hi> in
ſome ſort or other. And indeed,
ſince all Men have Thoughts, and
<hi>Study</hi> is nothing but the Attentive
Application of their Thoughts to
thoſe Objects which they are the moſt
concern'd to know; 'twould be great
Injury to the reſt of Mankind, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all, except two or three Orders
of Men, from the benefit of <hi>Studies.</hi>
Our <hi>Author,</hi> that he might not be
thus partial in a matter, where all
Perſons have an Intereſt, ſuits his
Inſtructions to all Ages, Sexes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and ways of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54201:4"/>
He <hi>Firſt</hi> Preſcribes Rules for
ſuch <hi>Studies</hi> as are abſolutely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to all ſorts of Men whatever.
Then he paſſes on to thoſe which are
proper for them, whoſe Birth and
Parts enable them to make ſome
further progreſs in Learning. In
the next place he applys himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe whoſe Condition requires
greater Improvements, than may be
requiſite for the <hi>Common Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
Afterwards he gives Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about <hi>Studies</hi> that are Curious,
as he calls them; not becauſe they
are, in no Senſe, neceſſary; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are not of ſo much uſe,
as the others before-mention'd, tho'
they be laudable and good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
Whereas thoſe which he
calls uſeleſs, are ſuch vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Curioſities, as are juſt
good for nothing at all, but to fill
the head with Superſtitious Conceits,
and Fanciful Chymera's. Laſtly,
<pb facs="tcp:54201:4"/>
He tells us how Children are to be
Inſtructed according to their ſeveral
Ages; What <hi>Studies</hi> are fit for
<hi>Women;</hi> What for <hi>Clergy-men,
Sword-men,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a ſhort View of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of his <hi>Second Part;</hi> after he
has, in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> given us an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
Account</hi> of <hi>Studies:</hi> which
may well paſs for a very Ingenious,
and Learned <hi>Eſſay</hi> upon that which
my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> calls, the <hi>Hiſtoria
Literata;</hi> and puts amongſt the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderata,</hi>
under the Title of <hi>Oculus
Polyphemi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would by no means derogate
from the Learned and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
either of the <hi>Ancients</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns,</hi>
who have Written upon this
Subject. Yet I muſt needs ſay, that
to my Apprehenſion, none ever Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it with ſuch a Judicious Cboice,
and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>naffected Gravity, as he ſeems
to have done. His Great Care is

not to make a vain ſhew and Barade
of his Learning. He Writes not
like a Man who is full of himſelf,
and poſſeſt with the troubleſom Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>Polymathy,</hi> his Buſineſs is
to give the moſt uſeful and ſolid
Advice in the plaineſt and moſt
ſimple Words. He is not too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Operoſe upon ſome Heads;
too ſcantly and defective in others:
but with an equal and ſteddy hand,
has drawn all the parts ſo, as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with one another, and ſtrengthen
the Whole. In ſhort, if I did not
think that I do Preſent the <hi>Réa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
with a <hi>BOOK</hi> of more Value,
than any thing I have yet ſeen in
this kind, I ſhould not have given
him a needleſs trouble. Several
both of former times, and of late, have
laid down many wiſe and and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Rules for the skilful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Youth; but I know no
<hi>Treatiſe,</hi> which, (in ſo ſhort a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
<pb facs="tcp:54201:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſuch a natural Method) compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
the whole Circle of Inſtruction, as
it relates both to the Scholars Studies,
and his Manners. So that I hope the
<hi>Reader</hi> will have Reaſon to Eſteem this
little Book above many others which have
been Written upon this Subject, either
with too little Judgment, or too much
Criticiſm.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be obſerved, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
takes upon him to Preſcribe
to the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> and Publick
<hi>Schools.</hi> He undertakes, not to be
a Doctor of the <hi>Chair;</hi> or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
unto thoſe Celebrated Places
of Education, whoſe Rules and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
have been Approved and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
both by Law and Cuſtom.
But, becauſe <hi>Private</hi> and <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi>
Education, has of late been ſo
much in Faſhion, and withal, uſually
ſo wretchedly managed; He thought
himſelf concerned to viſit the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
take an account of the Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
in this Matter, and do what in
<pb facs="tcp:54201:7"/>
him lay, to Redreſs them. <hi>And he
did not Intrude himſelf into
this Office, before he was called.
For, in the</hi> Preface, He tells us,
<hi>That he Compoſed this Book
at the deſire of a certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
for the Uſe of his Child.</hi>
Now ſince there is the ſame Reaſon
for ſuch kind of Treatiſes in <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
as in <hi>French,</hi> He hopes, that He
ſhall be accounted no more in our
own County, than in his own, a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
Body in other Mens Matters.</p>
            <p>But though the Book is not Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
for the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> and
<hi>Publick Schools,</hi> yet if the Tutors
of the one, and the Maſters of the
other, will Examin his Rules and
Method with Judgment and Candour;
I preſume they will ſee Reaſon to
acknowledge their Obligations to the
Author, and will not, I hope, have
much Reaſon to be offended with the
Tranſlatour. However, we do, with
ſome Aſſurance, promiſe our ſelves a
<pb facs="tcp:54201:7"/>
favourable, Reception from all thoſe
Gentlemen, who Educate their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in Private; as well as from
the Inſtructers, who ſhall take the
care of them. For I queſtion not,
but upon Experiment, it will be
found, that a Child of tolerable Parts,
Educated after this Manner, will in
a far leſs time than ordinary, to the
Joy of the Father, and Credit of the
Teacher, be better grounded in real
Learning, and more capable to uſe
it, than we commonly ſee Young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are, after they have been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Years at <hi>School,</hi> and not a few
at the <hi>Univerſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Truth, the <hi>Scheme</hi> which He
Propoſes, is Founded upon the certain
Principles of Reaſon and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and not upon the ſole Authority
of any Great Name, how Famous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
He freely inquires after the
beſt Rules, and Method of Inſtructing
Youth, not obliging himſelf to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the <hi>Syſtems</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:54201:8"/>
others, farther than he finds them
agreeable to the Dictates of Eternal
Reaſon, our Common Maſter, and
confirmed by his own particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
The Princes of <hi>Conte,</hi>
whoſe Studies he had the Honour to
Direct, as their Quality required a
more Ingenuous and Liberal way of
Education; ſo, I doubt not, but when
they came out of their Tutors Hands,
they found themſelve furniſhed with
a Morality, and a ſort of Learning,
anſwerable to their Birth; that is,
Wiſe, Generous, and Active; Built
upon the ſolid Foundations of Reaſon,
and Experience.</p>
            <p>As to the Tranſlation, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
as Faithfully as I could, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
own Rules, <hi>P.</hi> 137. not ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly,
rendering one Word for another,
but the <hi>French Idiom</hi> into the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
way of Speaking; yet, always as
near as poſſibly, preſerving his Senſe:
Excepting <hi>P.</hi> 50. where, what He calls
the <hi>Hereſie,</hi> I only Term the Doctrin
<pb facs="tcp:54201:8"/>
of <hi>Luther:</hi> Such Complements as theſe,
muſt be expected from one, who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
himſelf to be of the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Communion. We have ſome
more of them, <hi>P. 177 where he
refers to the Vulgar</hi> Latin, <hi>as the
verſion, which the Church hath
made Authentick; recommends the
knowledge of the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Tongue,
if for no other Reaſon, yet to ſilence
the</hi> Hereticks, <hi>and Adviſes his
Prieſt to Read the</hi> Trent Catechiſm,
<hi>and Council, and</hi> Romiſh Ritual.
Theſe and ſuch like Characteriſticks of
his Communion, I thought once to have
accommodated to the <hi>Engliſh Church;</hi>
as likewiſe the Honours he beſtows on
the <hi>French</hi> Nation, to our own. But
upon ſecond Thoughts, I judged it more
ſuitable with a Tranſlation, to let theſe
Paſſages go unaltered: Since the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
are in no danger of being harmed
by them; and the Wiſer will only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from them, that Cuſtom and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
in ſome things are apt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb facs="tcp:54201:9"/>
over the Judgments of the most
Reaſonable Men.</p>
            <p>To conclude, ſince Tranſlations out
of the <hi>French,</hi> have of late, been ſo
much encouraged; and to ſo good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
'tis hoped this will find ſome place
amongſt the Excellent Books we have
already received, and do ſtill expect out
of that Language. <hi>Du Pin,</hi> and <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch</hi>
have been worthily looked upon,
as Originals, in their reſpective La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
And when the Learned ſhall
have Impartially conſidered Mr. <hi>Fleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi>
Writings, they'll find him to be
one of thoſe <hi>French</hi> Writers, who (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
their peculiar <hi>Roman Shibbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth)</hi>
have Written, as if they deſign'd
to ſerve the Intereſt of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> that is, of <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>

Treat of private Studies,<note place="margin">The Deſign of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> and to give
Advice to thoſe alone, who Inſtruct
Children in Houſes, and are at liberty to
uſe what Method they ſhall think the Beſt: I have
nevertheleſs judg'd it neceſſary, Firſt, to Conſider
the courſe of Studies, which we find ſettled in the
publick Schools; to the end that we may conform
our ſelves unto them, as much as poſſible. But
to underſtand well the Order of our publick
Studies, it ſeems to me Adviſeable to go to the
Fountain-head; that ſo we may ſee whence eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part is deriv'd down to us; and how the whole
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54201:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
body of theſe Studies has been form'd in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of many Ages.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> GRammar, Rhetorick, and Philoſophy, came
from the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  </note> even the Names them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of theſe Studies import as much. From the
<hi>Greeks</hi> they paſs'd to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and from the
<hi>Romans</hi> to us. Now the <hi>Greeks</hi> had great Reaſon
to apply themſelves to theſe Three Sorts of Studies,
as they underſtood them.<note place="margin">Ariſt. Pol. L. 8. c. 3. Plato Leg. Lib. 7. p. 209.</note> By Grammar they (in
the firſt place) meant the Knowledge of Letters;
that is, the Art to Read, and Write, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Speak well. It was of great moment
to them, to know how to Read, Write, and
Speak correctly in their own Language, with
which they contented themſelves; for they Learnt
none of Strangers. Under the Name of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
they alſo comprehended the Knowledge of
the Poets, Hiſtorians, and other good Authors;
whom their Grammarians profeſs'd to explain:
And 'tis eaſie to ſee how uſeful this Study was to
them. At the Firſt, they had no other Books
but their Poets; and there they found all kind of
Inſtructions. All their Religion, and all their
Hiſtory were contain'd in them. For hitherto
they had no more certain Traditions than theſe
Fables, which now ſeem ſo Ridiculous unto us.
And as for their Religion, their Poets were their
Prophets, whom they looked upon as Friends of
the Gods, and Men inſpir'd; and for their works
they had a Reſpect not much inferiour (if I may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54201:11"/>
make the Compariſon) to that which we have for
the holy Scriptures. Moreover they found in
them Rules for the Government of themſelves;
and Lively Repreſentations of Humane Life.
And they had this Advantage, that theſe Books, ſo
full of Inſtructions, were perfectly well written:
Inſomuch that they were a divertiſement to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and beſides the Subſtance of things, they
learnt from them to Speak well, and to expreſs
their Thoughts nobly. In ſhort, all their verſes
were made to be Sung, and their moſt Ancient
Study was Muſick,<note place="margin">Plat. Rep. L. M. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoph. de nub.</note> that they might have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wherewithal to divert, and imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Innocently, at their leiſure times, by Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and playing upon Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Rhetorick and Philoſophy came later, and
began both of them much about the ſame time,
as Men of parts did differently apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
ſome ingaging in the management of
Affairs; and others, retiring from the World,
to give themſelves wholly to the ſearch of
Truth. That popular way, whereby the <hi>Greek</hi>
Common-wealths were govern'd in their publick
Aſſemblies, where all matters were carri'd by the
Votes of the People, obliged them, who deſign'd
to render themſelves powerful, either by Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Intereſt, carefully to ſeek after the Art
of perſwading the People to what they wou'd:
To this end, beſides publick Speeches, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
themſelves to the pleading particular Cauſes
before the Judges, that they might gain Friends,
and exerciſe themſelves in Speaking. Thus Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
became a ſurer means of Advancement,
than Valour, and Knowledge of War: becauſe,
a great Captain, if he did not uſe his Tongue well,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54201:12"/>
had little power in their deliberations; whereas
an Oratour, without being brave, cou'd either
form or break the neck of the greateſt enterprizes.
So that the Rhetoricians were that active ſort of
Men, whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> called Politicians. The
Speculative Men, whom they termed Sophiſts,
and afterwards Philoſophers, did at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themſelves to the Knowledge of the Nature
of things Coeleſtial, and Terreſtrial; that is to
ſay, they were Aſtronomers, and natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.
<note place="margin">Cic. Acad. quaeſt. 1. c. 4.</note> But <hi>Socrates</hi> reſolving to leave off all
purſuit after that which is without us, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himſelf wholly to that which might make
a Man better in himſelf, was chiefly concern'd
for the improving his mind, that he might reaſon
as exactly as poſſible, and govern his Life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the beſt rules this Reaſoning ſhou'd diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to him. And thus he added to Philoſophy,
two other parts, Logick, and Morality. In his
time and in the times of his firſt Diſciples, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
as well as Rhetorick, were the ſerious,
and continual imployments of Men grown up,
and form'd; and not the tranſient Studies of
young perſons. The moſt noble, and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
men thought themſelves Honour'd
thereby. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was of the Royal Race. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
was deſcended from King <hi>Codrus</hi> by his Father,
and from <hi>Solon</hi> by his Mother. <hi>Xenophon</hi> was one
of the greateſt Captains of his Age. And from
this time Learning was in ſo great Eſteem, and
became ſo much the mark of Men of Quality,
that the name <hi>Ideot,</hi> which in <hi>Greek,</hi> only ſignifies
a private Perſon, was taken for an Ignorant, and
ill Educated Man, as generally the common ſort of
People are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54201:12"/>
Among the Kings of <hi>Aegypt, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
(the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander)</hi> there were
many Grammarians, Poets, and Philoſophers.
And indeed it is very reaſonable, that in every
Country, they ſhould apply themſelves unto the
Sciences, who have moſt candor and Civility,
who being Born to good Eſtates, needing not to be
Sollicitous for the neceſſities of Life, and have moſt
leiſure, or, who being call'd to great employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
have moſt opportunity of becoming uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to others, and moſt need to inlarge their
Capacity, and Knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The <hi>Romans</hi> were inſtructed by the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
and did imitate them as much as they cou'd,<note place="margin">The Studies of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                  </note>
even to the learning their Language, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
had not been practiſed in the World.
Neither the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> nor the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> nor the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> did learn any ſtrange Language as an
help to their Studies. 'Tis true, that the <hi>Greek</hi>
was a living Language, and the Trading Tongue
of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, and all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> which
made it neceſſary for Travel, Traffick, and all
ſorts of Buſineſs. It was alſo eaſie for the <hi>Romans</hi>
to learn it, as well by reaſon of the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Greeks,</hi> both Free-men, and Slaves, who
were every where diſpers'd through <hi>Italy;</hi> as by
the Neighbour-hood of the <hi>Greek</hi> Colonies to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories.<note place="margin">Sueton. de illuſtr.</note> The <hi>Romans</hi> then had
this Study,<note place="margin">Gramm. ſub initio.</note> over and beſides what the <hi>Greeks</hi> had;
and they firſt joined Grammar thereunto, which
they learnt as the <hi>Greeks</hi> had done; that is, with
reſpect to the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue. Afterwards they
apply'd themſelves to the Latin, which then was
purify'd, fixt, and came to its perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54201:13"/>
But when the <hi>Romans</hi> began to Study, the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the <hi>Greeks</hi> were very much changed.
The Authority of the Poets was much ſunk, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the natural Philoſophers had taught the
World not to be deceived with Fables, and (with
all Men of Senſe) had diſcredited their falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<note place="margin">Lucret.</note> which had no other foundation but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Traditions, and groſs impoſtures. The
<hi>Greeks</hi> had begun to write true Hiſtories, from
the time of their Wars with the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and
they had acquired a great knowledge of Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
from the Conqueſts of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato Rep. II.III.</note> Beſides, the
<hi>Socratick</hi> Philoſophers taught a morality much pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
than that of the Poets: Yet they did not ceaſe
to be very much eſteemed, and to be looked upon,
if not as heavenly and God-like, yet, at leaſt, as
great men, and the chief Philoſophers. We find
in them every where very uſeful ſentiments,
and fair images of Nature. They were always
pleaſant to Read, to Repeat, and Sing: The
Ceremonies of Religion preſerved the uſe of
them: Their Antiquity, and the Cuſtom of
Commending them, did not a little Contribute
to the keeping up of their Credit.</p>
               <p>Rhetorick it ſelf, and Philoſophy, which then
were the moſt ſolid Studies,<note place="margin">Cic. de Orat. 11. c. 5.</note> had degenerated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Empire of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi>
Cities, even thoſe which had continued free, had
now no Affairs of great Conſequence to deliberate
upon, as before. The Orators often imploy'd
their Eloquence to flatter Princes, or elſe to make
themſelves admired. Beſides, having ſeen the great
uſefulneſs of this Art, they thought it expedient
to have it Taught to the Youth; and for this
purpoſe, they inſtituted a ſort of Maſters, whom
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54201:13"/>
they properly call'd Rhetoricians; who having not
a Genius ſufficient for true Eloquence, practiſed
this Trade, only to get a Livelihood by it.
Theſe are they, who have form'd this Art,
which is ſtill call'd Rhetorick; or at leaſt, who
have incumber'd it with that infinite number of
little precepts which we ſee in their Books.
Theſe are they, who have introduced Declamations
upon Subjects invented at pleaſure, and oft-times
very unlikely, exerciſing Youth to ſpeak without
Knowledge, only to ſhew their Wit. In ſhort,
theſe are they, who have introduc'd the falſe Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the following Ages; and thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Diſcourſes, ſo full of words, and void of things.
This Evil was chiefly ſpread in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cic. de opt. gen. Orat.</note> where the
<hi>Greeks</hi> were leſs free, and further from their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
and it was at <hi>Athens,</hi> where the true reliſh of
Eloquence and the liberal Arts were the longeſt
time preſerved.</p>
               <p>Philoſophy was become a pretence for Idleneſs,
and a continual War of unprofitable diſputes.
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was not ſatisfy'd with what was uſeful in
Logick, but carry'd the Speculation on to the
moſt minute exactneſs. He alſo apply'd himſelf
very much to Metaphyſicks, and the moſt general
Reaſonings. So many made Diſcourſes upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
and ſo few govern'd their practice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its Rules, that they render'd it Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.
For many made the profeſſion of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
only to lacquey after their little Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts;
as to make their Court to Princes, or get
Money. And they who ſought after Wiſdom
more ſeriouſly gave great offence by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of their Sects; for they treated one another
as Fools, and Mad-men. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54201:14"/>
                  <hi>Greeks</hi> in this condition, for a long time deſpiſed
Studies, as Childiſh Vanities, and Idle Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
not worthy of their pains, who altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
apply'd themſelves unto Buſineſs:<note place="margin">Cato.</note> Each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Man endeavoured to increaſe his patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
by Husbandry, Traffick, and Frugality;
and all of 'em together jointly concurr'd in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the State to flouriſh, by applying themſelves
to War, and Politicks.</p>
               <p>But though they wou'd have it believed, that
this frugality, this military Diſcipline, this firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in their Conduct, which made them ſo
powerful, were owing to none but themſelves,
and their own vertuous Reſolutions; yet their
own Hiſtory makes it appear, that they had
borrow'd much from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> even at that time,
before there were in <hi>Greece,</hi> either Oratours, or
Philoſophers by profeſſion. The firſt <hi>Tarquin</hi>
was a <hi>Corinthian</hi> by Birth, and he had inſtructed
<hi>Servius Tullius. Pythagoras</hi> lived in the time of
the latter; and it is very probable that ſome of
his Diſciples had correſpondence with the <hi>Romans,</hi>
their ſevere and frugal way of living ſo much
reſembling this <hi>Italick</hi> Philoſophy. However,
it is certain that they brought the Laws of the
Twelve Tables out of <hi>Greece;</hi> which <hi>Cicero</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
more than all the Books of the Philoſophers.
Applying themſelves with great diligence to theſe
Laws, and their Domeſtick Affairs, they form'd
a Study which was particular to themſelves, and
laſted as long as their Empire. This Study is Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law, which we do not find that any Nation
had cultivated before. Not but that the <hi>Greeks</hi>
had diligently Studied the Laws, but they did it
rather as Oratours, than Lawyers. I am not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54201:14"/>
Ignorant that they very well knew the order and
diſpoſition of them;<note place="margin">Aeſchin. in Cteſeph.</note> that they dived alſo into the
Reaſons of them; and, with good effect, apply'd
themſelves unto buſineſs, both publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.
But I do not find that they had any, who
made it their profeſſion, to explain them unto
others, and to give Counſel; nor that they wrote
Commentaries upon their Laws.<note place="margin">Cic. pro Mur.</note> For as for the
<hi>Formularies,</hi> it is certain that the <hi>Greek</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
left the care of them, to an inferiour ſort
of Men, whom they called Pragmaticks, or
Practitioners. 'Tis true, there were in <hi>Greece</hi>
Legiſlatours and Philoſophers who had ſtudied
the Laws after a more noble and extenſive
manner, ſince it muſt needs argue a greater
Genius to Compile a whole body of Laws,
than to apply them in particular to the leaſt
Affairs: And they confeſs'd that this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
ſo uſeful to the World, came to them
from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the <hi>East,</hi> as did all the reſt of their
Learning.</p>
               <p>To return to <hi>Rome:</hi> To the end of the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Age, after its foundation, Children were
then Taught only to Read, and Write, and caſt
Account. Men Studied the Laws, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularies;
<note place="margin">Horat. ep. L. 1. 2.</note> either indifferently, for their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
uſe; or more Curiouſly, to give Counſel
unto others, and gain Credit, and Reputation.
They did not begin to enter upon the Curioſities
of the <hi>Greeks</hi> ordinarily, to Learn their Tongue,
and to Read their Works,<note place="margin">Gellius. xv. c. 11.</note> till after the Second
<hi>Punick</hi> War.<note place="margin">Suet. de il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtr. gram. &amp; clar. Rhetor. ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> Hitherto there were to be ſeen

The <hi>Romans,</hi> when they apply'd themſelves to
the Studies of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> did it, according to their
own Genius; that is, they ſought therein what
was beſt, moſt ſolid, and moſt uſeful for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Life. The old <hi>Cato, Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Laelius,</hi>
were not Men, who wou'd burden themſelves
with Trifles. They Studied the Hiſtorians, and
Oratours, to profit by their Excellent Examples, and
good Maxims of the ancient <hi>Greeks;</hi> and to Learn
how to Speak as perſwaſively upon the Affairs of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Pericles</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had done, upon
thoſe of <hi>Athens;</hi> at the ſame time ſtudiouſly
avoiding to imitate the <hi>Greeks</hi> of their times, or
to take up with the Trifles of the Grammarians,
and Rhetoricians. Nay, they were even afraid of
this.<note place="margin">Cic. de Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. L. 2. ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays of the greateſt Oratours of his
time, they were fearful it ſhou'd be perceived,
that they had Studied the Books of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
leaſt it ſhou'd be thought, that they overmuch
valued them, and ſo their Reputation of being
Learned, might make their Diſcourſes to be
ſuſpected of too much artifice.</p>
               <p>The Wiſe <hi>Romans</hi> came afterwards to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
and there fix'd upon the principles and
Reaſons of Morality, and Politicks; of which
they already had much Experience, and many
Domeſtick Examples. Laſtly, they knew how
to take what was beſt in the Poets. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
ſo many great Oratours in the laſt Age of
the Republick, from the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> to <hi>Cicero;</hi> and
they alſo, who may be called the <hi>Roman</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
as <hi>Atticus, Cato</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> and <hi>Brutus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Eſtabliſhment of the Monarchy at
<hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. Dial. de corrupt. eloq.</note> having rendred great Eloquence, and the
Motives to it uſeleſs; (ſince the People did no

longer give their Votes in Publick Affairs, nor
beſtow great Places) Poetry got the upper

'Tis true, it fell ſoon afterwards, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing that was ſolid to ſuſtain it, and being
look'd upon only as a ſport, and diverſion of the
mind. Thus, within the ſpace of about Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years, the Studies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> came to be in
the ſame condition, wherein they had found thoſe
of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Every place was full of little Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians,
<note place="margin">Juven. Sat. 1.</note> Rhetoricians, and idle Declamers; of
prating Philoſophers, Hiſtorians, and Poets, who
tired the World in reciting their Works. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Civil Law was always preſerv'd, becauſe
it was always neceſſary, and depended leſs upon
the form of Government, or the particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Men. There were alſo ſome true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
though we ſhould reckon only the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and ſeveral others, of whom,
mention is made in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Epiſtles. But theſe
Philoſophers went rather for <hi>Greeks,</hi> than <hi>Romans:</hi>
The greateſt part of 'em alſo wore the <hi>Greek</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
in what Country ſoever they dwelt, and of
what Nation ſoever they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> In the mean time, a much more Sublime Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
began to be Eſtabliſhed;<note place="margin">The Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </note> I mean, the
Chriſtian Religion, which ſoon made this purely
Humane Philoſophy to vaniſh; and did yet more
ſeverely Condemn all thoſe other Studies, which
were leſs ſerious. The Principal Study of
Chriſtians, was the meditation of the Law of
God, and all the Holy Scriptures, according
to the Tradition of the Paſtours, who had faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
preſerv'd the Doctrine of the Apoſtles.
They call'd all the reſt, Strange, and Foreign
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54201:16"/>
Studies; and rejected them, as inticing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the manners of the Heathens. In Truth,
the greateſt part of their Books were either uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<note place="margin">Tert. de I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol. c. 10. &amp;c.</note> or dangerous. The Poets were the Devil's
Prophets, who breathed nothing but Idolatry,
and Debauchery; and made agreeable Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of all ſorts of Paſſions, and Villanies.
Many Philoſophers deſpiſed all Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. ep. 132. ad Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</note> and denied that there cou'd be any Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
or Prophecies. Others made great endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to Eſtabliſh Idolatry, by Allegorizing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
things, and by the Secrets of Magick.
Moreover their Morality was ſtuft with errours,
and all turn'd upon this principle of Pride,<note place="margin">Ep. 56. ad. Dioſc.</note> That
it was in Man's power to make himſelf good and
vertuous. The Oratours were full of Artifice,
Lyes, Reproaches, or Flatteris; and the moſt
ſolid Subjects of their Diſcourſes, were matters of
Buſineſs; from which the Chriſtians ſtudiouſly
deſired to Sequeſter themſelves. They believed,
that they ſhou'd have loſt the time given them
to gain Eternity, if they had imploy'd it in the
Reading Foreign Hiſtories, in Mathematical ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
and other Curioſities: And they always
ſaw in them, great danger of Vanity, a thing
inſeparable from the moſt innocent Studies. So
that the greateſt part of Chriſtians apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Labour of the Hands, and to works
of Charity towards their Brethren. Their
Schools were the Churches, where the Biſhops
daily explain'd the holy Scriptures. There were
alſo Prieſts, and Deacons, whoſe particular Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it was to Inſtruct the Catechumens, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the Diſputes againſt the Heathens. And
every Biſhop took particular Care to Inſtruct his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54201:16"/>
Clergy, chiefly the Younger ſort, who attended
continually about his Perſon, to ſerve him as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and Secretaries; to follow him, and carry
about his Letters, and Orders. And thus they
Learnt the Doctrine, and Diſcipline of the
Church, rather by Domeſtick Inſtruction, and
long uſe, than by formal, and ſet Lectures. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetheleſs,
it cannot be deny'd, but that there
were many Chriſtians, who were very Learned
in the Heathen Books, and the prophane Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But if we do well examine the matter, we
ſhall find, that the greater number of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
had Studied them before they became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
And being well vers'd therein, they knew
how to employ them to the purpoſes of Religion.
All the good they found in them, they vended
again as their own, becauſe all Truth comes from
God. They made uſe of the ſolid Maxims of
Morality, which they found diſpers'd in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
and the Philoſophers; and alſo of the remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
Examples of Hiſtory, to prepare the way
to Chriſtian Morality. On the contrary, they
took advantage from the Abſurdity of the Fables,
and Impiety of Heathen Theology, to Encounter
Paganiſm with its own Weapons; and thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
their Knowledge of Hiſtory in Diſputes
againſt the Heathens. It was with this Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Africanus</hi> Compoſed that famous Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology
from which <hi>Euſebius</hi> has taken his. It
was with this deſign, that the ſame <hi>Euſebius</hi> wrote
his <hi>Evangelical Preparation;</hi> and St. <hi>Clement</hi> of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> his Advice to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and his
<hi>Stromata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards the <hi>Arians,</hi> and other Hereticks,
(who made uſe of Philoſophy, to deſtroy the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54201:17"/>
Faith) did alſo oblige the Holy Fathers to
imploy Humane Learning to overthrow their
Sophiſms. Thus they made uſe of Prophane Books
with great Diſcretion; yet with an holy Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And therefore, when <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apostate</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
Chriſtians to Teach and Study the Books
of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that is, the <hi>Heathens,</hi> they lookt
upon this as a new ſort of Perſecution. Whence
it is plain, that at that time they profeſs'd to
Teach Humane Learning; which yet was not
permitted in the firſt Ages; if we may believe
<hi>Tertullian.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertul. de Idol. c. 10.</note> But the Reaſons which he alledges
are ceas'd ſince the Converſion of the Emperours,
and the full liberty of Chriſtianity. This happy
Change made the Philoſophers to be Neglected.
St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Witneſſeth, that in his time they
cou'd no more be heard to Diſcourſe in the <hi>Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. ad Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſc.</note> which were their proper Schools; though,
in thoſe of the Rhetoricians, ſome of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
were ſtill recited, but not taught; neither
their Books explain'd, of which even the Copies
were very rarely to be met with: That no perſon
dared to diſpute againſt the Truth, under the
Name of <hi>Stoick,</hi> or <hi>Epicurean;</hi> but that to be heard,
he was forc'd to Mask himſelf under the Name, of
Chriſtian, and to be enter'd into ſome Sect of the
Hereticks. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> did not Write this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was not well vers'd in the Writings of
the Philoſophers; for in his Youth he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
himſelf with them all: Inſomuch, that
it may be ſaid of him, that he was a perfect Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher;
ſince there never was any Man of a more
penetrating Spirit, profound Meditation, and a
more conſiſtent Reaſon. The greateſt part alſo
of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, were famous Philoſophers.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54201:17"/>
But 'tis very Remarkable, that amongſt all the
Philoſophers, Renowned in Antiquity, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
was he of whom they made leaſt uſe. They
found that he did not ſpeak worthily of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, nor of the Nature of the Soul;
that his Logick was too ſubtle, and his Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
too Low and humane; for this is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<note place="margin">Greg. Orat. 33.</note> which St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> gives of him.
And although <hi>Plato</hi> alſo has his faults, yet the
Fathers thought they cou'd make better uſe of
him; becauſe in his Writings they found more
footſteps of Truth, and more effectual means of
perſwaſion. In ſhort, 'tis evident, that if they
undervalued <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it was not becauſe they
cou'd not underſtand him, which certainly they
did, better than they who have ſince advanc'd
him ſo high.</p>
               <p>Prophane Philoſophy was decry'd, becauſe true
Philoſophers that is good Chriſtians, (and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Monks) were every where to be ſeen. That
Contempt of Honours, the Opinion of Men,
Riches, and pleaſures; That Patience in Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and hardſhips, which <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Zeno</hi> had
ſo much ſought after, and of which they had
diſcours'd ſo much, the Solitaries of theſe days
practiſed, after a much more excellent manner,
without diſputing, and without arguing. They
liv'd in perfect Tranquility, vanquiſhers of their
Paſſions, and continually united unto God. They
were troubleſome to no Man; and without writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without ſpeaking, without ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
except very rarely, they inſtructed the
whole World by their Example, and delighted
it with the fragrancy of their vertues. There is
therefore no reaſon to wonder, why they were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54201:18"/>
had in ſuch great veneration; or to judge of theſe
Ancient Monks, by thoſe that appeared before
the late Reformations, whoſe looſeneſs had cauſed
this name, ſo much honour'd by the Ancients, to
be deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>It muſt be remembred, that theſe were the
true Diſciples of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Martin,</hi>
and other Saints, whoſe Rules they practiſed,
and whoſe vertues they imitated. For the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries
were then the true Schools, where was
Taught not only Humane Learning and the
Curious Sciences, but the Chriſtian Morality
and perfection; which was taught not ſo much
by Reading, as by Prayer and real practice;
by the living Examples of the Brethren and the
Corrections of Superiours.</p>
               <p>This perfection of Monaſteries drew to them
the moſt wiſe and intelligent Men; and 'twas
often here only that ſuch perſons could be found,
as were fit for the Service and Government of
the Churches: And they who were thus drawn
out of the Monaſteries, did uſually continue the
exerciſes of the Monaſtick Life, in the ſtate of
the Prieſthood, and taught them to their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
from whence came the near Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Monaſtick Life and the Clerical;<note place="margin">Thomaſs. diſc. 2. p. l. 1. c. 30, 34, 35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>
which was ſo ordinary after the Fifth Age. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Biſhops lived in common with their Prieſts;
which made it more eaſie for them to inſtruct
them in Eccleſiaſtical knowledge; and as for
the younger Clerks, they who were not near
the perſon of the Biſhops lived with ſome holy
Prieſt, who particularly took Care of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
There were ſtill ſome prophane Schools,
where was taught Grammar ſo far as 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54201:18"/>
to write and ſpeak correctly, Rhetorick,
which daily became more affected and childiſh;
Hiſtory, which they began altogether to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
into Abridgments; Civil Law, which always
continued, becauſe it depended no more upon
Religion than the other; and the Mathematicks,
which are the Foundations of many Arts neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
unto Life.</p>
               <p>Learning ſuffer'd very much by the Ruine of
the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire, and the Eſtabliſhment of
the <hi>Northern</hi> People; ſo that there was ſcarce any
thing of it left but amongſt the Clergy and the
Monks. In Truth, excepting the Clergy there
were ſcarce any remainders of the <hi>Romans,</hi> except
Peaſants and Artificers, who were generally Slaves.</p>
               <p>The Franks and other Barbarians, did not
Study at all,<note place="margin">Maeurs des Chriſtiens n. 46.</note> and if they made any uſe of Letters
for the uſual correſpondencies of Life, it was
only of Latin: for they knew not ſo much as
how to Write in their own Language. Profane
Studies, as Philology and Hiſtory were moſt of
all neglected: It did not become Clergy-men
to buſie themſelves with them. It is well known
how ſharply St. <hi>Gregory</hi> Reproved <hi>Didier</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> becauſe he Taught Grammar.
Beſides having fewer Books, and leſs Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Studying, than in the foregoing Ages,
they betook themſelves to that which was more
neceſſary, that is to what immeadiately concern'd
Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
                  <hi>CHarlemaign</hi> who was truly great in all his
Actions,<note place="margin">The Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the <hi>Franks.</hi>
                  </note> did all that was in his power to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Re-eſtabliſhment of Learning. He
drew together from all quarters the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54201:19"/>
Men, by Honour and Rewards. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Studied too. He ſetled Schools in the Chief
Cities of his Empire, and even in his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace;
which was like a walking City. It appears
by many Articles of the Capitularies what was
Taught therein. For it is recommended to the
Biſhops, (who by the Duty of their place are
concern'd to provide for the Inſtruction of Youth,)
that they ſhou'd take Care that Children were
Taught Grammar, Singing, Caſting Account,
or Arithmetick. (It may be ſeen in <hi>Bede's</hi> Works
who Lived Sixty Years before) wherein their
Studies and all the liberal Arts did conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Grammar was then neceſſary, becauſe Latin
was altogether Corrupted, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
Ruſtick; as the Vulgar Language whence
the <hi>French</hi> is Derived was termed. This Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
I ſay, was nothing but an uncertain and
monſtrous Jargon, which Men were aſhamed to
write or uſe in any ſerious Buſineſs. As for the
<hi>German</hi> Language which was that of the Prince
and of all the <hi>Franks,</hi> it began to be Written
and to be uſed in ſome Tranſlations of the holy
Scriptures; and <hi>Charlemaign</hi> himſelf made a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
for it: The Singing which was taught, was
that of the Eccleſiaſtical Office, reformed at this
time according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cuſtom; and
thereunto were joined ſome Rules of Muſick.
Calculation or Computation ſerved for the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out on what day <hi>Eaſter</hi> was to be kept, and
for the Regulating the Year; It comprehended
alſo the moſt neceſſary Rules of Arithmetick,
by all which it appears, that theſe Studies were
only for thoſe who deſign'd for the Clergy:
Thus all Lay perſons were either the Noblemen
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54201:19"/>
who concern'd themſelves in nothing but War, or
the Commonalty buſied in Husbandry and Trades.
<hi>Charlemaign</hi> was careful to diſperſe all over his
Territories that Code of the Canons which he
received from <hi>Pope Adrian,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, and
other Laws of all the People under his Obedience,
whereof he made new Editions. He had a great
many ancient Hiſtories; and he was ſo curious,
as to cauſe the Verſes which preſerved the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the brave Actions of the <hi>Germans</hi> to be
Written, and put together. Thus, together
with the Holy Scriptures, and Fathers of the
Church, then very well known, he furniſhed his
Subjects with all things neceſſary for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
And if Men had gone on to have
Studied according to this Platform, and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had been more ingaged in the purſuits of
Learning, the <hi>French</hi> might eaſily have attain'd
and perfected that Knowledge which is moſt
uſeful for Religion, for Policy, and for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Conduct of Life; which things ought, in
my Opinion, to be the end of Studies.</p>
               <p>But curioſity which has always been injurious
to Learning, inſinuated it ſelf into Study from
this time: Many Studied <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<hi>Aſtrological Predictions.</hi> There were ſome,
who, in order to Write good <hi>Latin,</hi> did ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
Criticize upon the Words and Phraſes of
ancient Authors. The greateſt miſchief was,
that the <hi>Monks</hi> enter'd upon theſe Curioſities,
and began to value themſelves upon their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to the prejudice of their Hand-labour,
and ſilence, which hitherto had been ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to them. The Court of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nair</hi>
was full of them, and no buſineſs paſs'd in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54201:20"/>
his Court, wherein they had not a ſhare. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the State falling into the greateſt Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
by the ſudden fall of the Houſe of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maign;</hi>
Studies alſo fell with it, all at once. In
the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald,</hi> Publick Acts are
to be ſeen even of the <hi>Capitularies,</hi> Written in
a ſort of <hi>Latin,</hi> altogether Barbarous, without

ſo ſcarce, that <hi>Lupus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ferrier,</hi> ſent as far
as <hi>Rome</hi> to receive from the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Works of
<hi>Cicero</hi> to Copy over, which at preſent are ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
common; inſomuch, that when the little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Wars and Ravages of the <hi>Normans,</hi> had
taken away the Liberty of Travel, and broken
off Commerce, Studies became very difficult;
I mean, to the <hi>Monks</hi> themſelves, and the Clergy;
as for others, they never Dream'd of them, beſides,
they had more preſſing buſineſs to diſpatch: They
were often forc'd to remove in diſorder,<note place="margin">Moeurs Chriſtiens. n. 48.</note> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Reliques with them, to ſave them from
the Fury of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> abandoning their
Houſes and Churches to them, or elſe the <hi>Monks</hi>
and <hi>Clergy</hi> were neceſſitated to take up Arms in
defence of their Lives, and to hinder the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation
of the Holy Places. In ſuch great
Extremities, it was as eaſie for them to loſe their
Books, as 'twas difficult to Study them, and
Write new Copies of them. Nevertheleſs, there
were ſome preſerved, there being always ſome
<hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Monk</hi> remarkable for his Learning.
But wanting Books and Maſters, they Studied
without choice, and without any other direction,
than the example of their Predeceſſors. Thus it
is Recorded of St. <hi>Abbo,</hi> the Abbot of the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictins</hi>
upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> in the time of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54201:20"/>
that he had Studied <hi>Logick, Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy;</hi>
and that afterwards he betook himſelf to
the Study of the Holy Scripture, and the Canons,
and to Collect paſſages out of the Fathers.</p>
               <p>From this time, as the Royal Authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Re-eſtabliſhed, and Hoſtilities began to
ceaſe, Studies alſo revived; ſo that, in the time of
<hi>Philip</hi> I. about the Year 1060. Men famous for
their Learning, were to be ſeen in ſeveral Churches
of <hi>France.</hi> There were likewiſe ſome Schools in
the <hi>Cathedrals,</hi> as there were in the <hi>Monaſteries;</hi>
where there were Schools within for the <hi>Monks,</hi>
and without for the <hi>Seculars.</hi> They Studied as
before, Divinity, the Fathers of the Church, the
<hi>Canons, Logick,</hi> the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> Thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
during the following Age, always advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and perfecting themſelves, as we ſee by the
Writings of <hi>Ivo</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> the Maſter of the
Sentences, <hi>Gratian,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and other Authors
of the ſame time, whoſe Stile and Method is ſo
different from later Schoolmen.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the firſt of theſe School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
followed them ſo near, that the Change
muſt needs have happened in the time of theſe
great Men; that is to ſay, about the end of the
Twelfth Age: And I can find out no other Cauſes
of it, but the Knowledge of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and
the imitation of their Studies. The <hi>Jews</hi> were
they, who imitated them firſt: They Tranſlated
their Books into <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and there being then
<hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and all over <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> the
Books which they had Tranſlated into <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
were render'd in Latin. Some of them might
be received even from the <hi>Arabians</hi> themſelves,
with whom the Communication was eaſie, by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54201:21"/>
the Neighbourhood of <hi>Spain,</hi> (of which, they
as yet held more than half) and by the Travels
of thoſe, who went upon the <hi>Croiſado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> THe Vulgar Opinion, that all <hi>Mahometans,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtinction,<note place="margin">The Studies of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians.</hi>
                  </note> did always profeſs Ignorance,
is a great miſtake. They had an incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men, Famous for their Learning, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
many of the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> and
they have written enough to fill large Libraries.
Four Hundred Years before the Twelfth Age (of
which I ſpeak) they had diligently given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Study, and Learning was never at ſo great
an height with them, as when it was at the loweſt
with us; that is, in the tenth and eleventh Ages.
Theſe <hi>Arabians,</hi> I mean, all thoſe who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>Muſulmen,</hi> of what Nation, or Country ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
had two kinds of Study, the one proper to
themſelves, the other taken from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who
were Subject to the Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their particular Studies, were in the firſt
place, their Religion, that is, the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> the
Traditions which they attributed to <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
and his firſt Diſciples; the Lives of their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Saints, and the Stories which they relate of
them; the Caſes of Conſcience upon the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
part of their Religion, as Prayer, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
Faſting, Pilgrimage; and their Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Theology, which contains ſo many Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
about the attributes of God upon predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
the Judgment, the Succeſſion of Propheſie,
whence proceed ſo many Sects amongſt them,
who treat one another as <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others Studied the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and its Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
rather as <hi>Lawyers</hi> than <hi>Divines,</hi> to find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54201:21"/>
Rules for the management of Affairs, and the
Deciſion of differences: For this Book is their
only Law, even in Temporals. Others apply'd
themſelves unto <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> which had been very
carefully Written from the beginning of their
Religion, and their Empire, and has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
down ever ſince. But they were very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of ancient Hiſtories, deſpiſing all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
who lived before <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and calling all
that time the time of Ignorance, becauſe their
Religion was not known. They contented
themſelves with the <hi>Arabian Antiquities,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Works of their ancient <hi>Poets,</hi> which
to them ſerved inſtead of the Hiſtory for thoſe
times; wherein (it can't be denied) they have
followed the ſame Principle which the Old
<hi>Greeks</hi> did, of improving their own Traditions,
how Fabulous ſoever. But it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
alſo that their Poetry never had any Beauty,
but what was very Superficial, as flaſhy Thoughts,
and bold Expreſſions. They never apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to that ſort of Poetry which conſiſts in
imitation, and is moſt proper to move the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and that, perhaps, which made them avoid
it, was the deſpicable Opinion they had of
thoſe Arts, which any wiſe related thereunto;
as <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Sculpture,</hi> which their hatred of
<hi>Idolatry</hi> made them abhor. Moreover, their
<hi>Poets</hi> were uſeful for the Study of the <hi>Arabick</hi>
Tongue, which then was the Language of the
Maſters, and moſt of the People of all this
great Empire; and ſtill at this Day, is the
common Language of the greateſt part, and
every where the Language of the <hi>Religion.</hi>
They Studied it chiefly in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54201:22"/>
to learn it by Converſation with the Living:
The moſt Curious went from all Parts to the
Province of <hi>Irac,</hi> and particularly to the City
<hi>Baſſora,</hi> which was to them what <hi>Athens</hi> was
to the ancient <hi>Greeks:</hi> And there being then
powerful Princes in <hi>Perſia,</hi> many things were
Written in their Language, which have been
much improved ſince. Theſe are the Studies
proper to the <hi>Muſulmen,</hi> and were as ancient as
their Religion.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which they had received from the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> were later by Two Hundred Years; for
it was about the Year 820. when the <hi>Calif
Almamon</hi> deſired of the Emperour of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
the beſt Greek Books, and cauſed them to
be Tranſlated into <hi>Arabick.</hi> Nevertheleſs, it
doth not appear that they ever Studied the
<hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; it was ſufficient to make them
deſpiſe it, becauſe it was the Language of their
Enemies: Beſides, there were ſo many Chriſtians
in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> who underſtood both <hi>Arabick</hi>
and <hi>Greek,</hi> that they could not want Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and theſe Chriſtians Tranſlated the <hi>Greek</hi>
Books into <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> for themſelves,
and for the <hi>Muſulmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Greek</hi> Books, there were a great
many which were of no uſe to the <hi>Arabians;</hi>
they could not ſee the Beauty of the Poets in a
ſtrange Language, and with a genius ſo quite
different from them: Add this further, that their
Religion would not permit them to Read them;
they had ſuch an horrour of Idolatry, that
they did not think it lawful to pronounce ſo
much as the names of the <hi>falſe Deities:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſo many Millions of Volumes which they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54201:22"/>
have Written, you ſhall ſcarce find one which
mentions them. They were very far from Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
all thoſe Fables, about which our modern
<hi>Poets</hi> have been ſo Curious, and the ſame Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
might reſtrain them from reading Hiſtories;
beſides, that they deſpiſed, as I have already ſaid,
all that was older than <hi>Mahomet.</hi> As for <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>
and <hi>Policy</hi> which were brought forth, and
nouriſh'd in the moſt free Commonwealths; the
Form of the <hi>Muſulmen's</hi> Government gave them
no occaſion to make uſe of them. They lived
under an Empire abſolutely deſpotick, where
they were not to open their Mouths but
to Flatter their Prince, and Extol every
Thought of his, and where they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
for that which might conduce to the
advantage of the State, or to the Art of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading,
but how to obey the Will of their
Maſter.</p>
               <p>So that there were no Books of the Ancients
which were uſeful to them, but thoſe of <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi>
of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they neither ſought after <hi>Policy</hi> nor <hi>Eloquence,
Plato</hi> was not for them; beſides, to underſtand
him, the Knowledge of the <hi>Poets,</hi> the Religion
and Hiſtory of the <hi>Greeks</hi> was neceſſary. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
with his <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> was more
proper for them, and accordingly they Study'd
him with incredible earneſtneſs and diligence.
They alſo apply'd themſelves to his Phyſicks,
chiefly to Eight Books, which contain nothing
but Generals: For natural Philoſophy, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
which requires Obſervations and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
was not ſo ſuitable to them. They did
not omit to Study <hi>Medicks</hi> very cloſely; but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54201:23"/>
they founded it chiefly upon the general notions
of the four <hi>Qualities,</hi> and the four <hi>Humours,</hi> and
upon the Tradition of <hi>Medicines,</hi> which they
had not at all examin'd, and which they mixed
with an infinite number of Superſtitions. As
to other parts of it, they did not in the leaſt
improve Anatomy which they had received
from the <hi>Greeks</hi> very imperfect: 'Tis true, that
we owe <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> to them, which they have
carry'd very far, if not invented, but they have
mingled therewith all thoſe corruptions which
we can yet hardly ſeparate therefrom; vain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
extravagant Reaſonings, ſuperſtitious Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and all thoſe fond things which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
nothing but Montebanks and Impoſtors.
From <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> they paſſed eaſily to <hi>Magick,</hi> and
and all ſorts of <hi>Divinations</hi> with which Men ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
take up, when they are ignorant of natural
Philoſophy, Hiſtory, and true Religion, as
we have ſeen by the example of the ancient
<hi>Greeks.</hi> That which wonderfully aſſiſted them in
theſe Illuſions, was <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> which was the chief
aim of their <hi>Mathematical</hi> Studies. In truth,
this pretended Science has been ſo much culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
under the Empire of the <hi>Muſulmen,</hi> that
Princes took delight therein; and upon this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
ordered their greateſt Enterprizes. The
<hi>Calif Almamon</hi> did himſelf Calculate Aſtronomical
Tables, which were very famous; and it muſt be
confeſs'd that they were very ſerviceable for his
Obſervations, and other uſeful parts of <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi>
as <hi>Geometry</hi> and <hi>Arithmetick.</hi> We owe
to them <hi>Algebra,</hi> and the way of <hi>Cyphering</hi> by
<hi>Multiplying</hi> by <hi>Ten,</hi> which has render'd the <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical
Operations</hi> ſo eaſie. As for <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54201:23"/>
had the ſame advantages, which excited the
ancient <hi>Egygtians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
thereto, ſeeing they Inhabited the ſame
Country: And moreover, they had all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of the Ancients, and all thoſe which
the <hi>Greeks</hi> had added unto them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arabians,</hi> who made it their buſineſs to
Study their Religion, were not only no Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
but their declared Enemies, and decry'd
them as an impious ſort of Men, and Enemies
to their Religion. Indeed it was no difficult
matter for any, who could but reaſon in any
degree, to deſtroy the foundation of a Religion
which was built, neither upon Reaſon nor any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a Divine Miſſion. The Philoſophers there
fore being excluded from the Functions of Religion,
and other profitable Imployments, ſought the more
after Reputation; and they endeavour'd to get
it, either from the Names of the Maſters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whom they had Studied, or from their great
Travels, or from the ſingularity of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
A Learned Man in <hi>Spain,</hi> was always much
more Learned in <hi>Perſia,</hi> or <hi>Coraſan;</hi> and there
was a wondrous Emulation betwixt them, each
of them Zealouſly affecting to diſtinguiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by ſome new <hi>Logical</hi> or <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> ſubtilty.
And this ſame Humour run through all their
Studies, and all their Works. They apply'd
themſelves only to that which ſeemed moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
moſt rare, and moſt difficult; for this
end, diſreguarding Pleaſure, Convenience, and
even profit its ſelf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Franks,</hi> and other Latin Chriſtians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> only what the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
had taken from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that is, the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54201:24"/>
of <hi>Ariſtotle, Medicks</hi> and <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarding
their <hi>Language,</hi> their <hi>Poetry,</hi> their <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,</hi>
and their <hi>Religion,</hi> as the <hi>Arabians</hi> had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
thoſe of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But what is moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing,
is, That our Learned Men did little
leſs than the <hi>Arabians,</hi> neglect the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue,
ſo uſeful for the Study of Religion. For it was
not before the beginning of the Fourteenth Age,
that it was, that the Languages might very much
contribute to this end, chiefly in order to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> It was with
this deſign, that the Council of <hi>Vienna</hi> held in the
Year 1315. ordered that Profeſſours, for the <hi>Greek,
Arabick</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſhould be Eſtabliſhed, which
yet was not put into Execution till a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
Men did not begin to Study <hi>Greek</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the end of the Fifteenth Age; <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the
beginning of the Sixteenth; and <hi>Arabick</hi> in our
Age. Hitherto there were but ſome few curious
Perſons, who apply'd themſelves thereto, and they
ſeldom beſtow'd their pains upon Books of Hiſtory
which would have been moſt uſeful.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> TO return to the Twelfth Age. They who
Studied then,<note place="margin">The Studies of the Schoolmen, or thoſe which were Scholaſtick.</note> were not at all concerned to be
curious in Languages, not ſo much as in <hi>Latin,</hi>
which they uſed for their Studies, and in all
Affairs of Moment? But I cannot accuſe them
for this, but the unhappineſs of the Times. The
Incurſions of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and the particular
Wars which yet continued, had made Books ſo
ſcarce, and Studies ſo difficult, that they were
forc'd firſt to Labour in that which was of
moſt importance. There was, as yet, no Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and there were ſcarce any but <hi>Monks</hi> who
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54201:24"/>
could Write; and they were fully imploy'd in
Writing <hi>Bibles, Pſalters,</hi> and ſuch-like Books for
the uſe of Churches. They Write alſo ſome
Works of the Fathers, as they fell into their
Hands, ſome Collections of Canons, and ſome
Formularies of Acts, which were moſt ordinary
in tranſacting buſineſs: For 'twas to them Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
was made to cauſe them to be Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and 'twas from amongſt them or the Clergy
that Princes had their Notaries and their Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours;
they had ſcarce any time to Tranſcribe
the Prophane Hiſtories, and the Poets. 'Tis
true, that the Knowledge of Languages and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,
is neceſſary to underſtand the Fathers
well, and even Scripture it ſelf; but either they
did not apprehend it to be ſo, or elſe the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
difficulty of attaining this Knowledge
through the want of <hi>Dictionaries, Gloſſaries, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries;</hi>
and the ſcarceneſs of the Text it ſelf,
made them loſe all hopes of it.</p>
               <p>Hence it was, that they who would ſuperadd
any thing to the meer reading of the Scripture,
and the Fathers, did it only by Reaſoning and
Logick; as St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Sophiſt,</hi> the firſt Author
of the <hi>Nominals,</hi> who lived in the time of
<hi>Hen.</hi> I. and his followers, <hi>Arnold</hi> of <hi>Laon, Roſcelin</hi>
of <hi>Compeign,</hi> Maſter <hi>Abalard.</hi> This way of
Philoſophizing upon Words and Thoughts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
examining things in themſelves, was moſt
certainly a good expedient to eaſe themſelves of
the Knowledge of Matter of Fact, which is
not to be attained but by reading; and it was
an eaſie way to confound the ignorant Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
by a ſingular way of ſpeaking, and by vain
ſubtilties. But theſe ſubtilties were dangerous,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54201:25"/>
as it appeared by <hi>Berengarius, Abalard,</hi> and <hi>Gilbert</hi>
of <hi>Poirée.</hi> This is the Reaſon why the wiſeſt
Perſons, as St. <hi>Anſelm, Peter</hi> of <hi>Blois,</hi> and St.
<hi>Bernard,</hi> firmly reſolved to follow the Example of
the Fathers, rejecting theſe new Curioſities:
And the Maſter of the Sentences, giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
more liberty, made fome falſe ſteps.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Books of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> came
to be known, as I have ſaid, and whether for
the Diſputes againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> or for
ſome other Reaſon, I know not; the Divines
thought they had need of them, and therefore
did accommodate them to our Religion; whoſe
Doctrines and Morality they Explain'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Principles of this <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> This
was done by <hi>Albertus Magnus, Alexander Hales,</hi>
St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and many others after them: And
their Method of Divinity may be reckoned the
third, for there are two more ancient. The
<hi>Firſt</hi> was that of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
who <hi>Studied the Holy Scripture immediately,</hi> chiefly
drawing from thence the Knowledge which
was neceſſary for the inſtruction of the Faithful,
and the refutation of the Hereticks; this <hi>Theology</hi>
continued till towards the Eighth Age. The
<hi>Second</hi> was that of <hi>Bede,</hi> of <hi>Raban,</hi> and others
of the ſame time, who not being able to add
any thing to the Inſtructions of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
contented themſelves with Copying them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Collections and Extracts out of them,</hi> and taking
<hi>Gloſſes</hi> and <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon the Scripture out of
them alſo. The <hi>Third</hi> was that of the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
who handled the <hi>Doctrin of the Scripture,
and the Fathers, by the Form and Inſtruments of</hi>
Logick <hi>and</hi> Metaphyſicks, <hi>drawn from the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:54201:25"/>
                  <hi>of</hi> Ariſtotle:<note place="margin">Perr. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char.</hi> C. M. c. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>And thus Cardinal</hi> Perron <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſame time the Studies of <hi>Civil Law</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks</hi>
were revived, but it was impoſſible then to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Civil Law</hi> well ſince they wanted Laws. The
<hi>Roman Laws,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Barbarous Laws</hi> which had
been obſerved under the two firſt Races of our
Kings,<note place="margin">V. Hiſt. de droit <hi>Franc.</hi>
                  </note> were aboliſhed by contrary Cuſtoms, or
by Forgetfulneſs and Ignorance. They were
not in a Condition to make new Laws, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as yet, they had not Re-eſtabliſh'd the
Foundations of Civil Society; the liberty of
Travel, the ſecurity of Trade and Induſtry, the
Union of the Citizens, the Common People were
either Slaves, or look'd upon as ſuch: The Nobles
lived diſpers'd, and Cantonized every one in his
Caſtle, with his Arms always in his Hand. There
were no other Laws in <hi>France,</hi> but unwritten
Cuſtoms, very uncertain, and very different, by
reaſon of the prodigious number of Lords, in
whoſe power it was to give Law. It is true,
that in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Books of the <hi>Juſtinian Law</hi>
were recovered, and it began publickly to be
Taught at <hi>Montpelier</hi> and <hi>Tholouſe.</hi> But theſe Laws
were not Laws for us, becauſe the <hi>Gauls</hi> had been
freed from the <hi>Roman-Yoke,</hi> before <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was
in the World. Furthermore, they were not
able to underſtand them, by reaſon of Ignorance
of Languages and Hiſtory; there not being any

practice of our Courts, for Six Hundred Years
after they were Written. They did not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
omit to Study, and apply them as they

a great deal of Authority by the great Name of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54201:26"/>
                  <hi>Roman Law,</hi> and by the extream neceſſity there
was of ſome Rules in judicial proceedings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Law</hi> was not in ſuch an ill
condition. The practice of the Canons was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
though Diſcipline began to be remiſs.
There were many Collections of ancient Canons;
amongſt others, that of <hi>Gratian,</hi> who lived in the
middle of the Twelfth Age. 'Tis true, they
were not very Correct, and they were intermixt
with many paſſages of the Fathers, which ought
not to have the force of Laws, together with
the Decretals Fathered upon the firſt <hi>Popes,</hi> which
at laſt have been own'd to be <hi>Suppoſitious.</hi> This
Example makes it appear, of how great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it is, for the preſerving Tradition in its Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that there be always in the Church, Perſons
who are skill'd in Languages and Hiſtory, and
who are well vers'd in critical Learning.</p>
               <p>

Hitherto it had been in the Hands of the <hi>Jews;</hi>
excepting ſome Secrets of Old Women, and ſome
Traditions of Receipts, which were preſerved in
Families. The firſt Books which they Studied, were
thoſe of the <hi>Arabians;</hi> and amongſt others, the
Writings of <hi>Meſua</hi> and <hi>Avicenna.</hi> They received
their Fooleries and Superſtitions; and in the

and they conſulted them alſo for the knowledge
of <hi>Plants.</hi> As there were none but the <hi>Clergy</hi> and the
<hi>Monks</hi> who Studied, ſo there were none but they
who were <hi>Phyſicians. Fulbert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chartres,</hi>
and the Maſter of the Sentences, Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi>
were <hi>Phyſicians. Obizo,</hi> one of the Religious of
St. <hi>Victor,</hi> was <hi>Phyſician</hi> to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Groſs: Rigord,

This Council ſpeaks only of thoſe <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
who were profeſs'd; and <hi>Medicks</hi> ceaſed not

Years after. But it being never permitted
to the <hi>Clergy</hi> to ſhed Blood, nor to keep a Shop
of Ware: This might probably be the cauſe of
the diſtinguiſhing <hi>Phyſicians</hi> from <hi>Chyrurgeons,</hi> and
<hi>Apothecaries.</hi> This diſtinction has for a long time
kept <hi>Phyſicians</hi> in the Speculation only, without
applying themſelves to Experiments.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> THus all Studies were reduc'd to four ſorts or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.

Studies, which were accounted neceſſary to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
unto theſe higher Studies, which were called by
the general Name of the Arts. Doubtleſs Reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that Men ſhould Study what is moſt uſeful:

               <p>For a long time there had been about the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

for the <hi>Young Clergy,</hi> to whom <hi>Grammar, Singing,</hi>

was either the <hi>Chanter</hi> of the <hi>Cathedral,</hi> or the
<hi>Ecolatrés,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Capiſcol,</hi> that is, the
Head of the School. The other School was

whom the Biſhop himſelf, or ſome Prieſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned

theſe four principal Studies, (which were

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity:</hi> To denote that in one
City alone, all things were Taught which were
uſeful to know. This Eſtabliſhment ſeemed ſo
conſiderable, that the <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> favoured
it with great Privileges. Perſons came to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at <hi>Paris</hi> from all Parts of <hi>France, Italy, Germany,</hi>

and thus the private Schools of <hi>Cathedrals</hi> and
<hi>Monaſteries</hi> came to be neglected: Let us ſee more
particularly what was Taught in each Faculty.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> UNder the Name of Arts, were comprehended

                  <note place="margin">The Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Acts.</note> the <hi>Mathematicks</hi>
and <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> But to ſpeak properly, this Name
ought only to comprehend the Seven Liberal Arts,
of which we find Treatiſes in <hi>Caſſiodore</hi> and <hi>Bede,</hi>
viz. <hi>Grammar, Rhetorick, Logick, Arithmetick, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,

ſhould be one, capable to teach all theſe. For
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54201:27"/>
                  <hi>Grammar,</hi> they read <hi>Priſcian, Donatus;</hi> or ſome

                  <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, rather to acquaint the <hi>Roman</hi>
of their Times, (to whom it was natural) with
its utmoſt Niceties, than to teach its Elements to
Strangers.</p>
               <p>In the Thirteenth Age, <hi>Latin</hi> was no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in Common uſe, amongſt the People, in any
place of the World; and in <hi>France</hi> the ordinary
Tongue was that which we ſee in <hi>Ville-hardoüin,</hi>
in <hi>Joinville,</hi> and other <hi>Romancers</hi> of the ſame
time. It ſeems to me, that they ought to have
apply'd the Art of <hi>Grammar</hi> to this Language,
chuſing the moſt proper Words, and the moſt
natural Phraſes, fixing the inflexions, and giving
Rules for <hi>Conſtruction</hi> and <hi>Orthography.</hi> The <hi>Italians</hi>
did ſo; and about the end of the ſame Age,
there were ſome <hi>Florentines</hi> who Studied to Write
well in their Vulgar Tongue; as <hi>Brunetto Latini,
John Villani,</hi> and the Poet <hi>Dante.</hi> As for our
Language, it was not purified, but by Time;
and they did not ſet upon it, by publick order in
the <hi>French Academy,</hi> till Four Hundred Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Inſtitution of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities.</hi> 'Tis true, that
<hi>Latin</hi> was ſtill neceſſary for the reading of good
Books, and the Exerciſe of Religion; and they
who Studied at that time, were all Church-men.
<hi>Latin</hi> alſo was neceſſary for buſineſs, and for
publick Acts; and ſo it was for Travel, ſo
that Interpreters were called Latinizers. It was
therefore impoſſible to be without <hi>Latin;</hi> but it
was alſo impoſſible to Eſtabliſh the ancient puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it, by reaſon of ſcarcity of Books, and
upon other accounts, which I have obſerved.
They were forc'd to be contented with ſpeaking,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54201:28"/>
and Writing it meanly. They made no ſcruple
of mixing therewith many Barbarous Words, and
to follow the Phraſe of the Vulgar Tongues;
they were ſatisfied with barely obſerving the <hi>Caſes,
Numbers, Genders, Conjugations,</hi> and Principal Rules
of <hi>Syntax.</hi> To this they wholly reduc'd the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Grammar,</hi> looking upon all the reſt as an
unprofitable Curioſity, ſeeing Men ſpeak only to
be underſtood; and a more Elegant ſort of <hi>Latin</hi>
would have been more hardly underſtood. And
thus that Barbarous <hi>Latin</hi> came to be formed,
which has ſo long been uſed in the Palace;
which is with difficulty corrected in the Schools;
and which is ſpoken yet in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi>
for the convenience of Travel. Thence comes
the neceſſity of <hi>Gloſſes</hi> and <hi>Commentaries,</hi> for the
Explication of the ancient Books, Written in a
pure Style.</p>
               <p>Poetry conſiſted only in knowing the meaſure
of <hi>Latin</hi> Verſe, and the quantity of Syllables;
for they went not ſo far as to diſtinguiſh the
Characters of Compoſures, and the difference
of Styles. This appears by the Poems of <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Breton,</hi> which are only meer
Hiſtories of a flat Style, and as bad <hi>Latin</hi> as that
wherein they wrote in Proſe. To the reſtraint
of quantity and cuttings off, they added that of
Rhimes which made their <hi>Leonine</hi> Verſes; and
often neglecting even quantity; they only made
ſimple Rhimes in <hi>Latin</hi> as in <hi>French,</hi> and this was
that which they called the Church <hi>Hymns;</hi> this
was all the Poetry of Men which were ſerious.
As for the Vulgar Poetry, which began to be in
requeſt about the Twelfth Age (as may appear
by ſo many Romances and Ballads,) it ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54201:28"/>
the peculiar Talent of Debauchees and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines.
Such generally were the Country <hi>Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badours,</hi>
and other Poets of this time, who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Courts of Princes. In the mean time it
muſt be confeſs'd, that ſeveral of them were Men
of Wit, and (conſidering the time) of Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
alſo; yet their Works were full of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Love, and Extravagant Fictions. From this
time they continued more and more to ſeparate
the pleaſure of Diſcourſe, from reaſoning and
ſolid Studies; and this is that which made <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi>
neglected in the Schools; for there they
were not ſolicitous, either to pleaſe, or to move
the Paſſions.</p>
               <p>They chiefly apply'd themſelves to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and they believed, that it needed no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of Language, or any Figure of Diſcourſe.
Thus endeavouring to render it Solid and Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical,
they made it very dry and ungrateful; not
conſidering, that a Natural and Figured Diſcourſe,
ſpares a great many Words, and helps the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by the lively Images it imprints upon the
Mind. In the mean time, there being no Study
without Curioſity and Emulation: Our Learned
Men, did as the <hi>Arabians</hi> had done, either through
imitation, or by the ſame principle, and ſtuff'd
their Philoſophy with an infinite number of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
more ſubtle than ſolid, falling ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
of the Idea of the ancient <hi>Graecians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Logick of <hi>Socrates,</hi> which we ſee in <hi>Plato</hi>
and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> was an Art of ſeriouſly ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Truth, and he call'd it the <hi>Dialectick Art,</hi>
becauſe this ſearch cannot be well made, but by
Converſation betwixt two Perſons, both careful
to reaſon well. This Art then conſiſted in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54201:29"/>
rightly to every Queſtion in making exact
Diviſions, in well defining Words and Things,
and attentively weighing every Conſequence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'twas granted, without being in an Heat,
without fearing to be overcome, and to confeſs
their Errours; and without deſiring (through
Prejudice, or any By-reſpects) that one propoſition
ſhould be true, rather than another. So that in
this Logick, Morality enter'd, and Eloquence
found a Place. For ſince Men are uſually Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate,
or prevented with ſome Errour, their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
muſt firſt be calm'd, and their Prejudices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
before Truth be propoſed, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this preparation, would only offend them.
Now, this Method requires marvellous Diſcretion
and Addreſs, for Men to accommodate themſelves
to the infinite variety of Minds, and their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers:
And this is that which we admire in
<hi>Plato.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſt.</hi> Ret. 1.</note> 'Tis upon this Foundation, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
Parallels <hi>Logick</hi> with <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> and ſays, that both
the one and the other has the ſame Deſign, which
is to perſwade by Diſcourſe. <hi>Logick</hi> uſes more
ſolid and convincing Reaſons; becauſe, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Converſation, we better know the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him to whom we ſpeak; and we have
liberty to try all neceſſary ways to Conduct him
to the Knowledge of Truth. Inſtead of which,
<hi>Rhetorick,</hi> which is the Art of diſcourſing in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
is often obliged to follow the Prejudices of
its Auditours, and to bottom its Reaſonings upon
that which they acknowledge; becauſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to perſwade them to Change, by ſpeaking
to them a little while, and in a great Aſſembly.
And upon this account, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
only uſes <hi>Enthymems;</hi> that is to ſay, ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54201:29"/>
as are partly in the Auditours Mind, and
which it is not needful to Explain. Such was
<hi>Logick</hi> amongſt the <hi>Greeks:</hi> The Art of finding
out Truth, as far as poſſible, by natural means.</p>
               <p>Our Philoſophers ſeem to have conſidered
Truths, only in themſelves, and the Order which
they have to one another, independently upon us.
And 'tis true, that this was always done in the
<hi>Mathematicks;</hi> becauſe their objects raiſe no Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in us. It is no Man's intereſt to maintain,
that a Right Line is a Crooked one; nor that an
acute Angle ſhould be an Obtuſe one. But, ſince
<hi>Logick</hi> is the Inſtrument of all Sciences, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
of Morality, it ought to comprehend
every thing that is neceſſary to make all ſorts of
Truth to enter into Men's Minds; and rather
thoſe which the Paſſions do obſtruct than others.
Nevertheleſs, it doth not appear, that our <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi>
had ſufficient regard to the diſpoſitions of
their Diſciples. They have apply'd to all ſorts
of Subjects the dry Method of <hi>Geometricians;</hi>
and being the firſt of them had to do with
very dull Diſciples (for it was not known in
<hi>France</hi> what was Politeneſs 500 Years ago,)
they took great care to ſeparate all their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
to put all their Arguments in Form, and
evermore to diſtinguiſh the Concluſion, the Proofs,
and the Objections: So that it was impoſſible for
the dulleſt Pupil to miſ-apprehend them. They
thought that they mightily ſhortned the Work,
by cutting off all Ornaments of Diſcourſe, and
all the Figures of <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> but probably, they
did not conſider, that thoſe Figures which render
the Diſcourſe lively, and animated, are nothing
but the natural Conſequences of that effort, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54201:30"/>
we make to perſwade others: Beſides, theſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
do much ſhorten the Diſcourſe; often they
diſcharge an objection by one Word, often an
handſom Turn is a better Proof, than an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Form; and always thereby, the tedious
repetitions of Terms of Art are avoided.</p>
               <p>Let the Experiment be made, and one Page of
Scholaſtick Diſcourſe will be reduc'd to the fourth
part, by changing it into an ordinary, and natural Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
And yet they who are accuſtomed to this
way of Reaſoning, believe that Figurative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
contain nothing but Words, and cannot
own any thing to have Reaſon in it, that is not
diſtinguiſhed by Articles, and Titles. I'm very
ſenſible, that 'tis ſometimes neceſſary to argue in
Form, or to uſe Terms of Art, and name the
<hi>Major</hi> and the <hi>Minor,</hi> to give Light to ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Reaſon, and unravel a Sophiſm: But it
doth not therefore follow, that this muſt be always
done. Men do not ordinarily Expreſs themſelves
by ſet Forms of Speech, becauſe theſe are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
in Contracts and Oaths. Something ſhould
be left to be done by the Scholar, who ought not
to be ſo injuriouſly Treated, as to be ſuppoſed
uncapable of obſerving the Strength of a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
if he be not pointed to it by the Finger.</p>
               <p>The Study of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> conſiſted chiefly in Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whom the Profeſſors Read, and
Explain'd in Publick. But as the greateſt part of
Commentatours are very Copious upon the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of their Authors; ſo here, in time, they
made very tedious Treatiſes upon all the Praeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
of <hi>Logick.</hi> Of <hi>Ariſtotles Categories,</hi> which
are only a ſhort Explication of all the ſimple
Terms which can enter into Propoſitions, they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54201:30"/>
have made a very large Diſcourſe, and have
therewith mix'd a great deale of <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> and
even <hi>Theology</hi> For ſpeaking of <hi>Relation,</hi> ſome
have enter'd very far into the Myſtery of the
<hi>Trinity.</hi> They have alſo made very long Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon <hi>Porphyry's</hi> Introduction; whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Famous Treatiſe of Univerſals. They
have alſo joyned thereunto Queſtions upon the
Name and Eſſence of <hi>Logick</hi> it ſelf; as whether it
be an Art, or a Science, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces
they dilated ſo much, that they were forc'd
to be very ſhort upon the Rules of <hi>Syllogiſms,</hi> and
all things elſe which make up the main Body of
<hi>Aristotle's Logick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame almoſt has likewiſe been done in
Morality. There they have dilated upon the
general Queſtions concerning the End, of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
good, of Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
time to treat of Vertues in particular, and to
give ſpecial Rules for the Conduct of Life; which
nevertheleſs, ſeems to be the end of Morality.
And herein, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> might be of great uſe; for
he knew perfectly well the manners of Men, and
if his thoughts did not always ſoar ſo high as
<hi>Plato</hi>'s, yet he reaſoned more according to the
actions of ordinary Life, and the Practices of Men.
But after all, this is but a low degree for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to aim at, who ought to have learn'd from
their Infancy, a Doctrin infinitely above, even
that of <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> OF all Sciences, <hi>Phyſick</hi> was the moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,<note place="margin">Medicks. <hi>or</hi> phyſick.</note>
at the time when <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> began to
be Form'd. This Science was wholly taken from
the <hi>Arabians;</hi> and inſtead of Founding it upon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54201:31"/>
Experience, and beginning by well aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
what things were real and in Truth, they
Founded it altogether upon <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatours,</hi>
and upon general Reaſonings. And
truly it was not eaſie for the Learned Men of
this Time to make Experiments: They were all
either <hi>Monks</hi> or <hi>Clergymen,</hi> ſhut up in <hi>Monaſteries</hi> and
<hi>Colleges;</hi> for moſt part Poor, either by <hi>Profeſſion</hi>
or by their <hi>Fortune.</hi> The Arts were at a very
low Ebb; a great many inventions were loſt, and
few, as yet, of them were found again. The
<hi>Artiſans</hi> were generally Slaves, and very deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
Men would not eaſily believe, that any thing
could be learn'd of them. However, whether
this had been ſo or no; Men's Minds were not
diſpoſed to examin Matters of Fact, and conſult
Experience: They rely'd upon the Authority of
Books, and took all for granted which they ſaid
of the effects of Nature, and their Cauſes. They
were ſo far from deſpiſing what was extraordinary,
that the moſt marvellous things always ſeemed
moſt worthy of their Notice. Hence came the
belief of an infinite number of Fables, with
which the World is ſtill infected, though Pains
are daily taken to undeceive Men; ſo many occult
Qualities, ſo many Sympathies and Antipathies,
ſo many imaginary properties of Plants, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals:
This alſo was that which raiſed the credit
of <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Astrology,</hi> which then was but too
high. The Doctrin of the influences of the

ſort of <hi>Natural Magick;</hi> and every thing, of which

which was <hi>Supernatural,</hi> that is, the Power of
<hi>Wicked Spirits.</hi> For, being aſſured by <hi>Religion,</hi>
that there are ſuch <hi>Spirits,</hi> and that God permits
them ſometimes to Deceive Men, nothing did
more handſomly conceal their Ignorance, than to
attribute to them all that, of which they could
give no Account. Thus the Fictions of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi>
of this time, were not, by much, ſo abſurd,
as they appear to us. It was probable, even in
the Opinion of their Learned Men, that there
had been, and that there were ſtill in divers parts
of the World, <hi>Diviners</hi> and <hi>Enchanters;</hi> and
that <hi>Nature Produced Flying Dragons,</hi> and divers

a great many Superſtitious Practices, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Medicks;</hi> where People always love to do
ſomething that is Uſeleſs, rather than omit any
thing that may be of Advantage. To Study <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philoſophy</hi> (under which was comprehended
<hi>Medicks)</hi> was onely to Read Books, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute;
as if there had been no Animals to Diſſect;
no Plants, or Minerals, whoſe Effects were to be
Try'd; as if Men had not had the Uſe of their
Senſes, to have ſatisfy'd themſelves of the Truth
of that which others had ſaid. In a word, as if
no ſuch thing, as <hi>Nature,</hi> had been in the World,
to have been Conſulted in her Self. Much after
this manner were Arts, and eſpecially <hi>Medicks,</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the ignorance of <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory</hi> hinder'd

did onely Explain one place of the <hi>Digeſt,</hi> or the

their Credulity, as to mix with their Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Ridiculous <hi>Etymologies,</hi> and Abſurd <hi>Fables.</hi>
Whether it was, that they did not Apprehend
that they could not Practiſe the <hi>Laws,</hi> if they
did not underſtand them, or that they deſpaired
to underſtand them better: However it was,
their greateſt Endeavour was to Reduce them to
Practiſe, to handle Queſtions upon the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which they had drawn from the <hi>Texts,</hi> to
give Counſel, and Decide Caſes. But when they
undertook to apply this <hi>Roman Law</hi> to our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
(which was ſo ill underſtood by us, and
ſo different from our Manners) and yet, at
the ſame time, preſerve our Cuſtoms, which it
was impoſſible to Change; The Rules of Juſtice
became much more uncertain. All <hi>Civil Law</hi> was
reduc'd to School-Diſputes, and the Opinions of
Doctors, who, having not ſufficiently penetrated
into the Principles of <hi>Morality,</hi> and <hi>Natural Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
ſought ſometimes their particular Intereſts.
They alſo, who ſought after Juſtice, knew no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Means of procuring it, but particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
againſt Injuſtice; which made them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſo many New Clauſes for Contracts, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54201:32"/>
ſo many Formalities for Judgments. They, as
the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> did, labour'd onely to heal Preſent
Evils, without taking care to ſtop the Fountains
of them, and prevent 'em for the future; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they could not do it. For, to take away
the General Cauſes of Vexatious Proceſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
it is requiſite, that the Soveraign Power
be Concern'd; that there be ſome certain and
ſtable Laws known to all the World, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Officers fully Authorized. A great many
Means of Inriching, as well as Ruining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
muſt be taken away from particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and, as far as poſſible, they muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to the moſt Simple and Natural Way of
Living; as we ſee in that Law, which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
gave to his People, and which, whilſt they
obſerv'd it, made them ſo happy. But then <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
was ſo divided, and Princes ſo weak, both
in Power and Intellectuals, that it never came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their heads to make ſuch Laws.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/>
                  <hi>DIvinity</hi> was more purely Studied. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we find in all Times,<note place="margin">Divinity.</note> a <hi>Senſible Protection
of God over his Church, always to preſerve therein the
Sound Doctrin.</hi> But though the Doctrin was the
ſame, as in the foregoing Ages, the manner of
Teaching was different. The Fathers of the
Church being, for the moſt part, Biſhops, very
much imploy'd, ſcarce Writ any thing, but when
they were neceſſitated, for the <hi>Defence of Religion,</hi>
againſt <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and they Treated
onely of ſuch Queſtions as were really propoſed.
A good part of their Works are Sermons, which
they made to the People, in Explaining the <hi>Holy
Scripture.</hi> But the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54201:33"/>
wholly taken up in Studying and Teaching,
did ſeparate even all the parts of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
one from another. Some confin'd themſelves
to the <hi>Explication of Scripture,</hi> which they called
<hi>Poſitive Theology:</hi> Others to the <hi>Myſteries</hi> and <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Truths,</hi> which is called by the general
Name of <hi>Scholaſtick:</hi> Others to <hi>Morality,</hi> and
the Deciſion of <hi>Caſes of Conſcience.</hi> Thus their
end in the Schools, being to Teach, they made
it their Buſineſs to Treat of as many Queſtions as
they could, and to place them Methodically.
They thought, that to Exerciſe their Diſciples, and
prepare them for Serious Diſputes againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Faith; they ought to examine all
the Subtilties, which Human Reaſon could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them with upon theſe Subjects; and Obviate
all the Objections of Curious and Reſtleſs Spirits.
They had Leiſure for it; and they were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with Means of doing it, out of <hi>Ariſtotle's Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi>
and <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> together with the <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries</hi>
of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> Thus they did much the
ſame thing, which is done in <hi>Fencing-Schools,</hi> and
the <hi>Academies;</hi> where, to give Activity and Spirit
unto Young Men, they Teach them many things,
which are very rarely made uſe of, in Real En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters.
In Explaining the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Sentences,</hi>
whoſe <hi>Book</hi> was lookt upon as the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Divinity,</hi> they form'd every day New Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon thoſe which he had Propounded: and
afterwards they did the ſame upon St. <hi>Thomas's
Sums.</hi> But now, it muſt be confeſs'd, that this
Forming, and Reſolving of Queſtions, and, in
general, This meer Reaſoning, did, for a long
time, <hi>Leſſen Mens Application to Poſitive Studies,</hi>
which conſiſt in Reading and Criticiſm; as the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54201:33"/>
knowing the Literal Senſe of Scripture, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of the Fathers, and Matters of Fact in
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi> 'Tis true, theſe Studies were
very difficult, through the great ſcarcity of Books,
and the little Knowledge of Ancient Languages.
A <hi>Bible,</hi> with the ordinary Gloſs Compleat, was
not to be found but in Great Libraries. A pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſon was rich when he had <hi>Gratian</hi>'s <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi>
and the greateſt part knew not the <hi>Fathers</hi>
but by this Collection.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> THis was very much the State of Studies in
<hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Humanity.</note> and in <hi>Europe,</hi> when Men began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themſelves to <hi>Humanity,</hi> I mean, chiefly to <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
and <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> This Reſtoration may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Year 1450, and the Taking of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
which made ſo many Learned <hi>Greeks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into <hi>Italy</hi> with their <hi>Books.</hi> For though <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch</hi>
and <hi>Bocace</hi> had revived theſe Studies in the
foregoing Age, yet hitherto they had made but
little progreſs. But in <hi>Greece</hi> Studies were yet well
enough preſerved. The <hi>Commentary</hi> of <hi>Euſtathius</hi>
upon <hi>Homer</hi> is enough to ſhew, that, to theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Ages, there were remaining an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Learned Books, and Men. Thus, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Middle of the Fifteenth Age, a Whole
Shoal of Learned Men appeared, all at once;
(firſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> then in <hi>France,</hi> and proportionably
in the reſt of <hi>Europe)</hi> who, with incredible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
ayply'd themſelves to the Reading all the
Books of the Ancients they could find, to the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Latin</hi> as purely as 'twas poſſible; and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating
<hi>Greek Authors.</hi> The <hi>Art of Printing</hi> (found
out at the ſame time) made it much eaſier for
them to procure Books, and to have them Correct.
So that ſeveral afterwards labour'd in putting out
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54201:34"/>
excellent <hi>Editions</hi> of all the Good <hi>Authors,</hi> according
to the beſt <hi>Manuſcripts;</hi> enquiring after the moſt
Ancient, and comparing ſeveral together. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
made very exact <hi>Dictionaries,</hi> and <hi>Grammars;</hi>
others <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon difficult <hi>Authors;</hi> others
<hi>Treatiſes</hi> upon all thoſe Requiſites which might
help to the Underſtanding of them; as their
<hi>Fables,</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi> their <hi>Government,</hi> their <hi>Art of
War;</hi> and even to the <hi>leaſt</hi> particulars of their
<hi>Manners,</hi> their <hi>Habits,</hi> their <hi>Eating,</hi> their <hi>Diverſions.</hi>
Inſomuch, that they have taken all the pains ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to make us underſtand as much as 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
after ſuch a Long Interval, all the reſt of
the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Books.</p>
               <p>But ſome have too much dwelt upon theſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which are onely Inſtruments for other Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
more Serious. For there have been ſome Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Perſons, who have ſpent their Lives in Studying
<hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and in Reading all <hi>Authors,</hi> for
the Laaguage ſake; or only to underſtand the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi>
and explain ſome difficult paſſages of them,
without going any farther, or making any uſe of
them. There have been ſome who have gone no
farther than <hi>Mythology,</hi> and ſome other Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which I have mentioned; who have ſought
after <hi>Inſcriptions, Medals,</hi> and all that might give
any <hi>Light</hi> to <hi>Authors,</hi> ſeeking onely the pleaſure,
which they found in theſe Curioſities. Some
proceeding farther, have Studied the <hi>Liberal Arts,</hi>
according to the Ancient <hi>Rules,</hi> as <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and
<hi>Poetry,</hi> nevertheleſs without Practiſing them;
whence it came, that we have ſo many Modern
<hi>Treatiſes</hi> of <hi>Poetry,</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and yet ſo few
<hi>True Poets</hi> and <hi>Orators:</hi> and ſo many <hi>Political
Tracts,</hi> made by thoſe, who never were concern'd
in Buſineſs. Laſtly, The diligent reading the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54201:34"/>
                  <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> produc'd in many ſuch a
blind Reſpect for them, that they choſe rather to
follow their Errors, than to give themſelves the
Liberty to Judge of them. Thus it was believed,
that Nature was, in all Reſpects, ſuch as <hi>Pliny</hi> has
deſcrib'd her to be; and that ſhe could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but according to the Principles of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
The worſt of it is, that many have admired their
<hi>Morality;</hi> and did not conſider, how much it was
<hi>below</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> which they had learn'd from
their Cradle. Others, though but a few, have
exceeded on the other hand, having affected to
contradict the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and run as far as they
could from their Principles. But of thoſe who
have admired them, the moſt ordinary fault has
been, an aukward Imitation of them.</p>
               <p>It has been believed, that to Write as they
did, it was neceſſary to Write in their Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
without Conſidering, that the <hi>Romans</hi> Writ
in <hi>Latin,</hi> and not in <hi>Greek;</hi> and that the <hi>Greeks</hi>
Writ in <hi>Greek,</hi> and not in the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> or <hi>Syriack</hi>
Language. They thought themſelves happy, if
they could attain to the making good Verſes in
<hi>Latin;</hi> they have alſo compoſed ſome in <hi>Greek,</hi> at
the peril of not being underſtood by any Body:
And they, who, as <hi>Ronſard</hi> and his <hi>Followers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to make <hi>French Verſes,</hi> after their Reading of
the <hi>Ancients,</hi> have fill'd them with their <hi>Words,</hi>
their <hi>Poetical Phraſes,</hi> their <hi>Fables,</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi>
without concerning themſelves, whether ſuch <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems</hi>
might pleaſe thoſe who had not Studied as
they had done: It was ſufficient, that they
made them Admired for their Profound Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
They imitated alſo the Oratours; they
made Harangues in <hi>Latin,</hi> and ſtuff'd their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54201:35"/>
in <hi>French,</hi> with <hi>Latin</hi> ſayings. In a word,
they thought to make uſe of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> was to
get them by heart, to ſpeak of the things of which
they ſpake, and to repeat their own proper
words: in ſtead of which, well to have imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, they ought to have pitcht upon Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which had more relation to us, as they had
choſen thoſe which appertain'd unto them to have
treated them, as they did, after a ſolid and divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
way; and to have Explained them, as well
in our Language, as they had Explained them in
theirs.</p>
               <p>This new kind of Study rais'd a ſort of War
amongſt the Learned. The <hi>Humaniſts,</hi> Charm'd
with the Beauty of their <hi>Ancient Authors,</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
themſelves upon their New Diſcoveries, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
the common ſort of Doctors, who, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Tradition of the Schools, neglected Style,
to follow Things; and preferr'd what was profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
to what was pleaſant and agreeable. The
<hi>Doctors</hi> on their ſide, I mean the <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>
lookt upon theſe <hi>New Philologers</hi> as <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians,</hi>
and <hi>Poets,</hi> who amus'd themſelves with
Childiſh Toys, and Vain Curioſities. But the
<hi>Humaniſts</hi> made themſelves heard, becauſe they
Writ Politely, and by the Reading of the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. Epiſt. obſcur. vir. <hi>Eraſm.</hi>
                  </note> had learnt to Railly with a good Grace.
The Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> who aroſe a little while
after, fomented theſe Quarrels, and made them
more ſerious. He was for Reforming Studies as
well as Religion. He was for having no <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
and no <hi>Prophane Sciences.</hi> He was for Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Plato, Aristotle, Cicero,</hi> and all the Ancient
Books,<note place="margin">Ep. ad nov. <hi>Germ.</hi> an. 1520.</note> that nothing might be Studied but the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and all the remaining part of time ſpent
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54201:35"/>
in Hard-Labour. Thus carrying the thing too
high, he expoſed the moſt Holy Maxims of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi>
to Cenſure. The Reſiſtance which he
found among the <hi>Doctors of Divinity,</hi> and the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi>
of the <hi>Faculty of Paris,</hi> and other <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi>
made him their Irreconcileable Enemy. He
treated them with the laſt degree of Contempt;
and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> his Faithful Diſciple, imploy'd
all his Wit, and all his fine Learning, to render
them Ridiculous. But the Reformers did not
long continue in this their firſt Severity againſt
Prophane Studies. They ſoon became more
Zealous in Studying <hi>Humanity,</hi> ſeeing that Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and an Opinion of their ſingular Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had drawn a great many Followers to them.
They now lookt upon theſe Studies as a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Means towards the Reformation of the Church;<note place="margin">Hiſt. Eccleſ. de <hi>Beze,</hi> initio.</note>
and would have this Reſtoration of Learning
paſs for a Principal Sign of the Will of God in
this Matter. It ſeemed, if you wou'd have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
them, as if this Knowledge of Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and Hiſtories, which they had by conſtant
Pains acquired, was a certain <hi>Mark</hi> of an <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Miſſion;</hi> and making them to be Admired
by the Ignorant, they eaſily perſwaded them, that
the <hi>Catholick Doctors</hi> were no better Skill'd in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
than they were in good Learning. But
they had not this weak advantage very long.
The <hi>Catholicks</hi> ſoon ingag'd them with their own
Weapons; and uſed ſucceſsfully againſt them
the Original Languages, and the Ancient <hi>Authors,</hi>
according to their own Editions. Then Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
again to Study the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers,
very little known in the Foregoing Ages. They
Studied <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> the <hi>Councils,</hi> the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54201:36"/>
Canons: They aſcended to the original of
Tradition, and took the Doctrin from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Head.
The literal ſenſe of Scripture was
ſought after by the help of Languages and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm.
I well know, that many, even of the
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> have driven theſe inquiries to vain Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities,
and that ſeveral alſo continued too much
Wedded to the old Style of the Schools. So dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
a thing it is, for Men to keep themſelves in
a true Mediocrity.</p>
               <p>The Language of the Scholaſtick Philoſophy,
which came to us from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> is not in it
ſelf, worthy of any particular reſpect; it is like
the Architecture of our ancient Churches. This
Architecture which we call <hi>Gothick,</hi> and which
truly is <hi>Arabick,</hi> is neither more Venerable, nor
more Holy, for having been apply'd unto Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſes in times, when Men knew no better.
It would be a ridiculous delicacy, to reſolve never
to enter into any Churches built after this manner;
as it would be alſo a vain ſcrupuloſity not to dare to
build any of a better Model. It is by chance,
that theſe Idea's come to be joyned to thoſe of
Religion; and that which comes from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
and Inſtitutions of Men, ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from what things are in themſelves.</p>
               <p>If on the one Hand, this Reſtoration of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
has render'd Studies more ſolid and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
than before; on the other, they have
made them more difficult; for they have been
rather augmented than changed, and Men were
deſirous to retain all. Thus by little and little, and
by a long Tradition, that courſe of Studies which
is at preſent obſerved in the publick Schools, has
been Formed. Firſt of all, <hi>Grammar</hi> with the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54201:36"/>
                  <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, Poetry, that is, the making of
<hi>Latin</hi> Verſes, <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and upon occaſion, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi>
and <hi>Geography,</hi> then <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and afterwards
<hi>Divinity, Law</hi> and <hi>Medicks,</hi> according to Men's
different Profeſſions. I leave it to thoſe who have
paſs'd through them, to judge, whether nothing
is taught in the Schools, but what is uſeful, and
whether all that is neceſſary be taught therein.
My deſign, as I ſaid at firſt, is only to
ſpeak of private Studies. And this is the Reaſon
why I have thought, that I may be permitted to
ſet aſide the Authority of Cuſtom, and to reaſon
freely concerning the matter of Studies, as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi>
(who are the moſt obedient to the Laws
of their Country) nevertheleſs, take the liberty
to reaſon upon <hi>Politicks.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak of Studies
in general, though my principal purpoſe is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
my ſelf to thoſe, which are moſt uſeful to
Youth, inſtructed in private; and I ſhall only
propoſe my Reflections, which are founded upon
Experience.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> WE ought, in my Opinion, firſt
to inquire what Study is,<note place="margin">Of the Choice of Studies.</note> and
what end Men ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to themſelves in Study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
To heap together an abundance of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
though it be with great Labour, and to
diſtinguiſh ones ſelf from the common ſort, by
knowing that which others are ignorant of; is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54201:37"/>
not ſufficient to denominate a Man a Student.
For if ſo, then to count all the Letters of a
Book, or all the Leaves of a Tree, would be
to Study; ſince this would be a very difficult task,
and would end in a very ſingular ſort of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
But, why would this Pains taking be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
but becauſe it would be neither a profitable,
nor a grateful Work? That therefore ought not
to be called Studying, which hath not for its end,
at leaſt, the Pleaſure of Knowledge; but yet,
Pleaſure cannot juſtifie thoſe Studies which preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
others that are better, or ſuch imployments
as are more uſeful. We ſhould pity that Sick
Perſon, who ſhould be ſollicitous about nothing,
but to dreſs himſelf according to the Mode, and
Eat every thing that is grateful to his Palate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of ſeriouſly ſeeking after the means of a
Cure. A young <hi>Artiſan</hi> would deſerve to be
Laugh'd at, who in the time of his Apprenticeſhip,
ſhould entertain himſelf with drawing of Pictures,
and playing upon Inſtruments, inſtead of learning
his Trade. He might think it a fine Apology, to
ſay, that he takes Pleaſure therein, and that Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and Muſick are more noble Employments
than thoſe of the <hi>Carpenter</hi> or the <hi>Smith.</hi> But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
his Father or his Maſter would read
him another Leſſon. Leave theſe things, would
they ſay, to <hi>Muſicians</hi> and <hi>Painters,</hi> the time which
you ſhall ſpend in their Trades, will hinder you
from learning your own. You are wholly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
your ſelf to that, and are permitted, only
to ſpend the <hi>Holy-Days</hi> in your Innocent Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
inſtead of Debauchery. Much after the ſame
manner young Scholars may be accoſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:54201:38"/>
                  <q>Your Education muſt be the Apprenticeſhip of
your Life; you are to learn how to become an
Honeſt Man, and skilful in the Profeſſion,
which you ſhall undertake; apply therefore
your ſelf altogether to that, which may make
you ſo. But <hi>Grammar, Poetry,</hi> and <hi>Logick</hi> (he'll
ſay) divert me: I find great pleaſure in the
Knowledge of the Tongues, in drawing Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies,
and making different Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Language of Men: I love to judge of
Styles, and to examine the Rules of Poetry: I
love theſe Learned Speculations upon the nature
of Reaſoning, and theſe exact Enumerations of
all thoſe things which may Form a Concluſion.
You have reaſon to do ſo; all theſe pieces of
Knowledge are pleaſant: They alſo are praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
and you may uſe them to ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
But beware leaſt Pleaſure carry you too
far, and that you do not beſtow too much
time upon them: Natural Philoſophy alſo has
great Charms; if you give your ſelf up too
much to <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> you have Work enough
in them for your Life. Some have thought it
too ſhort for the Study of Hiſtory; and others
have ſpent it in mere Curioſities of Travel, of
underſtanding the pleaſant Arts, as <hi>Painting</hi>
and <hi>Muſick,</hi> of inquiring after things that
are Rare. In the mean time, when will
you begin to learn to provide for your ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?
When will you inſtruct your ſelf in the
things which are proper to your Profeſſion?
You ought wholly to renounce theſe Pleaſures,
if you cannot tell how to moderate them; but if
you would purſue them in a reaſonable degree, and
ſeaſonably, beſtow upon them that time, which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54201:38"/>
others ſquander away in Eating and Drinking,
in Play and unprofitable Viſits. But neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
obſerve your times of Exerciſing your
Body and unbending your Mind; for Health
and Liberty of Mind, is to be preferr'd to all
Curioſity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides Pleaſure, there is ſtill another great
Temptation to be avoided; which is Vanity.
How many Studies are there which Men have
ſought after, only to make a ſhow, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
themſelves, and aſtoniſh the Ignorant. The
way to know which they are, is to think what we
ſhould Study, if we were to live in Solitude, and
never to ſpeak to any Body.</p>
               <p>Nothing therefore ſhould be called Study, but
the Application to ſuch kinds of Knowledge as are
uſeful in Life. And there are two ſorts of them;
one whereof are profitable for Action, teaching
Men how to acquit themſelves worthily in reſpect
of thoſe Duties which are common to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
or of thoſe which are proper to each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
The others are uſeful in Retirement, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
us with means how to imploy our ſelves
honeſtly in our times of Repoſe, and to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of our leiſure Hours, avoiding Idleneſs
and Debauchery. The firſt ought to be the end
of a Man, as a Man, whoſe perfection is Moral
Vertue; who is in the next place to be conſidered,
as a Member of Civil Society. It is alſo of great
Importance, that he ſhould improve the Intervals
of Action: All Men's Actions tend only to reſt,
and leiſure; and this Eſtate is moſt dangerous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe, who know not how to uſe it well. But
they who know how to profit thereby, gain ſuch
knowledge, as may be ſerviceable to them in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54201:39"/>
Conduct of their own Lives, and thoſe of others;
and moreover, in acquiring it, taſte the pureſt
pleaſures of this Life. For, as by bodily La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
Men gain their Bread, which the Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
with Pleaſure, and gives new Strength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it for new Labour: In like manner, by buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and the actions of Life, we obtain reſt;
wherein we learn how to manage the following
actions of our Lives, and that with pleaſure.
And providence hath ſo diſpoſed the Bodies of
Children, that whilſt they are not yet capable of
Labour, they require a great deal of nouriſhment,
to make them grow, and become ſtrong. The
ſame alſo is true of the Soul, there being no Age,
wherein we learn ſo eaſily, and deſire ſo much to
learn, as during our Childhood, when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for action; inſtead of which, old Age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Men become uncapable of Learning, is very fit
to inſtruct, and hath a great inclination thereunto;
inſomuch, that there is no State of Life, of which
we may not make a good uſe, if we know how to
co-operate with the intentions of the Creatour.</p>
               <p>Youth therefore is a very precious time; Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
and Docibility are never ſo great as then.
Children would know all things, all Objects are
new to them, and they look upon them with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and admiration; they continually are ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Queſtions, they are for attempting all things,
and imitating all that they ſee done. Beſides,
they are Credulous and Simple; they take Words
for that which they ſignifie, till they be Taught
to be Cautious, by finding that thoſe about them
do Lye to them, and deceive them. They take
what impreſſion you will, having neither Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
nor Reaſon to reſiſt them. The Memory
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54201:39"/>
is never more pliable, nor more ſure; and what
things they have in this Age been accuſtomed to
think on more than others; to the ſame they apply
themſelves with more Facility and Pleaſure all
the days of their Lives. 'Tis evident, that God
hath given all theſe qualifications to Children, to
the end that they may learn that which may ſerve
them all the reſt of their Lives. And it is alſo
from the ſame Providence, that they have not
theſe diſpoſitions beſtow'd upon them in vain;
but that, at the ſame time, is given to them a
capacity of retaining all that is neceſſary to them,
and the external means of Learning it.</p>
               <p>It is the fault of thoſe who have inſtructed Us,
and Ours afterwards; if we want any of that
knowledge which is neceſſary: Whence it is,
that the ignorance of our Duties, renders us tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
culpable. Now the capacity which we have
to know, and to retain, is not little; and there
is no Man ſo meanly inſtructed, and of ſo groſs
an underſtanding, provided he be not altogether
ſtupid, who knows not a vaſt many things. Take
a Peaſant, who knows not how to Read, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
learn'd a Trade, he knows how the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
things of Life are done; what is the price
of them, what are the means to come by them;
he knows the Trees and Plants of his own Farm,
the nature of the Soil, and the different ways of
Tillage it requires; together with the Seaſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for each: He knows the way of Hunting and
Fiſhing, according to the cuſtom of his Country;
and an infinite number of ſuch like things which
are uſeful and ſolid, and yet not ordinarily known
by thoſe who are called Learned. The ignorant
therefore are not ſuch as think of nothing, and who
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54201:40"/>
have nothing in their Memory. They have fewer
things therein, and think oftner of them, without
Order and Connexion; or elſe they think of a
great many things, but yet ſuch as are little,
mean, vulgar, and uſeleſs. The firſt are more
dull and heavy, theſe more light and unſtable.
On the contrary, Learned and Skilful Men, have
not always their Heads better made than others,
but they uſe them more, they think more upon
Great, Noble, and uſeful Objects.</p>
               <p>But yet, how large ſoever this capacity of
Learning and Retaining is, in thoſe, whoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Diſpoſitions are moſt happy, it is clear ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
that it is limited, ſince it depends (at
leaſt in part,) upon the Diſpoſition of the Brain,
and the Soul it ſelf is a Creature, whoſe Vertue
is Finite. Beſides, Life is ſhort, the greateſt
part of it is imployed about the neceſſities of
the Body, and the reſt is given us, rather for
Acting, than for Learning. In ſhort, without
ſpeaking of that which is above our reach, we
may ſay, that no particular Perſon can know all
that, which yet the Mind of Man is capable of
knowing. Whoever ſhould have the Vanity to
pretend to it, would leave a great many things
unknown, to burthen himſelf with many which
are ſuperfluous; and yet even in theſe, would
daily diſcover Countries, which were before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to him.</p>
               <p>We therefore ought to husband our time; and
with great care chuſe that which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to know, and ſo much the more, becauſe
we cannot forget, when we would. For Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is not like <hi>Pictures</hi> or <hi>Medals,</hi> which we put
into a <hi>Cabinet,</hi> that we may look upon them
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54201:40"/>
when we have a mind, and ſet them out of ſight
when we would not ſee them. We have no other
place, wherein to put our Knowledge, but our
Memory, and our Soul it ſelf; there it remains,
often as long as we live, and thoſe things we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the moſt to be rid of, are they which moſt
frequently offer themſelves. Moreover, 'tis our
Good or Evil Thoughts, which Form our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
inſomuch, that an Errour which we have
embraced, is like a Poiſon we have ſuck'd in; the
effect of which is no more in our power to
prevent.</p>
               <p>And if we be obliged to be careful in our
choice of what we Study our ſelves, we ought to
be more careful for the inſtruction of others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Children. It is more injuſtice to laviſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Goods of another Man, than our own;
and it is a ſort of cruelty to cauſe them to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray,
who are committed to our Conduct. It is
ordinarily thought, that this choice is of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to little Children. As ſoon as the firſt
ſparklings of Light begin to appear in them,
they are generally ſuffered to receive a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ill impreſſions, which muſt afterwards be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out: Inſtead of helping them forward, they
are uſually encouraged in their defects. They
are credulous, the Story of the <hi>Aſs's Skin,</hi> and an
Hundred other impertinent <hi>Fables</hi> are related to
them, which take poſſeſſion of their Memory,
in its firſt <hi>rawneſs.</hi> They are fearful, they are
told of <hi>Hob-goblings,</hi> and <hi>Horned Beaſts;</hi> they are
continually threatned. All their little paſſions are
indulged; their <hi>Greedineſs, Anger, Vanity:</hi> And
when they are catch'd in the Net, when they ſay
ſome Fooliſh thing, by drawing a right conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54201:41"/>
from an impertinent Principle, which has
been inſtill'd into them; how are they Laugh'd at,
and Triumph'd over, for having been deceiv'd!
And preſently, how are they Kiſs'd, how are they
careſs'd, as if they had done well! Poor Children
are uſed as if they were made for the Diverſion of
great Perſons; as little <hi>Dogs,</hi> or <hi>Apes.</hi> In the
mean time it ſhould be conſidered, that they are
reaſonable Creatures,<note place="margin">Mat. xviii. 10.</note> whom the <hi>Goſpel</hi> forbids us
to deſpiſe: Upon this high conſideration, that
they have the Bleſſed Angels for their Guardians.
How much therefore are Men, eſpecially Parents,
obliged to take care of them, to cultivate their
Minds, and form their Manners? But what!
(may it be ſaid) Muſt Children be Educated in
a Dull and Melancholy way, by ſpeaking to
them of nothing but ſerious and high Matters?
Not at all; Men ought only to take the trouble of
accommodating themſelves to their Capacity, that
ſo they may be aſſiſted gently, and led along
with ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> THere are wanting in Children only two things
towards their <hi>Reaſoning well,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The way and Method to give At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note> 
                  <hi>Attention</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi>
The moveableneſs of their Brain, which
cauſes them continually to be in Motion, and not
continue long in one Place, is the Reaſon, why
they cannot conſider any one Object for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time, much leſs obſerve the Order and
Connexion of things. The little Knowledge
they have of particular things, is the cauſe why
they want principles of Reaſoning; which are
drawn from Matters of Fact, from Laws of
Nature, and the inſtitution of Men. As for
Principles, which proceed purely from the Light
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54201:41"/>
of Nature, they have the ſame then, they will
have as long as they ſhall live. They may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Err, when they lay down a poſitive Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
or when they do not ſufficiently attend to
natural Principles; but they draw their Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
aright, and if they had not then the notions
of the great Principles, and of good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
they would never have them: For
Men do not give theſe notions to one another,
they proceed only from the Creatour, ſince
they are the Foundation of Reaſon it ſelf.
The defect of Experience is that which may
be firſt ſupply'd, by anſwering all their Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
with the ſame ſimplicity, with which they
propoſed them; telling them the Truth in every
thing as far as 'tis uſeful for them to know
it, and explaining it to them very clearly. Nor
is it enough to ſatisfie their Curioſity concerning
all the ſenſible Objects, which make them ſpeak;
but they ſhould alſo be informed in uſeful Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,
as that of Religion, and of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
But great care muſt be taken, to Explain
to them every thing, of which, as yet, they
have had no Experience, that ſo, if poſſible,
they may ſay nothing, of which they have not
a diſtinct Idea in their Minds. They may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
be Taught ſome Fables, as thoſe of the
Famous Gods of Antiquity, and the Fables of
<hi>Aeſop,</hi> which may be uſeful to them for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.
Theſe Toys do divert them, and do
them no harm, when they are not given
to them, as things of greater value than
they really are. But they ought never to be
deceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54201:42"/>
As for Attention, they muſt be brought to
it with Sweetneſs, and a great deal of Patience.
It will come with time. And when they ſhall
begin to be more capable thereof, at firſt it may
be excited, by the pleaſure of ſome kind of
Knowledge which Invites them: afterwards, by
Fear, Threatnings, and even Chaſtiſements
themſelves. But let theſe laſt Means be never
uſed, but after all others have been Attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>As for their firſt Inſtructions, I would have
them given ſo, as that they ſhould not perceive
there is any Deſign of Inſtructing them. Their
Intervals from Play may be made profitable to
them. When they are weary with Running<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Exerciſing themſelves, Relate to them the
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Terreſtrial Paradiſe,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Abraham,</hi> or the <hi>Adventures</hi> of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
Joſeph:</hi> At another, ſome <hi>Fable</hi> (as I
have Adviſed) without obliging them to repeat
that they have Learnt, but leaving it to them,
of their own accord, to do it, when they ſhall
be in Good Humour. There are beſides, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Artificial ways of Exerciſing the Curioſity
of Infants in this firſt Age; as by <hi>Pictures,</hi> and
<hi>Images</hi> ſet before them, that they may deſire the
Explication of them: By Diſcourſes held before
them, as not thinking of them; and continuing
them, if they ſhall hearken to them, directing
the Diſcourſe even to them alſo. When ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
are together, Emulation may be of great
uſe: That may be ſaid to one before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which we would have the other to Learn:
To him who ſhall be moſt obedient in other
things, it may be propounded as a Reward, to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54201:42"/>
tell him ſome Fine Story. Knowledge and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſhould frequently be commended before them,
without letting them ſee, that it is upon their
Account. In ſhort, the <hi>Natural Temper,</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Inclination</hi> of each Child ſhould be Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he may be brought to be <hi>Attentive,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Motive</hi> which Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
him. For this end, Nets muſt be ſet for
them on all ſides, that they be deceived, for their
own good as much as poſſible; not ſo, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them Quarrelſom and Malicious; and this is
Cheating them to their own Advantage. Above
all, care ſhould be taken, in theſe firſt years,
when Impreſſions are very ſtrong, never ſo to
joyn the Idea of a <hi>Rod,</hi> with that of a <hi>Book,</hi> that
they ſhall never think of <hi>Study,</hi> but with Dread:
This makes Study a Pain to them; and there
are ſome, who never will be wrought upon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner. On the contrary, they ought
to be drawn on with Joy, which is Natural to
this Age. We ſhould Laugh, and Jeſt with
them ſometimes, provided, that Authority doth
not ſuffer thereby; and rather expect ſome
years before we enter them upon Serious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and Regulated Study. As the Brain
of Children is very tender, and all things to them
are New, they are much affected with the Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Objects which ſurround them, and are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
Attentive to them. Hence it is, that they
do eaſily joyn together what affects them at the
ſame time; ſuch a certain Sound, with ſuch a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
or Smell, which yet have no Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with one another. Hence it is, that they
Learn ſo eaſily to Speak; Hence alſo it is, that
Chaſtiſements have their effect upon them. But
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54201:43"/>
this alſo is that which is the cauſe of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors:
for they take all that for good which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to their Senſes, or which is joyned to
any agreeable Object; and the contrary for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
Theſe Firſt Impreſſions are ſo ſtrong, that
often they form the Manners of the Child, for
all the remaining part of his Life; and ſeems to
be one of the Cauſes of the different Cuſtoms of
whole Nations. So that, he who could be ſo
happy as to joyn agreeable Senſations to the firſt
Inſtructions, which are given of things uſeful,
for Manners, or for the Conduct of Life: In
a word, to joyn that which is truly good with
pleaſure: This Man would have found the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
of Education; [a Secret much more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than that of the <hi>Philoſopher</hi>'s <hi>Stone.]</hi> I know,
that, upon this Principle, Sweet-Meats, Images
and Money, and Fine Cloaths are given to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to Recompence their Diligence, and Excite
them to do well: But, by this, we do them
more harm than good. Hereby we Cheriſh in
them the Seeds of Gluttony, Covetouſneſs and
Vanity. They ſhould be Invited by more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Pleaſures than thoſe of Eating, of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
any thing, and making themſelves Gazed
upon and Admired: and I know none ſo ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to this end, as thoſe of Sight; ſuch are the
Beauties of Nature, Pieces of Painting and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,
Symmetry, Figures and Colours. As
the Sight makes us Attribute all its Impreſſions
to External Objects, ſo its Pleaſures carry us one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Admire and Love theſe Objects, and not
our Selves, which is the great danger. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Sounds, and Good Smells have propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
the ſame effect; and this perhaps is the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54201:43"/>
Reaſon, why, in the Solemn Office of the Church,
it has been thought Expedient, to yield ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to theſe Three Senſes. For this Reaſon I
ſhould Adviſe, that the firſt Church to which
the Child is carried, ſhould be the Faireſt, Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and moſt Magnificent; That he be rather
Inſtructed in a Fine Garden, and in the ſight of
a Pleaſant Proſpect, when the Weather is Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,
and when he is in the beſt Humour. I
would have the firſt Books he is to uſe, well Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Bound; that the Maſter himſelf, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
be Well-made, Proper, Speaking well, with
a good Tone, an Open Countenance, and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in all his Deportments: And ſeeing it is
difficult to meet with theſe Qualities joyn'd with
others more Eſſential, I would, at leaſt, that he
have nothing, that is Unbecoming, Rude and
Diſtaſtful.</p>
               <p>The little care that is taken to accommodate
our ſelves to the weakneſs of Children, in all
theſe things, is the Reaſon, that, for the moſt
part, they have an Averſion, and Contempt as
long as they live, for that which they have been
Taught by Old, Ill-humour'd, and Melancholy
Perſons; and that the Diſguſt they take againſt
Publick Schools, built after an Old Faſhion,
which have neither Light nor good Air, often
Influences even their <hi>Latin,</hi> and other <hi>Studies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whatſoever is done to make Children At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive,
it is not to be hoped they will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
ſo any long time; nor that they can always
be led on by Pleaſure. There is often need of
Fear; Joy Diſtracts them, and joyning it ſelf, to
their Natural Levity makes them, in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
paſs from one Object to another. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54201:44"/>
to be feared, that they will be too Familiar
with their Maſter, if he be always in a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Humour; and that ſeeking always to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them, he be too Airy, and diſcover ſome
Weakneſs. He muſt therefore often take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Himſelf the Character which doth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong to him, which is the Serious. He
muſt ſometimes ſhew Anger both in his Looks,
and by the Tone of his Voice, to ſtop the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer
of theſe young Minds, and make them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into themſelves. And ſometimes if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
to paſs from Threats to Chaſtiſements,
they may be managed ſeveral ways before they
come to Corporal Puniſhments: and they ought
to be made ſenſible, that they are only Puniſhed
for want of Attention, or ſome Fault relating to
their Manners; and not meerly for their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and want of Wit; to the end, that they
may not look upon Puniſhment as an Evil, but
a Piece of Juſtice. <hi>Above all, all poſſible care ſhould
be taken, never to be really Angry at them, what
Mein ſoever may be put on.</hi> I know very well
that this is not eaſie; The Office of Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not always Pleaſant; If the Diſciple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to be tired, (though he often is diverted by
ſeeing ſomething New:) The Maſter has Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
much more to be ſo. And, in this Caſe,
Reſentment is ſoon taken, and it is ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
excited by the continual Fooleries of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
ſo oppoſite to the Humour of an Old
Man, or one arrived to the years of Maturity.
Beſides, Threatnings and Chaſtiſements are much
a ſhorter way to give Attention, than that Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation,
and thoſe Pleaſant Artifices of which I
have ſpoken. But what is more Commodious
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54201:44"/>
for the Maſter ought not to be regarded; and
it is certain, that it is always more profitable
for the <hi>Scholar</hi> to be Conducted by Sweetneſs and
Reaſon.</p>
               <p>At leaſt, great care ſhould be taken that they be
not Corrected without cauſe, tho' it be but by a
Word, or a Look<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, how juſt ſoever the Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
may be, it is always Harſh; eſpecially in
an Age wherein the Paſſions are ſo ſtrong, and the
Reaſon ſo weak. It is a ſort of Wound, which
imploys all the Attention of the Soul, and inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
her in thinking on the Grief which ſhe feels,
or the Injuſtice which ſhe imagines ſhe has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Inſomuch, that if the Injuſtice be real,
and the Child perceives it, either by ſomething
which goes before, or ſomething which follows,
(as the Judgment of others, or that of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
himſelf, when he ſhall, but never ſo little,
come to himſelf;) If, I ſay, he perceives that
his Maſter is Paſſionate, or that he is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
Reaſonable; He will not fail either to
hate, or Deſpiſe him; and, from that time, his
Maſter becomes uſeleſs to him. And it ought
not to be imagined, that Children are eaſie to be
deceived herein: They are very ſenſible whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have Right, or Wrong done to
them; and they have a very quick Senſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they can diſcern the Paſſions by the Viſage,
and all External Motions; though, as yet, they
know not how to expreſs them, and do not ſo
much as reflect that they do obſerve them.</p>
               <p>They have this Good Quality, that their Ill-humour
and their Anger do not laſt long, and
that they ſoon return to that Joy which is more
natural to them. Let us be cautious not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54201:45"/>
it: Not to make them ſad, by putting
Fear into them for a long time; not altogether
to diſcourage them, by driving it to exceſs. It
is better that they ſhould be a little Wanton, then
to be Drooping and ſad againſt their Nature. On
the contrary, they ought not, at any time, to be
Afflicted, but to the end that they may make
good uſe of that Compoſed State they ſhall be in
afterwards. For it muſt not be expected, that
Reprimands, or Inſtructions, will have any great
effect upon them, as long as Fear, or Grief do
poſſeſs them. They ſee nothing then but the
Evil with which they are Threatned, or which
they feel; and, if the Puniſhment be violent,
their Sighs oppreſs them, and they are beſides
themſelves. But as ſoon as the Tempeſt is over,
and they are return'd to a reaſonable Temper,
they fall to Study afreſh, and 'tis then we ſhould
give them Inſtructions, when they are in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to underſtand them. Not that we ſhould
always expect ſo much Reaſon from them, as to
condemn themſelves. But, at the ſame time,
when they make their frivolous excuſes, they ſee
that they are in the wrong, and often do Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
themſelves afterwards.</p>
               <p>Though I have ingaged my ſelf to ſpeak of
this Method of giving Attention, with reſpect to
the firſt Inſtructions which are given to Children;
yet it is eaſie to ſee, that it extends to all other
Studies proportionably. In the beginning, they
ſhould, as much as poſſible, be ingaged by Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and afterwards retain'd by Fear. As their
Reaſon ſhall become ſtronger, there will be leſs
need of theſe Artifices.</p>
               <p>

LEt us return to the Choice of Studies, from
which I have a little digreſs'd,<note place="margin">The Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> to ſpeak of the
firſt Inſtructions, and the General Method of
Teaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Study is the Apprenticeſhip of Life, it
ſhould furniſh us with the Means of acting well,
and uſing our Leiſure well. Life is ſhort; The
Capacity of the Brain is Stinted; Youth is the moſt
proper time for Learning. I think I have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
theſe Principles, and have reaſon thence
to conclude, That we ought to chuſe with great
Caution, what is to be Taught to Young Perſons.
But, to make this Choice well, we muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
our ſelves to one certain ſort of Perſons, or
one certain kind of Studies. We ſhould, as
much as poſſible, conſider all at once; all Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of Men, and Knowledge which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for them. Let us conſider all Reaſonable
Creatures of both Sexes, of all Conditions, as
well thoſe which are aſcribed unto Fortune, as
Riches, Poverty, Greatneſs, and the Private
Life; as thoſe which proceed from Choice; as
the Sword, the Gown, Traffick and Trades.
And though we do not conſider them but in one
Age onely, yet we ſhall not fail to examin all the
degrees of them, from the firſt Infancy to the
Ripe Age, and perfect ſtate of each Perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in them.</p>
               <p>As for Knowledge, the Profitable ought well
to be diſtinguiſhed from the Pleaſant; and the
firſt ſhould be divided according to the Three
Sorts of Goods for which they may be uſeful:
The Goods of the Soul; as Underſtanding, and
Vertue: Thoſe of the Body; as Health, and
Strength: And thoſe which are called the Goods
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54201:46"/>
of Fortune, and which are the Subject of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Amongſt thoſe Pieces of Knowledge which
are Profitable, thoſe may be diſtinguiſhed which
are moſt ſo; and they, without which none can
be without, may be reckon'd as Neceſſary. Theſe
Diſtinctions being ſuppoſed, it will be eaſie to
Regulate the Choice of Studies of which we now
Treat. For 'tis evident to any one, how little
ſoever he will follow the Dictates of Reaſon,
that, what immediately concerns our Selves, as
we are Compoſed of Body and Soul, is to be
preffer'd to all that which is without us; and
that amongſt External things, thoſe which are
neceſſary for our Subſiſtence, ought to be choſen
before thoſe, which onely give Pleaſure. It is
ſufficiently clear alſo, that they who have leſs
Leiſure for Study, or leſs Capacity, as Artiſans,
Soldiers, Poor People, and all Women, ought to
be Inſtructed in that Knowledge which is more
Generally Uſeful: For, it is not juſt, that they,
who have Reaſon as well as others, ſhould Live
without any Inſtruction at all. To Conclude,
as for the Diſtinction of Ages, it is evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that Children muſt be ſo managed, that
they be not over-charged at firſt; and yet, that
the Time, when they are moſt capable to Learn,
ſhould not be ſuffer'd to be ſpent unprofitably.
I ſhall follow theſe Diſtinctions through all the
reſt of this <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> and firſt, ſhall examin the
Studies which are moſt neceſſary to all the World;
afterwards thoſe which are of no uſe, but to them
who have moſt Leiſure (as the Rich, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
<hi>&amp;c.)</hi> whether they be thoſe which are
very profitable, or thoſe which are the moſt Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
Afterwards, I ſhall obſerve in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54201:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Studies may be Taught to Youth. And Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I ſhall ſhew which are thoſe, every Man
ought to Apply himſelf unto, all the reſt of his
Life, according to the Profeſſion which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces.</p>
               <p>AMongſt the Inſtructions neceſſary to all the
World, the Care of the <hi>Soul</hi> is moſt urgent:
and it concerns us more to Govern our <hi>Wills</hi> well,
than to enlarge our <hi>Knowledge.</hi> The firſt Study
therefore is that of <hi>Vertue.</hi> All Men are not
bound to have Wit, to be Learned, and Expert
in Buſineſs, to excel in ſome ſort of Profeſſion;
but there is none, of what Sex and Condition
ſoever he be, who is not obliged to live well. All
other Goods, without this, are unprofitable, ſince
this ſhews the uſe of the other. We can never
have enough of this, and yet the greateſt part
of Men have ſo little of it, that thereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
how difficult it is to attain it. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
therefore Labour after this too ſoon, and
ought not to think, that <hi>Morality</hi> may be deferr'd
to the end of our Studies, and then that we
ſhould onely beſtow but a little part of our time
upon it, and thence preſently paſs to another Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
For it ſhould he begun from the Cradle, at
leaſt as ſoon as the Child is put into the Nurſes
Arms, and continued as long as he is under Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Maſter has hitherto done nothing, if
his Scholar goes not from him with Reſolutions
to apply himſelf unto it all his Life. I know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, that it is the Church, from whom the
Faithful ought to Learn <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi>
and that the True Profeſſors of this <hi>Science,</hi> are
the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> But it is but too well
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54201:47"/>
known how little effect publick inſtructions
have, at leaſt, if Domeſtick inſtructions do not
aſſiſt, and prepare the way for them.</p>
               <p>Divers Methods, according to the condition of
the Child, ought here to be obſerved, by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it to him, much leſs at the beginning,
than when Reaſon begins to exert it ſelf in him,
and always to augment your inſtructions, as
it only grows ſtronger. At firſt, Maxims
ought to be laid down, without rendring a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of them; there will be a time to do that
afterwards.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I ſuppoſe a Morality, which is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
whoſe Precepts are founded upon the Doctrins
of Faith. I would begin with theſe Doctrins, firſt
of all to inſtruct the Child. I have already touch'd
upon this, when I ſaid, we ought to begin with
them, by teaching them Matters of Fact, and
mentioned thoſe, which ſhould be firſt planted
in their Memories. For the firſt inſtructions
of Religion ſhould then be inſtill'd into them,
when it is not yet adviſable to imploy them in
any formal Leſſons; being careful to recount
to them a great many Matters of Fact, and
Maxims, to the end, that they may be furniſhed
with Principles of Reaſoning, when they ſhall
afterwards come to have the ſtrength of Attention,
and the habit of Thinking. Theſe Diſcourſes
will be as it were, Seeds ſown at all Adventures,
which ſpring up, and bring forth more or leſs,
as the Soil is fruitful, and Heaven is favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here dilate upon the particular
Method of Teaching Religion. What I have
ſaid upon this ſubject, may be ſeen in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54201:47"/>
to the Hiſtorical <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> When Children
have learn'd this <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> or any other that is
better, and are capable to read the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi>
care ſhould be taken to make them know the
outward beauties thereof; I mean, the Excellency
of the different Styles that they obſerve in the
Hiſtories, how Choice and Orderly plac'd the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact are; how ſhort, lively, and (at the ſame
time) how clear the Narration is: That they take
notice, in the Poetry of the Nobleneſs of the
Elocution, the variety of Figures, the ſublimity
of the thoughts: In the Moral Books, of the
Elegance, and Brevity of the Sentences; in the
Prophets, the vehemence of the Reproaches and
Threatnings, and the richneſs of the Expreſſions:
That all this be ſhewed to them, by compariſon
with prophane Authors, whom the Learned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
ſo much; and that it be by no means
forgotten to ſignifie unto them, that the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations
do not come up to the beauty of the
Original Language. The ſame prophane Authors
will further help them to underſtand the Manners
of this firſt Antiquity, and cauſe them not to be
ſurprized by a great many Modes of Acting and
Speaking, which offend the ignorant, when they
read the <hi>Scripture;</hi> which is that which I have
endeavoured to do, in the <hi>Manners of the</hi>
Iſraelites.</p>
               <p>I believe it will be uſeful to give them ſome
ſlight Knowledge of the Fathers, and other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Authors; for I am concerned to ſee,
that the moſt part of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who Study,
know <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> better than St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
or St. <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> You'll ſay, perhaps, that in
them we do not meet with that Wit and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54201:48"/>
which we find in the <hi>Pagan</hi> Authors; and
that <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Authors are proper for none but
Prieſts and Devout Perſons: Their Title <hi>Holy,</hi>
is a prejudice to them; and doubtleſs, makes
many Perſons believe, that their Works are full
only of ungrateful Exhortations, or Meditations.
Men ſeek Philoſophy in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and put him
to the Torture, much againſt his Will, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
him to Chriſtianity; and yet, they
have in St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> a Philoſophy altogether Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;
at leaſt, <hi>Morality, Metaphyſicks,</hi> and the
moſt ſolid part of <hi>Logick:</hi> For, as for natural
Philoſophy, he did not apply himſelf thereto.
Why ſhould we not ſeek for Eloquence in St.
<hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> in St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and in St.
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> as well as in <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero?</hi>
And why in them ſhould we not alſo look for
<hi>Morality,</hi> rather then in <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Seneca? Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius,</hi>
indeed, is not ſo good a Poet as <hi>Horace</hi>
was; but he is not to be deſpiſed, for he has Writ
with a great deal of Wit and Elegance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
borrowing the Ornaments of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
which did not agree with his ſubject.
In a word, I would have the young Man early
advertiſed, that ſeveral Saints, even thoſe who
were moſt zealous for Religion, and moſt ſevere
in their Manners, as St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi>
St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> were great Wits, and very polite
Men; and if they have undervalued <hi>Human Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and the <hi>Sciences,</hi> it was not becauſe they wanted
knowledge, but becauſe they knew better.</p>
               <p>Moreover, to balance the Human Vertues
which are to be ſeen amongſt the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Romans,</hi> I would make my Scholar obſerve,
not only the ſame kind of Vertues, but much
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54201:48"/>
greater, and others altogether unknown to the
<hi>Pagans,</hi> ſuch as are to be found, either in the Holy
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> or the moſt approved <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.</hi>
I would let him ſee the Wiſdom and
the Conſtancy of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> by the moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Acts yet remaining, as thoſe of St. <hi>Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
Prieſt of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> of St. <hi>Euplius</hi> Deacon of
<hi>Catanea</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> of Pope <hi>Stephen,</hi> and of ſo many
others: The reading of which is moſt delightful.
I ſhould make him admire the Patience, and
Angelick Purity of the Solitary, by the Relations
of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom, Palladius, Caſſian,</hi> and
many other grave Authors. Laſtly, I would
let him know thoſe, who lived as good <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
in the midſt of worldly Buſineſs, and great
Imploys; as the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> St. <hi>Pulche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
Charlemaign,</hi> St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> Though it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to know that there never was any Age
wherein the Church had not her great Saints;
and to obſerve their different Characters: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
to have a great and holy <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi>
it is adviſeable chiefly to dwell upon the
firſt Ages, wherein the Vertues were more
frequent, and the Diſcipline more vigorous.
Thus the Manners of the Chriſtians, whether in
the times of Perſecution, or the beginning of
the Churches Liberty, ſhould be plainly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Their <hi>Domeſtick</hi> way of Living, the Form
of their Aſſemblies, the Prayers, Faſtings and
Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, particularly of
Penitence: All this might be related very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.
A young Man that had theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> of
<hi>Religion,</hi> would have the great Principles of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi>
or rather, he would have the thing it ſelf.
For I would adviſe, that during this time, he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54201:49"/>
ſhould be Taught the Rules thereof, by the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> particularly the <hi>Epistles</hi> and
<hi>Goſpels</hi> for <hi>Sundays,</hi> the principal <hi>Holy-days,</hi> and
<hi>Lent,</hi> and ſome little <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as the
Confeſſions of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> the Offices of St.
<hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the Conſiderations of St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> And
becauſe this Study ſhould be carryed on by little
and little, together with other Studies of <hi>Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> care ſhould be taken in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of prophane Authors, to advertiſe him of all
the Errours which are to be met with in them,
and the imperfection of their pureſt <hi>Morality,</hi> in
Compariſon with the Chriſtian; to the end, that
he may value theſe Authors no more than they
deſerve.</p>
               <p>It is very uſeful to accuſtom Children to judge
of that which they read, and often to ask them
what they think of ſuch a Maxim, or ſuch an
Action, and what they would have done upon
ſuch an occaſion. Hereby their Sentiments are
Diſcovered, which if bad, may be rectified; if
right, encouraged. It is good alſo to Exerciſe
them without Books, upon the ſubjects of which
they can talk; as upon the occurrences of Life,
chiefly upon their little differences; if ſeveral of
them be brought up together, the Matter will
more affect them, and they will better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Maxims. For here we ought not to
deceive our ſelves, as if Study conſiſted only in
reading of Books. All that is uſeful to know,
has not yet been Written; and 'tis impoſſible to
Read all that has been Written. We ſhould account
Reflexion and Converſation to be a great part of
our Study. There are a great many things not
to be learn'd, but by Tradition and <hi>Viva voce;</hi>
and alſo there are ſome which every one appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54201:49"/>
by obſerving what others do, and Reflecting
upon himſelf. But 'tis chiefly <hi>Morality</hi> which is
thus learn'd: Every one Forms his Maxims,
much leſs from that which he reads, than from
that which he hears ſpoken; eſpecially in familiar
Converſation, which he thinks more ſincere than
publick Diſcourſes; and from that which he ſees
thoſe do, whom he accounts moſt rational. Hence
it is, that Example and Authority have ſo great
an effect upon Manners. For, ſeeing there are
but few Perſons who have Strength and Patience
enough for Reaſoning (eſpecially amongſt Youth)
and yet none would willingly be deceived: It
follows, that they will believe the Wiſeſt, yet,
not ſo much what they ſay, as what they do;
becauſe Actions are ſurer Proofs of their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than Words.</p>
               <p>And here; behold the great difficulty we meet
with in Teaching <hi>Morality,</hi> I mean ill Example,
and the Corruption of Manners, not only in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
but often alſo in private: For, you do well
to tell a young Perſon what you know to be the
beſt, and to convince him by ſtrong Reaſons.
But he has always in the bottom of his Soul, a
violent Prejudice, which renders all your Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
Suſpicious; and this is the common Opinion.
It ſeems to him, that common ſenſe requires, he
ſhould prefer it to yours, and that 'tis more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to ſuppoſe that you are deceived, than
that all the reſt of Mankind are ſo: And if, by
chance, the Maſter ſhall diſcover any Weakneſs
(as where is the Man, who doth not betray ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it ſometimes?) If he be peeviſh, if his
Manners be ungrateful, or ſingular; in a word,
if he comes (through his own fault, or otherwiſe)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54201:50"/>
to be hated, or deſpiſed; Preſumption preſently
becomes a Conviction, and his Remonſtrances
have no further effect; unleſs it be to prejudice
the Truth, and to render good Maxims odious,
or ridiculous to the Scholar, all the reſt of his
Life. Men much rather follow the Maxims of
thoſe, whom they Eſteem, and Love; and (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men Act by imagination, eſpecially in their
younger Years) they eſteem, or love thoſe, who
are grateful to them, or ſeem to be happy, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality, the Rich, thoſe who have a
good Mien, who Speak well, who are Straight
and handſom Men. Now theſe ſhining Qualities
are much more ordinarily to be met with in thoſe
who have leſs Vertue, and more rarely in thoſe
who Teach, than in others. Beſides, there are
ſome Men by general Preſcription, are ſuppoſed
to be Wiſe and Vertuous, and yet are not ſo in
effect; as ſome Fathers, old Men, Magiſtrates,
and perhaps alſo Clergymen and Religious. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that young Perſons, though never ſo
well inclin'd, are very hard put to it, how to
chuſe thoſe whom they ought to follow. In
the mean time, their Paſſions grow, become
ſtronger, and hold Intelligence with thoſe many
Enemies which attack them from without.</p>
               <p>Yet all theſe difficulties ſhould not diſcourage
us; and though we ought to hope for nothing,
but by the Power of the Divine Grace; yet it
is not ſufficient only to implore this Aſſiſtance
by continual Prayer, all Human means ſhould
alſo be imploy'd. The Succeſs which doth not
depend upon us, ſhall not be reckoned to us,
neither ſhall we be Reproached for it; and
whatſoever ſhall become of the Scholar, the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54201:50"/>
Maſter ſhall be puniſhed for his negligence, or
rewarded for his pains. Admoniſh therefore your
Charge, that to do well, he muſt draw himſelf out
of the Crowd, and not follow the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
Prove it to him, both by the Authority of the
Goſpel, and by Reaſon, ſince whatſoever Principle
of <hi>Morality</hi> you ground him in, all that you can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
good in the World, will be very little, in
Compariſon of the contrary Evil. There are few
Rich Men, a great many Poor; few that enjoy Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and Honours; few Learned, few Wiſe Men,
abundance of Sots and ignorant Perſons; very little
Vertue, in what ſenſe ſoever you underſtand it.
Make him obſerve that there is ſcarce any one
whoſe actions are all of a piece, and who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows

It cannot be avoided, but that Men will fall into
theſe abſurdities, unleſs they ſtick to one only

               <p>In truth, it is not <hi>Morality,</hi> if it be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
one, and built upon one only Principle.
You ought not therefore to ſpeak to your Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54201:51"/>
of <hi>Human Morality,</hi> of <hi>Worldly Wiſdom,</hi> of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,</hi>
or the <hi>Prudence</hi> of this <hi>World.</hi> Nothing
of this ſhould enter into his Mind, but it ought
preſently to be balanced with the Maxims of the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> by making him comprehend well, that
we muſt be Chriſtians altogether, or not at all;
that it avails nothing to be ſo by halves, leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abandoned of God, we ſhould renounce our
Baptiſm: It is to belye our ſelves, not to follow
the Law without reſerve, which we have owned
as Divine. But to eſtabliſh a young Man in this
Doctrine, it will not be unuſeful to remove cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
groſs Calumnies, which are often Form'd
againſt <hi>Christian Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſome ſo little acquainted with it,
that they think it allows, or at leaſt, excuſes
Sottiſhneſs, and meanneſs of Spirit; and that
bravery and greatneſs of Mind, are Vertues on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be found in the Men of the World.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, Prudence and Magnanimity are
Vertues recommended in the Scripture, as well
as Temperance and Juſtice; and the contrary
Vices render us no leſs culpable before God,
than before Men. The difference is, that Men
often are not reaſonable enough to excuſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
which are purely involuntary. Beſides,
Devotion is accuſed for making Men ſad; and
if they durſt ſay, it Unhappy; becauſe, a great
many of thoſe who paſs for Devout Perſons,
are ill Humour'd, Critical, and Complaining,
whereas, nothing is farther from <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> for
that is a Spirit of Sweetneſs, Tranquility and
Joy: And Melancholy, is reckoned by the moſt
ancient Spiritualiſts, amongſt the Seven or Eight
Sources of all Sins, as well as Gluttony and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

Beſides theſe Conſiderations, and many other
ſuch-like, which may be uſeful to weaken the
Objections againſt <hi>Morality,</hi> or altogether to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them according to the Maſters ability,
and the Scholars Docibility: Method is of great
Conſequence, for there is no part of Studies which
requires ſo much Art and Care. If Children at
firſt be over-charged with many Precepts, they
are tired, and diſcouraged, or if they take Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in them, they are apt to grow Conceited,
and to read Lectures of <hi>Morality</hi> before their
time. They are admired and commended for
the fine Diſcourſes they Rehearſe, which infuſes a
great deal of Vanity into them. Nevertheleſs,
they ceaſe not, at the ſame time, to act as
Children, that is to ſay, to follow their Paſſions;
inſomuch, that they ſo ſoon accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſpeak well, and do badly, that they
become more incorrigible than others; becauſe
the excellent Maxims which they know by
Heart, when yet they do not Practiſe them, do
not affect them at all; and becauſe they think
they know more of them, than they who would
Correct them. 'Tis alſo very dangerous to make
them reflect upon their Faults, without ſeriouſly
endeavouring to bring them to amend them:
Otherwiſe, theſe Reflections will be like thoſe
idle Diſcourſes of ſuch as tire the World, by
telling of their Faults, as well as of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers;
meerly out of Vanity, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
admired and diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of
Mankind, by the delicacy and unaccountableneſs
of their Sentiments. I am, ſay they, ſtrangely
afraid of Thunder: I have a wonderful averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Sots: I am impatient with my Servants.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54201:52"/>
I am very apt, every Moment, to be Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
with Paſſion: And an Hundred ſuch
like Fooleries which they complain of, as of their
Megrims, and their Vapours. Nothing is more
pernicious to a Child, than to accuſtom him to
this ſort of Language: The ſureſt way is, to
make him put your Directions into Practice, and
as much as lies in you, make him ſenſible of all
that you ſay, by his own Experience. Some
Men have heard much Diſcourſes about <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
and have ſpoke of it much themſelves, who
yet are ignorant; that what we call the <hi>Paſſions,</hi>
are thoſe lively Motions which a Man feels in
his Heart, and in his Bowels; when he fears,
deſires, and is in anger. He is accuſtomed to
ſpeak of them, as of the Heavens, the Stars, and
of all things without him. Young Men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhould be ſhown by the Finger, and by the
Eye (as I may ſo ſay) what is every Vertue, every
Vice, every Paſſion, both in thoſe with whom
they converſe, and Principally in themſelves. But
above all things (as I have ſaid) they muſt be
taught to practiſe that which they know; and
in this, there is need of great Patience and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
They are Weak and Light every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
they fall, and fall again into the ſame
Faults. They eaſily forget all their <hi>Morality,</hi>
when a new object of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> preſents it ſelf:
And though they ſhould recal themſelves, they
have not ſtrength enough to reſiſt it. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that they ſhould attain, in a few days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this firmneſs of Mind, is to expect, that a
young Plant, ſet to Day, ſhould to Morrow
have a ſolid Trunk, and deep Roots. We ought to
wait a long time, and not to think it too much to
Labour often, and Water the Soil daily.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54201:52"/>
This Levity of Children is indeed hard to be
born with: But doth it not excite our Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
rather becauſe it is Irkſome to us, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it harms them? Let us enter into our ſelves,
Are we proportionably wiſer than they, in reſpect
of the more perfect Age to which we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd?
Have we not, as well as they, our
Paſſions? Are we not addicted to our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures?
And if our Divertiſements ſeem to us to
be more ſolid than theirs, perhaps to Men more
wiſe than we are, they would appear more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.
Let us make the Compariſon with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
Let us ſuppoſe our ſelves at the Age of
our Scholars, and ingenuouſly confeſs, that at
that Age, their Thoughts were ours. Thus we
ſhall find all Children to be very near a-like. I
ſay this, not as if we ſhould neglect in others,
the Faults of which we our ſelves are, or have
been guilty; nor as if our Scholars ought to take
Advantage thereof, if they ſhould happen to
come to the knowledge of them: But I ſay that
this conſideration ſhould make us very gentle and
patient; leaſt by preſſing a Young Man too
much, to aſcend all at once to the higheſt Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of Vertue, by the moſt difficult ways, we
caſt him into Deſpair.</p>
               <p>The Inſtructions therefore of <hi>Morality</hi> ſhould
be managed with great Caution, and Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to the Scholar's Capacity, and much more
to the Strength of his Soul. We ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
watchful to ſpy out the Propereſt Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when they may be given moſt uſefully, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſcrupulouſly obſerving the order which we
have propoſed to obſerve in Studies. Often, from
ſome fault which your Scholar has committed, or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54201:53"/>
ſome Reflection made by himſelf, or which you
occaſion him to make, by Reading ſome <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
or <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Humanity</hi> to him; you'll have a
fit opportunity to Inſtruct him in ſome <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Maxim,</hi> or to Reſcue him from ſome <hi>Error.</hi>
Do not loſe theſe happy Opportunities. Quit all
things for <hi>Morality.</hi> The occaſions of Teaching
him <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or <hi>Humanity,</hi> will occur oft enough;
but your <hi>Scholar</hi> perhaps may come no more to
be in ſo favourable a Diſpoſition: And that
which is thus ſaid, beſides the Buſineſs, as it
were, and without Deſign, doth ordinarily more
good, than that which is diſcours'd to him in a
Formal Lecture; where he is upon his Guard,
becauſe he knows that you will ſpeak of <hi>Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
before-hand. We ought not to be afraid of
making Digreſſions, which Treat of ſomething
more uſeful, than the Subject at firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

either from <hi>Pride,</hi> or a <hi>Contempt</hi> of others;

Inſomuch that it is impoſſible but a Man

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54201:53"/>
the <hi>Ancient Monks</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt,</hi>
who were <hi>Courteous</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> in the moſt <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightful
Solitudes. Converſation</hi> with the <hi>World</hi>
is indeed a ſhorter way to <hi>Good Breeding:</hi> and
the Neceſſity of being continually one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Obliges Men, at leaſt, to have all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of <hi>Vertue,</hi> which may render <hi>Society</hi>
eaſie. And uſually they go no further than
theſe Appearances, making <hi>Civility</hi> onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in an Habit of hiding ones <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guizing
his <hi>Sentiments,</hi> that ſo he may teſtifie that
Reſpect, or Friendſhip for others, which moſt
commonly he has not. So that <hi>Civility</hi> prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the Subſtantial part of <hi>Vertue;</hi> whereas it
ſhould be a Conſequence of it, and like that
<hi>Flower of Beauty</hi> which naturally accompanies an
Healthful Body.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs theſe Flattering Compliments,
and Appearances of <hi>Civility,</hi> are generally the
firſt Inſtructions given unto <hi>Children;</hi> and thoſe
which are the moſt Inculcated, as if all Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
conſiſted in this.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſs theſe Expreſſions of <hi>Submiſſion,
Eſteem</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> would be Excellent, if they
were True; for then we ſhould be all Humble
and Charitable. But ſince it is not ſo, it would
be better to Talk more Truly; or rather to Talk
leſs, and Doe more. <hi>There is a great difference
betwixt ſhewing Contempt, and teſtifying Eſteem,
or Reſpect to all without diſtinction.</hi> And that
which ſhews the Ridiculouſneſs of our Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are the ſerious Tranſactions of Buſineſs;
where the Language is wholly changed; and
where the leaſt Intereſt is Diſputed with them,
unto whom the Moment before, we ſeemed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54201:54"/>
to have granted every thing. <hi>Children,</hi> not
having, as yet, Judgment enough to diſtinguiſh
the different Subjects and Occaſions, accuſtom
themſelves from theſe firſt Inſtructions, to Lye,
and Diſſemble upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>Beſides, an abundance of Unprofitable Lyes
are told in this Matter. <hi>Civility</hi> conſiſts more in
abſtaining from what may be troubleſome to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in being <hi>Gentle, Modeſt</hi> and <hi>Patient,</hi> than in
Speaking much, and uſing much Cringing. One
Obliging word, well placed, gains more upon us,
then all the Great Complements with which
ſome <hi>Country Gentlemen</hi> do oppreſs us. They who
equally Careſs and Honour all Men, Oblige
none; and have nothing whereby to ſignifie their
True Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>But the worſt ſort of <hi>Civility,</hi> is that, which
conſiſts in Conſtrain'd and Forc'd kinds of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures;
That <hi>Methodical Civility,</hi> which appears one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Forms of ſome Starch'd Compliments,
and Impertinent Ceremonies, and which are
more Ungrateful than <hi>Natural Clowniſhneſs:</hi> This
Affectation to do all things in Mode and Figure,
is one of the Principal Characters of a Pedant.
And for this Reaſon <hi>Scholars</hi> ought, above all
things, to avoid it. For, ſince their Condition
reſtrains them, for the moſt part, from Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with Great Men, which requires an extreme
Politeneſs; I think that their <hi>Civility</hi> conſiſts
chiefly in knowing how to hold their Peace,
without affecting Silence; and, in ſpeaking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what they know, and as much as
<hi>Charity</hi> requires for the Inſtruction, and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Neighbours; and, as for other things,
to Speak and Act juſt like other Men: And
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54201:54"/>
becauſe Faults are more ſenſible in Feigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations,

all; For, in Truth, this is nothing elſe but <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</hi>
And the firſt Objects to which we ſhould

which <hi>Socrates</hi> profeſt to Teach, when he ſaid,
<hi>That it was the Midwiſe to Mens Minds: That it

made them onely call to Mind what they knew before.</hi>
In truth, as I have already obſerved, 'tis not in our
Power to Imprint in Children the moſt <hi>Simple
Notions,</hi> which are the Foundations or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all others. I call the Foundations of
<hi>Knowledge, Simple Ideas;</hi> as the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Being,</hi> of

Number, Motion, Duration:</hi> The <hi>Sentiments;</hi>
as the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>White, Heat, Grief, Fear, Anger,

the firſt Principles do belong to theſe Foundations;
as, <hi>The Relation betwixt the whole, and its part; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
produces nothing; Beings ought not to be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd
without Neceſſity; The Will always ſeeks after
Happineſs.</hi> We bring into the World with us
theſe kind of Thoughts, and Judgments, which
are the Foundations of all other Judgments and
Reaſonings, which we make as long as we live:
and it is the Attentive Conſideration of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
by Abſtracting them from other Notions
leſs clear, and leſs certain, and which are onely
the Conſequences of them: 'Tis this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I ſay, which, is properly, that which is
called <hi>Metaphyſick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Logick</hi> is the Conſideration of
other <hi>Ideas,</hi> and other <hi>Judgments,</hi> which are no
leſs clear, and certain, and are alſo born with us;
but ſuch as reſpect rather our Knowledge, than the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54201:55"/>
Objects of it. And hence it is, that I call them
Inſtruments. Such are the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>True</hi> and
<hi>Falſe; Affirmation</hi> and <hi>Negation; Error</hi> and <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
and, above all, the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Conſequence,</hi>
whereby we underſtand that ſuch a certain <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
follows from another certain one; that ſuch
a <hi>Reaſon</hi> is <hi>Concluding,</hi> and that ſuch an one is
<hi>not.</hi> None of theſe Notions can be given to
thoſe who have them not, and there is no Man
that hath them not, if he hath the uſe of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi>
for herein preciſely it doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> are not, as 'tis ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuppoſed, difficult <hi>Studies</hi> of Abſtracted and
High flown things, and which do not concern
us; nor of fine <hi>Speculations,</hi> which appertain onely
to the Learned. They are of uſe to all the
World, becauſe they have for their Object, that
onely, which paſſes within our ſelves, and which
we know the beſt; and have no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
but to accuſtom our ſelves never to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
nor to reſt ſatisfy'd but with clear <hi>Ideas;</hi>
and not to be over-haſty in paſſing Judgment, and
drawing of <hi>Conſequences</hi> therefrom. It is to be
wiſht that all, which doth not truly ſerve this end,
might be taken away from them.</p>
               <p>Without entering here, in particular, upon this
Inſtruction (ſince I do not Write a <hi>Logick)</hi> I
ſhould deſire, that a Child be early accuſtomed, to
ſay nothing but what he underſtands, and not
have any <hi>Ideas,</hi> but the cleareſt that poſſibly can
be. To this end, in all that he ſhould Learn, he
ought continually to be Exerciſed in Dividing and
Defining, that hereby he might Learn exactly to
diſtinguiſh each thing from others, and to give to
every thing that which appertains unto it. Not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54201:56"/>
that I would, as yet, charge his Memory with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,
and the Rules of Diviſion and Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but make him Practiſe them, upon thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which ſhould be moſt familiar unto him.
When he ſhall have ſtrength enough to retain
ſeveral <hi>Ideas,</hi> or ſeveral <hi>Judgments</hi> likewiſe, at once,
I would make him apprehend the difference of
True, of Falſe, of Uncertain; and I would
Convince him, that he ought not to deny every
thing, nor to doubt of every thing; but that 'tis
neceſſary to follow ſome certain Rules in paſſing
our Judgments. In the next place, I would have
him to obſerve thoſe Truths, which are the firſt,
in the order of Knowledge, and, upon the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of which, depends that of all the reſt: Whence
would follow the Knowledge of the Soul, and
its diſtinction from the Body, the Knowledge of
God, and the Rules of True, and Falſe: from
which all the reſt of <hi>Logick</hi> might be eaſily dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
I would have it to conſiſt in a very few
Precepts, that is, as many, neither more, nor leſs
than ſuch, as ſhould really aſſiſt Reaſon. For, if
upon ſtrict examination, it did appear, that Men
might Reaſon as Surely, and as Juſtly, without all
theſe Obſervations, I ſhould Condemn them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon this one account, that they would be
Unprofitable; and ſhould place them in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Curioſities,</hi> how True and Pretty ſoever
they may be. But doubtleſs it will be found, that
ſome Rules of <hi>Logick</hi> (to how little a number ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they be reduc'd) will be very uſeful to help
<hi>Reaſon:</hi> and alſo ſome Axioms of <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> to
which every Man, that Reaſoneth, will be obliged
to have Recourſe; and which, conſequently, will
be the Foundation of all his Reaſonings.</p>

All the World ſees the Uſefulneſs of Reaſoning
juſtly, and upon Solid Principles (I do not ſay one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Sciences,</hi> but in <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and in all the Affairs

of others, or their own Paſſions has Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
upon their Mind, to the Means, neceſſary
to acquire that which they deſire. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
I ought to be Rich: Therefore I will take
upon me ſuch an Imployment; I will take ſuch a
Journey; I will ſuffer this, and that; and ſo of
the reſt. But what ſhall I do with my Wealth,
when I have gotten it? But is it really Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to be Rich? This is that which they do
not at all inquire after. They, who Reaſon thus,
never had other than Vulgar Spirits, of what
Profeſſion ſoever they were: though they were
the Learned, and the Doctors; though they
were Miniſters of State; though they were Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I call that a Vulgar Spirit, which is limited
to certain Pieces of Knowledge, which is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
but upon particulars, and Reaſoneth onely
upon Experience. And I find, that one of this
Spirit is always the ſame, what Object ſoever he
propoſes to himſelf. He doth not become great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for applying himſelf to Publick Affairs; and
is not more Knowing for concerning himſelf in
matters of Science. He will never do more than
Reaſon probably upon the Experience of that
which he has Read, and gueſs at one Fact from
another; but he will never go ſo far, as to Judge
of what he Reads, and refer every thing to its
proper uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:54201:57"/>
He who is truly Learned, and truly a <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi>
goes further, and begins higher. He takes
not up with the Authority of others, nor with
his own Prejudices; but riſes always, till he has
found a Principle of Natural Light, and a Truth
ſo clear, that he cannot call it into queſtion. And,
when he hath once found it, he, with aſſurance,
draws from it all its Conſequences, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
from it. Whence it comes to paſs that he
is firm in his Doctrin, and in his Conduct; that
he is inflexible in his Reſolutions, patient in the
Execution, equal in his Humour, and conſtant in
his Vertue. Now this Learned, this Wiſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may be found in all Conditions. Amongſt
the Patriarchs we have Examples of Wiſe <hi>Shepherds</hi>
and <hi>Husbandmen;</hi> amongſt the Ancient <hi>Monks,</hi> of
Wiſe <hi>Artiſans;</hi> and of what Profeſſion ſoever a
Man is, he will never be as happy as he can be
in this Life, if he acts not upon certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
or if a moſt immoveable Faith doth not
ſupply the defect of Reaſoning. But to ſpeak in
our own way, and with Relation to thoſe who
have uſed to Study amongſt us, theſe Solid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
and theſe certain Principles are chiefly
neceſſary unto thoſe who are to Conduct others;
as <hi>Clergymen, Magiſtrates,</hi> and thoſe who Govern,
or are concern'd in the Management of Publick
Affairs. To Speak better, we ought not
to reckon, that there are any <hi>True Studies</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this Foundation: for, to know matters of
Fact, and gain Experience, Uſe is ſufficient; or if
Reading be joyned thereunto, there is no need of
much Inſtruction. But to form the Mind, for a
Man to ſee clearly what he doth, to conduct
himſelf by ſure Evidence, and not by uncertain
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54201:57"/>
Opinion; This is what ought to be ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and it is this Inquiry which ought to be called
<hi>Study.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt part of Men are more capable of
this <hi>Philoſophy</hi> than is believed. It requires no
Extraordinary Talent of Memory, Imagination,
and Briskneſs of Spirit; but onely a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Senſe, Attention and Patience: So that
there are none, but very Light Spirits, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attain unto it. Even Peaſants themſelves, if
they be not altogether Stupid, may be often fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inſtructed in this <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> than they who
are more Sprightly.</p>
               <p>To Conclude, Every one muſt be managed
according to his Genious; and the <hi>Maſter</hi> ought
not to ſpend ſo much time in the Inſtruction of
thoſe whom he Teaches with Pleaſure, becauſe
their Minds are open to receive what he ſays; as
thereby to neglect others, becauſe they put him
to more trouble. On the contrary, theſe laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
more Care, more Affection, and more Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
in the Inſtructor: and 'tis a ſad thing, yet
not to be remedied, that the moſt ignorant, and
dulleſt Learners, have ordinarily the worſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, ſince I have enter'd upon the Subject, I
will go on to Explain my ſelf concerning <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</hi>
I think that a <hi>Maſter</hi> ſhould endeavour to
make all thoſe under his Charge <hi>Philoſophers;</hi>
Principally ſuch, whom he ſees to have good
<hi>Natural Parts:</hi> but he muſt not wait till he has
a conſiderable number of ſuch who ſhall ſucceed
therein. It is a great Undertaking to form one
True <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> that is to ſay, one Man who
Reaſons aright, who is always upon his Guard
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54201:58"/>
againſt all the Cauſes of Error; who, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of his Life, follows onely Reaſon and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
who ſeeks, in all things, to know the Truth,
and to aſcend unto the firſt Cauſes. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of Men, 'tis true, would be capable of
this, if they did uſe their Reaſon well, and if
they were not precipitant in their Judgments. But
'tis rare to find any of them, whoſe Will is ſo
Regular, and Strength ſo much, as to be able to
reſiſt their Paſſions. It muſt alſo be confeſt, that
the greateſt part of the Profeſſions of Life, may
be perform'd reaſonably well, without coming to
this Perfection. One may be a good <hi>Phyſician,</hi>
provided he knows the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the
moſt Aſſured Remedies approved by Experience.
For though a Man ſhould know all that has been
yet diſcovered in <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> to this preſent
time, he would ſcarce know the firſt Cauſes of
Diſtempers any better thereby. Skill in the Law
obliges a Man to go no higher, and to ſeek for no
other Principles of Reaſoning, than the Laws al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Eſtabliſhed among Men: The reſt belongs
to the Legiſlatour. The <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers, whoſe
Deciſions we do with Reaſon admire, were no <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi>
at all; and this <hi>Science</hi> was form'd at
<hi>Rome,</hi> before they knew either <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> or <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar.</hi>
As for <hi>War,</hi> 'tis evident likewiſe, by the
<hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, and moſt Nations, that there
is no need of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> to be a good Soldier. The
<hi>Romans</hi> were never greater Warriours, than whilſt
they continued in their Ignorance. <hi>Mummius</hi> and
<hi>Marius</hi> were not leſs skilful therein, than <hi>Pompey</hi>
and <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and theſe laſt, though they were more
Learned, were not more <hi>Philoſophers</hi> than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As for other Profeſſions leſs conſiderable, as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54201:58"/>
Husbandry and Trades; Philoſophy is not at all
required of them, who apply themſelves unto
them; though the moſt uſeful Arts were not
at firſt invented without Philoſophy. I know,
that 'tis believed, that it is uſeful to Divinity;
and it is indeed to be deſired, that all <hi>Clergy-men</hi>
were true <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> But yet I have ſhown,
that, in the firſt Ages of the Church, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
made little account of <hi>Human Philoſophy:</hi>
Nevertheleſs, it cannot be doubted, but that the
Biſhops and Prieſts of that Time, did perfectly
well diſcharge all their Duties. I leave it to thoſe
who Labour uſefully in the Church, to judge,
whether that which they have learn'd of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi>
be of any great uſe to them, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Souls.</p>
               <p>But as to the reſt, ſince a Man ſhould neither
be deceived himſelf, nor deceive others; I would
not give the name of Philoſopher, but to him,
who ſhould really deſerve it. I would not make
my Scholar ſo vain, as to believe himſelf to be a
Philoſopher, becauſe he can ſay ſome diſtinctions
and diviſions by Heart, though he be never the
wiſer or better for them: I would not contribute
any thing to the making this great name deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the unlearned. For Women, and Men
of the World, judge of the ancient Philoſophers,
by the moderns, and equally deſpiſe them all.
Hence it is, that <hi>Plato,</hi> of all prophane Authors,
the moſt Excellent, and moſt Delightful, is little
Read, even by the Learned, and not yet Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into our Language. Hence it is, that they
who read the Tranſlations, of <hi>Xenophon, Epictetus,</hi>
and others, do admire that theſe Philoſophers
reaſoned ſo well. 'Tis the ſame abuſe, that has
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54201:59"/>
brought into diſ-eſteem the name of <hi>Rhetorick,
Poetry,</hi> and the greateſt part of the Liberal Arts;
and which has given falſe <hi>Ideas</hi> of them, which
makes us practiſe them ſo ill. For 'tis natural to
believe, that a thing is really that, which its
name imports.</p>
               <p>Therefore, although it is to be wiſh'd, that
all Men (at leaſt they who Study) were truly
Philoſophers, yet, there is ſo little reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it; that it ſeems to me, that the greateſt
part of Men, ought not to pretend to it. At
leaſt, all the Philoſophy they ought to learn,
ſhould be reduc'd to a good <hi>Logick:</hi> The reſt is
not neceſſary for the attaining other Sciences.
On the contrary, all the Sciences joyned to the
practice of all Vertues, make up the true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher;
to which, therefore we cannot arrive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Age of Maturity (if any one be ſo
happy, as ever to attain unto it.) But, it is more
certain, that <hi>Grammar, Rhetorick,</hi> and whatſoever
goes under the name of Humanity, are not at
all neceſſary to <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Logick.</hi> To learn
how to reaſon well, there is no neceſſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Latin,</hi> or any other Language; it might be
Taught to a <hi>Mute,</hi> provided there were ſigns di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
enough, to Explain to him the Reflections
upon Thoughts. Eloquence ſuppoſes Reaſoning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
formed, ſeeing it adds thereunto Motion,
and Expreſſion; for it doth not (as the Ignorant
believe) conſiſt in ſpeaking fine Words, but in
giving Weight to good Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Since our <hi>Logick</hi> conſiſts not in certain Words
and Rules, wherewith the Memory is charged,
that we may talk of them, or underſtand thoſe
who do ſpeak of them; but in a real Exerciſe of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54201:59"/>
good Reaſoning: It is not to be thought, that it
is to be learn'd only once, as an Hiſtory, and
never after to be minded. It muſt be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practiſed, during the whole courſe of Studies;
and I ſpeak of it in this place, only to obſerve
its Order, and to ſhew that it is of more worth,
and more neceſſary than all the Studies I have
mentioned; at leaſt, then thoſe which conſiſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Knowledge of Matters of Fact, or
things Poſitive and Conjectural.</p>
               <p>But though Reaſoning be neceſſary, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and the Knowledge of particular things, is
ſo likewiſe. A Man cannot be truly learned, nor
eminently skilful, without this depth of Reaſoning
which I have ſpoken of, but he may be skilful
enough to perform the Duties of Common Life,
without this Reaſoning; provided that he has a
particular Knowledge of the things which are
practiſed: Whereas, without this particular Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the beſt general Reaſonings, as long as
they continue <hi>General,</hi> will never come to any
thing. 'Tis theſe general Reaſonings, which have
at all times diſcredited the Philoſophers and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, when to them they did not joyn the
Knowledge of particular things, eſpecially, the
Inſtitutions of Men: And this is the Eſſential
Fault of <hi>Raimund Lullius</hi> his Method, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
its Scholars only in ſuch general Notions,
as are of no uſe; and do not render them, at all,
more Learned in Speculation; ſince they add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to what all Men know naturally, but only
Names, and Arbitrary diſtinctions. I more value
a <hi>Peaſant,</hi> who knows of what Corn the beſt
Bread is made, and how this Corn is made to
increaſe; than a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who reaſons only
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54201:60"/>
upon Goodneſs, Perfection and Infinity, without
ever Deſcending Lower. Let, therefore, your
Scholar have a true and diſtinct underſtanding;
let him reaſon upon general Principles, and put
what he knows into a good Order. But let him
be ſatisfied with a few Principles; and let him be
furniſhed with ſomething to ſet in Order; I mean,
with diſtinct and particular Obſervations.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> HItherto, I have ſpoken only of thoſe Studies
which tend to the perfection of the Soul,<note place="margin">That Men ought to have a care of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note>
by forming the Mind and the Manners. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
alſo muſt be ſaid, of thoſe which may be
uſeful to the Body; ſince, next to our Soul, there
is nothing which ought to be ſo precious to us,
as this other Part of our ſelves: And ſince alſo,
the ſtrict Union of the one with the other, is
the reaſon, why the Soul is not in a condition to
act well, if the Body be not well diſpoſed. I
know that this ſort of Study is not in uſe amongſt
us; we are ſenſible enough, that Health, Strength,
good Behaviour and Beauty, are Goods of the
Body; but we are apt to ſuppoſe, that they muſt
all be given by Nature. The Art of procuring
them, is ſo much forgotten; that, was it not
certain, that the Ancients had it, and alſo had
carry'd it to as great Perfection, it might not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be believed, that it was poſſible. This is
the Art which the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Gymnaſtick;</hi> which
chiefly conſiſted in the Exerciſe of the Body; and
upon this account, it is Foreign to my ſubject;
for I have not undertaken to treat of all that
relates to the Education of Youth, but only of
their Studies. I ſhall therefore leave this Treatiſe
of Exerciſes to ſome Perſon, who ſhall be better
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54201:60"/>
vers'd in it than I am; and I ſhall, in the mean
time, only ſpeak of that Knowledge, which
may be uſeful for the preſervation of Health. I
will not call it by the Name of <hi>Medicks,</hi> becauſe
we do not now undertake this long and difficult
Art, which imploys Men all their Life; and which
is converſant about the healing of Diſeaſes, rather
than the preventing of them: Whereas, that which
I here underſtand by this Study, neceſſary to all
Men, is only ſome certain, plain and eaſie Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
for the preſerving, and increaſing Health.</p>
               <p>I would therefore, from the firſt Infancy, have
Sobriety inſtill'd, as far as this Age is capable
thereof; not by making Children Faſt, for it is
not yet time: But by not permitting them to
Eat as much as they would, nor all that they
have a mind to, nor offering any thing to them
which might Tempt them, or giving them ſuch
Rewards or Puniſhment which depend upon
Eating. In their Preſence, Gluttons and Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Perſon, ſhould be expoſed to Contempt,
ſometimes by way of Raillery, ſometimes by
ſerious Diſcourſe; Diſeaſes and other Miſchiefs
obſerved, which proceed from the Exceſſes of the
Mouth; Sobriety commended, and the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it Demonſtrated: And all theſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as much as may be, ſhould be made, without
ſeeming to have any deſign of inſtructing them,
and without directing your Speech to them, that
ſo they may be leſs upon their Guard: But, above
all, great care muſt be taken, not to bely theſe
Diſcourſes, by any contrary Speeches, or by any
Action. In a word, to enforce them, by your
Example. We ſee, by the Manners of whole
Nations, how powerful the Opinion, Cuſtom,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54201:61"/>
and Impreſſions of Infancy are in this Matter.
Drunkenneſs ſo frequent in the <hi>Northern</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
is a Monſter in <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> live all
their Life upon <hi>Rice, Pulſe,</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> without
Eating <hi>Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Fiſh;</hi> and ſome of them are ſo
Exerciſed in Faſting, that they can abſtain for
Fifteen or Twenty days together, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any Nouriſhment. Perhaps it may be
thought, that theſe things belong rather to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inſtructions; but they are alſo proper means
for preſerving Health: And it is not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to enter, in particular, upon a large deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Vertues. In the mean time, ſince
theſe Inſtructions are uſeful to ſeveral ends, they
are doubtleſs upon that account, the more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
               <p>To be in good Health, it is convenient to
be Neat and Clean, to Breath a pure Air, to
Drink good Waters, to Eat ſimple and plain
Meats; and though Nature ſufficiently teaches all
this; yet, 'tis not amiſs to put Children in Mind
of it, and cauſe them often to Reflect thereupon;
for Cuſtom eaſily gets the Upper-hand. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
gives Strength, doth alſo very much conduce
to Health; which Strength doth neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Now that which Strengthens, is not (as
the Vulgar commonly believe) to Eat much,
and to Drink much Wine, but proportionably to
our Nouriſhment and Reſt, to joyn Labour and
Exerciſe. The Exerciſes moſt in uſe with all
Men, are Walking for a long time together,
Standing upright for a conſiderable while, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Burthens, drawing at Pullies, Running, Leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Swiming, Riding, Exerciſing Arms, playing
at Tennis, and other ſuch-like, according to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54201:61"/>
Ages, Conditions and Profeſſions to which any
one is deſigned. I ſhall leave the particulars to
thoſe, who perhaps, may ſometime give us a
Treatiſe of Exerciſes. I will only obſerve, that
it is of great importance, for Children early to
have a good Eſteem for them; together with a
great Contempt of the Soft and Effeminate
Life.</p>
               <p>He ſhould be Taught, that a Man is capable
of very little, if he cannot (without altering
his Health) ſometimes take exceſſive pains;
breaking, if need be, all the Rules of Sleep and
Diet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In ſhort, that there are many Vertues,
which cannot be practiſed, but with a good Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. iv. 8.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, indeed, <hi>That Bodily Exerciſe
profiteth little:</hi> But he ſays this, in compariſon
with Exerciſes of Godlineſs; and in a time,
when the Emulation of the <hi>Greek Athleticks,</hi>
had carried them to an exceſſive Curioſity. For
many lived under a very ſevere Diſcipline, and
in very great Hardſhip, without any other end,
but to make themſelves admired in the Games.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">1 Cor. ix. 25.</note> elſewhere, makes uſe of this
Example, to ſhew Chriſtians how earneſtly they
ought to ſtrive for the incorruptible Crown.
The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> 'tis true, did not ingage in theſe
<hi>Gymnaſtick</hi> Exerciſes, which would have ſpent
too much of their Time; much leſs in the
Combats and their publick ſhews, founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Idolatry; yet they did not omit to Exerciſe
the Body by uſeful and hard Labours. St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>

adviſe it; and the greateſt part of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Monks</hi> have practiſed it. So that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
doth not ſay that the Exerciſe of the Body is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54201:62"/>
good for nothing; and though he thought it
good for very little, in compariſan of Chriſtian
Vertues, he would doubtleſs have accounted
it great in Reſpect of that which we do now
commonly preferr before it. For that which
now a-days, makes Exerciſes ſo little valued, is,
becauſe they do not conduce to the attaining unto
Honour, or gaining Money; and becauſe they
do not agree with Feaſting, Sleep, and Idleneſs,
wherein the greateſt part of Men make their
happineſs to conſiſt.</p>
               <p>In truth, there are none among us, but they who
are deſigned for the War, to whom any Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
are taught Methodically: And yet, even
herein, there are, in my Opinion, two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Faults. The one, that no care is taken to
Form the Soldiers, who Compoſe the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Troops: They are not taught to
Manage their Arms, and perform their Exerciſes,
till they be Liſted. The other Fault is, that,
in the <hi>Academies,</hi> where Gentlemen are Exerciſed,
no reckoning is made of that which is moſt
eſſential; that is, to make them Healthy, and
render their Bodies Robuſt. For they do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom
young Men to live upon ſimple and
common Meats; to ſuffer ſometimes Hunger,
Heat, Cold, and the injuries of the Weather;
to paſs whole Nights without Sleeping, to
lie uſually Hard, to be upon Horſe-back whole
Days together: In a word, to inure themſelves
to all ſorts of Fatigues. In the mean time, theſe
Fatigues are ordinarily of much more uſe in
War, than Dancing, and the extream fineries of
Fencing, and the Art of Riding. Nevertheleſs,
this care that is taken to Form the Bodies of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54201:62"/>
Gentlemen, as indifferent as it is, is a very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Proof of the uſefulneſs of Exerciſes. Hence,
doubtleſs, it comes to paſs, that Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the Officers of the Army, have ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bodies better made, Walk and Move, in all
Reſpects, with a better Grace, not only than
Artiſans and Citizens, but than the Men of the
Robe, who have not paſs'd through theſe Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Nay, even the meer difference of Labours
has a very great effect, without any care taken
in Education. <hi>Gardiners</hi> and Labouring-Men,
have Bodies generally otherwiſe Formed and
Proportioned, than <hi>Shooe-Makers</hi> and <hi>Taylors,</hi> and
other Sedentary Artiſts. But to ſpeak only of
thoſe, who are Educated with moſt care (though
they are not deſigned for the War,) amongſt ſo
many other things which they are Taught, why
ſhould not the Exerciſe of the Body be one? Is
it becauſe they have a Soul and no Body at all?
Is it becauſe <hi>Latin</hi> and the <hi>College-Philoſophy</hi> are
more neceſſary to them than Health? Let us
confeſs the Truth. It is becauſe we never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
this Matter, we believe, that Health comes
of it ſelf; that we always have enough of it,
and that the moſt important buſineſs, is to get a
great deal of Money, and be preferr'd to high
Imployments; as if we could enjoy theſe Goods,
and theſe Honours without Living, and having
our Health.</p>
               <p>When I ſpeak of having a care of Health, I
do not mean thoſe Cautions of Women, Seden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and Lazy Men, who are feeling their Pulſes
every Moment; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who by fearing Diſeaſes,
are almoſt always Sick, or, at leaſt, imagin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be ſo: Who take Broaths every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54201:63"/>
who cannot Faſt, nor ſuffer Hunger, nor
Eat later, than at ſuch a certain Hour; who
cannot Sleep, if they do not lie very ſoft, and
very far from Noiſe; who never have Window
Shuts, Skreens and Counter-doors enough: In a
word, who are extreamly afraid of the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies.
Theſe Perſons abuſe thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
things, which were invented for the truly
Sick; and for them whoſe Health is impared by
long Labours, or by extream old Age. And that
which ſhews their ſoftneſs, is, that they never
uſe the means which I have mentioned of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Abſtinence; but had rather take a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
than deprive themſelves of a meals Meat.
It is therefore of great Conſequence, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſhould betimes apprehend the Error of theſe
pretended <hi>Valetudinarians;</hi> for they do Educate
Children the worſt of any People. They wrap
and cover them to the end of the Fingers, they
ſuffer them not to do any Exerciſe, leaſt they
ſhould hurt, or over-heat themſelves. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
Purge them at certain Seaſons, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
them ſo much, that they are of a weak
and delicate Complexion, that the poor Children
believe it all their Lives; and pretend thereby to
diſtinguiſh themſelves from the common People,
as well as by their Riches, and Quality. For,
ſince none but the Rich, and ſuch who have
Leiſure, can obſerve all theſe Niceties; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
themſelves, that it appertains to none but
<hi>Peaſants</hi> and <hi>Porters</hi> to have good Bodies; and
pride themſelves in their weakneſs, as a mark of
their Wit. Nevertheleſs, if we would take the
Matter aright, a Man ought more to be aſhamed
for being weak, and unhealthy, than for being
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54201:63"/>
Poor: Since there are more Innocent means of
acquiring Health than Riches; and theſe means are
more in our Power.</p>
               <p>Young Perſons alſo ſhould be delivered from
a great many Superſtitions (which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of former Ages has introduc'd into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks)</hi>
concerning the quality of ſeveral Meats,
which are accounted Cold or Hot, without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and againſt Experience; concerning many
effects which are attributed, without Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the <hi>Moon</hi> and other <hi>Stars.</hi> In this Rank
may be reckoned a great part of the Precepts of
<hi>Schola Salernitana.</hi> On the contrary, I would have
them Taught that which has been moſt conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreed upon, by the moſt skilful <hi>Phyſicians,</hi>
for the ordinary Regimen; the means of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Health, the Remedies for the moſt common
Diſeaſes; and eſpecially, all that relates to
Wounds: For it is more difficult to avoid them,
than great Diſeaſes; and of greater importance,
to be able to cure ones ſelf of them. For all
this, 'twould be uſeful to know <hi>Anatomy</hi> reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
well, beſides other great Uſe which may
be made of it in <hi>Morality,</hi> to underſtand the
Paſſions, admire the Wiſdom of God, and make
us ſenſible how much we depend upon his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
It would be well alſo to know the quality
of the moſt ordinary Meats; the moſt common
Plants, thoſe Remedies which are moſt eaſie to
be found; and all this, according to the moſt
approved Experiences. More or leſs of theſe
things may be Studied according to the capacity
of the Maſter, and the Leiſure and Inclination of
the Scholar. It would not be amiſs to make the
effects of ſome of the moſt terrible Diſeaſes, to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54201:64"/>
be obſerved, thereby to imprint upon young Men,
a great horrour of Intemperance and Debauchery;
and, on the other hand, to carry them ſometimes
into a Kitchin, or ſome Office, there to ſee all the
while, how much Artifice, Labour, Time and
Money, are ſpent in preparing the Ragou's and
Sauces, which are only the Ornaments of Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> THe foregoing Inſtructions, are thoſe, wherein
all Perſons are concern'd,<note place="margin">Men ought not to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy meerly for Intereſt.</note> ſeeing there is no Man
but has a Body and a Soul to take care of. The
following Inſtructions relate to the preſervation
of Eſtates, and conſequently, are not of uſe
to thoſe who are extreamly Poor. So that, the
Advice which I ſhall give, is ſcarce Practicable,
but by ſuch Children as are Born of Parents, who
are at leaſt, indifferently accommodated. The
Pooreſt ſort of all, have neither Money nor Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
to lay out in the Inſtruction of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in Private; and if they will have them to
Study, it is by ſending them to the Publick
Schools. But perhaps, before I go any farther,
it will not be out of the way, to ſay a word of
that, which ſhould invite thoſe who are very
Poor, to Study, or diſwade them therefrom.</p>
               <p>Regularly Study, is not the means to acquire
Wealth, and belongs only to thoſe who have
an honeſt Leiſure. Good ſenſe requires, that a
Man ſhould firſt begin by purveying for his
Subſiſtance, before he ſatisfies his Curioſity. For
they who apply themſelves to Study, when they
have not whereupon to live, are like thoſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
who being Landed in a Deſert Iſland,
ſhould amuſe themſelves in Contemplating the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54201:64"/>
Stars, and diſcourſing upon the Ebbing and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Sea; in ſtead of making themſelves
Cottages, and ſeeking out Proviſions. It may be
ſaid to them, <q>If you deſire to have the Goods
of Fortune, as the moſt part of Men do, Why
do you thus amuſe your ſelves? Why do you
not take the ordinary and natural Means to
procure them? You are born for the Country;
continue there: Till the Lands of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
or, if he has left you none, ſerve a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
do Journey-work, Learn a Trade; Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
if you have wherewithal; chuſe ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
whereby you may live honeſtly, and
leave <hi>Studies</hi> unto thoſe who have leiſure, who
are Rich; or elſe do not concern themſelves to
be ſo.</q> But, may ſome ſay, <hi>Studies</hi> themſelves
are one of thoſe Profeſſions whereby Men gain
a Livelihood; at leaſt they lead to ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Profeſſions, The Church, the Court, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick:
and in any of theſe ways a Man may
live more Comfortably than by Tilling the Earth,
and Labouring at a Trade. Behold! the vain
hope which makes ſo many poor Prieſts, and ſo
many poor Advocates.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay, that all who are Poor ought to
be debarr'd from <hi>Studies,</hi> for then few, who could
live at their own eaſe, would give themſelves the
trouble of Teaching and bringing up Children;
much leſs would they take upon themſelves the
Charge of <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> eſpecially in the Country.
I ſhould deſire therefore no more, but that the
number of theſe <hi>Poor Students</hi> were not ſo great;
that thoſe of them might be choſen who have
better Abilities, and more Vertue; and the others
who <hi>Study</hi> for baſe and ſordid ends, rejected. For
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54201:65"/>
it cannot be enough Lamented to ſee, into what
Extremities Young Perſons often are caſt, who
raſhly Embark themſelves in <hi>Studies,</hi> and then
find it too late to Learn a Trade, yet think any
other way of Living unworthy of them. Several,
not knowing what to do, betake themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Calling, unto <hi>Religious Societies:</hi> or if
they be afraid of being ſhut up, and becoming
ſubject to a Rule, they ſeek after ſome practical
Imployment, belonging either to the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> or
(as their Genius is) they turn <hi>Muſicians, Poets,
Comedians, Mountebanks,</hi> or any thing you can
imagine.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Studies</hi> themſelves ſuffer, by being hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Ill-bred and Selfiſh Perſons, who are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly Sollicitous how to get a Livelihood,
or how to grow Rich. Their end is not the
Knowledge of Truth, and the Perfection of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but Intereſt: So that they force their
Thoughts, to make them comply therewith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
They <hi>Study</hi> not that which is beſt in it ſelf, but
what makes the beſt Return; They endeavour
not really to become more Skilful, but to be
thought ſo, and to pleaſe others. In a word,
with them thoſe are <hi>Profitable Studies,</hi> not which
tend to the Publick Advantage, as the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Arts,</hi> and the Perfection of <hi>Manners,</hi> but
thoſe which make the <hi>Students</hi> Rich. But let us
return to our Subject.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have endeavour'd to ſpeak of thoſe
<hi>Studies,</hi> which are of Uſe to all ſorts of perſons,
to Women as well as Men, Rich and Poor. Theſe
<hi>Studies</hi> are ſuch as reſpect <hi>Religion, Manners,</hi> and
the <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> for Reaſoning Juſtly,
and Health. I treated of them in all the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54201:65"/>
wherein he may Teach them, who Inſtructs
a Child that is Honourably Born, Deſign'd to
Great Imploys, and on whom the <hi>Maſter</hi> beſtows
all his Care, having all the Encouragements he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.
<hi>Proportionably,</hi> it may be Judged, how much
of them ought to be Taught to an ordinary
perſon, a Woman, or an Artiſan. Thus, to
the <hi>Poor,</hi> the Inſtructions of a <hi>Curate,</hi> careful of
his Duty, of a Maſter of the private Schools, or
of an Intelligent Father, will ſuffice. They
may alſo, for the moſt part, omit Learning ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Write or Read: for I account it much
more neceſſary, that they ſhould be Inſtructed in
all that I have mentioned, as far as they ſhall be
capable. I now come to <hi>Studies,</hi> which are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for Buſineſs, and conſequently are likewiſe
common to all who have Eſtates, of what Sex
and Condition ſoever they be: And theſe <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
are, <hi>Grammar, Arithmetick, Oeconomicks,</hi> Skill
in <hi>Law.</hi> But I muſt explain in what Senſe I
underſtand all theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> BY <hi>Grammar</hi> I onely underſtand <hi>Reading</hi> and
<hi>Writing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Grammar.</note> Speaking <hi>French</hi> well, and <hi>Writing</hi>
Correctly; ſo that a Man is not at a loſs, either
for Choice of Words, or Conſtruction of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
and alſo can Write well, even the moſt
Common Things; as a Letter of Buſineſs. I do
not think a Child ſhould he Taught to Read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he be Six years old, unleſs he be naturally
one of very happy Intellectuals. For this is a
troubleſome <hi>Study;</hi> there is nothing of that
in it, which Children ſeek after, which is Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
and there is need of a great deal of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
of which they have none. Let us Judge
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54201:66"/>
of them by our ſelves. How difficult is it, at
the Age, when Reaſon is perfect, to begin to
Read <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Arabick?</hi> We are puſh'd on by
Curioſity, we deſire, with all our hearts, to Learn
theſe <hi>Languages,</hi> and we are accuſtomed to <hi>Study</hi>
and <hi>Industry.</hi> Nevertheleſs 'tis very ungrateful to
fix our eyes a long time upon the ſame Figures,
ſo often to gather together the ſame Letters, to
ſupply, by Memory, what is wanting in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
(as there wants ſomething in all ſorts of
Languages) and, at laſt, for all the Fruit of our
Labour, onely to pronounce words which we
do not underſtand. And yet we take it ill, that
poor Children, who ſeek after nothing but their
Play, do not take all this trouble in good part;
and Severely Chaſtiſe them becauſe they do not
pore long enough upon their <hi>Book.</hi> But, after
all, Why ſhould we preſs them on ſo much; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
if their manner of Living will oblige
them to Write and Read all their Lives? Are we
afraid that they ſhall not know how to do ſo
when they are grown up? But do we ſee any
of them, who, when they are Ten or Twelve
years old, are without this Learning? It may
be ſaid, we do not ſee any ſuch, becauſe there
are none who are not obliged to Learn theſe
things in their Childhood. But do we think,
that Emulation, The ſhame of not being like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the Neceſſity of Writing and Reading
in all our other <hi>Studies,</hi> will not alſo do very much
in theſe?</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the harſhneſs of theſe firſt
<hi>Leſſons,</hi> makes them, for a long time, diſguſt all
<hi>Study.</hi> We ſhould have a great deal of Patience
with them, make them Read but a little at a time,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54201:66"/>
and inſenſibly increaſe, as it becomes more eaſie
to them; and, at the ſame time, Teach them
<hi>Hiſtories,</hi> or other Things which may divert
them. At firſt we make them Read in <hi>Latin,</hi>
becauſe 'tis pronounced more as it is Written,
than the <hi>French.</hi> But, I believe, that the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
a Child would have to underſtand what he
ſhould Read, and to ſee the Fruit of his Labour,
would make him go on faſter. For this Reaſon
I ſhould preſently give him ſome <hi>French Book,</hi> which
he might underſtand. It eaſily appears, that the
ſame difficulties which there are in Learning to
Read, are alſo to be found in <hi>Latin,</hi> and other
<hi>Languages;</hi> and that they continue longer. There
is alſo, by the Cuſtom of the Schools, added to
them another difficulty, which is that of the
Rules, and all the Art of <hi>Grammar.</hi> For tho'
we are not accuſtomed to Learn <hi>Latin,</hi> but with
the <hi>Grammar;</hi> nor the <hi>Grammar</hi> but in <hi>Latin,</hi> or
upon the Foundation of the <hi>Latin Grammar;</hi> it
is clear nevertheleſs, that theſe are two different
<hi>Studies;</hi> ſince there is no Language which may
not be Learnt by Uſe; as likewiſe there is none
which has not its <hi>Grammar.</hi> I have ſhewed, that
this Method began at the time when <hi>Latin</hi> was
the Vulgar Language; and that the <hi>Greek Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi>
which is the firſt which we know, was
made alſo by the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, to imitate theſe <hi>Ancients,</hi> whom we do,
with ſo much Reaſon eſteem, the <hi>Grammar</hi>
ſhould be <hi>Studied</hi> in our own Language, before
it be <hi>Studied</hi> in another. Since this <hi>Study</hi> would
conſiſt onely in cauſing the Child to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
upon a Language which he already
knows; he would often take pleaſure therein:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54201:67"/>
and the Difficulties which he ſhould meet with
would be leſs than they would be, when
added to thoſe of Learning a Language.
There would be always this advantage, that he
might be made perfectly to underſtand all the
Precepts by familiar Examples. But I would not
load him with over many Rules, ſince the great
Curioſity in <hi>Grammar</hi> conſumes much time, and
is of no uſe.</p>
               <p>You have perhaps labour'd a whole day, to
get by heart one Exception, whereof probably
you'll have no uſe three times in all your Life.
I ſhould content my ſelf with the Principal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,
and the moſt General Rules; and ſhould
propoſe no more to my ſelf, than to Speak and
Read well, to obſerve a very exact Orthogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
in Writing; to underſtand all that I Say,
and all that I Read, as far as the Knowledge of
the Tongue may conduce thereunto. For this, it
would ſuffice, to know the Diviſions of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the Parts of Speech, and their Subdiviſions,
and other things which I cannot mention in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
at leaſt, unleſs I ſhould make a <hi>Grammar.</hi>
Now, that theſe Precepts ſhould not be dry, and
jejune, as they are in <hi>Books,</hi> I would render them
ſenſible and pleaſant by the way of Teaching
them. When a Child ſhould have Read in his
own Language, for ſome time, the things which
he underſtood, and wherein, if poſſible, he ſhould
take pleaſure; One would begin to make him
obſerve, that all that Writing conſiſted onely in
Two and twenty Letters, and that all the Large
Diſcourſes are Compoſed onely of Nine ſorts of
Words; that there are two kinds of <hi>Articles;</hi>
that there are Genders in Nouns; Tenſes and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54201:67"/>
Perſons in Verbs; Numbers both in the one and
the other; and thus of the reſt. As ſoon as he
ſhall know how to Write a little, you might
cauſe him to digeſt thoſe <hi>Hiſtories</hi> which have
been recited unto him; and here the mean and
improper Words, the bad Conſtructions, and the
faults of Orthography ſhould be Corrected. He
might be told the Rules of Etymologies, and
Taught many of them occaſionally. They ſerve
very much for the Underſtanding the meaning of
Words, and Orthography, and are diverting.
Thus by a few Precepts, and a great deal of
Exerciſe, he might Learn in two or three years
as much <hi>Grammar</hi> as a <hi>Gentleman</hi> need to have
for the Uſe of Life; and more than ordinarily
they know, who have been Eight or Ten years
in the College.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part might ſtop here, and Learn
no other Language at all. Sword-men, Practici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
Accountants, Merchants, and all below
theſe; as alſo the greateſt part of Women may
let <hi>Latin</hi> alone: Experience ſhews this. But, if
they knew as much <hi>Grammar,</hi> as I have ſaid, it
would be very eaſie for them to uſe good <hi>French
Books,</hi> and the Tranſlations of the <hi>Ancients;</hi> and
perhaps, at laſt, they might be diſabuſed, and not
imagin, That that Perſon muſt be a Fool who
does not underſtand <hi>Latin.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Latin</hi>
is neceſſary for Clergy-men, and Men of the
Robe, and that it is very uſeful for Souldiers, tho'
it was onely for their Travels; and, amongſt
Women, to the Religious, for underſtanding the
Office which they Read. But I believe, it would
be much more eaſie to Learn, if it was not Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſſed
with ſo many Rules of <hi>Grammar.</hi> Not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54201:68"/>
that I believe, it ſhould be Taught by uſe alone;
though there have been ſome examples of it, even
in our time; but the Method of doing this is not
ſufficiently eſtabliſhed, to propoſe it to the World.
Add to this, that whatever habit of Speaking
Children might have, I ſhould ſcarce believe that
it would continue conſtant, in a Language, which
is not continually uſed, without the help of Rules.
'Tis true, we have an Example in the <hi>Jews,</hi> who
Teach their Children <hi>Hebrew,</hi> without any Rule,
and make them very knowing therein; but this
is with a very long time. Let us therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make uſe of Rules, provided that they do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
and not over-burthen Children.</p>
               <p>Now, if they know them in their own Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
the reſt will be very eaſie. It will be onely
making them obſerve what is different in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
Language. The want of Articles, the Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Nouns, the Paſſive in Verbs, the Liberty
of placing the Words differently, and the like.
This, for the moſt part, onely would be Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the General Rules which they had
learnt.</p>
               <p>To Conclude, They ſhould be continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in <hi>Reading</hi> ſome <hi>Author,</hi> which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
with Pleaſure (if it might be;) and
they ſhould be Taught the Rules, much rather
by uſe, than the ſtrength of Memory; though it
ſhould not be forgotten alſo to cauſe them to get
things by heart. That which will beſt Imprint
them upon their Minds, will be Compoſing; but
yet it muſt not be begun ſo ſoon, nor continued ſo
long as Reading, which ought to be their Chief
Exerciſe, and continue, during the whole courſe of
their <hi>Studies.</hi> For there is this Advantage in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54201:68"/>
                  <hi>Grammar,</hi> and the <hi>Study</hi> of Languages; that, being
as Inſtruments, he who has once Learnt them will
confirm himſelf therein, proportionably as he ſhall
uſe them: Becauſe the Books wherein he Learns
things, are Compounded of the words of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Language put together, and placed according
to <hi>Grammar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/>
                  <hi>ARithmetick</hi> comes afterwards; and I think it
ſhould be begun later;<note place="margin">Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</note> that is, when Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is already formed; as at Ten, or Twelve
years. At firſt the <hi>Scholar</hi> ſhould be Taught the
Practice of the Four Great Rules; he muſt be
exerciſed in Caſting Account, either with Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or with the Pen; to make uſe of all ſorts of
Cyphers; to reduce the moſt uſual Weights and
Meaſures. Afterwards he may go on to the
Rules which are more difficult, and be ſhown the
Reaſons of all; and the Knowledge of Proportions
may be Taught him, as his Leiſure and Genius
ſhall ſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> IT will be thought ſtrange, doubtleſs, that I
reckon <hi>Oeconomicks</hi> amongſt <hi>Studies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks.</note> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the moſt neceſſary too: but hear what I
would ſay for my ſelf. The Deſign of young
Perſons <hi>Studies</hi> ſhould be, to acquire, in the firſt
Age that Knowledge, which muſt be ſerviceable
to them all the reſt of their Lives; or at leaſt, the
Principles of this Knowledge, as I think I have
already ſhewn. Therefore, that which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to the moſt common and ordinary Affairs,
that which reſpects the Maintenance of Life, and
the Foundation of <hi>Civil Society;</hi> This Knowledge
ſurely ought to have the firſt place next after
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54201:69"/>
that which refers to Man in himſelf, and directly
conduces to the perfecting the Soul or the Body.
So that it is principally the Scholars ignorance of
theſe kinds of things, which makes ſeveral deſpiſe
both them and their <hi>Studies.</hi> What are the thoughts
of the Eldeſt Son of a Family, who comes from
the <hi>College?</hi> to divert himſelf, to boaſt of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and if he be pleas'd with Study, to follow
his Curioſity: He never concerns himſelf how
he ſubſiſts; whence comes that which nouriſhes
and cloaths him, and the like. He only conſiders
how other young Perſons of the ſame quality live,
and would, by no means, be leſs accounted of, nor
want Money to Game, or ſatisfie his Paſſions. In
the mean time he fills his head with <hi>Comedies,
Romances, Muſick;</hi> or, if he wants Wit, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
himſelf to more groſs pleaſures. Some great
Change in his Fortune muſt happen, the Death
of a Father, ſome Great Eſtate fall which he
muſt take poſſeſſion of, ſome great Law-ſuit, a
Marriage, or an Office to make him open
his eyes, and ſee that there is any ſuch thing
as buſineſs in the World; and that he has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to take care of as well as other Men. I
know that in all this, there is a great deal that is
natural to Youth, which is hurry'd on to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
by violent Paſſions; and has not experience
enough to have any eſteem for things that are
uſeful. But this is the Reaſon alſo why Youth
ought to be aſſiſted and reſtrain'd, in ſtead of
which it ſeems, as if Men had a deſign to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
their Faults. Young Perſons, 'tis true, will
never love Labour and Buſineſs. Yet it ought,
at leaſt, to be endeavour'd, by preparing them
early for them, that they may not appear ſo harſh
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54201:69"/>
and burthenſome when they ſhall come to the
Age, when they muſt apply themſelves unto
them for good and all. Upon this account, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<hi>Studies</hi> neceſſary to all, who have any
thing to Manage and Preſerve, I reckon <hi>Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks,</hi>
and Skill in the Law: and obſerve where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I make <hi>Oeconomicks</hi> to conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Seeing the firſt Objects which make impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon Children, are thoſe within the Houſe, as
its divers Parts, the Servants, and their different
Offices, the Moveables, and Working Inſtruments.
There is nothing to be done but to follow the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of their Natural Curioſity, to Teach them
with pleaſure the uſe of all theſe things, and make
them underſtand, as far as they are capable, the
Solid Reaſons, which put Men upon inventing
them, by letting them ſee the Inconveniencies
which they remove. Thus alſo they would be
accuſtomed to admire the Goodneſs of God in
all things which he Furniſhes us with for our
Wants; the Induſtry which he has given unto
Men to make uſe of them; the Happineſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Born in a Country that is Cultivated, and
in a Well-inſtructed and Polite Nation: to take
Noble <hi>Ideas</hi> of all things, which an ill Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Vanity of our Manners make us
deſpiſe; and not ſo much to diſdain a Kitchin, the
Back-yard, the Market-place, as the moſt part of
Perſons Gentilely bred do.</p>
               <p>To Conclude, Thus they would be accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make Reflexions upon all that preſents its
ſelf to them, which is the Principle of all <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
For Men mightily deceive themſelves, when
they imagin, that they muſt ſeek a great way off
for that wherewith Children are to be Inſtructed.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54201:70"/>
They are not to live, either in the Air, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Stars, much leſs in the Imaginary Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in the Country of the <hi>entia Rationis,</hi> or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Intentions; but they muſt live on the
Earth, in this Low World, ſuch as it now is, and
in this Corrupted Age of it.</p>
               <p>They ought therefore to know the Earth
which they Inhabit, the Bread which they Eat,
the Animals which are Uſeful to them; and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, the Men with whom they are to Live
and to Act. And let them not, in the leaſt, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin
that, to conſider all the things which
are about them, is to debaſe themſelves.</p>
               <p>In a great Family there will be more occaſion
for theſe Inſtructions than in a leſs; and there
will be yet more, if Children be ſometimes in the
City, and ſometimes in the Countrey. Thus the
Children of Perſons of Quality, who may have
all theſe Advantages, ought to know more things
than others. As they grow in Age, more may
be told them concerning theſe things; and, in
ſome ſort they might be indifferently well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in thoſe Arts, which reſpect the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of Life, by letting them ſee Men work
at them; and by explaining to them every thing
carefully. They ſhould then be ſhewn, either
in the Houſe, or elſewhere, how Bread, and
Cloth, and Stuffs are made. They ſhould ſee
<hi>Taylors, Tapiſtry-makers, Joyners, Carpenters, Maſons,</hi>
and all who are concern'd in the Building-trade,
Work in their particular Callings. They ſhould
alſo be, ſome-ways, ſo far Inſtructed in theſe
Arts, as to underſtand the Language of the
Workmen, and that they may not be eaſily
impos'd upon. Now this <hi>Study</hi> will, all this
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54201:70"/>
while, be a great Divertiſement for them: And
ſeeing Children deſire to imitate every thing, they
will be ſure to play over all theſe Arts. And
herein they ſhould not be roughly Oppoſed, or
Laughed at, but gently aſſiſted, by ſhewing them
what will be <hi>Chymerical</hi> in their deſigns, and what
<hi>Feaſible.</hi> This might be an occaſion of Teaching
them a great deal of <hi>Mechanicks;</hi> and they would
have the Pleaſure of Succeeding in ſome things,
which in this Age, is very great. It would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
be well to acquaint them with the common
Price of the Works which they may have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for, and the things which they may Buy
themſelves, and even thoſe which they may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
others to Buy. For, though theſe Prices of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
change, yet, they who have known them
once, will not be ſo much to ſeek; eſpecially,
if they be once well told, why ſome Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
are ſo dear in reſpect of others; and the
moſt ordinary Cauſes of the Change of Price.
I ſhould alſo deſire that a young Man be ſoon
inſtructed, either by Experience, or an exact Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
in all that is neceſſary for Travel. This
is the Study which I call <hi>Aeconomicks.</hi> It eaſily
appears, that I do not pretend to make it a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in Form, or that it ſhould be learn'd by
Books. It might be learn'd by Converſation and
Practice; and would be, not ſo much the Office
of a Maſter, as the care of a good Father, or
an affectionate Tutor. Other Studies would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
it, and it would help them. To Exerciſe
the Rules of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> the young Perſon
might make up the Accounts, and keep a Regiſter
of Receipts and Expences, which is ſo neceſſary
a Practice to every Man, who has any thing to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54201:71"/>
take care of,<note place="margin">Eccl. xl. 11. 7.</note> that it is recommended in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
it ſelf. In Human Authors, as <hi>Cicero</hi>
and <hi>Virgil,</hi> it may be obſerved to them, how
much the <hi>Romans</hi> did then eſteem <hi>Husbandry,</hi>
and a diligent application to their <hi>Domestick</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
This might be ſeen more in thoſe Authors
which treat of Country Buſineſſes; as <hi>Cato</hi>
and <hi>Columella,</hi> and in ſome Books of the Law.
The young <hi>Romans</hi> muſt needs have been
very ſoon fit to Act, and manage their Affairs,
ſince at Fourteen Years they were out of Tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
were accounted grown Men at Eighteen,
and took their Place, and argued freely before
the Magiſtrates. As for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Aecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks</hi>
of <hi>Xenophon, Aristophanes, Theocritus, Heſiod</hi>
and <hi>Homer,</hi> do ſhew, that they buſied themſelves
very much within their Houſes, in Management,
and all kind of Husbandry; and that the Richeſt
and moſt Civilized Perſons, did then make that
their buſineſs and delight, which at this day is
looked upon as the Lot of the miſerable. The
Authority of theſe great Names, and the Conſent
of ſuch Excellent Writings, might give Noble
Ideas of all, even the moſt common things of
Life. This alſo might make the Scholar much
more capable of profiting, even by the <hi>Holy
Scripture;</hi> ſeeing that all which is accounted ſo
mean and dull, came from the ſimple and ſolid
Manners of that wiſe Antiquity, when no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
diſdain'd to Labour, more than he did to
Eat: And this, I think, I have ſhewn in the
Manners of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> But whether the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſhall read theſe Authors, or the Maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to him what they ſay; I would have him
careful to make all things very ſenſible, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54201:71"/>
all to our own Country Uſage and Cuſtom.
Let us leave it to the <hi>Grammarians</hi> by Profeſſion,
curiouſly to inquire after all the Plants which
<hi>Virgil</hi> names, and the Deſcription of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of <hi>Agriculture</hi> which <hi>Heſiod</hi> mentions.
Let us only take occaſion from what they ſay,
to make our Scholar underſtand that which at
preſent is done in our Country, and let us not
be diſcouraged, if they uſe ſome word which we
may not underſtand, provided that we know
our way of Management, as well as they did
theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> AS for the Law, ſince it depends leſs upon
the imagination,<note place="margin">Civil Law or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence.</note> and has more Reaſoning
in it, we ſhould wait till the Mind be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to attend, and the Judgment be form'd;
that is, till Thirteen or Fourteen Years, and till
our Scholar be towards the end of his Studies.
Nevertheleſs, it is much more eaſie to make
this ſenſible and agreeable, than it is <hi>Philoſophy,</hi>
which is the ordinary Study at this Age; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
after this Foundation of <hi>Aeconomicks,</hi> of
which I have ſpoken, it would be a great deal
more eaſie.</p>
               <p>You may ſuppoſe, that, by skill in the Law,
I do not here underſtand that long and difficult
Study, which makes <hi>Lawyers</hi> by Profeſſion, and
which contains the Knowledge, not only of all
the Laws that are uſed in a Country, upon any
ſubject whatſoever, but of all that alſo, which
ſerves to explain and apply them to particular
Matters. I only ſpeak here of thoſe Studies
which are neceſſary to all Men of ingenuous
Birth. Thus, as to Law, I only underſtand that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54201:72"/>
which every private Perſon is obliged to know
of it, in order to keep what he has, and to do
nothing againſt the Laws. Every one is thus
far obliged by the Laws themſelves, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
that all Citizens are inſtructed therein,
ſince they impute the Ignorance of them as a
Fault, and Puniſh it, either by the loſs of Goods,
if they have failed to obſerve the Laws, in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or preſerving them, or by more ſevere Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments;
if this Ignorance has betray'd them
to ſome Crime. Nevertheleſs, no care is taken
to inſtruct young Perſons in them, except thoſe,
who are deſigned for the Gown; and queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
it will be thought ſtrange, that I deſire
this ſhould be done.</p>
               <p>But to examine things without Prejudice, this
Study is as uſeful, at leaſt, as <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which
they are Taught; and is not more difficult. But
<hi>Philoſophy,</hi> it may be ſaid, Exerciſes the Minds of
young Perſons, and makes them ſubtle. So will
alſo the ſubtleties of Law, by which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
points will be better underſtood: But 'tis
feared, that they would be tired, ſhould they be
told of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſus fructus,</hi> and Propriety; of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the right of Heir-ſhip, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Hereditary, betwixt the parts Individible,
and the parts Diviſed, although ſolid effects of
all theſe diſtinctions may be ſhown to them. Is
it not to be feared likewiſe, leaſt the Univerſals, the
Categories, the Infinite in Act, and in Power,
and the <hi>Entia rationis,</hi> ſhould put them out of
Humour? In ſhort, the knowledge of Right,
whether pleaſant or not, is neceſſary to all, who
live under the ſame Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:54201:72"/>
This Study would be very eaſie, if we had
certain and fix'd Laws, as the <hi>Romans</hi> had thoſe
of the Twelve Tables; the <hi>Athenians</hi> thoſe of
<hi>Solon;</hi> the <hi>Hebrews</hi> thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or rather of
<hi>God.</hi> A Man ſhould need only to read theſe Laws
to know his Duty. But it is not thus, a great
deal of Experience is required to diſtinguiſh, in
the large Volumes of the Edicts of our Kings,
thoſe which are obſerved, from thoſe which are
not. Cuſtoms ſpeak not but of certain Matters.
We follow a great many Rules of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Law; the greateſt part of which, nevertheleſs, is
not received; at leaſt, not into the number of
our Cuſtoms. Our Law therefore, being ſo mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſo uncertain, there is great need of Study,
to underſtand it: I mean, to have ſuch an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
knowledge of it, as is to be ſuppoſed in
private Perſons. For to know it exactly, it is the
Study of a Man's whole Life.</p>
               <p>Now this indifferent Knowledge thereof, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to all, I make to conſiſt in theſe things.
Firſt, in underſtanding the Terms, ordinarily
uſed in ſpeaking of Buſineſs, and which we meet
with, in the Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and other
Law Books;<note place="margin">Fee, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, purchaſe, to quit, to warrant.</note> as <hi>fief, Cenſive, propres, acqueſt, déguer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir,
garantir,</hi> and all the reſt, which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
uſed in the ordinary way of Speaking.
Children may learn all theſe words betimes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
if care be taken to make them underſtand
the ſenſe, by ſenſible Examples; and the ſooner
they ſhall have learn'd them, the leſs Barbarous
they will appear afterwards. It will be much
more worth their while, to charge their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with them, than with Names, Figures of
<hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and the Terms of <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> After
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54201:73"/>
this Knowledge of their way of Speaking, which
implies a great many Definitions; I would have
the Scholar learn the moſt general Maxims of the
Law, which relate to particular Subjects; as of
Tutelage, Succeſſions, Marriages, the moſt uſual
Contracts, without entring into the Subtleties of
the Law, or much affecting the Method; but
only obſerving therein a little Order, for clearing
up the Underſtanding, and aſſiſting the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
In the next place, the manner of Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ones Right in the Courts of Judicature,
ſhould be Treated of; and, without Deſcending
to all the particulars of the Proceſs, the order
of it in general, ſhould be obſerved, and the
neceſſity there is, of exactly obſerving in Judicial
Proceedings, the Forms Eſtabliſhed. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
will be for the Maſter to chuſe out of
Books, that Knowledge which is neceſſary;
and is ſo diſperſed, and blended in them. For
it muſt be confeſs'd, that, as yet, we have no
Book, where all that which I have ſpoken of
is put together, and ſeparated from the reſt.
Till ſome Perſon ſhall undertake this. <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s
Inſtitutes, the cuſtomary Inſtitution of <hi>Loiſel,</hi> that
of <hi>Coquil,</hi> and the <hi>Index</hi> of <hi>Ragueau,</hi> and other
ſuch-like Books may be made uſe of. Moreover,
it would be well to Read to the Scholar, the
whole Cuſtom of his Country, and ſhew him
ſome of the moſt common Contracts, that he
may underſtand the Principal clauſes of them.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, have we not wrangling
<hi>Pettifoggers</hi> enough in <hi>France,</hi> without deſiring
that all Men ſhould be ſo? Behold! The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Language of ignorant Perſons, to call thoſe
Wranglers who underſtand Buſineſs, and ſpeak of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54201:73"/>
it in proper Terms. On the contrary, one of the
greateſt Cauſes of Litigious Pleadings, is this ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of Law. Hence it is, that Men make
diſadvantageous Agreements; which afterwards
they will not perform; that ſo many Revocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Reſtitutions are required againſt <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes;</hi>
that they raſhly undertake a Proceſs, the
Conſequences whereof they do not foreſee; that
having Equity at the bottom, they commit it to
the management of a Sollicitor, who ſpoils a
good Cauſe, by his ill Proceeding. So that if
any knowledge of Buſineſs produces Wrangling,
'tis that confuſed and uncertain knowledge of
ſome little part of Practice, without Order, and
without the Knowledge of Principles. Whence
it is, that the greateſt <hi>Pettifoggers</hi> are always the
meaneſt ſort of Practitioners. Now Men muſt needs
have theſe obſcure and imperfect Notions, when
they are only inſtructed by uſe. Beſides that,
this is a very ſlow Maſter, and ſcarce ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms,
but by the Faults which are committed.
Further, after a long time, you will hereby know
only ſome certain particular Matters, and which
indeed you may know, even too particularly,
and, at the ſame time, be intirely ignorant of
all the reſt. To me therefore it ſeems, that it
would be better, not altogether to depend upon
Experience, but to be firſt prepared for it, by ſome
general Knowledge. For though it be true,
that many are ſufficiently vers'd in buſineſs,
by uſe alone; it ought to be confeſs'd, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
that they would be ſtill better, and more
eaſily inſtructed, if they joyned ſome Study
thereunto. And ſeeing there is a certain Age,
wherein we deſire that young Perſons ſhould
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54201:74"/>
Study, though it were only to imploy them; why
ſhould we not rather buſie them, in that which
may be ſerviceable to them afterwards; than in
that which is only for the School, that is, for
nothing? For the School is not of uſe, but ſo
far as it fits us for the remaining part of Life.
Now in this Matter, there is no need to fear, leaſt
they ſhould learn a little more Law, than may be
abſolutely neceſſary for them. It is difficult, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
to meaſure this <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> and they will
retain (we may be ſure) no more than the ſum
of that which they learn.</p>
               <p>This Study, which of it ſelf, is a little dull, may
be made more delightſome, by the Knowledge of
many Matters of Fact; which giving to the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
a little Experience before his time, would
render both the Maxims and the Reaſonings of
Law, more ſenſible. I would then, that the
young Man be often told, what are the different
Conditions of Men of the ſame Country, what
their Imployments, and what it is by which they
ſubſiſt: That he knew how a Peaſant, an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
a Citizen lives, what a Judge is, or any
other Man of the Robe; I ſay, that which they
are, and not that which they ought to be;
what was their Birth, how they came to Offices,
how they live: That he be acquainted how the
Soldiers and the Officers of the Army ſubſiſt;
and alſo that he be inform'd concerning <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and the Religious: In a word, concerning
all Men, with whom he muſt live. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature alſo of Men's poſſeſſions ſhould be
deſcrib'd unto him from the leaſt Farm, to the
greateſt Lordſhip; and how the Rents of them
are made. What is Trade and the Bank, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54201:74"/>
how Men grow Rich thereby. The different
natures of Rents; to conclude, the different ways
of Living and Subſiſting, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Countries. And ſeeing they cannot
Learn all this, but by Converſation, young
Perſons ought to be taught to profit, by diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with all ſorts of Perſons, even with Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
and Servants. The way is, to make each of
them ſpeak of his own Trade, and of things
which he knows. Both of them would gain by
this mutual Converſation. He that ſpeaks, has
the pleaſure to Inſtruct, and to make himſelf
heard; he who hears, has the pleaſure to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
ſomething new, and the profit will thereby
abide with him.</p>
               <p>The Reading alſo of the Ancients, will help
him to underſtand theſe ſame Matters of Fact;
as I have obſerved for <hi>Oeconomicks.</hi> The Orations
and Epiſtles of <hi>Cicero,</hi> are full of wonderful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Affairs; which the Scholar may be brought
to obſerve, as he ſhall have occaſion. If he is
to live a private Life, particular buſineſs ſhould
be chiefly explained unto him; if he is deſign'd
by his Birth, to great Imploys, he ſhould be more
kept to publick Matters. <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> and other
Hiſtorians, will alſo teach him a great deal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them. Thus, the ſame Leſſon might
ſerve for ſeveral uſes; for <hi>Grammar,</hi> for <hi>Rhetorick,</hi>
for <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> for <hi>Morality,</hi> for <hi>Oeconomicks,</hi> for <hi>Law.</hi>
Sometimes one kind of Reflections ſhould be
made, ſometimes another, as occaſion ſhall ſerve;
and it would be hard, if none of them ſhould
take effect. But, in all theſe Obſervations, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
which continually Tempts, ſhould be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unleſs it be uſed as a Ragouſt to Excite the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54201:75"/>
Appetite of Knowing. For otherwiſe, it will be
no great harm, not to underſtand ſome word in
<hi>Plautus,</hi> or <hi>Varro,</hi> which denotes ſome Office of
a Slave; to be ignorant of ſome formality of their
publick Aſſemblies; provided, that it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
that the <hi>Romans</hi> well underſtood their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
both private and publick, and that they
were very diligent in it; and that all thoſe great
Men, whom we admire in their Hiſtory, did
not make themſelves great (each of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his genius) but by this application.
Thus this Study of Law, would not only make
young Men capable of buſineſs, but contribute
more than any other, to the rendring their Minds
ſolid, and Forming their Judgments: Since it
would conſiſt only in making them know the
Truth of thoſe things, which are the moſt fit
for Men to know.</p>
               <p>Now, in my Opinion, this Solidity, and this
Rectitude of judgment, is that which ſhould
chiefly be ſought in Studies. There is but too
much of the Sparkiſh humour in the World; but
there never will be enough of good ſenſe. Why
ſhould this Glittering Fiery Spirit be ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to Scholars, which cannot be given
to thoſe, who have it not naturally; and which
uſually, doth more harm than good, to thoſe who
have it? Let us improve in good Senſe and
Judgment. All who are not Born Stupid, may
arrive to this Rectitude of Mind, provided, that
they be accuſtomed to apply themſelves to it,
and not to Precipitate their Judgments. And 'tis
only by this, that Men ſucceed in Buſineſs, and
in the whole Conduct of their Lives. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Buſineſs, alſo, would contribute to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54201:75"/>
reclaiming young Men from vain Fooleries; and
to the making them ſerious: For we become
ſuch, as our Thoughts are, with which we are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up. This will accuſtom them to be diligent,
to be careful, to love Rule and Juſtice, which
a Man muſt needs love, if he knows it, before
it comes to be his intereſt to oppoſe it. Now
young Perſons are not as yet ſenſible of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;
Avarice is the leaſt of their Vices.</p>
               <p>And to make them diligent and careful, it would
be very deſireable, that the Practick might be
joyn'd to the Inſtructions; That the Father
ſhould enter his Son into the Counſels apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to his Houſhold Affairs; that he would
make him Diſcourſe of whatever occurs; That
he would commit to his Care ſome of the Leſs
difficult of them; That he would put ſome part
of his Eſtate into his Management, whereof
he ſhould give an account. Nothing would be
more advantageous, than for a Perſon of a great
Eſtate, to be thus Educated; to be ſo capable of
Buſineſs, that he ſhould have no Intendants,
Agents and Sollicitors, but only to eaſe him, and
might not altogether rely upon them; that he
ſhould himſelf Manage all Affairs in chief, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to his Servants, only the Execution of them
in particular: In a word, that he ſhould govern
thoſe under him, and not, as it too often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
be governed by them. For, is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the abſolute Dependance wherein Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
and Bayliffs hold their Maſters, and that
careleſsneſs which ruins ſo many Families, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the ignorance of Perſons of Quality,
and their ill Education? I know very well that
they cannot be excuſed from a great deal of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54201:76"/>
and Love of Pleaſure: But it happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
that they take a diſtaſte againſt Pleaſure,
and do ſhake off Idleneſs: Whereas when they
are paſt a certain Age, there is no more time for
Inſtruction. At firſt they entertain an averſion
for buſineſs, becauſe they do not underſtand the
Terms, and have no Knowledge of the Maxims.
They flatter themſelves, that good ſenſe is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for the ordering their concerns; and every
one thinks he is well enough provided there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
But they do not conſider, that Law is
mixed with an abundance of Matters of Fact
and Rules, Eſtabliſhed by Men, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to Divine: And when they come to ſee
the neceſſity of being inſtructed, they are aſhamed
to confeſs their ignorance. Laſtly, the long ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of applying themſelves to nothing, and not
being confined, makes them often over-look their
moſt important Intereſts. This is what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

more extenſive than meer private Perſons
require. Their skill in <hi>Law</hi> ſhould comprehend the

It is hard to hinder Men from talking;
but it is alſo difficult for Princes and Miniſters
of State to keep from Laughing, when they ſee
Citizens and Artiſans Diſpute about the Intereſts
of <hi>Potentates,</hi> and preſcribe to them Rules for
their Government. But as for Children, who it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54201:76"/>
may be reaſonably foreſeen, will one day come
to be preferr'd to high Places, it is of conſequence,
early to inſtill into them Right Maxims, leaſt
they ſhould imbibe falſe, or act only at a venture.
I would then have them know, in the firſt place,
the State of the preſent Government of their
Country; the different parts of which this Body
is Compounded, the Names and Functions of the
Officers which Govern it: The manner of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Juſtice, of Adminiſtring the Revenues, of
Exerciſing the Policy thereof, and the like; as
alſo the Way of conſulting about Publick Affairs.
I would have every one begin with the State of
his own Country, as being moſt neceſſary, and
moſt eaſie to know; and that, in the next place,
he ſhould conſider the Condition of thoſe Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries which are neareſt, and to which
he has moſt Relation. By ſhewing him how things
are really and in truth: I would ſhew him how
they ought to be; not, as yet, according to the
Opinions of the Philoſophers, and pure Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but, according to the Laws of the State it ſelf,
and its ancient Cuſtoms. This is that which I
call Publick Right. The Rules according to
which each State is Governed: The Rights of
the Soveraign, and the Officers he makes uſe of:
The Rights of States, and Soveraigns, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of one another. This Study is more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
than Reaſoning, and it contains much more
Hiſtory which may make it pleaſant.</p>
               <p>Policy conſiſts more in Reaſoning, and ſhould
Aſcend as high as to ſearch after Principles. It
conſiders not only how <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> ought
to be Governed, according to the particular Form
of their Conſtitution, and the Laws which are
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54201:77"/>
there Eſtabliſhed: But it inquires in general,
what is Civil Society, what Form of Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the beſt, what are the beſt Laws, and
the beſt means to preſerve Quiet and Concord
amongſt Men. Theſe general conſiderations, are
very uſeful to give unto the Mind, <hi>Elevation</hi>
and <hi>Extention,</hi> provided, that Application of
them be made to particular Examples, not thoſe
of <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> but of the Moderns,
which affect us more, and inſtruct us better.
The Advice which to me ſeems of greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
in this Matter, is, That a young Prince,
or other Child of more Inferiour Rank, be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhewn the difference betwixt true and falſe
Policy; that he be Taught to abhor that, which
only propoſes to make the Prince, or the Body
of Men which Governs, Powerful, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of all the reſt of the People; which
makes the Vertue of the Soveraign to conſiſt,
in maintaining, and increaſing his Grandeur,
leaving Juſtice, Faith, and Humanity to private
Perſons. That he be inſtructed, not much to
relie upon the Artifices, by which his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
may be weakened, in ſtirring up Enemies
againſt them, or Exciting Diviſions amongſt
them; nor the skill how to deceive his Subjects
in making them believe the State to be ſtronger
than it is. For the avoiding all theſe Evils,
the greateſt part of modern Politicians ſhould
be laid aſide; eſpecially, <hi>Machiavel,</hi> and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Hobs.</hi> Let us return to <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
whoſe Politicks are founded upon the ſolid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Morality and Vertue. Their end is,
not to Exalt one Man, or any number of Men,
above others, but to make Men live as happily,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54201:77"/>
as 'tis poſſible, in Society; to procure to all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſons ſafety, the peaceable poſſeſſion of
their Goods, Health of Body, Liberty of Mind,
Rectitude of Heart, and Juſtice. To confer all
theſe benefits upon a whole Society, theſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
believed it was juſt, that ſome ſhould
be at the pains of watching continually over it;
that they might make proviſion for all its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
defend it from outward Attacks, and
preſerve Peace within. Theſe, if I miſtake not,
are the Principles of true Policy.</p>
               <p>But to ſee it in its Purity, we muſt go higher
than <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> It muſt be Learn'd from
<hi>Moſes, David, Solomon,</hi> the Prophets, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;
or rather <hi>God</hi> himſelf, whoſe Interpreters
they were. They will tell us, that all Men
are Brethren; That the firſt States were only
great Families; that every one ought to love the
Country where he was Born, and the Society in
which <hi>God</hi> had plac'd him: That it is juſt, that
one Man ſhould give his Life for the publick
Safety; and that it is <hi>God</hi> alone, who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
ſome Men to govern others: That the
Perſon of the Prince is Sacred: That he is plac'd
over the People to Defend them, and to render
Juſtice unto them: That he cannot perform his
Duty, if <hi>God</hi> do not give him Wiſdom: And a
great many ſuch like Maxims; whereof a whole
Body of Policy, taken from the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi>
might be Compoſed. Perhaps I have ſaid but
too much upon a Subject, which few Scholars
have need of, and few Maſters are capable to
Teach.</p>

Bred,<note place="margin">Languages, <hi>Latin,</hi> &amp;c.</note> there are others which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for them; but yet, ſuch as may be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
omitted. Firſt of all, <hi>Latin;</hi> for I have not
at all ſuppoſed, that the Studies I have hitherto
ſpoken of, ſhould depend thereon; and what
I have ſaid of the helps which may be drawn
from ancient Authors, for <hi>Oeconomicks,</hi> and skill
in <hi>Law,</hi> ought to be underſtood, in Reſpect of
thoſe only, who, over and beſides, ſhall have
learn'd <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> or elſe ſhall Read the
<hi>Tranſlations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though <hi>Latin</hi> be not neceſſary, yet it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uſeful for Religion, for Buſineſs, and for Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Since the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has not thought
it convenient to change the Language of her
Prayers and her Offices, no more than the <hi>Greek,</hi>
and other Oriental Churches, it is to be wiſh'd
that all Chriſtians underſtood this Language;
and that all, who have the convenience of
Learning it, ſhould not neglect it. Add to this,
the ſatisfaction there muſt needs be, in being able
to Read the Writing of ſo many <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers,
and of underſtanding that verſion of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
the uſe of which is Authorized by the Church.
For Buſineſs, the greateſt part of the Terms,
which are uſed in ſpeaking about it, are <hi>Latin,</hi>
and drawn from the <hi>Roman</hi> Law; of which it is
impoſſible to talk well, in another Language, as
may appear by the Law Books of the Modern
<hi>Greeks.</hi> Laſtly, for all Studies, Men are ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to uſe this Language, that it is become
the common Language of Learned Men, over
all <hi>Europe;</hi> that the greateſt part of Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54201:78"/>
have uſed it; and that it is beneficial for
the underſtanding all the <hi>Ancients.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſpoken of the way of Learning it; and
have Adviſed, That more regard be had to Uſe,
than Precepts. I ſhall here add, That the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of every Language ought carefully to be
obſerv'd to the <hi>Scholar;</hi> and that he ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
never to Render <hi>Latin</hi> but by good
<hi>French;</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> but by good <hi>Latin.</hi> It ought
to be demonſtrated to him, that one word cannot
always be render'd by another of the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
as a Verb for a Verb; a Noun for a Noun;
nor always one Word by one Word; becauſe
one <hi>Latin</hi> word often expreſſes a whole Phraſe
of the other. Men have many more Thoughts
then they have invented different Sounds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to expreſs them: So that there is no Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
where we ſhall not fall ſhort in ſome
places. It is not therefore to Tranſlate exactly,
only to turn the words, if the Conſtruction of
the Language, whence we Tranſlate them be
Barbarous. 'Tis true, this way of Tranſlating is
more ſure, as to the fidelity of it, and it gives
the <hi>Reader</hi> the Pleaſure of ſeeing, in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,
the Genius of the <hi>Original Language.</hi> Such
is the Famous Verſion of the 70 Interpreters. It
repreſents the Original, word for word, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
renders the ſame <hi>Hebrew</hi> words, by the ſame
<hi>Greek</hi> words. There can be no Tranſlation done
with more exactneſs, and Religious care. The
Reſpect for the Holy Text made them fearful to
alter the Senſe thereof by the leaſt change. But
ordinarily to Tranſlate well, the ſame thought, and
(as much as may be) the ſame Figure, and the
ſame Strength of Expreſſion, ſhould be render'd
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54201:79"/>
according to the natural Mode of another Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
and when the Scholar miſſes this, he
ſhould be brought to ſee the Fault of his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.
For example, Complaining of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Perſon, would you ſay, <hi>I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
little thanks for my favour to him?</hi> You
ſhould rather ſay, <hi>He hath ill requited the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he had to me.</hi> The <hi>Latin</hi> has this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
in reſpect of us, that, ſeeing our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is derived from it, we believe that the words
ſignifie the ſame that they do from whence they
proceed, though often it is not ſo. <hi>Table</hi> comes
from <hi>Tabula,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Planck: Chamber</hi>
from <hi>Camera,</hi> which ſignifies a Roof: <hi>fortis</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>valiant:</hi> and <hi>Valens, Strong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſhould alſo be ſhewn, That 'tis an Error to
think, that the <hi>Latin,</hi> or any Dead <hi>Language</hi> can be
perfectly Learnt. We can know no more of it, than
is Written, and we cannot underſtand all of it
that is Written. How many Words are there in
<hi>Cato,</hi> and in other <hi>Authors,</hi> who Treat of <hi>Ruſtick
Affairs,</hi> which no Man now underſtands? How
many ſorts of Vulgar, and Trivial things are
there, which never were Writ in <hi>Latin?</hi> Even in
the Diſcourſes, which we think we underſtand
beſt, there are certain <hi>Elegancies</hi> which we cannot
Reliſh;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gell.</hi> Lib. 1. c. 7. 13. c. 19.</note> as thoſe which <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> obſerves, in

impoſſible to Learn, even the Living <hi>Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
(which are not Natural to us) in the utmoſt
Perfection; What can be hoped, as to thoſe
which ſubſiſt onely in <hi>Books?</hi> But our Comfort is,
that it would be uſeleſs to know them better. We
have no need of <hi>Latin,</hi> but for underſtanding
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54201:79"/>
                  <hi>Books,</hi> or for making our ſelves underſtood by
Strangers. As to <hi>Books,</hi> we can underſtand no
more than is Written: and to make our ſelves
underſtood by Strangers, we ſhould Speak <hi>Latin</hi>
much after the ſame rate that they do. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
I would not Imitate the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi>
who make no Scruple of uſing the baldeſt
<hi>Latin,</hi> provided that they ſpeak it eaſily. But
yet I would more carefully avoid the Affectation
of ſome Learned Men, who, ſtriving to ſpeak <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
very finely,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Gell.</hi> l. 1. c. 10.</note> are hard to be underſtood. I
ſhould rather chuſe to ſpeak worſe, and be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
underſtood. I would then Accommodate my
Style to the capacity of the Generality of the
Learned; without neglecting it ſo, that it ſhould
be Barbarous, or taking ſuch pains about it, that it
ſhould be obſcure. Above all, I would have the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>Books</hi> obſerved; and not have the <hi>Jeſts,</hi>
or <hi>Proverbs,</hi> which <hi>Plautus</hi> makes his Slaves ſpeak,
put into a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Divinity,</hi> or any other ſerious
Matter; nor into a Familiar Letter, Poetical Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and Lofty Figures, taken out of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippicks.</hi>
Theſe Advices are neceſſary, ſince the
vanity of ſome of our Modern Learned Men
has given occaſion for them, in reſpect of all theſe
Indecencies. They often alſo mix <hi>Greek</hi> Words
in their <hi>Latin Writings;</hi> wherein, in my opinion,
they do themſelves no great honour; ſince this
is ſilently to confeſs, that they know not how to
expreſs in <hi>Latin</hi> that which they ſay in <hi>Greek:</hi>
for he cannot be ſaid to know a Language well,
who knows not therein how to expreſs what he
will; at leaſt by a Circumlocution; beſides, thus
to interrupt the Diſcourſe by Words, which make
the <hi>Readers</hi> loſe what follows, is to inſult over
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54201:80"/>
them, if they know not <hi>Greek.</hi> But if I ſhould
be neceſſitated to inſert a <hi>Greek,</hi> or an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or
any word of another Language into a <hi>Latin</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
I ſhould always Write it in <hi>Latin</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that I might not puzle my <hi>Reader.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> THE Second of theſe Uſeful <hi>Studies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> is <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
But ſeeing it is difficult for one Man
to Read all thoſe we have, of all Times, and all
Countries; and it is not convenient that many
Perſons ſhould wholly imploy themſelves in this
ſort of Reading, there is need of Choice and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in this, as much, or more, than in any other
<hi>Study.</hi> He who, as is uſual, ſhall think it enough
to Read, at a venture, the firſt <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Hiſtory</hi>
which ſhall come to his hands, will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of charging his Memory with a great many
<hi>Fables,</hi> or of retaining nothing for want of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
that which he Reads, Some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
therefore ſhould be given to young Men,
for diſcerning what <hi>Hiſtories</hi> will be uſeful to
them, and how they may Read them Profitably.
But to doe this well, the Foundations of this <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
ſhould be laid from their Infancy. For though
Novelty be a great Charm in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> yet nothing
is more ungrateful, than to find nothing therein
but what is New; to ſee therein nothing that
you know, not ſo much as one Place, or one
Perſon. The <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>China</hi> is full of great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currencies,
and rare Examples of Vertue; yet becauſe
we never have heard any thing of <hi>Jao,</hi> nor of <hi>Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamyou;</hi>
and even the lateſt <hi>Geography</hi> of this great
Country, is not at all familiar to us; This <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi>
(at the firſt eſpecially) is very tedious to us.
The Memory is continually in Labour. When
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54201:80"/>
we find a proper Name, we know not whether
we have already ſeen it or no; or, we remember
that we have ſeen it, but we have forgotten what
it is; or take a Country for a Man, or a Man for
a Woman; we ſee not the Intereſt which one had
to Love or Hate another. In ſhort, the Mind
is oppreſt with ſo many Novelties, all at once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
it is in continual pain. On the contrary, when a
Man who has ſtudied but a little, Reads <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
or <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> he meets every where with
what he knows; the greateſt Objects are fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to him. He has, all his Life long, heard
Men talk of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi>
But he ſees a great many particulars
which he had no knowledge of; and 'tis this
knowledge which makes his Reading pleaſant to
him, becauſe he knows whither to refer what he
Learns, and becauſe he labours not to underſtand
or retain the Principal matters. The trouble is
much more to them who have no Learning at all;
accordingly they complain, for the moſt part, of
their ill Memory. But they ought rather to
complain of their ill Education; which makes the
<hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman Hiſtory</hi> almoſt as troubleſom to
them, as that of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> or <hi>Muſul-men</hi> is to
thoſe, who have gon through the more ordinary
<hi>Studies.</hi> Yet there is here a great difference; for
there are few among us who have not heard of
<hi>Alexander, Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Charlemaign;</hi> But who, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ſome few who are curious, knows any thing
of <hi>Almamon,</hi> or <hi>Ginguiſcan?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot begin too ſoon to Teach Children
the Principles of <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> At the ſame time, when
we Acquaint them with the Matters of Fact, which
ſerve as a Foundation to the Inſtructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54201:81"/>
Religion; we ſhould alſo relate unto
them, thoſe which are the moſt conſiderable, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing,
pleaſant, and eaſie to be remembred in
Prophane <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Thoſe rather than others ſhould
be choſen, which ſtrike the Imagination. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus's
Wolf; The Death of Lucretia; The Sacking
of Rome by the Gauls; The Triumph of Pompey, or
that of Paulus Aemylius; The Death of Caeſar.</hi> And
if they could have a Sight of <hi>Medals, Statues,</hi> or
<hi>Pictures,</hi> the Images of them would be more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and be imprinted deeper in the Memory. This
doubtleſs, is the greateſt uſe of <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving;</hi>
and it was a great advantage to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Greeks,</hi> that they might Learn <hi>Hiſtory</hi> even
without Reading, only by walking about in their
Cities. For whereſoever they turn'd their Eyes,
they found either Imboſſed Works, or Excellent
Pictures in their Temples, in their Publick Halls,
which Repreſented Battels, and other Famous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents;
or the Statues of Illuſtrious Men, whoſe
Countenances reſembled the Originals, and whoſe
Habit and Poſture denoted what was the occaſion
of their Advancement. Even in the Countrey it
ſelf there were to be ſeen, Trophies, Tombs and
Pyramids, which were as ſo many Monuments of
<hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great care alſo there ſhould be to acquaint chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with a great many proper Names of Men
and Places; that they might ſoon be familiar to
them, and excite their Curioſity. Eſpecially I
would mention thoſe to them which make the
greateſt Figure in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the World, <hi>Seſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris,
Ninus, Nabucodonoſor, Cyrus, Hercules, Achilles,
Homer, Lycurgus;</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> proportionably.
But I would joyn thereto the Names of Modern
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54201:81"/>
                  <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> which yet are uſually much leſs ſpoken of
to Children: <hi>William the Conquerour, Godfrey of Boü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon,
Sancho the Great</hi> King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> and all the
other who have been moſt Famous theſe Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years. Neither would I altogether omit
even the <hi>Orientals;</hi> I would have a Child to have
heard ſome talk of the <hi>Cailiffs</hi> of <hi>Bagdad</hi> and <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro;</hi>
of the great Power of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and that
of the <hi>Moguls:</hi> their Names would not appear
to them ſo Barbarous afterwards, if they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to them betimes. They ſhould alſo make
uſe of <hi>Geographical Maps,</hi> for the Names of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which alſo they might learn according to
the difference of all Times, and all Languages,
as far as may be. In the beginning of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
I would not confine my ſelf to any
order of Dates, or Chronology, but follow the
Curioſity of Children, as occaſion ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to recount to them all theſe Names and
Actions.</p>
               <p>The Matter of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> being thus prepared, I
would begin to put it into order, as ſoon as my
<hi>Scholar</hi> ſhould be Ten or Twelve years old. I
would then make him obſerve the <hi>Epochs,</hi> which
are uſed in the reckoning of time. The <hi>Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi>
the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Rome, Alexander,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi>
the <hi>Mahometan Hegira.</hi> But I would
not Embaraſs him with an Exact <hi>Chronology,</hi> nor
oblige him to Retain the meer Simple Dates:
for this requires a great Effort of Memory. I
would alſo carefully abſtain from ſpeaking to
him of the <hi>Julian Period;</hi> and I would not uſe
even the years of the <hi>Creation of the World:</hi> for
'tis very Difficult, not to ſay Impoſſible, to fix
them; and beſides, they are not of great Uſe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54201:82"/>
ſince to the Times of the Foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the <hi>Olympiades</hi> (which are the ſame almoſt)
there ſcarce is any <hi>Hiſtory</hi> but the Sacred: The

of Years, which cannot, without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
be drawn into a Sum And unto thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and Occurrencies which are moſt known to

Computing the years of the <hi>World</hi> to thoſe, who
have Leiſure and Curioſity to <hi>Study Chronology</hi> more
profoundly.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I would often Repeat unto him
certain General Obſervations, which render the
<hi>Study</hi> of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> more ſhort, more eaſie, and more
uſeful. You muſt know (would I ſay to him)
that we have not the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of all Times, nor
of all Countries. There have always been a
great many ignorant Nations; and of thoſe who
have Written, there are very few whoſe <hi>Books</hi>
we know. All the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of the Ancient <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entals,</hi>
of the <hi>Egyptians, Syrians, Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
are periſhed; and the moſt Ancient which
we have, except that of God's People, is the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>Herodotus:</hi> which was not Written till
about Two thouſand years after the Flood, and
Twelve hundred after <hi>Moſes.</hi> To the Time of
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> we have ſcarce any Books
but thoſe of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> wherein are
Recorded any Hiſtories (which are certain, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54201:82"/>
worthy of Belief) more Ancient than the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of <hi>Rome.</hi> For Five hundred years after
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> you have onely one Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
to follow, which is the <hi>Roman.</hi> But after
the Ruin of the <hi>Weſtern Empire, Spain, France, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
and <hi>England</hi> Compoſed each of them their
particular Hiſtory: To which muſt be added
thoſe of <hi>Germany, Hungary, Poland, Sweedland</hi> and
<hi>Denmark,</hi> proportionably according to the time
when they began. Nevertheleſs all theſe Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
may be referr'd to that of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe
the Empire of <hi>Charlemaign</hi> Comprehended the
Greateſt part of theſe Countries; and in others,
he was ſo Reſpected, that the People accounted
it their honour to imitate the Manners of his
Subjects: Whence it is, that the <hi>Levantines</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
all the Nations I have mentioned under the
Name of <hi>Franks.</hi> This is the Succeſſion of the
Hiſtory which is moſt known to us; except you
will add thereunto the <hi>Byzantine</hi> Hiſtory, which
we have for Two hundred years. As for that of
the <hi>Muſulmen,</hi> which contains all that hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for a Thouſand years in <hi>Egypt, Syria, Perſia,
Africa,</hi> and all the other Countries, where the
Mahometan Religion is ſpread, we are ignorant
of it to this day.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this is not, as is commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
becauſe the Mahometans have Written
nothing, or becauſe their Books are loſt: for
there is as much of their Hiſtory alone as would
make a whole Library; but their Books are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Printed, nor Tranſlated, excepting two or
three, which go about in the hands of the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
We know alſo, that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> have a
Long Succeſſion of Hiſtory, whereof we have
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54201:83"/>
had in <hi>Latin</hi> an Abridgment about Thirty years
ſince. We know that the <hi>Indians</hi> have very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Traditions, Written in a particular Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
We know ſomething of the Hiſtory of
<hi>Mexico,</hi> and the <hi>Incaes,</hi> which yet doth not riſe
very high; And within theſe Two hundred years
we have had an infinite number of Relations of
ſeveral Voyages. This is all that we know of
Hiſtories. We ſee how little it is, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with the whole Compaſs of the Earth, and
all Succeſſions of Ages; yet nevertheleſs, as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
as it is, 'tis too much for one ſingle Man:
So that it is in this <hi>Study</hi> eſpecially, we ſhould
chuſe carefully, and limit our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Firſt we ought to know what to hold to, as
to the beginnings of each Hiſtory, that we may
not give credit to <hi>Fables,</hi> which affect to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
too high. The ſureſt Rule is, to look upon
all that as Suſpicious which precedes the time,
when each Nation received the uſe of <hi>Letters.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the Quality, and the Times of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
ſhould be diligently obſerv'd. It may be
ſaid in general, that no Hiſtories deſerve credit,
but of thoſe who have Written of their own Times;
or of thoſe who have Collected out of ſuch Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians;
whoſe Books, by a Succeſſive Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may have been delivered down to us. But
when there are Interruptions in an Hiſtory, and
large obſcure Vacuities, all that went before ought
to be ſuſpected. I ſhould content my ſelf with
this Order, and theſe General Rules for Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Hiſtory, and oblige my Scholar, to have a
more ſpecial inſight into the particular Hiſtory
of his own Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:54201:83"/>
Furthermore, This Study ſhould be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
extended, or contracted, according to the
Quality of Perſons. A Man of indifferent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
needs but a very little Hiſtory: He, who
is likely to have ſome ſhare in Publick Affairs,
ſhould know a great deal more thereof; and a
Prince cannot know too much. The Hiſtory of
his own Country makes him ſee his own Affairs,
and, as it were, the Titles of his Houſe; and
that of Foreign Countries neareſt to him; teaches
him the Concerns of his Neighbours, which are
always mixed with his own. Nevertheleſs, ſince
there are a great many other things to be known,
and the capacity of a Man's Mind is limited; He
ought chiefly to <hi>Study</hi> the Hiſtory of his own
Country, and Houſe; and to have a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Knowledge of that, which is neareſt to his
own Time. I would have every Lord propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to know well the Hiſtory of his own
Family; and every private perſon that of his
own Shire and Town, better than thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>The Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is a perfect Model of the
Choice which every one ſhould make in the <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
of Hiſtory. <hi>Moſes</hi> has therein Compriſed all
the things which it was uſeful for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
to know; chiefly dilating upon thoſe which are
of greateſt Importance: as the Creation, the Sin
of the Firſt Man, the Deluge, the Hiſtory of the
Patriarchs,<note place="margin">Gen. 10. 1.</note> unto whom God had made the Promiſes,
which he was about to fulfil. He doth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to obſerve the Origin of all Nations; and
to ſpeak more or leſs of their Hiſtory, as they
had more or leſs Relation to the People for
whom he Wrote. But if you would have an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54201:84"/>
Abridgment only for the refreſhing of your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
you have an Example thereof in the Firſt
Chapter of the <hi>Chronicles;</hi> where the Names a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
plac'd ſucceſſively, recalls all the Hiſtory of
<hi>Geneſis.</hi> It is nevertheleſs to be wiſht, though
it is not abſolutely neceſſary, that all who have
leiſure, do Read the Principal Hiſtories of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> They are profitable both for
Morality and Eloquence. For, bringing to the
Reading of them that Corrective which I have
Preſcrib'd, the Examples of the great Actions,
and good Conduct of the Ancients, may be very
uſeful; And the manner after which the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
Writ, may be of great advantage to us, both
as to the Method, and to the Style, if we know
how to imitate them. So that a Man ſhould as
well exerciſe himſelf in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, by
Reading the Hiſtorians as other <hi>Authors;</hi> ſince
without Reading much he cannot Learn it.</p>
               <p>

of Men,<note place="margin">Natural Hiſtory.</note> the moſt uſeful <hi>Study,</hi> in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
is Natural Hiſtory. I comprehend under
this Name, all that Knowledge which is Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and founded upon that Experience, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
the Conſtruction of the Univerſe, and of all
its parts: as far as is needful for one, who is not
to be an <hi>Aſtronomer, Phyſician,</hi> or <hi>Naturaliſt</hi> by
Profeſſion. For no Man, ſurely, ſhould be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ignorant of this World which we inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
of theſe Plants, and theſe Animals which
nouriſh us; of that which we are our ſelves. I
know very well, that the Knowledge of our
Selves is the moſt neceſſary of all. But this is
the Knowledge of the Soul, which I referr to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54201:84"/>
                  <hi>Logick,</hi> and <hi>Morality.</hi> As for the Body, ſince we
govern it much leſs by Knowledge, than by a
blind Inſtinct, attended with Motions, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon us, yet without our Knowledge of the
Springs and Machines, which are the immediate
Cauſes of them, the particular Knowledge of
its Structure is ſcarce of any uſe to us, but for
the admiring its <hi>Author;</hi> who is not leſs admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in other Animals, and other parts of Nature.
It's true, we ſhould be affected more with that
which we find in our ſelves. Moreover, the
Knowledge of the Body is very uſeful for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Paſſions, their Cauſes, and their
Cures, which is a great part of Morality; and
for diſcerning what is proper for the preſervation
of Health, from that which is deſtructive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
which is one of the <hi>Studies</hi> which I have
plac'd amongſt the moſt neceſſary.</p>
               <p>This Natural Hiſtory therefore ſhould Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
Coſmography, and Anatomy. By Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,
I underſtand the Syſtem of the World,
the Diſpoſition of the Stars, their Diſtances, their
Magnitudes, their Motions; according to the
late obſervations of the moſt exact Aſtronomers;
depending upon them as skilful Perſons, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be credited, without examining their
Proofs. Herein alſo I comprehend the Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
not labouring to ſearch out the Cauſes of
them, but only to know the Matters of Fact:
The Deſcription of the Earth, not ſo much of
its Surface, which relates to Geography (and is
referr'd to the Moral Hiſtory) as its Depth,
and the different Bodies, which it contains. At
firſt ſight, it ſeems, as if this Knowledge was no
more than pure Curioſity; but, in truth, it is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54201:85"/>
very uſeful for raiſing the Mind, and inlarging
it; for furniſhing us with true Ideas of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Wiſdom, and Almighty Power of God, of
our own weakneſs, and the littleneſs of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
things. Under the Name of Anatomy I
compriſe that of Plants, as well as that of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
without lanching into Curioſities, which has
no bounds. I would have my Scholar to know
well the Animals of his own Country, the moſt
famous of other Countries, and the Plants which
are moſt uſed: That he ſhould know how to
diſtinguiſh the principal parts of a Plant, and an
Animal; That he ſhould ſee how theſe Living
Bodies are nouriſhed, and preſerved; but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
That he ſhould be acquainted with the
Admirable Structure of thoſe Springs, which make
Animals to move: I mean that of them which
is felt with the Finger, the Bones and the Muſcles.
This <hi>Study,</hi> if he have Leiſure and a Genius, may
be extended to the Knowledge of thoſe Arts,
wherein are employ'd the moſt Ingenuous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines;
or which produce the moſt conſiderable
changes in Natural Bodies; as Chymiſtry, the
Melting of Metals, making Glaſs, Tanning and
Dying.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> INto the number of thoſe <hi>Studies</hi> which are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to all Students,<note place="margin">Geometry.</note> I alſo put Geometry: In
truth, it doth not onely contain the Principles of
ſeveral very uſeful Arts, as Mechanicks, Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Trigonometry, Gnomonicks, Architecture
wholly, (eſpecially Fortification, of ſuch great
uſe at this day) but alſo it forms the Mind in
general, and ſtrengthens the Reaſon extreamly.
It accuſtoms Men, not to content themſelves with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54201:85"/>
appearances; to ſeek after Solid Proofs; and not
to ſtop, as long as there is the leaſt ground for
doubting: and by this means to diſcern Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and Demonſtrative Reaſons from meer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities.
It would nevertheleſs be dangerous, if
not directed by ſuch a Logick as I have reckoned
amongſt the number of neceſſary <hi>Studies.</hi> For 'tis
this Logick, which lays down the Great Rules
of Evidence, of Certainty and Demonſtration:
and bids us not believe, that none but ſenſible
and imaginable things, as the objects of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
are, can be clearly known: That there are
no certain Reaſonings, but thoſe concerning the
Relations of Angles, and Lines, or the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Numbers: That we ought, in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to expect the ſame kind of Certainty. But
when theſe Diſtinctions and General Rules are
laid down by a good Logick, Geometry opens a
great Field of Exerciſe for Defining, Dividing,
and Reaſoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> TOwards the end of the Young Man's <hi>Studies,</hi>
when he is about the Age of Fourteen or
Fifteen,<note place="margin">Rhetorick.</note> or later (as his Underſtanding and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
will permit) the more ſolid Rules of true
Eloquence may be made known unto him. I do
not propoſe this <hi>Study</hi> as neceſſary, becauſe one
may be a good Man, and alſo expert to ſuch a
degree, without being Eloquent; as alſo becauſe
Eloquence depends, at leaſt as much upon <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
as <hi>Study.</hi> It muſt, nevertheleſs, be confeſt,
that it is of great uſe; and that ordinarily it
makes the moſt important and difficult Affairs
to ſucceed well. For here by Eloquence or
Rhetorick I do not underſtand, what is generally
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54201:86"/>
underſtood thereby, by abuſing a word, which
<hi>Pedants</hi> and <hi>Declamers</hi> have brought into diſrepute.
I do not, I ſay, underſtand that, which enables
Men to make Ceremonious Harangues, and other
ſuch-like Studied Diſcourſes, which tickle the Ear
for the preſent, but uſually do nothing but raiſe
Diſturbances. I underſtand hereby the Art of
perſwading effectually, whether a Man ſpeaks
in Private, or in Publick. I mean that, which
makes one Advocate to carry more Cauſes than
another; one Preacher, Humanly ſpeaking, to
Convert more Souls; one Magiſtrate to have a
greater ſway in the Debates of his Company;
one Agent to make a more advantageous Treaty
for his Prince; one Miniſter of State to Govern
more in his Counſels than another. In a word,
That which makes a Man become Maſter of
other Men's Minds, by Speech. I know well,
that they who ſucceed in the greateſt Affairs,
have more of natural Parts, and Experience,
than Study; but I doubt not, but that Study
would be very uſeful to them. They would
have never the leſs of thoſe fine natural accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments,
and that great Experience: And yet,
over and beſides, they would have ſome more
certain Rules, and the Examples of the greateſt
Men of Antiquity. A Prince, or Miniſter of
State, who ſhould be ſo well Educated, as to
be, from his Youth, well acquainted with <hi>Cicero,
Demoſthenes,</hi> and <hi>Thucydides,</hi> would find great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in Reading them over again when he comes
to the Age of Maturity, and receive great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
from them. But theſe Authors uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
uſeleſs, and are deſpiſed for want of fit
Readers. They are Read to Children, who
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54201:86"/>
would not underſtand, even in <hi>French,</hi> ſuch-like
Diſcourſes, for want of Experience in the World,
and attention unto Matters of Moment. Or if
they be Read by Men, they are the Learned by
Profeſſion, as <hi>Regents, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Religious,</hi> who
are Sequeſtered from the World, and are fill'd
with <hi>Ideas,</hi> quite different from thoſe, which
imploy'd the Thoughts of theſe Authours.
<hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> were Men brought up
in the World, and in Buſineſs: They Roſe by
their Merit much above their Birth (which yet
was honeſt, according to the Cuſtom of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
and they arrived to the greateſt Power they
could have in their Commonwealths. <hi>Cicero</hi> was
Conſul, that is, for the ſpace of a Year, he was
at the Head of an Empire, as large as Twelve
ſuch as any we now ſee in <hi>Europe.</hi> He Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Province, he Commanded Troops, he was
equal in Dignity, to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> Kings
Courted him. Yet becauſe we have read theſe
Authors at School, we often retain a very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<hi>Idea</hi> of them; becauſe we know that they
Pleaded Cauſes, we take them for ſuch Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
as Ours are;<note place="margin">Sueton <hi>in</hi> Jul. 55.</note> and do not conſider that <hi>Caeſar</hi>
Pleaded alſo, and might have diſputed Eloquence
with <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf. Beſides, we ſee many who
Study them all their Lives, without becoming
thereby more fit for the World and Buſineſs; and
we do not Reflect, that theſe Perſons ſeek for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them but Language, and Figures of
<hi>Rhetorick,</hi> which they often imitate very wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
they ſeek nothing leſs in them, than the
way of managing great Affairs.</p>
               <p>The more things the Scholar ſhall know,
and the more his Reaſon ſhall be Form'd, the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54201:87"/>
more capable he will be of this Study of Eloquence.
For it only gives the Form to Diſcourſes; good
Senſe, and Experience muſt furniſh the Matter.
I ſhould therefore wait till the young Man ſhould
have Thoughts, and be able to ſay ſomething of
himſelf, before I would Teach him the Way and
Manner of ſpeaking. Firſt, I would ſecure <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi>
and give him to underſtand as ſoon
as he ſhould be capable; that Eloquence is a good
accompliſhment, being only the perfection of
Speech: That, as Speech is given Us, only that
we may ſpeak the Truth, Eloquence is given to
make this Truth eſteemed, and to hinder it
from being ſtifled by the ill Artifices of thoſe
who oppoſe it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Plat. Gorg.</note> or the bad Diſpoſition of them who
hear it: That it is to abuſe Eloquence, to make
it ſerve Intereſts and Paſſions; though <hi>Cicero</hi> and
the greateſt part of Orators have made this uſe of
it: That its regular uſe is to perſwade Men to
that which is truly good, and eſpecially, that which
may make them better;<note place="margin">Auguſt. <hi>Doct. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> L. III. c. 2, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Painting out to them,
the horrour of Vice, and Beauty of Vertue in
lively Colours; as the Prophets and the Fathers of
the Church have done. This is what I call the
Morality of Eloquence.</p>
               <p>The Art conſiſts in knowing how to Speak
and Write well, upon all occaſions of Life; not
only in publick Actions, as thoſe Harangues,
which are made only to comply with ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Formalities; but in the more ordinary Debates
about Buſineſs, and in ſimple Converſations, in
knowing how to give a relation of any Matter,
to Write a Letter: All this is Matter of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
proportionably as the Subject requires
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:54201:87"/>
To ſhew him the Secret of it, I would Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
uſe Examples and Exerciſe. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
might be taken out of <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,</hi>
according as the Scholar ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with theſe Languages. If he knew no
<hi>Latin,</hi> the Tranſlations of <hi>Cicero</hi> might be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to him, or ſome good Modern Book, as
the Cardinal <hi>D' Oſſat</hi>'s Letters, which are full of
ſolid Eloquence, by which he had Succeſs in
Buſineſs. Theſe Examples would give ſubſtance
and pleaſure to the Precepts: For naked Precepts,
given in general, would always be Dry and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> L. c. 3.</note> and as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> ſays, one of good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
parts would acquire Eloquence, rather by
hearing Eloquent Diſcourſes, than by Studying
Precepts of Eloquence. He will thus gain by
all ſorts of Reading: He will every where find
Examples of that which he ought to follow,
and avoid; and this Exerciſe would ſettle his
Judgment: For he muſt be accuſtomed to Judge
of what he Reads, to give a Reaſon, why he
thinks it good or bad. Theſe Reaſons make up
the whole Art of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſtot.</hi> Rhetor. <hi>L.</hi> 1. initio.</note> which has been Form'd
upon Examples, by obſerving what did effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
perſwade, and what was prejudicial to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
and making Rules thereupon; to the
end, that they might not talk meerly at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but by Rule and Diſcretion: Not only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but Converſations, and the moſt common
Diſcourſes of Life, are good Leſſons of Eloquence.
Theſe living and familiar Examples, might render
it more ſolid and real, than Books, and all that
which ſmells of the School can. It is therefore,
adviſeable, to learn a young Man, how to make
advantage of it, and to Study all the Art of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54201:88"/>
after this natural way. Make him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Addreſſes, which the groſſeſt ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
uſe to make their Intereſts take effect; with
what force the Paſſions make them ſpeak, and
what variety of Figures they furniſh: How the
Voice, the Geſture and all the outward Demeanour,
is fitted to the motion of him who ſpeaks. Theſe
Examples are ſtronger in them, who are exerciſed
in Buſineſs, than in others; in the City, than in the
Country; at the Court, than in the City; and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
are more lively in Women, than in Men.</p>
               <p>The other means of Teaching this Art, which
is Exerciſe, ſhould conſiſt, not only in Writing,
but in Speaking. I would have this Exerciſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be perform'd in <hi>French,</hi> how well ſoever
the Scholar might know <hi>Latin.</hi> 'Tis ſufficient
that he be buſied in Learning to ſpeak well, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
applying himſelf alſo to a Language which
is not natural unto him. 'Tis to be fear'd, that
he would force his Thoughts, for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to expreſs them true enough, or leaſt
he ſhould loſe ſome fine Period in <hi>Cicero:</hi> If he
ſhould treat of any ancient Subject, he probably,
will Tranſcribe (without underſtanding them)
the Phraſes of thoſe Authors he has Read: And
if the Subject be Modern, he will be puzled to
ſpeak of it in <hi>Latin.</hi> For being accuſtomed to
ſpeak only to <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> he'll be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at a loſs, when he muſt ſpeak to Men,
wearing Hats and Periwigs; and is to treat of
the Intereſts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> where there
is neither Tribune to Plead before, nor Solemn
Popular Aſſemblies, nor Conſuls. Let him Write
therefore, in his own Language; firſt of all, Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
Letters, and other eaſie Compoſitions.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54201:88"/>
Afterwards, let him make ſome <hi>Elogy</hi> of a Great
Man, ſome common place of Morality; but ſuch
as is ſolid, without <hi>Jargon, Galamafries,</hi> and <hi>Falſe
Thoughts:</hi> Let him expreſs his real Thoughts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly.
Laſtly, when he ſhall have made ſome
Progreſs, let him Write whole Diſcourſes; as
Diſſertations upon the Hiſtories he ſhall have
Read, and upon the Subjects he ſhall know the
beſt; that he may, as far as he ſhall be able,
bring together all the circumſtantial Proofs of
the Matter, avoiding wandering, and general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.
Theſe Written Compoſitions do accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
Youth to attend, to fix their Thoughts,
to chuſe the Beſt, and put them into Order; to
make Periods, and in them, to obſerve the Turn,
and meaſure, which pleaſe the Ear: In a word,
to ſpeak exactly. The Exerciſe of ſpeaking,
will accuſtom them to hold on a continued Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
without being at a loſs, without Heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or Correcting themſelves, to be bold and
attentive. Now by this Exerciſe of Speaking,
I do not underſtand ſo much that which is called
Declaiming (which, at moſt, is uſeful, only to
thoſe who, in time, are to ſpeak in publick) as
thoſe Diſcourſes which are familiar, coherent and
maintained by thoſe, who ſpeak well of Buſineſs,
or relate an Hiſtory well in Converſation. This
is that which I call <hi>Rhetorick.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> BUt if your Scholar be one of an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Genius,<note place="margin">Poetry.</note> you may carry him on to <hi>Poetry,</hi>
which is, in Truth, but a more ſublime ſort of
Eloquence. I do not think, that this Art ſhould
be Taught to many; ſeeing it is better there
ſhould be no wretched Poets, than 'tis neceſſary
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54201:89"/>
there ſhould be any Poets at all. For Verſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
ought not to be accounted Poetry, nor
ſhould we look upon Poetry only as a Diverſion,
judging of it according to Modern Examples.
To ſee the true Character of it, we ſhould go
as high as <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Homer:</hi> In them we
ſhall ſee Poetry very grave and pleaſant both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
fit to form the Judgment for the Conduct
of Life, and full of Inſtructions, very neceſſary
to thoſe for whom they were made; that is to ſay,
of their Religion, and Hiſtory of their Country.
We may ſee the ſame thing in <hi>Pindar,</hi> and the
other <hi>Greek</hi> Poets. The <hi>Latins</hi> have only imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them: It is true, that <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Pindar,</hi>
who ſo well underſtood this Art, have uſed it
in fomenting Idolatry, and making themſelves
paſs (by a wicked ſort of impoſture) for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
Men and Prophets; not to ſpeak of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of their <hi>Morality:</hi> So that to find true
Poetry eſtabliſhed upon a ſolid Foundation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we may ſecurely taſte all the pleaſure the
Tongues of Men can give it, we muſt go to the
Songs of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and other true Prophets.
'Tis there we ſhould take the true <hi>Idea</hi> of Poetry.</p>
               <p>It conſiſts in my Opinion, in giving to the
moſt neceſſary Truths, a pleaſant and affecting
Reliſh, for the forming of Men's Lives, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
them happy; and in imploying for this
noble end, all that is moſt forceable, lofty, and
ſparkling in the Mind of Man; all that is moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
and Elegant in Speech, all that is moſt
Harmonious, and Paſſionate in the ſound of the
Voice. This therefore cannot be the ſport of
Children; it is miſerably to abuſe thoſe Excellent
Talents which God hath given us, to imploy them
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54201:89"/>
in wicked or uſeleſs Subjects. We ſhould rather
Labour to reconcile the lively imagination with
good Senſe, and with Vertue.</p>
               <p>There will be no great need of giving many
Rules of Poetry, to one, who already knows
thoſe of Eloquence: To ſuch an one, ſcarce any
thing more need to be given, but ſome excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
thereby obſerving how high Poetry may
riſe, and what it cuts off from ordinary Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
The moſt neceſſary thing, would be to ſhew
the different Characters of the ſeveral pieces of
Poetry: As what is an Ode, what an Hymn, an
Elegy, an Eclogue, and ſo of others; deſcribing
them according to the Model of the Ancients,
principally the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and ſhewing how we may
imitate them. As for the Rules of Verſifying,
this is a buſineſs but of a few Leſſons; Exerciſe
alone will make it eaſie. I do not here ſpeak of
<hi>Latin</hi> Verſes; if any of them be made, it ſhould
be, rather as an Exerciſe of <hi>Grammar,</hi> for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the quantity, and having choice of Words
for Compoſing: And yet, I know not, whether
this Profit would balance the Trouble, which the
Scholar would find in Learning to make theſe
<hi>Latin</hi> Verſes. But they, who would pretend
to Poetry ſhould Exerciſe themſelves in their
own Language, and Write for their own Nation.
To conclude, I will not ſay, that Poetry is an
uſeleſs knowledge to all thoſe who are not Born
Poets, or do not intend to Exerciſe this Talent.
'Tis fit, that the greateſt part of well-bred Men
ſhould be able to judge of Poetry, by true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
and to this purpoſe, that they ſhould
know the Characters of the ſeveral Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the Examples of the Ancients. But I
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54201:90"/>
cannot perſwade my ſelf to put this Study into
the number of thoſe which are the moſt uſeful,
of which I have already ſpoken. I only place it
in the Rank of laudable Curioſities, which I am
now about to enumerate.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> AS the firſt therefore of theſe Curioſities I
reckon Poetry in <hi>Theory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Curious Studies.</note> and the Reading
of the ancient Poets. Not but that a Man, if
he knows them well, may profit thereby, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by the <hi>Greeks:</hi> But to read them with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
a Man ſhould ſo well know their Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
their Mythology and their Manners; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that
the profit or the pleaſure which would come
thereby, ſeems to me not worth all this Toil:
conſidering, that there are ſo many things beſides,
that are neceſſary to be known. To Poetry, I
joyn Muſick: I do not mean only the Exerciſe
of Singing, and the Rules for Managing the
Voice, but the Art and Principles of theſe Rules.
With theſe alſo I joyn Painting, Deſigning, and
all the Arts which depend thereon. I put alſo,
amongſt the number of Curious Studies, all thoſe
parts of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> which go beyond the
Elements of <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geometry.</hi> Herein I
count <hi>Perſpective, Opticks, Astronomy,</hi> the <hi>Theory</hi> of
the <hi>Planets:</hi> Exactneſs in <hi>Chronology:</hi> The inquiry
after <hi>Antiquities,</hi> as <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Inſcriptions:</hi> The
Reading of <hi>Travels:</hi> The Study of <hi>Languages:</hi>
For, excepting <hi>Latin,</hi> the reſt may be Rank'd
amongſt the Curioſities.</p>
               <p>Not but that the <hi>Greek</hi> may be very uſeful
to all, who deſire to be well skill'd in <hi>Philology,</hi>
principally to <hi>Clergy-men.</hi> The <hi>Italian,</hi> and the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> are ſo nearly Ally'd to the <hi>French;</hi> that,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54201:90"/>
as little as our Genius lies towards Languages,
we ought not to neglect them. As for other ſtrange
Languages, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>German;</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but particular profit which can countervail the
difficulty of Learning them. But the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Curioſity of this kind, is that of the <hi>Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Languages.</hi> It Flatters our Vanity, as being
ſingular, and having ſomething prodigious in it.
Beſides it denotes a profound Learning, becauſe
theſe Languages are not ordinarily Learn'd, but
after thoſe which are more common. But in
Truth, its uſefulneſs is not ſo great as to pay for
the time and trouble which it coſts. As whole
Nations reap Advantage from the Courage and
Curioſity of ſome few Travellers, who have
diſcovered the moſt remote Countries; and from
the induſtry of the Merchants who daily Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
therein: So 'tis ſufficient, that ſome few of
the Curious, by their Tranſlations and Extracts,
ſhould let us know the Books of the <hi>Arabians,
Perſians,</hi> and other Orientals. Curioſity goes
much beyond the extent of the Memory, or even
of Life it ſelf; and amongſt the Curious them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
it is to be wiſh'd, that each of them
would limit himſelf to one Language, that he
might know it well; or, at moſt to two or
three, which have a great Connexion betwixt one
another; rather than to have an imperfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of a great number of them.</p>
               <p>I except the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, in reſpect to
the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> which 'tis hard well to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
without having ſome Tincture thereof: And
I account it very advantageous to the Church,
that there are always ſeveral <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it; if it was for no other Reaſon but
to ſilence the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who think to Fortifie
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54201:91"/>
themſelves thereby, and to Labour in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in thoſe Countries where
they are. But, excepting the neceſſity of this
Controverſie, I would not oblige my ſelf to Read
many <hi>Rabbins.</hi> There is more to be loſt than
gotten by this Study. Let us not ſuffer our
ſelves to be deceived by the Vanity, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, which all others are ignorant of; let
us conſider what uſe it is really of. If there
ſhould be any thing uſeful in the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> it would
be the Matters of Fact, and Traditions of
their ancient Cuſtoms of their Nation: But they
are, for the moſt part ſo Modern, that 'tis very
difficult to believe, that they have preſerved
theſe Traditions. There are ſcarce any of them
older than Five Hundred Years; ſo that though
the <hi>Talmud</hi> ſhould have been Written but a
Thouſand Years ago, there would ſtill be Five
Hundred Years, wherein theſe Traditions muſt
have been preſerved without Writing: A thing
which is ſcarce probable. The Time and the
Style of their Books, ſeem to ſhew that they
Writ only in Emulation of the <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
Nevertheleſs, if any one have ſo much inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for this kind of Study, as to give himſelf
wholly up to it; I would have him to confine
himſelf chiefly to the <hi>Talmud,</hi> where he will
doubtleſs find their moſt ancient and profitable
Traditions, for the knowledge of the Manners
of the <hi>Jews;</hi> principally after their return out
of Captivity, to their intire diſperſion under the
<hi>Romans.</hi> But this Labour is too painful, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
to invite many Men to undertake it.</p>
               <p>Another Curious Study, which yet may be
very uſeful, is the <hi>Theory</hi> of the different Trades
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54201:91"/>
and Manufactures. In this Rank alſo, I place
the Knowledge of <hi>Plants,</hi> not only ſuch as are
uſeful, but of all that has been ſaid of them,
and likewiſe of <hi>Animals,</hi> and all natural Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
proportionably: The Experiments of <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi>
or of other Arts, whereby new Secrets have
been diſcovered: The different <hi>Syſtems</hi> which
the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have invented, for the Explaining
the effects of Nature: That is to ſay, in a word,
all <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> or natural <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> I call all this
Curioſity: It is better to be buſied therein, than to
be Idle, or devote ones ſelf to Play: But a Man
ought to be very cautious on the other Hand, that
he doth not ſo deliver himſelf up to Curioſities, as
to quit the Eſſential Duties of Life; as to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Buſineſs and more uſeful Studies, though
leſs pleaſant; as to deprive himſelf of Bodily
Exerciſe, which preſerves his Health, or of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Diverſion for unbending the Mind, and
putting it into a condition of applying it ſelf to
more uſeful things. It is this Paſſion of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
which doth moſt harm to Learned Men;
though otherwiſe it often conduces to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on certain pieces of Knowledge, very
far. But for this end, 'tis ſufficient, that ſome
private Men ſuffer themſelves to be Tranſported
with this Paſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/> I Put a great deal of difference betwixt thoſe
Curioſities which are laudable and good in
themſelves,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeleſs Studies.</note> and thoſe Studies which are bad, or
altogether uſeleſs. I had rather a Man ſhould
do nothing, than ſeek after the <hi>Philoſopher</hi>'s
<hi>Stone:</hi> I had rather he ſhould be ignorant, than
know the great, or the little Art of <hi>Raymund
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54201:92"/>
Lully;</hi> which makes a Man to know nothing
truly, and yet to believe that he knows every
thing, becauſe he knows the Alphabets, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
wherein, under certain Words, and Figures,
are placed Notions, ſo general, which none can
be ignorant of, even without Study; and which
alſo lead to nothing. In this Rank likewiſe, I
place every thing that deceives, under the Name
of <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> The <hi>Phyſicks</hi> which give a Man
no knowledge of Nature: The <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi>
which doth not at all conduce to the inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
the Mind, and do not lay down the
great and Fundamental Principles of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>Judiciary <hi>Astrology</hi> is ſtill more deſpicable
than bad <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> ſeeing it has leſs appearance
of Reaſon: And it is much more dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
its Deſign is to know what is to come;
and engages Men, who give credit to it, to
guide their Lives by deceitful Lights; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the expreſs Prohibitions of the Law of
God,<note place="margin">Deut. xviii. 11.</note> which condemns, in general, all ſorts of
Divination, and particularly, the fear of the
Signs of Heaven.<note place="margin">Jer. x. 2.</note> Nevertheleſs, there are but too
many, who ſuffer themſelves to be bewitch'd with
it; and perhaps the Prohibition contributes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
For they are not Men of the beſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
nor the Honeſteſt, who amuſe
themſelves therewith. 'Tis true, it is not Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
when 'tis reſtrain'd to the Prediction of the
Changes of Weather, and all that depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the motion of Matter: But even in this, 'tis
falſe, and impertinent; ſince it Reaſons upon
fanciful Principles, and which have no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Reaſon, or Experience; nor any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54201:92"/>
with the Conſequences drawn from them.
Of this kind alſo, is <hi>Chiromancy,</hi> which foretells,
I know not what, by the Lines within the Hand;
and I do not underſtand, why as great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
may not be diſcovered by thoſe of the Foot;
unleſs it be only becauſe they cannot be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
look'd upon.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Reliques of ancient Superſtitions;
for all the Divination of the <hi>Heathens</hi> was of this
Nature. They obſerved the divers Motions of
the Flame aſcending upon the Altar; which they
called <hi>Pyromantie:</hi> They conſidered the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Situation of the Extrails of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices;
and this was the Art of their <hi>Aruſpices:</hi>
The <hi>Augurs</hi> obſerved the flying of Birds, their
Singing, their manner of Eating: Other Deviners
made their Predictions from Prodigies; whether
they were really ſo in Nature; or whether they
made thoſe appearances to be eſteemed as ſuch,
which had nothing in them extraordinary; for
Superſtition made Men fearful of every thing.
If one had met a Black <hi>Dog,</hi> or found a <hi>Serpent,</hi>
or if his <hi>Stockings</hi> were wrong put on, and a
Thouſand other Accidents, to which we ſhould
ſcarce believe they had any regard, if the
Books of the Ancients did not ſhew the Truth
of theſe things;<note place="margin">

ſome Reliques of them. There were ſome who
Explained Dreams; others, who diſtinguiſhed
Lucky and Unlucky Days. And abundance of
People Lived upon this Trade of Divining;
there were an infinite number of Books about
it; it was a very long and difficult Study. For
ſince it was Founded only upon the Opinion of
Men, and upon pretended Experiences; it could
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54201:93"/>
have nothing certain. And this Art of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was ſupported, as other parts of <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
by the reſpect Men had for Antiquity; for it
was very ancient in the World. The <hi>Romans</hi>
and the <hi>Greeks</hi> had it from the <hi>Egyptians, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi>
and other <hi>Orientals;</hi> and it was Authorized
by Religion. Chriſtianity had brought it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
into contempt; but the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and
the <hi>Jews,</hi> have, with great diligence, Collected
all that remained of it, both in Books, and in
the Memories of Men. They are, at this Day,
ſtill much addicted to it, and the <hi>Indian Idolaters</hi>
much more. Amongſt Chriſtian Nations, thoſe
give moſt Credit to theſe Impoſtures, who are
the leaſt improved in good Learning, for nothing
is ſo proper to diſabuſe them herein, as the Study
of natural <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and true <hi>Aſtronomy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt pernicious Studies we may further reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all that which is called <hi>Magick,</hi> even that which
is termed Natural; which is made to conſiſt in
<hi>Sympathies,</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> betwixt certain Numbers,
and Figures, and natural Bodies; betwixt the
<hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Metals,</hi> or <hi>Plants,</hi> or the Parts of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Bodies: In a word, in all the <hi>Rêveries</hi> of
the <hi>Cabbala.</hi> I account it alſo unworthy of a
Well-bred Man to learn the tricks of <hi>Leger-de-Main,</hi>
or to perform all thoſe Feats of Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which make <hi>Mountebanks</hi> ſo much admired.
To do them well, a Man muſt be very much
Exerciſed in them; and the Pleaſure which may
be taken in them, can never countervail the Time
ſpent in Learning them. I ſhould ſay the ſame of
all Sedentary Games, which require ſo much Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that after having play'd a while, the Head
is diſcompoſed therewith: For thoſe, methinks,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54201:93"/>
are ſtrange kind of Divertiſements, which make
thoſe who uſe them, to ſtand in need of being
diverted afterwards. The Glory of Playing well
at <hi>Cheſs,</hi> is not, in my Opinion, worth the pains;
which being well imployed, might acquire ſome
ſolid knowledge, and if they, who have Parts
and Leiſure, would beſtow upon ſome kind of
Study, which they like, ſome of that great deal
of time, which muſt be thrown away upon
Games, to know them perfectly, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more benefit, and probably, no leſs Pleaſure
alſo. The ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> lived plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly,
though they played much leſs, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more time to Converſation, and Reading.
But Cuſtom has prevailed, and Men now Game
for Intereſt, rather than Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> HAving run through all the Studies, which
we ſhould apply our ſelves unto in
the time of Youth,<note place="margin">The order of Studies according to ſeveral Ages.</note> before we be determined
unto any Profeſſion; I think it neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
in what Age I would have them placed;
and how they may be carry'd on all the time, from
the moſt tender Infancy, till Men enter into the
World, and into Buſineſs. Firſt, There ſhould
always be ſeveral Studies going on at the ſame
time. I have ſignify'd this, in ſeveral paſſages
of this Diſcourſe, as when I ſay, that <hi>Morality,
Logick, Hiſtory, Oeconomicks,</hi> ſhould begin as ſoon
as a Child is capable to underſtand what is ſaid
to him; though according to the different Ages,
very different Methods ſhould be obſerved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
The ſame proportionably I have ſpoken of
<hi>Grammar, Arithmetick, Law,</hi> and of <hi>Rhetorick;</hi>
and it ſhould be underſtood of other Studies, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54201:94"/>
Bodily Exerciſes, which are to be performed at
the ſame time. And if any one wonder hereat,
I deſire him to conſider, that Children Act, at
the ſame time, by Body and Soul, and by the
divers faculties of the Soul, which are to be
cultivated by theſe different Studies. They Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
all at once, the Will, the Reaſon, the
Memory, the Imagination. If their Studies be
ſeparated, 'tis to be feared, that their Manners
may be Corrupted, whilſt their Memory is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving;
and that, whilſt they are wholly buſied
in Learning a Language, their Reaſoning may
go aſtray. It will be too later to recover it again,
when ill habits ſhall be formed. Beſides, Variety,
more eſpecially in this Age, doth pleaſe: Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
Study more willingly four different things
in two hours, than one only in one hour. One
Study is a Diverſion to another, and the more
different they are, the leſs fear there is of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
them.</p>
               <p>To come now to the diſtinction of Ages, and
to lay down more diſtinctly, what hitherto I
intended to ſay, I ſhould deſire, that an Infant
ſhould be taken care of, as ſoon as he begins to
Underſtand and Speak, which I reckon is when
he is about Three Years old. Till Six, I ſhould
permit him to divert himſelf, and freely to look
about him, preſenting, as much as poſſible, thoſe
Objects to him, which may be for Inſtruction;
relating to him Hiſtories, anſwering his Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſpeaking before him (as ſeeming to have
no Deſign) that which may be uſeful to him;
yet ſo, that he might be able to underſtand it.
I would not, at this Age, oblige him to ſay any
Leſſon, or get any thing by Heart, but the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54201:94"/>
                  <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> and ſome other Prayers.
A Father, or a Mother, careful of their Duty, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
by Diſcreet and Affectionate Servants, may
give him theſe firſt Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>At Six years he may have a Maſter, who may
begin gently to require ſomething of him more
Regularly. He may Recount to him ſome <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
eſpecially ſuch as relate to Religion: Teach
him the Catechiſm, to fix in him the Doctrin (of
which he Diſcourſes to him more largely) and
alſo to Write, and Read. At the ſame time,
what he at firſt began to Inſtruct him in, muſt be
continued with more Diligence than before; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing
to him a great many Matters of Fact;
Naming many Famous Perſons; Letting them

explaining to them that which relates
to <hi>Houſe-keeping, Husbandry,</hi> and <hi>Arts.</hi> In theſe firſt
years great care ſhould be taken to draw on
Children by Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>At Nine or Ten years they may be kept in
more awe, and more ſeverely uſed, if there be
need. This is alſo the time, wherein he ſhould
be Inſtructed in the more Troubleſom <hi>Studies;</hi> as
<hi>Grammar, Compoſitions</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> The <hi>Languages</hi>
(according to that Profeſſion which it may be
reaſonably foreſeen the Child will take to) the
<hi>Latin, Greek, German.</hi> It is good to begin them
in this Age, from Eight or Nine to Twelve.
This alſo is the time to Learn the moſt Simple O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi> to Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> by <hi>Chronology</hi> and <hi>Geography.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At Twelve years old, it will be time to form the
Judgment, and to guide <hi>Reaſon</hi> by <hi>Logick,</hi> accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Youth to Define and Divide well, and to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54201:95"/>
make Reflections upon his Thoughts. This is
alſo the time to Teach him the Demonſtrations
of <hi>Geometry,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Mathematicks</hi> which
he ought to know. Moreover, he ſhould be
brought to Read much, and to exerciſe his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon <hi>Authours:</hi> Then alſo, or ſooner, if it
may be, the Terms, and Principal Maxims of the
Law ſhould be begun to be Explained to him.</p>
               <p>At Fifteen years, if you be not haſtened, it will
be ſoon enough to Teach him <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> though
you may try the Genius of your Scholar before, by
ſeveral little Compoſitions, by exerciſing him in
<hi>Grammar,</hi> and cauſing him to Epitomize the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
which he is moſt concern'd to know the
beſt: They will certainly improve his Style. In
theſe laſt years of <hi>Studies</hi> he ſhould alſo Learn that
more exactly, which, as yet, he has only rudely
cut out; as <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> if his condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it: and <hi>Morality,</hi> which, if poſſible, he ſhould
throughly underſtand, even to the firſt Principles
thereof. To this time alſo thoſe <hi>Studies</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
which have more of Curioſity in them, as
<hi>Poetry, Phyſicks</hi> (or Natural <hi>Philoſophy) Aſtronomy:</hi>
that ſo more or leſs of them may be imparted to
him, according to his Leiſure and Inclination.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to me to be the moſt convenient way
of managing <hi>Studies</hi> according to different Ages. I
am ſenſible, that 'tis impoſſible to preſcribe any one,
which agrees to all Children; and that there may be
very great differences herein, from the differences
of Minds, which advance more, or leſs; of Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which afford more or leſs leiſure, and require
more, or leſs <hi>Study;</hi> Laſtly of Health, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
of Life. Yet I thought it would not be
altogether uſeleſs to mark out this rude Draught, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which, very nearly, meaſures may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

IT is further neceſſary to explain my ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Studies</hi> of Perſons of the other
Sex,<note place="margin">The Studies of Women.</note> of which I have ſaid ſomething in ſeveral
places. It will doubtleſs be accounted a great
<hi>Paradox,</hi> to ſay, That they ought to Learn any
thing but their <hi>Catechiſm, Sowing,</hi> and ſeveral lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Matters; to Sing, Dance, and Dreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
according to the Faſhion; to make a
Curt'ſy well, and Speak Civilly: for this is all,
wherein their Education is, ordinarily, thought
to conſiſt. 'Tis true, they have no need of the
moſt parts of Knowledge, which, at preſent, go
under the Name of <hi>Studies:</hi> neither <hi>Latin,</hi> nor
<hi>Greek,</hi> nor <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> nor the <hi>College-Philoſophy</hi>
are proper for them: and, if ſome of the more
Curious of them have Learnt them, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
drew nothing from them but Vanity;
which render'd them odious to other Women, and
deſpiſed by Men. Whence, as from certain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
it has been concluded, that Women
were not capable of <hi>Studies:</hi> as if their Souls
were of another kind, than thoſe of Men; as if
they had not, as well as we, a Reaſon to Direct,
a Will to Govern, Paſſions to ſtrive againſt,
Health to Preſerve, and Goods to take Care of;
or, as if it was more eaſie for them, than us, to
Diſcharge all theſe Duties, without Learning any
thing. 'Tis true, that Women have uſually leſs
Attention, and leſs Patience for Reaſoning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially,
leſs Courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Reſolution than
Men: and that the Conſtitution of their Bodies
contributes ſomething to this Diſparity, though
doubtleſs their Ill Education doth more. But,
for a balance, they have more quickneſs of Mind,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54201:96"/>
and Penetration; more Sweetneſs, and Modeſty:
and, if they be not deſign'd for ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Imployments as Men are, they have, upon
this, and other Accounts alſo, much more leiſure,
which degenerates into a great Corruption of
Manners, if it be not imploy'd in ſome <hi>Study.</hi>
And we have particular Reaſon in <hi>France,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that Women ſhould be Knowing, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable;
and that is the Credit and Reſpect which
they have amongſt us. That which cauſes ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
very Polite Men, to Reaſon little, and Speak
with little Coherence, is, becauſe they turn their
<hi>Studies</hi> into Raillery, and make profeſſion of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance:
And this, becauſe, being form'd in the
Converſation of Women, they retain the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
thereof: Whereas, on the contrary, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Ancients, with whom Learning and
Reaſoning were in honour, the Women were
more Learned, and yet nevertheleſs not ſo
much Regarded.</p>
               <p>To ſee what <hi>Studies</hi> may be uſeful to Women,
I think the ſureſt way is to run over all
thoſe I have already Explained. Firſt then, they
ought not to be over-Ignorant in Religion, nor
too knowing therein. Since they are ordinarily
inclin'd to Devotion; if they be not well-Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
they may eaſily become Superſtitious. It is
therefore of great Importance for them early to
underſtand Religion, to be as Solid, Great, and
Serious as it really is in it ſelf. But if they be
Learned therein, 'tis to be feared, that they may
become Dogmatical, and embrace new Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when they ſhall find opportunity for it. It
is enough therefore to Teach them the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Doctrines, without entring into <hi>Theological</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:54201:96"/>
Diſputes; and to take the moſt pains in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
them in <hi>Morality;</hi> Inſpiring into them
thoſe Vertues which moſt belong to them, as
Sweetneſs, Modeſty, Submiſſion, Love of Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Humility; and thoſe to which their
Temper is moſt oppoſite; as Courage, Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Patience. For the Mind, they ſhould
ſoon be exerciſed in thinking Coherently, and
Reaſoning Solidly, upon the moſt ordinary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which be of uſe to them; Teaching
them what is moſt Eſſential in <hi>Logick,</hi> without
Choaking them with Great Words, which may
only fill them with Vanity. For the Body, there
is ſcarce any Exerciſe proper for them, but Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But all the Precepts of Health which I
have given, appertain unto them; and, indeed,
they have the moſt need of them, ſince they are
more ſubject to Indulge themſelves in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to draw Reſpect from their Diſtempers
and Weakneſſes. The Health and Vigour of
Women concern all the World; ſeeing they
are Mothers of Boys as well as Girls. It would
be well alſo for them to know the moſt eaſie
Remedies of ordinary Diſtempers: for they are
very fit to prepare them in Houſes, and to take
care of the Sick. <hi>Grammar,</hi> as to them, conſiſts
onely in Reading, and Writing, and Compoſing
correctly in <hi>French</hi> a Letter, <hi>Memoir,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Piece ſuitable to them. <hi>Practical Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
is ſufficient for them; and it is no leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for them than Men; and alſo they have
need of <hi>Oeconomicks,</hi> ſince they are deſign'd more
to intend the Affairs within doors, at leaſt more
particularly: Accordingly they are careful enough
to inſtruct themſelves in Domeſtick Management.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54201:97"/>
But, 'tis to be wiſht, that, together with this
Skill, was joyned a little more Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
for the Curing of two Evils; Littleneſs
of Spirit, and Covetouſneſs, ſo incident to the
Managing Women; and on the other ſide, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
and Diſdain in thoſe who pretend to
the Spirit of Wit. To this end, it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uſeful, to make them comprehend betimes,
that the moſt Honourable Imployment of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is, the care of all within Doors; provided
that ſhe do not value her ſelf too much upon
that, which onely tends to her Intereſt, and that
ſhe know how to put every thing into its proper
place.</p>
               <p>Tho' Matters without doors chiefly relate unto
the Men, yet 'tis impoſſible but that often the
Women muſt have part therein; and ſometimes
they find themſelves altogether charged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;
as when they become Widows. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
further neceſſary to Teach them ſome Skill
in Law; that is, ſo much as I have Recommended
to all Perſons of any Condition. They ſhould
underſtand the Common Terms of Buſineſs, and
the Great Maxims; In a word, they ſhould be
capable to go to Council, and take Advice. And
this Inſtruction is the more neceſſary in <hi>France,</hi>
becauſe Women are not under Guardianſhip;
and may have Great Poſſeſſions, of which they
are Abſolute Miſtriſſes. They may omit all the
other <hi>Studies: Latin,</hi> and other Languages, <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Mathematicks, Poetry,</hi> and all [other] Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
They are not deſign'd for thoſe Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which make theſe <hi>Studies</hi> either neceſſary,
or uſeful to them; and ſeveral of them would
only make them Inſtruments of Vanity. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54201:97"/>
'tis better they ſhould ſpend their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
hours in them, than in Reading Romances,
in Gaming, or ſpeaking of their Petticoats, Gowns,
and their Ribbons.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> I Think I have ſufficiently explain'd all the <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
which are to be Taught to Youth;<note place="margin">Studies of Clergy-men.</note> and all
which belong to all ſorts of Perſons of both
Sexes: at preſent I ſpeak of thoſe, which are
particular to Men of divers Profeſſions, referring
all to the three Principal, the Church, the Sword,
and the Gown.</p>
               <p>A Clergy-man is deſign'd to Inſtruct others,
concerning Religion, and to perſwade them to
Vertue. Therefore he ſhould know three things;
The Myſteries of Faith, Morality, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Teaching them.</p>
               <p>His Principal <hi>Study</hi> ſhould be the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Let him begin to Read it from his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and continue this Reading ſo conſtantly all
his Life, that every Sacred Text may be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
familiar unto him; and that there may be no
place which he cannot quickly recollect. Though
he ſhould Learn it all by heart, he would do no
more than what was very common, in the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Church, even in Lay-men.</p>
               <p>This conſtant Reading of the Scripture will
ſerve as a good Commentary, provided, that at firſt
you ſhall onely ſeek after the litteral Senſe (which
will offer it ſelf naturally to your mind) without
ſtopping at Difficulties. You will always find
therein clear Truths enough for your Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that of others. After having Read all
the Holy Scripture with attention, one Chapter
after another, without skipping over any thing;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54201:98"/>
when you ſhall come to Read it again, a great
part of your difficulties will vaniſh. They will
grow ſtill leſs at a Third Reading; and the more
you ſhall Read it, the more clear will it be to
you; provided, that you ſhall Read it with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
and Submiſſion, conſidering that it is God
himſelf who ſpeaks. The Hiſtorical Catechiſm
may facilitate the Reading of Holy Scripture in
Beginners; helping them to diſcern which are
the moſt conſiderable paſſages, and ought to be
moſt meditated upon. The Treatiſe concerning
the Manners of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> is as a General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
which removes ſeveral literal difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
As for the Spiritual Senſe of Scripture it
muſt be ſoberly ſought after; chiefly relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that which is obſerved in Scripture it ſelf: and
afterwards that which we learn by Tradition, I
mean, by the moſt uniform, and Ancient Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Fathers.</p>
               <p>A Clergy-man ought to avoid the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
of Studying too much, and too little.
There are ſeveral who think that they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to do after the Office, and the Maſs,
if they have no Benefice with Cure of Souls; and
if they have, they believe they have done all that
is required, by performing the moſt urgent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
But we ought not to be at reſt, as long as there
ſhall be Ignorant Perſons to be Inſtructed, and
Sinners to be Converted. They therefore who
have no great Natural Parts, nor great conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
for <hi>Studying,</hi> who want Books, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
(as in the Country, and far diſtant Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
ſhould make it their buſineſs to know the
Eſſential and Common things: To Catechize;
which is not ſuch an eaſie Office, as ſeveral ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54201:98"/>
but the moſt important of all, ſeeing it is
the Foundation of Religion: To make Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of Holy-days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Familiar Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
accommodated to the Capacity of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours:
To hear Confeſſions, and give Whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Advice. A Vertuous and Zealous Prieſt may
do all this, without Reading any thing but the
Holy Scripture, the Catechiſm, the Council, the
Inſtructions of his Ritual, ſome Sermons of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi>
or other Moral Book of ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which ſhall happen to fall into his hands.
This is that which may be ſaid to be neceſſary,
in the matter of Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Studies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They who are at leiſure, and have Books, and
other Conveniencies of <hi>Studying,</hi> ought to guard
themſelves againſt Curioſity. The beſt Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative,
in my Opinion, is, early to conſider the
full extent of our Profeſſion, and all the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it requires. An Accompliſh'd Clergy-man
ſhould be able to prove Religion to <hi>Libertines</hi>
and <hi>Infidels;</hi> and conſequently ought to be very
well skill'd in <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſick,</hi> (ſuch as I
have repreſented them) that he may be able to
Demonſtrate, by Solid Reaſons, that every Man
of Good Senſe, ought to ſubmit himſelf to the
Authority of the Catholick Church. He ſhould
alſo be capable to defend Religion againſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;
and for this end to know the poſitive
Proofs of our Belief, drawn from the Scripture,
the Councils, or the Fathers. He ſhould know
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, the Canon-Law, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Practical, Beneficial, and that which is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in the ancient Canons, but alſo the true
Rules of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline (upon which all
that is Practical is founded) and how that which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54201:99"/>
is not practiſed has been aboliſhed. He ſhould
know Chriſtian Morality in all its extent; not
contenting himſelf only with the Deciſions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Caſuiſts, concerning what is Sin, and what is
not: But he ſhould proceed further, and ſee
how the Fathers have judged thereof, and alſo
be acquainted with their Method of Teaching
Vertue, and guiding Souls to Perfection. This
is what we will find in <hi>Caſſian,</hi> and the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Rules. A great eſteem ought to be had of
theſe Works, which are the Product of ſo many
Holy Experiences. Laſtly, He ſhould know
the Ceremonies of the Publick Office, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Sacraments; the Practice of all
Eccleſiaſtical Functions: But this Study conſiſts,
not ſo much in Reading of Books, as in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of Living Tradition. When once he
has the Great Principles of Scripture, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he will be much inſtructed by ſeeing the
Labours of others, and by labouring himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with them.</p>
               <p>Seeing that a Clergyman is deſigned to inſtruct
others, it is not enough for him to know all that I
have mentioned: he muſt alſo know how to
Speak, and Perſwade. He therefore ſtands in
need of that ſort of Logick, and that ſolid E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
I have ſpoken of. For let us not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
our ſelves, a Man without Gifts is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the Miniſtry of the Church. A good
Prieſt is not onely a Man who Prays unto God,
and leads an Innocent Life; ſuch an one, at moſt,
is no more than a good Monk. He is a Prieſt to
aſſiſt others; and, as he is not accounted a good
Phyſician who doth not heal a great many Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
neither is he to be called a good Prieſt, who
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54201:99"/>
doth not Convert a great many Sinners. I do
not ſay, that none ought to be made Prieſts, but
ſuch as have a florid Imagination, an happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
a pleaſant Voice, and ſuch like qualities,
which uſually make Preachers Famous: but I
ſhould deſire, that there were not any, who
have not a Solid Judgment, and a right way of
Reaſoning; who ſhould not know how to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct,
both in Publick and in Private; with all
the Sweetneſs and Authority which the difference
of Subjects and Perſons do require: In a word,
who ſhould not have ſome Ray of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick
Eloquence, the perfect Model of which
we have in St. <hi>Paul.</hi> A Clergy-man, unto whom
ſo many Pieces of Knowledge are neceſſary,
ſhould not loſe his time in Prophane Studies, or
uſeleſs Curioſities. He ſhould alſo uſe great choice
in the <hi>Studies</hi> appertaining to his Profeſſion: Let
him not beſtow too much time upon thoſe Large
<hi>Commentaries</hi> on <hi>Scripture,</hi> the ſight of which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
is enough to terrifie, by the Bigneſs and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Volumes; and to make one deſpair
of ever underſtanding the Text: Let him not
amuſe himſelf with uſeleſs Speculations, and the
vain Wranglings of the School-men: Let him
not ſuffer himſelf to be Tranſported too far with
the humour of Criticizing upon matters of Fact,
and Inquiring too Curiouſly into Eccleſiaſtical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities:
for there are all theſe Rocks to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
even in the <hi>Studies</hi> which belong unto
him. He ought always to remember, that the
<hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is not an Humane Art, or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
wherein every one is permitted to ſeek, and
invent: that his buſineſs is onely to Collect, and
faithfully preſerve the Tradition of the Church.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54201:100"/>
He ſhould Meditate Attentively upon thoſe
Rules which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For a Clergy-man ſhould not be a profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

is to be a Man of Action, and, above all, of

Armed Madman. It is therefore of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they, whoſe Inclination, and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
do put them into ſo dangerous a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſhould have a great deal of Reaſon and Power
over themſelves; to the end that they may uſe
their Courage and Strength only for the Publick
Good, and againſt the Enemies of the State. It
would be better that the Houſe ſhould not be
Guarded at all, than that it ſhould be kept by
Dogs, who, without diſtinction, ſhould fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe who belong to the Houſe, as well as
upon the Thieves.</p>
               <p>The other Reaſon is, the great Idleneſs which
uſually attends a Soldiers Life. He knows not
what to do, when in Garriſon in Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in a place where he muſt ſtay any time,
when his Wounds are under Cure, and oblige
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54201:101"/>
him to think of them for a while. Happy then
is he, if he have a Book, and can take pleaſure
in Reading.</p>
               <p>Further, I doubt not but that many more
Soldiers would love <hi>Study,</hi> if they knew, or did
conſider, that <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> were very
Learned; and that Ignorance joyned to Valour,
never produced any other than Brutal Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and Deſtroyers of Mankind; as the <hi>Turks</hi>
and <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Studies</hi> which ſeem to me moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for <hi>Sword-men,</hi> are theſe; Amongſt the
Tongues, the <hi>Latin;</hi> yet rather, for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of Travel, than for Reading. And, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account, they ſhould be able to ſpeak
it, if not Elegantly, yet at leaſt Fluently. With
this Tongue a Man may Travel all over the
North; it ſupplying the place of ſeveral others.
Nevertheleſs 'tis very fit they ſhould know the
<hi>German</hi> Tongue; and the ſooner they learn it,
'twill be the better. When they ſhall be once
well acquainted with the <hi>Latin,</hi> they'll eaſily learn
<hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> Thus in what Country ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they may have been born, they will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Neighbouring-Languages, which are
the moſt neceſſary. They ſhould know a great
many Hiſtories: The Ancient, to ſee therein the
Examples of Great Captains, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman;</hi>
to know as particularly as may be, that Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Diſcipline, and that Art of War, which
made them ſo ſtrong above other Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:54201:101"/>
The Modern Hiſtory will give them a
Knowledge of the preſent State of Affairs, and
their Original; the Right of the Prince whom
they ſerve, and the Intereſts of other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns.
<hi>Geography</hi> alſo is very neceſſary for them;
and, as for the Countries, eſpecially where they
make War, they cannot know them too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
nor have a too exact <hi>Topography</hi> of
them. As to the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> they chiefly need
<hi>Arithmetick, Geometry</hi> and <hi>Mechanicks:</hi> for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe well, they'll eaſily apprehend the
practice of <hi>Fortifications;</hi> and all that either
<hi>Books</hi> or <hi>Maſters</hi> uſe to Teach concerning the
<hi>Art of War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is one <hi>Study</hi> which <hi>Sword-men</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
undertake, and which yet, to me, ſeems
very neceſſary, at leaſt to thoſe who are in
Command; and that is, the Policy and Law of
War. I mean, that they ſhould know the <hi>Jus
belli,</hi> or Right of War, in all its extent: as,
<hi>What are the lawful cauſes thereof; What Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ought to be obſerved for the beginning of it;
How far Acts of Hoſtility ſhould proceed; What Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Perſons are exempt therefrom;</hi> In a Word,
all that which reſpects this part of Publick
Right, the Execution of which is committed to
them. They ſhould be well-inform'd of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
of their Prince, and the particular Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
for the Subſiſtence and Diſcipline of the
Troops; and, above all, they ſhould know the
Rules of thoſe ſevere Judgments which muſt be
executed againſt Deſertion, and other Military
Crimes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:54201:102"/>
The reſt of the Art of War, which is the
moſt Eſſential part of it, cannot be Learn'd by
Books, or Lectures; for it depends upon the
Exerciſe of Body, upon Converſation with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Experienced in the <hi>Trade; and upon the
actual Service of him, who would be Inſtructed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
But if he be well Educated, if he be early
accuſtomed to ſeek after what is real and ſolid
in all things; to make Reflection upon every
thing he ſees; and put uſeful Queſtions to all
ſorts of People; he'll know more of it in Two
Campaigns, than others in Ten. War is a
more ſerious Myſtery than young Men, who
ingage in it, do repreſent it to themſelves;
who, very often ſeek nothing elſe thereby, but
<hi>Libertiniſm</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> To conclude, The
better Born he is, who is Inſtructed therein,
the more extenſive ought his Knowledge to be.
He who is likely to be no more than a ſimple
Officer, or to Command only particular Parties,
ſhould be much better acquainted with little
particularities, and much leſs with general things;
than he, who probably, will one day, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
Provinces, or Command Armies. And this
Rule is common to all Profeſſions. The higher
a Man is brought up, the more Objects his
Sight takes in at a time, to ſee their Order in
general; but he is leſs concern'd to know every
Object exactly, than another Man who is near
it, and ſees but one ſuch at a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/> THE Men of the Gown, have truly, more
need of Learning,<note place="margin">The Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Men of the Robe.</note> than the Sword-Men; but
yet they ought not to burthen themſelves with it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54201:102"/>
over much. They are deſign'd for Buſineſs,
and are to Study, only to make themſelves
capable thereof. They are therefore to avoid
that Studious Spirit (oppoſite to the Spirit of
Buſineſs) which only hunts after the Pleaſure of
knowing, or the Glory of being reputed Learned.
They are to inquire after the middle, betwixt the
<hi>Scholaſtical</hi> Knowledge of the <hi>Law-Doctors,</hi> and
the groſs ignorance of the meer Practitioners.
For theſe are (as I may ſay) two Nations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
different. The Doctors ordinarily are
concern'd to know how to ſupply <hi>Antinomies</hi> and
<hi>Solutions</hi> for the Reception of an Officer, or for
any other Diſpute: To underſtand the Laws of
the <hi>Code</hi> and the <hi>Digeſt,</hi> which are moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for their difficulty, or elſe to give a new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of them: To reſtore ſome Paſſage:
To Explain a difficult Word: To diſcover in
ſome Author of Humanity, ſome piece of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
or Law: To reduce the Law into
Order, by new Diviſions: To find out ſome
ſingular Method. In the mean time, they do
not apply themſelves enough to the Cuſtom of
<hi>France:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cujas.</note> It has been obſerved that <hi>Cujacias</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was very ignorant in Buſineſs. On the
other ſide, the Practitioners know nothing, but
the <hi>Retail</hi> of that which they Practiſe; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Aſcending higher than Twenty or Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years, they may have ſpent in Buſineſs; and
without looking further than the Juriſdiction
under which they Practiſe; without knowing
the Original, or Reaſon of any thing. They
only ſay, this is done, and this is not done;
not knowing again that which has changed its
Name. They underſtand, neither how to put
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54201:103"/>
things together, to divide, nor place them in
Order. In a word, they Work like <hi>Artiſans,</hi>
who for their Art, have nothing to alledge,
but the Example of their Maſter. To this
ignorance of Practitioners, we owe the Style
of the <hi>Law-Proceedings</hi> in Matters of <hi>Bargain</hi>
and <hi>Sale,</hi> of <hi>Royal Letters,</hi> of the <hi>Edicts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> which are for the moſt
part Digeſted with ſo little Method and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity.
But the greateſt Evil which comes
from thence, is the Wrangling and Confuſion
in Buſineſs. The Study therefore of <hi>Lawyers,</hi>
has for its end, the furniſhing them with the
great Principles of the moſt ordinary Matters
of Buſineſs; and inlightening their Minds, that
they may treat of theſe Matters (naturally ſo
entangled and obſcure) with Order and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs.</p>
               <p>So that the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Robe</hi> have great
need of <hi>Logick,</hi> that they may know how to
divide, and define well; not according to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical</hi>
Exactneſs, but ſo far as may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the better carrying on of Buſineſs. They
have need of <hi>Arithmetick, Oeconomicks,</hi> and a
great knowledge of all the particulars of Life,
of the Management of Country Affairs, of
Trade, of the Bank, and all the ways of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting,
and growing Rich. For moſt Buſineſs
is decided, rather by way of Fact than Right.
And upon this account, they ſhould be early
accuſtomed to be Diligent, Patient, and Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
But, above all, they ſhould have the
Knowledge of <hi>Civil Law.</hi> And this Knowledge
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54201:103"/>
contains both the general Principles of natural
Equity, which are chiefly to be ſought for, in
the Books of the <hi>Roman Law;</hi> and the poſitive
Rules of our particular Law, which they will
find in the <hi>Edicts,</hi> and in the <hi>Cuſtoms.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
there are a great number of Maxims,
which they cannot Learn but by Uſe. Let
them, by all means, apply themſelves to the
Reading of the Texts, whether of the <hi>Roman</hi>
or our <hi>French</hi> Law; ſeeing the Texts only
are the ſolid Proofs in Matters Conteſted. But
let them not neglect the Reading of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
in Queſtions which they have Leiſure to
Study to the bottom: There they will often
find good Hints, provided they ſhall know how
to uſe them with Judgment. Since the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Law is the moſt proper to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
they ought not to neglect any part of
it, no, not ſo much as to be ignorant of (if
poſſible) any particularity of <hi>Law-Proceedings.</hi>
'Twould be well alſo for them to know Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
ſo far, as it relates to the Law: That
is, they ſhould take notice of the different
Laws and Maxims, which have obtained in
our Country in different Times. They ought
to go further, if they be Judges, and preferr'd
to great Places. It would well become them
to Aſcend to the very Fountains of the Law,
and Examine the Reaſons thereof by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of true <hi>Morality,</hi> and <hi>Policy.</hi> In a word,
though they are only obliged to Execute the
Laws; yet 'tis adviſeable that they ſhould be
capable to be <hi>Legiſlatours.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Eloquence</hi> is
very uſeful, not only to Advocates, but to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54201:104"/>
Judges, and all thoſe who are to ſpeak of
Buſineſs: I mean that ſolid <hi>Eloquence,</hi> of which
I have ſo often ſpoken.—Theſe are the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
which I Eſteem moſt neceſſary and uſeful,
to all Men in general, and to thoſe of each
Profeſſion in Particular.</p>
