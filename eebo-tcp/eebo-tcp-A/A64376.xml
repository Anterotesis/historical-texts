            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

if I should wholly ascribe the publishing
of this Sermon to your Importunity. I am

so very senfible of the excellent Ends and
Methods of this <hi>Establishment,</hi> that I
am not willing to omit the least thing
which may, in your Judgments, conduce
to them. <hi>It</hi> has, this present year (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Charity for putting forth Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices)
provided Five hundred and twelve
Pounds towards the support of <hi>Widows</hi>

I fear the Needs of the next year will
be greater than those of this; but cannot
but hope that the Supplies will grow in
proportion to them.</p>

to <hi>Do nothing by partiality.</hi>

it useth to be; that is, without <hi>Partiality,</hi> or

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, In General,</hi> nothing is to be done

               <hi>First,</hi> For the Nature of <hi>Partiality,</hi> it is a
vicious Principle, which inclineth Men to
act, not according to the merit of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Cause, but out of private and sinister
Ends.</p>
            <p>It is here, by the Apostle, and by <hi>Clement</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in his first Epistle †<note place="margin">Clem. Ep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. ad Cor. Ed. Colom. p. 56, 110.</note> to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is as much as to say, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
accepting of Persons, or <hi>Declining</hi> from
the reason of the Case, through the influence
of by-respects.</p>
            <p>In Persons acting by themselves, we call
it <hi>Partiality;</hi> when they act in Confederacy
with others, it hath the Name of <hi>Sedition</hi> in
a <hi>State,</hi> of <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Division</hi> in a <hi>Church;</hi>
of <hi>Faction</hi> in <hi>both</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Id ibid. p. 8. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>. And it sometimes takes
place even where the Constitution is good;
for the best of Causes may be factiously
espous'd, and partially manag'd, whilst
evil-minded Men adhere to a Church or
State, not <hi>as such,</hi> but <hi>as a Party,</hi> and in order
to the strengthning and defending themselves
against the <hi>Side</hi> they hate, and with which
they can no more live than Fire with Water.
Such <hi>Partialists</hi> were the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who took
very great pains to make Proselites, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40287:6"/>
them to <hi>their way,</hi> rather than to
the <hi>Jewish Religion,</hi> to the end that <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
might support them, when <hi>Reason</hi> was
wanting.</p>
            <p>2. Now, <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Partiality</hi> in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either by our Selves, or in Conjunction
with a Party, is that by which Mankind is very
apt to be leaven'd.</p>
            <p>If St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not discern'd, that even
<hi>Timothy</hi> himself had had the Seeds of this
Corruption in his Nature, he would not
have given him Caution against it in so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
solemn a manner as he did, charging him
 <q>as in the presence of God, and his blessed
Son, and his <hi>Elect Angels</hi> (those ministring
Spirits whom God approves of) to do nothing
out of this Principle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The same Apostle found it breaking out
in his time in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Clem. Epist. 1. ad Cor. p. 110. 1 Cor. 1, 12. c. 3. 4.</note> where
all pretended to love the Gospel, but one
had a partiality for <hi>Paul,</hi> another for <hi>Apollos,</hi>
and another for <hi>Cephas</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or (perhaps)
for some other Teachers, whose Names the
Apostle thought fit to spare, transferring their
Parts to himself and his Brethren. This
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40287:7"/>
went not then so far as the dividing them
into <hi>distinct Communions;</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 3. 3</note> but, however, it rais'd
a strife amongst them about the preheminence
of their Pastors, whilst they affected them
severally, not as Christian Ministers, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Personal Accounts, and did this with
Exasperation of Mind, and with open Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity.</p>
            <p>And if Christians were so partial and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
as if Christ himself was divided
in that Primitive State, when the Blood of
Christ was yet almost warm upon the Cross,
when he was just risen from the Dead, and
ascended into the Heavens, when Miracles
(like that constant one of the Sun) were daily
before Mens eyes; when Christianity seem'd
to be taken up in good earnest, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
with peril of Life; certainly it can be
no surprize to us to find Partiality in the
Men of this Generation, in which, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the external Members of Christ's
Church (like those of the Natural Body
that lye remotest from the heart) are chill
and cold, as living at such distance from the
first Fountain of Evangelical Tradition; and
many find a way to their worldly Profit

through the breaches of Unity. It is in the
<hi>few</hi> that <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> rule; and what
Equity can be expected where the <hi>Passions</hi>
of Men give the Law? Daily experience
shews how narrow-minded, how unjust,
how biassed Men are, how they judge by
their Affections; and that instead of <hi>doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by Partiality,</hi> they scarce do any thing
otherwise; in such sort that where there are
many Competitors for any Place, every one
of them finds his Friend, and perhaps the
most unqualifi'd Person does at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
            <p>3. But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> every Christian should

after the common fashion of the Men of this
World, who have scarce a grain of the Salt of
Wisdom in their Bodies, whose <hi>Imaginations</hi> are

of the latter, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Covetousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Partial men resolve all into their own

They would perswade themselves, or at least
the World, that Heaven it self testifies against
the Persons whom they affect not, by every
misfortune which befalls them. If Men of
another way live piously, and fall into some
great affliction, or die a sudden death, they
rashly call this a <hi>Judgment.</hi> If some of their

more than the Cause: It puts the bribe into the

it: It takes the small Offenders in its Net,
and lets great and powerful Malefactors escape:
It preferreth an ignorant, wicked, and slothful
<hi>Relation,</hi> before one who is knowing, pious
and diligent, but a stranger to our Blood:
It feedeth the slow Bellies that fawn, and

<hi>That nothing is to be done with Partiality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Observation is more <hi>Special,</hi>
No <hi>Charities are to be partially administred.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Charities must be done.</hi> For seeing the God
of Order has not set all Men upon the same
Level, because he would not put them into a
state of Competition and War; and that the
Poor shall be always with us, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of supplying them; and seeing they
have not an Estate, which might enable them
to do it; and Age and Accidents prevent
labour in many of them; therefore Charity
must keep them from perishing: And for the
Publick Supplies, as they are manag'd, they
seem not to be sufficient for these things:
At least they extend not to many of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
who are brought low, and can neither
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40287:12"/>
dig nor beg, nor decently receive from the
common Rates.</p>
            <p>But though Charity must be done, and a
Man who is tied by the Laws of the Land, to
Measures of Justice, is by them left free in his
Charity, and <hi>may do what he will with his own;</hi>
yet he is obliged to set himself Rules by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Prudence, and to remember that he is
God's Steward, and must not suffer Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to warp him in the dispensing of his
Goods.</p>
            <p>It is true, where the Needs and Merits of
two Persons are equal, and there is but one
Place or Office, or enough only for the Relief
of one, it is not Partiality to prefer a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or a Friend, who is often nearer than a
Brother.</p>
            <p>Again, to <hi>do good to all Men as we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
but especially to those who are of the Houshold
of Faith;</hi> to deny small transient Alms to
many (unless they are perishing), to make up a
Fund which may do a considerable good, as the
Apprentizing of helpless Orphans, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
the Stock of a charitable Foundation,
or the giving to the Publick such a Building
as may be both a Prison and a Work-house,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40287:12"/>
as certainly most Prisons ought to be; all this
is not Partiality, but Wisdom; in such Cases
there are Circumstances which turn the Scale
on the right-side.</p>
            <p>But, to support with Alms one that can la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and to deny another that cannot; to let
no <hi>Manna</hi> fall in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> but all in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi>
to fatten the Rich, and to do nothing
for the Poor; to supply a vicious poor Man,
and to starve a vertuous one; to give to a bold
Vagrant, and to turn away the face from an
honest or laborious Neighbour; to uphold
Pride, and to depress Humility; to misapply
the Revenues of Charity allotted for good
Uses, to those which are either not good, or not
designed; to burthen others to whom we are
equal in all respects, and to ease our selves in
Contributions to the Poor; to have no more
consideration of the Aged than of the Young;
of the Sick than the Healthful; of those who
have spent their Days in Diligence, than those
who have consumed both Time and Substance
in Sloth; of those who have been <hi>persecuted
for Righteousness-sake,</hi> than of those who have
failed with all Winds, and been safe; of the
Children of Enemies, than those of Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40287:13"/>
of those who have numerous Families,
than those who are single; of those who are fit
by their <hi>Genius</hi> to be educated for Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Church and State, than of such who are
fit only for low and servile Works: This is to
act by an inequality, which a Man cannot
answer to the Reason of his own Mind.</p>
            <p>And as this is true, in <hi>special,</hi> of Charity, so
do's it hold,</p>
            <p>3. In <hi>the Third place,</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> of the
<hi>Charity</hi> of <hi>this Corporation,</hi> which would never
have flourished, if Partiality had been at the
Root of it.</p>
            <p>There are two Reasons, among others,
which should prevail with the Members of
<hi>this Society,</hi> for the excluding of sinister Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Persons administring</hi> are supposed
to be such, who have been by their Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
to God, who have been shewn good
Examples from the beginning; who have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib'd
early the Principles of Religious Wisdom.
Better and more equal Measures, are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
therefore, from them to be expected,
in distributions of Charity, than from such
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40287:13"/>
who have not had those advantages in their
Youth.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly,</hi> The <hi>Persons receiving,</hi> are Objects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to such who have ministred in Holy
Offices; and Religion it self suffers in the
World, by the meanness and necessity of
those who more immediately attend on the
publick Service of it, or nearly belong to
them; for the World judges according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and by the despised estate of the
<hi>Religious,</hi> is tempted, if not to scorn, yet the
less to reverence, God and his Worship; so
that for Religion sake (which ought to be to
us the greatest of Motives) the Objects of
this Corporation, ought to be treated with
such impartial Charity, that in every one (so
far as there is a sufficiency for the doing of it,)
some becomingness of Figure may, for the
honour of the Holy Function, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>Now, for the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of this Discourse,
(that it may be suitable to the method of the
Body of it) it shall consist of a threefold <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I address my self <hi>to all,</hi> of what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or Condition soever, beseeching them
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40287:14"/>
in all their Capacities, and in all Causes, to
proceed with a Righteous indifference: To
render to all their Dues, and not to suffer Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to supplant Equity.</p>
            <p>The Discourse which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> us'd in all

it is <hi>most difficult,</hi> for them to strip themselves
of all their <hi>Partialities</hi> whilst they are on

from certain <hi>Romish</hi> Guides, he would believe
they carried some of them into Heaven it self;

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40287:14"/>But the more difficult the Duty is, the
more earnest application must be used, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it must be done in some competent degree;
for no Man who refuseth to <hi>deny himself,</hi> can
be Christ's Disciple. Study therefore, with all
diligence, to move uprightly in all your ways,

man, nor regarded the <hi>Person</hi> of men.</q> He
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40287:15"/>
cared for all Men so far as to <hi>die</hi> for their
Good; but he cared not so for any Mans
Person, as to accept it against the Rule of
Equity. He had a particular regard to St. <hi>John,</hi>
his <hi>beloved Disciple;</hi> but his Care was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on some especial Reason; probably a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Divine Charity in his Temper, in
which he might exceed the rest.</p>
            <p>And be the rather mov'd to this impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by the <hi>Consideration of the Time;</hi> the <hi>Time
of Advent;</hi> which sets before us the Judgment
of the great Day, on which all Men shall
receive, not according to what they have been in
their Fortunes, and what they may vainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to; but according <hi>to what they have done
in the Flesh, whether it be good, or whether it be
evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I apply my self both to those whom God
hath prosper'd, and who dispense Alms with
their own Hands, and to those who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
by others of large Hearts and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
in the Administration of <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What you do, do with <hi>Integrity,</hi> that the
Ends of Charity may be attain'd to. Be not
sway'd by the mere importunity of indigent
Persons, or by the mere recommendation of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40287:15"/>
those, who, for the avoiding the giving an Alms,
are free of their Hands and <hi>Testimonials,</hi> which
are of little labour or charge to them.</p>
            <p>Discourage not the <hi>Living</hi> by the misappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the Charity of the <hi>Dead;</hi> which are
such and so many, that every <hi>Commission</hi> for
<hi>Charitable Uses,</hi> is ready to put a damp upon
the Benevolence of the Executors of it.</p>
            <p>And after all your Care and Proceeding,
in <hi>Number, Weight</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> expect Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
not from Men, but from the
Righteous Judge of the World. For the
<hi>necessitous</hi> will <hi>have their Eye evil,<note place="margin">St. Matt. 20. 15.</note> because yours is
good;</hi> they will, out of their own partiality,
raise clamour against all Dispensers of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as doing unequal things. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
only their own Cases, and cry out,
That there was never Poverty, never Grief
like theirs; that they are the greatest Objects
of pity; and that others, whose Needs and
Merits are not so great, are preferr'd before
them, though in truth they are much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But it should not move us to any
degree of Resentment, to be cited before
Mans Judgment; to our great Master we
shall stand or fall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40287:16"/>3. <hi>Last of all,</hi> For you my Brethren of
<hi>this Society,</hi> whilst I am exhorting you to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality
in Acting, I have reason to praise
you for being influenc'd already by so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Principle.</p>
            <p>Go on in the Name of the Righteous God,
in the straight way, in which you have made
so many laudable Steps; Go on and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper.</p>
            <p>Observe particularly, the Words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
in the, 3<hi>d,</hi> 5<hi>th,</hi> and 10<hi>th</hi> Verses of this
Chapter. <q>(3.) Honour Widows that are
Widows indeed. (5.) Such as being <hi>desolate</hi>
[or alone and unencumbred] trust in God,
and continue in Supplications and Prayers
night and Day. (10.) Such as are well
reported for good Works; such as have
brought up Children, and lodged Strangers,
and reliev'd the Afflicted [when they had
ability] and diligently followed every good
Work.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If we walk after such Rules, that Seed of
Charity, which was but so lately sown in this
Constitution, and has already attain'd to some
considerable growth, will shoot up further
till it become a Tree, under the Shadow of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40287:16"/>
which the Poor and Miserable may sit down
with great refreshment.</p>
            <p>If Equity and Charity meet together, Peace
will come down from Heaven, as the present
Reward of Righteousness.</p>
            <p>And in the End, when we shall appear
before God the Father, and our impartial
Mediator Jesus Christ, and the innumerable
Company of <hi>Elect Angels,</hi> we shall receive
that Blessing which the <hi>Son of Man</hi> shall then
pronounce to all the Just and Charitable,
saying, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, I was
naked and ye cloathed me, hungry and ye fed me,
thirsty and ye gave me drink, a stranger and ye
took me in; Well done good and faithful Servants,
enter ye into the joy of your Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that Supreme Lord and Benefactor of
Mankind, who <hi>came not to destroy, but to save;</hi>
Together with <hi>the Father and the Holy Spirit, be
ascribed Glory and Dominion, and Praise, this day
and for Ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
