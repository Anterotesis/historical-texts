         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

the Profession of their faith
have been Baptized in the
Name of the Lord Jesus.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY BRETHREN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough my Prayer unto
God is, that what I have
written, may tend to the
establishing of those, who
have already been obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient;
yet unto you I
do chiefly recommend this following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
and my Reason is, Because it doth
more principally concern you, it being a
discovery of part of the minde of Christ;
yea, part of the foundation of his service,
<pb facs="tcp:34067:4"/>
whereunto the greatest Number of you
have not yet been obedient.</p>
            <p>And now, my Brethren, you that by
Baptisme have declared your selves to be
followers of the Lord Iesus Christ; I do
Begg and intreat of you, to Examine your
principles, and see whether or no, you
have obeyed Christ, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
he gave to his Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi>
28. 20. Wherein you are injoyned the
Observation of all things he commanded
for your obedience, according to his Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
being forty dayes with his Apostles
and Disciples, (after his Resurrection)
in which time he gave Commandments
unto his Apostles, whom he had chosen,
and was speaking unto them of the things
pertaining to the Kingdome of God, <hi>Acts</hi>
1. 2, 3. <hi>vers.</hi> I beseech you consider,
have you obeyed the form of Doctrine,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. which you shall finde laid
down, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. See, I pray you,
whether the beginning-Word of Christ is
that you have received; whether you stand
<pb facs="tcp:34067:4"/>
upon that foundation, the Doctrine of
Christ and his Apostles, upon which the
first Churches were built, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 20.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
            <p>Consider, God in these last dayes hath
spoken unto us by his Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. the
Lord Iesus Christ is our great Doctor, the
Prophet whom <hi>Moses</hi> spake of, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.
21. therefore we must learn of him, we
must hear him in all things; Therefore
know, it is your duty to be followers of
God, according to your Profession in
Baptisme, and to Act in no way, but what
Christ hath appointed for you; Even that
way, whose foundation is upon the lips of
Christ, which he also hath appointed a
foundation for us to build upon.</p>
            <p>Wherefore examine if you have laid
your foundation with this Corner-stone,
with Repentance from dead works, faith
towards God, the Doctrine of Baptismes,
and laying on of hands, the Resurrection of
the dead, and eternal Iudgement: Whether
these be the principles of your Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:34067:5"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. Consider wherein you are
defective in these principles: are you not
in Repentance? I wish I could not charge
you herein; yet I must tell you, the Hire
of the Harlot is found amongst you, the
burden of which your poor Brethren have
long mourned under, and suffered for. I
know it is not the practise of all of you;
yet those that do it, were never to this day
disowned by you? O! that you would
therefore try your selves: have you turned
your selves from the vain worships of the
men of this World, and from such who
teach for Doctrines mens traditions? are
you according to your Profession of Christ
in Baptism, dead to the rudiments of this
World? <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20. Why know, it is your
duty, not only to cleanse your selves from
Temporal, but Spiritual delfiements,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. and as you are not to act
any thing contrary to the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
in your Conversation, so to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the worship of God, but by rule:
for that which hath proceeded from our
<pb facs="tcp:34067:5"/>
Lord Iesus Christ, is the rule for Saints to
walk by. Know this, that all the misery
and sin in the World came in at this
door, <hi>viz.</hi> by hearkning to Reason, the
wisdome of the flesh, against that which
God hath spoken: it is mans deformity,
to walk according to his own invention,
and at last, (as experience doth teach,)
will prove his own destruction. Surely
God will not indure to be prescribed by his
Creatures; no, it hath been wickedness in
those that have done it, and God hath
found it out; but he takes pleasure in them
that fear him, and teaches them in his
wayes, <hi>Psa.</hi> 25. 12. but when men change
his Laws and Ordinances, (although it
proceeds from no wicked intent) yet it
provokes him to Iudgment, as it did in
<hi>Uzza,</hi> 1 Chro. 15. therefore learn to know
the voyce of Christ; for his Sheep hear it,
and they follow him.</p>
            <p>It hath been the work of Satan and his
Instruments, such who first did forsake
the right way, whom God gave up unto
<pb facs="tcp:34067:6"/>
strong delusions to believe lyes, because
they received not the truth in the love
thereof, to corrupt the Word of God, and
to change his Laws, and to set up their
posts by the posts of God, or rather in
their stead: and who knows not, that
knows Christ, that now all his endeavours
are to make voyd those truths, and the
right way of the Lord; either in whole or
in part? if he cannot keep people wholly
in blindness, he will labour to insnare
them through pretended wayes of light,
which is indeed darkness. O! how doth
he now perswade the poor soul, that either
the wayes of God are not now to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or else the practise of them is but an
indifferent thing. O! let's beware of this
deceit: for he that saith I know him, and
keepeth not his commandments, is a lyer,
and the truth is not in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 4.
therefore I desire you to examine your
selves, and see wherein you are short of
obeying the voice of Christ; being careful
of receiving any thing, but what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb facs="tcp:34067:6"/>
the Word of the Lord; and be also
as careful of rejecting any thing that is
his will.</p>
            <p>And wherein he speaks unto you, as you
are Baptized believers, know, it is your
duty to be obedient, to be followers of him,
to set shoulders to his work; for unto that
this day you are called, that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Sion</hi> may again be laid, the Walls
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> may be again repaired, and
then they that be of thee, shall build the
old waste places, <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. 11.</p>
            <p>Let not the wisdome of man beguile
you, (whereby he labours,) when any
truth of God is discovered, to pervert it,
or to turn you aside from following of it:
know, this is but one of Satans old plots,
and deceitful workings; and marvel not
that he works in good men in our dayes;
for this is certain, that if persons dissent
from truth, so far they serve for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
which is alwayes against the truth,
which is the Law of God, that which God
hath commanded: thus he wrought in the
<pb facs="tcp:34067:7"/>
Prophet of the Lord, who told a lye in the
Name of the Lord, unto which the young
Prophet yeilded; contrary to what God had
Commanded him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 18 and
was destroyed of a Lyon: know, he many
times makes use of good men to carry on
his design; therefore though you may
judge they are good men, that speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a truth of the Lord; let not that
turn you aside, knowing it is your duty to
be a follower of him, in what he hath
spoken, that doth relate to the worship of
God, or your duty in your conversation;
which doth concern you, as you are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and would be partakers of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
especially those things that are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of your faith and Religion; yea,
principles of the worship and service of
that God, whom we profess to sear; yea,
and to obey.</p>
            <p>And take heed of those who teach you,
only to believe that, unto which you ought
to manifest your obedience to the great
God. Such persons, who call that which
<pb facs="tcp:34067:7"/>
Christ taught, and whereunto believers
were obedient, a Doctrine, but not a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
such words are corrupt: but let us
know this, that so far as Christ hath
taught us, we ought to be obedient; and
therefore let your obedience be manifest to
all men; For the Lord is at hand to give
recompence unto you: and let not the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
which truth meets withal, be a
stumbling-block unto you. You may see
how easily confusion and errour take
place upon the hearts of men, this day.
O, let truth have place upon your Souls!
O, it grieves my Soul to see, how easily
that which hath but a colour or shew of
truth from the Scriptures, takes place upon
the hearts of men, and many Professors
this day; and yet that which is real truth,
hath little entertainment in the World.
What's the Reason? was not this alwayes;
it's too low, it's too mean, it's too plain? it is
indeed without the wisdome of man; and
therefore finds little entertainment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men. Alas, saith the Wiseman,
<pb facs="tcp:34067:8"/>
what's a little water? this is a poor thing:
others have as low an esteem of laying on
of hands; besides, it's a riddle unto them:
thus God makes foolishness the wisdome
of this World.</p>
            <p>But now some do say, Did we see these
Ordinances to continue, we should wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
obey.</p>
            <p>I Answer, Do you think the Scribes
and Pharisees would not have made as
large a Profession as this, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
the Counsel of God against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
being not Baptized? <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 30.
or do you not think, that those who are
short of any truth, if they profess any
thing, but will as readily make this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
as your selves? yet will this excuse
them? or would the Iews ignorance of the
Lord of life, excuse their Crucifying the
Lord of Glory? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. surely no.</p>
            <p>Therefore know, it's your duty to seek
after truth, and to yeild obedience to it:
Christ requires it of you; therefore come in
unto him, and be willing to take upon you
<pb facs="tcp:34067:8"/>
his yoak, and despised wayes; and be sure,
you shall be no losers by it.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord help you, you that have
put on Christ by Baptisme, to read what I
have written in this book without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and with a heart lifted up to God
for wisdome, to direct to give you to see
truth from errour. And that this truth,
which I do principally mind and drive at,
(to wit) laying on of hands upon believers
Baptized, as such, may have the Spirit of
God, making of it forth unto your Souls,
in the Reading and Consideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;

            <div type="section">
               <head>Of Layings on of hands, according to the
wisdom of God given under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
considerations thereof,
minded in the New
Testament.</head>
               <p>THE Scripture of the
New Testament
speaks of laying on
of hands upon three
several accounts or
ends.</p>
               <p>First, upon Baptized believers, as
such; To the end they might receive
the Spirit; which is the promise of
God unto them, as <hi>Acts</hi> the 8. and
<hi>Acts</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>2. On Ministers; to the end they
might be separated to the work of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34067:10"/>
Ministry, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6, 13, 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.
14, 5. 22 <hi>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. On the sick, for healing; to
the end they might recover, as <hi>Mark</hi>
16. 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 8 <hi>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall, as the Lord shall help me,
speak somthing to the two last
briefly, and then to the first I shall
be more large, it being the duty of
all believers to submit unto, and that
which is chiefly in my eye in this
discourse.</p>
               <p>First, of the laying on of hands
for healing, it was a particular gift
of faith, which the Lord Jesus did
promise to give unto his people, as
is plain from <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 17, 18 <hi>vers.</hi>
These signes shall follow them
that believe; in my Name they shall
cast out Devils, they shall speak with
new tongues; they shall take up
Serpents; and if they drink any
deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;
they shall lay hands on the sick, and
they shall recover: in which enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34067:10"/>
of signs, we find laying
on of hands for healing: which signs,
as the Spirit of the Lord teacheth us,
were given for those who believed
not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 22 <hi>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this promise of healing, by
laying on of hands, as we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
the Lord made good upon
many of his people, as believers in
the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who were
partakers of this gift, which they
were to go forth in the practise
thereof; according as the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 8 <hi>vers.</hi> yea as
Christ himself, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 5 <hi>vers.
Luk.</hi> 4. 40 <hi>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now some may say,
Was this practise to continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
believers? to which take this
two-fold answer.</p>
               <p>First, If the gift be continued, that
is, of healing, then this practise; for
we cannot Act, unless we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>2. If any have or shall receive
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34067:11"/>
such a gift of faith, they are to go
forth in the practise thereof; for gifts
are given to profit withal, that is, for
the good of others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7 <hi>vers.</hi>
therefore if any one have received
such a gift, he is to be up and doing,
to administer the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query.</hi> But some may say, Is there
no Ordinance, that the Lord Jesus
Christ hath left unto his people, to
wait upon him in for healing, in the
time of sickness?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Yes, and that is prayer
and anoynting with Oile in the
Name of the Lord; this is left, as an
Ordinance, or way unto believers,
to wait upon the Lord in, in the
time of sickness; wherein the Elders
of the Church of Christ ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister,
as is manifest from <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.
14, 15 <hi>vers.</hi> Is any sick amongst
you? let him call for the Elders of
the Church, and let them pray over
him; anoynting him with Oile in
the Name of the Lord; and the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34067:11"/>
prayer of faith shall save the sick,
and the Lord shall raise him up; and
if he have committed sins, they shall
be forgiven him.</p>
               <p>From whence we may observe,
that this duty is injoyned by the
Apostle upon those that are sick:
Herein the soul ought to wait upon
God, and in this way to look up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God for healing.</p>
               <p>But Oh! the evil of professors in
this our day, who run to the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
but not to God; but few wait
upon God in his way: the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of this of old, as a great
evil, as the 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 16 <hi>vers.</hi> yea,
we may see this was <hi>Asa's</hi> sin, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi>
16. 12 <hi>vers.</hi> though he were in
much affliction; yet he sought not
unto the Lord, but to the Physitian.</p>
               <p>And is not this the sin of many
Professors in this our day? O! that
God would make them sensible
thereof, and make this word of use
to them, that they may look more up
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34067:12"/>
unto God, that they may exercise
more faith upon him for healing;
that if they can but with the poor
Woman, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5. 26, 27, 28, <hi>vers.</hi>
touch the hem of Christs garment,
for there is much vertue still in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Some will say, We cannot
see this way to continue in the
Church of Christ amongst believers,
unless we did see the effect thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> First, If you Judge of the
minde of God, that which is laid
down your duty, by the effect, you
may run your selves into many
temptations, as the Jews of old did:
when they saw not the glory of the
last Temple, to be so great as the
glory of the first Temple was, <hi>Hag.</hi>
2. 3, <hi>vers.</hi> they were discouraged in
the work of the Lord, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and so indeed, this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
got upon them, as in the first
Chapter, the second <hi>verse:</hi> The time
is not come, the time that the Lords
House should be built; but the Lord
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34067:12"/>
for this reproves them with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as you may see in the 4, 5,
and 6 <hi>verses,</hi> and after by his servant
<hi>Haggai</hi> exhorteth them unto the
work, as in the 8 <hi>verse,</hi> and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
them unto it, in the 13 <hi>vers.</hi>
Then spake <hi>Haggai</hi> in the Lords Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
unto the people, saying, I am
with you, saith the Lord: and in the
second Chapter, 5 <hi>vers.</hi> According to
the word that I covenanted with
you, when you came up out of <hi>Egypt;</hi>
so my Spirit remaineth amongst you:
fear you not.</p>
               <p>So I say, God is a God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with believers; his truths are
sealed by the blood of Christ. O
then take heed of questioning his
faithfulness in making good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
from whence doth this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
our looking for such and such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
but indeed from our unbelief,
not believing the promise of God?
therefore take heed of judging the
minde of God by the effects: for in so
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34067:13"/>
doing, you will make the way of
God of no force or weight for souls
obedience.</p>
               <p>2. How can you see the effect of
that, you have never yet attained
unto nor believed? therefore I may
say to you, as the Lord Jesus did
unto the Jews, If you will do his
will, you shall know of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 17.</p>
               <p>3. What effect have you seen, of
the laying on of hands upon persons
to office? it is true, as many write,
and do say, laying on of hands is a
resignation of a person or persons to
office; therefore they instance <hi>Moses</hi>
laying on his hands upon <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
Numb. 27. 23, <hi>vers.</hi> but you shall
find a more excellent effect, that
which fitted him for that work,
which he was called unto, as <hi>Deut.</hi>
34. 9, <hi>vers. Ioshua</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun,</hi>
was full of the Spirit of wisdom:
for <hi>Moses</hi> had laid his hands upon
him. Learn from hence, that as it is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34067:13"/>
Gods way, so he meets with his
people therein; and as in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of laying on of hands upon
persons to office, so also in this of
anointing with Oile. For his wayes
are not in vain unto his people.</p>
               <p>4. Those who have waited upon
God in this Ordinance, have found
the effect thereof; they have met
with God therein, they have seen
his faithfulness, been partaker of his
grace, received healing, not onely
to their bodies, but also to their
souls: this effect some poor souls,
who waited upon God in this
way, have been partakers of; so that
they are able to bear witness to this
truth, and also to set to their seals,
that God is true, a faithful God;
meeting with those who wait upon
him, in his way: therefore I may
say of this truth of Christ, as one
may say of the new Wine in the
cluster, <hi>Isai.</hi> 65. 8, <hi>vers.</hi> Destroy it
not, for a blessing is in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34067:14"/>5. We do not so much minde in
our waiting upon God in this way,
to see an immediate work of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which is that which too many
doat upon, and so like <hi>Thomas,</hi> unless
they see a sign, they will not believe,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 25, <hi>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we do chiefly mind our duty,
believing, that it shall not be in
vain our waiting upon him therein,
so leaving the effect of it unto God,
who knows best when to give in
mercyes to his people.</p>
               <p>Now this may be matter of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
especially to those, who
look upon laying on of hands for
healing, to be the anointing with
Oile, spoken of by the Apostle
<hi>Iames,</hi> that they are and were two
distinct things; the one being a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
gift of the Spirit, which a
person might receive of healing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
by the laying on of hands,
as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.
8, <hi>vers.</hi> and many others also.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:34067:14"/>The other an Ordinance of Christ,
wherein the Ministry of the Church
were to act, and that not by vertue
of any particular gift, but of their
ministerial office; and therefore saith
the Apostle, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. Let him call for
the Elders of the Church, and let
them pray over him, anointing him
with Oile in the Name of the Lord:
wherein they ought, as in all other
appointments, to look up unto the
Lord for a blessing, leaving the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forth of his grace to the poor
soul, unto himself.</p>
               <p>2. By what hath been said, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
the ignorance of the people
of God this day, that have been long
reading and learning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and yet are ignorant of this
command; and likewise those that
are Teachers and Leaders of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
that know the will of
God, yet walk not in the practise
thereof. It likewise reproves those
congregations, that have for some
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34067:15"/>
season, looked upon themselves as
Churches of Christ, and yet want
this order among them. Oh that
they would consider the reason, why
they are short in this particular,
that they might see whether or no,
the Lord have not a controversie
with them, for their neglect, and
their opposition against one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his Doctrine, that which
Christ taught, unto which believers
as believers were obedient, which
is a great transgression, their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
to hear Christ in that saying
of his, which is the last particular of
laying on of hands I have minded,
as I shall indeavour in it's place by
the Lords assistance, to make forth
unto you.</p>

               <head>Secondly, Of laying on of hands upon persons to office.</head>
               <p>THis was likewise an Ordinance,
or way of God, by which those
persons who were called to office
by the Church of Christ were set
apart, and so indeed are to be set
apart, as it was the practise of the
first Churches, and of those who
first trusted in Christ, whose foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
we are to follow: in this way
they went: see <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3, <hi>vers.</hi> And
when they had fasted and prayed,
and laid their hands on them, to wit,
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> they sent them
away.</p>
               <p>From whence observe, and that
first, the work it was great, it was to
the Ministry, according to what the
Lord had spoken concerning <hi>Paul,</hi>
that he was a chosen vessel, and that
to preach the Gospel unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
as you may see in the 26 of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34067:16"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 16, 17, <hi>vers.</hi> so the work
was great, to the performance of
which they would need much of the
power and presence of the Lord
with them; therefore they fasted
and prayed, and layed their hands
on them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Observe, the persons who laid
on hands, they were the Prophets
and Teachers in this Church, as in
the 1 and 2 <hi>verses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewise, somtimes it was done
by the Apostles themselves, as <hi>Acts</hi> 6.
6, <hi>vers.</hi> so also by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
who were called as before to the
office of Apostles, to lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to do the work of an Apostle,
<hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23, <hi>vers.</hi> so also by <hi>Timothy,</hi>
who was the first Bishop of the
Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>vers.</hi>
and also <hi>Titus,</hi> Tit. 1. 5. <hi>vers.</hi> so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by the Presbytery, the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Eldership in the Church, who
were by the Church of Christ, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to officiate in the wayes of God
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34067:16"/>
unto his people, by whom <hi>Timothy</hi>
was ordained a Bishop, 1 <hi>Timot.</hi> 4.
14. <hi>vers.</hi> So that we see this way of
God, and the manner of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
thereof, in some small mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
discovered; I shall give but this
touch of this second thing minded,
and that for this reason:</p>
               <p>Because our opposers of laying on
of hands upon believers, as believers,
have owned the laying on of hands
upon officers, though in a disorderly
manner they have gone forth in the
practise thereof, as will appear,</p>
               <p>First, from what Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> writes
in his book of <hi>Right Constitution,</hi> pag.
31. where saith he, the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Elders and Deacons are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
1 <hi>Timot.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I have read of Bishops and
Deacons, and of Apostles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
who were Deacons; but never
of Elders and Deacons: My reason
is, because a Deacon is an Elder in
the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:34067:17"/>2. This discovers according to
their practise, what they have set
persons apart for: as their pastoral
Charge in the Church of Christ,
they were set apart for Elders; so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
as Ministers of the Gospel, they
were ordained for Elders, though
their great disorder is, in building be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the foundation was rightly laid;
yet observe the wise mistaken in their
proceeding, though by this practise
of theirs, with fair words they have
stopped the mouths of many poor
souls, who were clearing themselves
from such disorder as they were in;
they stopped their consciences with
this, that they are under laying on
of hands, as well as those that do
practise it upon believers as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
I say, In this, how confused
have they appeared in their setting
persons apart for Elders? not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or at least not minding, that in
the word Elders is comprehended
all officers in the Church, with the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34067:17"/>
Ministerial work also, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, <hi>vers.</hi>
2 Epistle <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. vers. 3. 1. vers. and
so Elders is distinguished into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
offices in the Church, as Bishops
and Deacons: the Deacons were to
be men full of the Holy Spirit and
faith; &amp; so indeed fit for the work of
the Lord among his people, as well as
Bishops, and so were Elders in the
Church, see <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. <hi>vers.</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi>
15. 22. <hi>vers.</hi> where the Deacons
spoken of in the 6 Chapter, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Elders in the 15 Chapter: again,
<hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>vers.</hi> where the Apostle
writeth to the Saints, with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Deacons: so <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
writes of the qualifications of the
Bishops and Deacons, not Elders
and Deacons; you shall never in all
the Scripture find Elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
expressed.</p>
               <p>So that I hope, this may be a word
of use unto them; however it will
be unto the Church of Christ,
though from a weak and unworthy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34067:18"/>
instrument. I shall now leave
them as to this, but as for the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
it self, they having now at
last, come forth in the practise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they must stand to maintain it;
and therefore knowing their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
I shall leave them to contend
for this truth, with those (if there
be any) that do oppose it, it being
that I do believe, and have allowed
of, therefore I shall only take notice
of one or two objections made by
some, and then proceed to the third
thing minded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> Some there are, who
say there are no Apostles now:
they laid hands upon persons to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
then; therefore that practise is
deased. To which I shall give this
two-fold answer.</p>
               <p>1. That those who were not
Apostles, as to their call, But Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
or Pastors of Churches, were
exhorted to walk in this way, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.
5. <hi>vers.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>vers.</hi> yea Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34067:18"/>
and Teachers by the authority
of the Church of Christ, may lay on
hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, <hi>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. By this appears a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
in the understanding of many
men, (according to this objection;)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> That the Ministry of the
Apostles is ceased.</p>
               <p>I Answer, The office of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
is the first office in the Church
of Christ, and that is to lay the
foundation; the foundation of the
service of God; therefore saith <hi>Paul,</hi>
I have laid the foundation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
10. <hi>vers.</hi> the foundation, that is, the
Lord Jesus Christ in his Doctrine,
that which Christ and his Apostles
did teach, upon which the Church
of Christ was built: see <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 20.
which, foundation was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Word
of Christ, that which
persons ought to know, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
before they are sit for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God.</p>
               <p>But now, that this, <hi>viz.</hi> (to lay the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34067:19"/>
foundation,) is the first office in the
house of God: see the 1 <hi>Corint.</hi> 12.
28, <hi>vers.</hi> God hath set some in the
Church; first Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so
Christ did ascend, and gave gifts
unto men, and that some to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
as well as other offices in the
Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 8. compared with
the 11. <hi>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now some may say,
Christ did chuse Apostles, he chose
Twelve, which he called Apostles;
therefore they ceasing, the office
ceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> To which I Answer, that
this was before Christ ascended; but
after he ascended, he gave some
Apostles; that is, to that work to
lay the foundation, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, <hi>vers.</hi>
and so <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<hi>Acts</hi> 14. 4. and 14. <hi>vers.</hi> and
others also spoken of in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.
23. <hi>vers.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1. compared with
6. and 9. <hi>vers.</hi> He that doth autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively
as the first Apostles, or by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34067:19"/>
vertue of the authority of the Church
of Christ, lay the foundation of the
service of God, he is properly an
Apostle, he doth the work of an
Apostle: for other foundation no man
can lay, that is to be approved of by
the Lord; yet other men may lay
the same, even preach the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ, which he did, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>Thirdly, Of laying on of hands upon
Baptized believers as such, to the
end they might receive
the Spirit.</head>
               <p>THat laying on of hands upon
Baptized believers, as such, is one
part of their obedience to the Lord,
which he requires of them; an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of the Lord Jesus Christ;
I shall thus prove unto you:</p>
               <p>First, because it is a saying of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that which he
taught, and that for believers obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34067:20"/>
as well as repentance, faith
and Baptisme: see <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.
Many persons do say, If we
could but see, where ever Christ
taught it; Surely, we should not
gainsay it. O that now they would
consider for their conviction this
Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>vers.</hi> where the
Apostle calls it the Doctrine or
Teaching of Christ; and a more suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
witness that Christ taught it,
we cannot have, then the Apostle is.
The Doctrine of Christ, that which
he taught, as he did repentance, faith,
resurrection and eternal judgment:
Now consider, Doctrine doth imply
teaching, and teaching doth infer
practise, that so believers might
learn, for teaching and learning are
relations as a Father and Child, the
one infers the other. Now to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
this reason for our obedience,
we may consider these three things.</p>
               <p>First, what the Apostle saith, in
<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22. <hi>vers.</hi> where we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34067:20"/>
to a hearing of Christ in all
things, and that also from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that will follow our neglect, as
in the 23 <hi>verse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In that it is placed amongst
those foundation-principles, <hi>Hebr.</hi>
6. 1, 2. and that in the midst of them,
as if the Spirit of the Lord did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
the opposition that would be
made against this truth.</p>
               <p>3. Because it is one of Christs
first teachings, and therefore those
words in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. may be rendered
<hi>the beginning-word of Christ,</hi> the <hi>A.B.C.</hi>
of a Christian, one of those first les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that believers then did learn,
and now should learn; which is this,
to wait upon God in this way of
his, for the Spirit of promise, which
is their right, whereby they might
be inabled, as they do desire, to do
him service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now unto this, some
object, and say, that all things that
Christ did and said, we are not to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34067:21"/>
be followers of him in, as to raise the
dead, to command the winde to
cease, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> To which I answer,
though this may be true, yet what is
this to the purpose? Because we are
not to say in all things as he did;
therefore we must say in nothing as
he did, neither as he taught us: this
is error with a witness. We grant
that in all things we are not to do
and say as Christ did: But yet in all
things that does relate to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and service of God, as repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
faith, and Baptism; or our
duty in our conversation, we are to
do as he hath said, for unto this God
himself commands us, see <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 35.
<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Him shall ye hear in all
things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Further, to make voyd this
reason, some object, and say that
Christ taught the resurrection of the
dead, and eternal Judgment, as well
as laying on of hands; but that is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34067:21"/>
only to be believed: the resurrection
and Judgment, we know we cannot
practise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer, first;
This is that we ought as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to do, <hi>if possible we can, to
attain to the resurrection of the dead,</hi>
Phil. 3. 11.</p>
               <p>2. That Christ taught it, we grant;
and that it is for our obedience, we
do also affirm, and that is so far as
he requires it.</p>
               <p>3. I do hope, you do also know,
that so far as Christ hath taught us,
we ought to be obedient to him: that
which he taught which was No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
we ought to believe; that
which he taught, which was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
we ought to obey. Now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
laying on of hands is a practical
Doctrine, as is manifest by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
actings and the Saints obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 6. Now
let the opposers of this truth of
Christ shew, where ever laying on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34067:22"/>
of hands was taught by Christ, as the
resurrection and eternal Judgment,
only to be believed, and then they
will say and do somthing to their
purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But say some, In <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1.
the Apostle calls it a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but not
<hi>a practise;</hi> and so by this would make
voyd this way of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This objection was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by Doctor <hi>Chamberlain</hi> in his
dispute with Captain <hi>Kiffin,</hi> as you
may see in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> page of his book,
where saith Doctor <hi>Chamberlain,</hi>
                  <q>Because the Apostle calls it a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
therefore so far from being
not practised, that it ought the
rather to be practised; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
practising no learning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, saith he, you wrest this
Scripture, whereas the express pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the Holy Spirit is, To
teach Doctrines, that so believers
might do what is taught. For the
proof of which, he cites <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34067:22"/>
20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21, 24. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 17.
and 15. 14. <hi>Iam.</hi> 22. 23, 24, 25.
<hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 9. and many other places:
yet saith he, you wrest it to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
contrary; and you say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called a Doctrine, that it
might not be practised, for indeed
so much such an objection doth
import.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr <hi>Perry</hi> in his book of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions
in answer to Doctor
<hi>Chamberlain,</hi> pag. 14. as he doth
therein conceive that which is true,
so he doth suppose that where in he is
mistaken, and that is, to think, and so
to write, that Doctor <hi>Chamberlain</hi>
minded Mr <hi>Kiffens</hi> wresting of the
Scriptures above mentioned; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
indeed, we may plainly see in his
book, and in this I have written of
his words, that he minded him of
wresting <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. which was the
ground of this objection: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may take notice, that the
Scriptures above mentioned, do suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34067:23"/>
prove what Doctor <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi>
brought them for, which
was this, that <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. was wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by Mr <hi>Kiffin</hi> from the proper
true meaning of the Spirit of God
therein. Mr <hi>Perries</hi> words you may
see, are these: saith Mr <hi>Perry,</hi> 
                  <q>I
conceive that every Doctrine of
Christ, that he hath commanded
to be taught by his Apostles, and
his Disciples were commanded to
observe and practise, ought to be
practised: but if this appear not in
this particular thing in any of
those Scriptures, wherein hath Mr
<hi>Kiffin</hi> wrested them? I know not:
but (saith he) in the contrary,
I suppose he doth own them, in
what the Spirit of God means in
them, according to what light he
hath received.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To the later part of these words,
I answer thus much, Who knows not
what Mr <hi>Perry</hi> saith of Mr <hi>Kiffin,</hi> to
be true, and so indeed of all men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34067:23"/>
they walk contrary to their
light?</p>
               <p>But from the former part of his
discourse, we may observe two
things:
<list>
                     <item>1. His mistake, as you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
heard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. His granting what we contend
for, <hi>viz.</hi> that every Doctrine of
Christ which he commands to be
taught by his Apostles, and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
were commanded to observe
and practise, ought to be practised;
this is that we do affirm; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do contend for this truth or
Doctrine of Christ with him and
others that do oppose it: For did
Christ teach it, as you have heard;
and did the Apostles teach it, as you
shall hear in the next reason for the
proof of this truth; and did Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
believers, as such, observe and
practise it, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 6.
and shall not believers now practise
it? Shall not they tread in the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34067:24"/>
of the flocks of Christ, be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of those who first trusted in
him? Shall the cunning working of
Satan prevail alwayes, (as he hath
done for a long time, to the perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and destroying of the truths of
Christ,) and as he doth to this day,
to the denying of them? I say, shall
he alwayes prevail? God forbid:
O <hi>let God be true, but every man a lyer;</hi>
for <hi>what was written afore-time, was
written for our learning, that we through
patience, and comfort of the Scriptures
might have hope,</hi> Rom. 15. 4. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let not truth be destroyed: his
Doctrine was sealed with his blood,
even the death of Christ, and shall
we alter or deny his will? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid:
shall not we hope to find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with God in his appointment?
Surely the contrary will discover us
to be such, that little regard his
Laws, whose precepts are not our
delight.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Reason.</hi> As Christ taught it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34067:24"/>
so the Apostles taught it, read <hi>Heb.</hi>
5. 12. compared with Chapter 6.
1, 2. in the first Chapter 12 <hi>vers.</hi>
saith the Apostle; <hi>Whereas for the
time you ought to be Teachers, you have
need to be taught again, which are the
first principles of the oracles of God,</hi> &amp;c.
where by these words, <hi>you have need to
be taught again,</hi> is plainly implyed,
they were once taught this principle;
and that this the Apostles did teach
them, is also manifest, in that they
laid the foundation of this Church
of the Hebrews; who were those
Jews, spoken of in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. who
are there said to <hi>continue in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Doctrine:</hi> and as they taught it, so
it was a way of God, wherein they
did administer unto his people, and
unto which they were obedient: see
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. and <hi>Acts</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now some will say, In
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. is not mentioned laying on
of hands; therefore believers there
were not under it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34067:25"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Two which I answer, as
laying on of hands is not in so many
words there laid down, no more
there is not the resurrection from
the dead, and eternal Judgement in
so many words expressed; doth that
therefore prove they were not taught
them? Surely, the Apostles would
not have baptized them, but upon
that profession, that their bodies
should be raised, as well as Christ
dyed for them. Again, to say that the
Apostles did not there preach lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands, in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. proves
no more, or is to no more purpose,
then to say that <hi>Philip</hi> did not
preach Baptisme to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi>
when we read of not one word he
spake of it, although he Baptized
him, as you may see <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 35. But
now that the Jews who did believe,
were taught laying on of hands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and eternal Judgment, is
plainly manifest, from <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12.
compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. where
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34067:25"/>
as you have heard, he minds them of
it, as one of those first lessons they
had learned, and as a principle of
the foundation, or beginning-word
of Christ committed to them.</p>
               <p>2. Consider what is written: <hi>they</hi>
(to wit, those that were Baptized
and added to the Church, who gladly
received the word,) <hi>continued in the
Apostles Doctrine,</hi> see <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. Now
this they could not do, if they had
not been taught laying on of hands
which was a principle thereof, part
of what Christ and his Apostles
taught them, as you have already
heard, or may see in the Reasons
given; unless we deny their wayes
to be the same in every Church,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. Again consider, how
can it be thought with honour to
God and his truth, that a man can
be said to continue in the Doctrine
of the Apostles or word of Christ,
when they were not in the practise of
it? for say the Objectors, There is no
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34067:26"/>
mention made of laying on of
hands, no more say I there is not
of the resurrection and eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and yet both preached and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by them.</p>
               <p>3. Consider, they are here said
to be added to the Church, as well
as they received the word, and were
Baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now some may and do
say, By this you make laying on of
hands to be an Ordinance, whereby
those that did believe and were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
were added to the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer, Yes,
and that because laying on of hands
was next administred after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and that in order to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the Soul in the house of God;
it being part of its foundation, the
beginning-Word of Christ; and in
this order, was both preached and
practised by the Apostles. This like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we may consider, that the end
of this Ordinance is promised, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34067:26"/>
applyed to those that are Baptized,
see <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. where saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>And you shall receive the gift of
Holy Spirit; for the promise is to you;</hi> yea,
saith he, <hi>to as many as the Lord our
God shall call;</hi> that is, the promised
Spirit should be given according to
the will of God: and in the 41 <hi>vers.</hi>
it is said, <hi>They that gladly received the
Word were Baptized, and the same day
were added unto them three thousand
Souls:</hi> where we may take notice of
this order; 1. They gladly received
the Word; 2. Were Baptized;
3. Were added to the Church.</p>
               <p>From whence we may learn thus
much, that by Baptisme they were
not added; because their addition to
the Church followed after their
Baptisme: for as their gladsome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the Word went before
their Baptisme, so did their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
before their addition; which
addition was something else besides,
and more then Baptism; for so much
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34067:27"/>
the Text doth hold forth; and being
added, they continued in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Doctrine: and so it is plain, as
it is part of the foundation, so it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Baptisme, as you may see by
the practise thereof, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17, 19.
Chapter 6. 7.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Reason.</hi> Because as Christ and
his Apostles did teach it, so they
taught it as a principle of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the service of God, a
foundation-principle of that service,
wherein they were to live to the
Glory of God, and upon which they
were to stand to go on to perfection:
read <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Moses</hi> was to build a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
unto God, he had a strict
charge, that he should do every
thing according to the pattern the
Lord had given him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 40.
and so afterward, when <hi>Solomon</hi> was
to build the Temple, he likewise
was to do it according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
which <hi>David</hi> had received by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34067:27"/>
the Spirit; and as it is said, which he
was made to understand, by the
hand of God upon him: the first of
<hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 11, 12. and 19.</p>
               <p>Now as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> were
not left at liberty to follow their
own understanding, but were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to make all things according to
the pattern of Gods will: So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were the Apostles, but also
were faithful stewards of the will
and commands of the Lord Jesus:
the first of <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. which Jesus the
Christ, likewise was a Messenger,
and the great Prophet of the eternal
God, whose word is Gods will unto
his people, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 37. and who as a
Son, even as <hi>Moses</hi> a Servant, was
faithful over his own house, <hi>Heb,</hi>
3. 2. <hi>Who was faithful to him that
appointed him, even as Moses was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in all his house;</hi> Even as <hi>Moses:</hi> as
<hi>Moses</hi> was faithful to do every thing,
exactly according to the pattern; so
was the Lord Jesus Christ faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34067:28"/>
unto him, who did appoint
him.</p>
               <p>And surely this considered, we
may easily see, there is not less
exactness and circumspection to be
used now in times of the Gospel,
in building a Spiritual house unto
God, then there was under the Law,
in that which was typical: for that
exactness under the Law served but
as an example or shadow of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, that is to say, Spiritual
or Gospel-things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5.</p>
               <p>Now this being a foundation-principle,
it ought to be laid in every
Church of Christ: for it is no way
consonant to truth, for a man to
think ever to make a lasting build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(either in Spirituals or Civils)
without a good foundation: for saith
<hi>David,</hi> Psal. 11. 3. <hi>If the foundations
be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</hi>
read <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 49. This being a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Gods chusing, to be laid in
the beginning or foundation of his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34067:28"/>
service; How doth it concern us,
and all those who put to their hands
to erect and constitute a Church
unto Christ, to do whatever they do,
as much as in them lies, according
to the pattern given by God; &amp; that
in building they leave out no part
of his foundation? for a principle is
a main support unto the building,
especially where God himself layes
it.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Reason.</hi> Because laying on of
hands is an oracle of God, one of
those commands that God gave
unto his Church, read <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12.
with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. saith the Apostle,
<hi>You have need to be taught again, which
be the first principles of the oracles of God,</hi>
that is, of his Commands, for so the
word oracle doth imply, as you may
see, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38. <hi>This is he that was in
the Church in the Wilderness, with the
Angel which spake to him in the Mount</hi>
Sinai, <hi>and with our Fathers who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the lively oracles to give unto us;</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:34067:29"/>
that is, the whole word of the Law,
or Commands of God, declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his people by the mouth of <hi>Moses,</hi>
for their obedience: as also <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1,
2 <hi>vers.</hi> bears witness unto this: <hi>What
advantage then hath the Iew? or what
profit is there of circumcision? much every
way; because unto them were committed
the Oracles of God;</hi> Where by <hi>Oracles</hi> is
signified the whole Law committed
unto them, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. the
word Oracles being in the plural
number, doth signifie the whole
will of God committed to believers,
the Doctrine of Christ: and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Oracles of God, is the
first part of Christ his Doctrine, the
things which Christ first revealed
and preached to them, as the Apostle
bears witness, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2 <hi>verses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, the word <hi>Oracle</hi> doth hold
forth the counsel of God, which is
the will and minde of God unto his
people, for their obedience; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34067:29"/>
                  <hi>If any man speak, let him speak as an
Oracle of God;</hi> that is, as the will and
minde of God for souls obedience:
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
Acts 20. 20 vers. <hi>that he kept back no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that was profitable unto them;</hi> and
in the 27 <hi>vers.</hi> that he had <hi>declared
unto them the whole Counsel of God:</hi> a
part whereof was laying on of
hands, it being that he taught and
practised among them, as <hi>Acts</hi>
19. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now to turn aside this
truth, saith Mr <hi>Collier</hi> in his book of
Right Constitution, in the 76 <hi>page,</hi>
Oracles do not alwayes imply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
though all commands are
Oracles; yet all Oracles are not
commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Two which I answer,
that though all commands are Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and all Oracles are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
yet what is this unto the
purpose? doth this prove that laying
on of hands is not one of those Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34067:30"/>
that are the commands of the
Lord Jesus Christ: for was it not
reckoned with, and so left upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
as that which Christ did teach
with repentance, faith, and Baptism,
resurrection and eternal Judgment,
as the foundation of the service of
God to every believing Soul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.
1, 2. was it not that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
taught, that unto which Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
believers as such were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient?
as <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 17. &amp; 19. 6. this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
were excuse to answer this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>But surely the weakness of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is discovered, if we consider
Mr <hi>Colliers</hi> reasoning, in the 78 <hi>page</hi>
of his book: saith he <q>The word truly
read both in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. and 6. 1.
is not the <hi>principles;</hi> but the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of the Oracles of God, and the
word of the begining of Christ;
and so cites the Greek words, to
hold forth not <hi>principles</hi> of the
doctrine, but <hi>beginning</hi> of the word,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34067:30"/>
the same, as in the 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>In the
begining was the word,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which I answer, that it is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovered, and I think upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
consideration himself will
grant, that the word signifies <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
as well as <hi>beginnings;</hi> although I
do grant that in other places it may
so signifie, and in this place, (to be so
rendred) may not be altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper;
Yet I must tell him, and I
would have others minde it, that as
he saith, if the words be truly read,
they do so signifie; so I say, If the
words have their proper sence given
to them, they do hold forth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Doctrine of Christ. For
I pray you, what is the beginning of
the words of Christ, when it is
minded as the foundation, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of his Doctrine? for they are
such things as make a sure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the Saints to build upon: and
so we may observe that these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
put together, are the foundation
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34067:31"/>
of the service of Christ; and that
these principles here minded, are
such things as are not temporary,
but lasting, and according to the
minde and will of Christ, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in by the Saints so long as
they continue in this World.</p>
               <p>But saith he further in that place
of his book: <q>There are many things
that are Doctrines and Oracles
for us to believe, but not to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise;
and so instanceth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
waiting at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> till the
Spirit came upon them; their
speaking with Tongues, healing
the sick, raising the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these
saith he are all Doctrines of the
beginning and laying of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
to be believed, but not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised,
unless in the same power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which I answer, first, for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the sick, raising the dead, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Tongues immediately; we
cannot do, unless we are partakers
of the same power: Neither ought
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34067:31"/>
we now to go and wait at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
by vertue of that command the
Apostles had: although thus much
I may minde, that as the Apostles
waited at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for the promise
of the Father; so ought every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Soul to wait in <hi>Zion,</hi> in the
wayes of God, till he be fitted for
the work of God, before he go forth
therein, as too many do this day.</p>
               <p>2. Saith he, <q>they are all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the beginning and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the foundation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But now say I, Where are they laid
down, as laying on of hands is, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 2. part of the foundation? for
their waiting at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> their
speaking with Tongues, healing the
sick, raising the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
laid down the foundation, or
principles of the foundation, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning-Word
of Christ; but laying
on of hands was part of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was confirmed to be the
Word of Christ with signes, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34067:32"/>
and gifts of Holy Spirit; as the
speaking with Tongues, healing the
sick, raising the dead, and the like.</p>
               <p>3. I answer, that this is but cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
reasoning, to subvert the truth:
for as to the Apostles waiting at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
did not Christ command
the so to do? and does not our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
tell us, that that command
was temporary, ended with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the duty there required; &amp; is of
no more weight in this case, then as
if he had instanced that Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
one of his Disciples to fetch
an ass upon which he did ride unto
<hi>Ierusalem?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for speaking with Tongues,
healing the sick, and raising the
dead, they were particular gifts,
not that which is applyed to every
one; to the performance thereof, as
we see, laying on of hands was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
1. To the <hi>Iews,</hi> Heb. 5. 12.
2. To the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> Acts 8. 17.
3. To the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> Acts 19. 6. and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34067:32"/>
so it was minded to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as
well as repentance, faith, Baptismes,
Resurrection, and eternal Judgment,
as that which they ought to consider
of, according to their profession of
Christ therein; that was, to wait
upon God for his Spirit to teach
them, and to assist them in their
Holy profession: without the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of which Spirit, they were not
able to live unto God. I say, this
Ordinance of Christ, it ought to
have according to their profession of
Christ therein, an influence upon,
and through their whole lives; even
as its fellow-principle Baptisme, as
you may see <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Reason.</hi> Because there was no
Church of Christ without this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
or way of Christ, and that
as a principle in the foundation of
his service; the foundation, even the
Doctrine of Christ and of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
upon which they did stand, as
first the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who were the first
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34067:33"/>
Church of Christ under the Gospel,
whose pattern we ought to follow:
this was that they received, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.
and that when they were babes, <hi>Heb.</hi>
5. 12. which first pattern must be
followed whether we will or no, God
will have it so; for he is bringing
forth his truth in righteousness, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that prophecie, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.
10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who were the
second Church of Christ we read
of; this way they went, and that
next after Baptisme, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17.</p>
               <p>3. The Church at <hi>Ephesus</hi> were
set up on this foundation-principle,
<hi>Acts</hi> 19. 6. this was part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of God committed unto them by
the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 20. 27.</p>
               <p>4. A fourth witness unto this
truth, and that is the Church at
<hi>Derbe</hi> and <hi>Lystra,</hi> of whom <hi>Paul</hi> laid
the foundation, as <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 6. and of
whom <hi>Timothy</hi> was a member, <hi>Acts</hi>
16. 1, 2. upon whom <hi>Paul</hi> laid his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34067:33"/>
hands, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> saith
the Apostle; as if he should say, See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thou hast that excellent grace
and gift of faith, (which he speaks of
in the 5 <hi>verse,</hi>) <hi>I put thee in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi>
or I do admonish thee, <hi>that
thou stir up the gift of God which is in
thee, by the putting on of my hands,</hi> or
which God gave thee, through the
laying on of my hands: from whence
it is plain, that in this way <hi>Timothy</hi>
waited upon God, which was not in
vain unto him; and afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
approved of, was ordained to the
work of the Ministry, by the laying
on of hands of the Company of the
Eldership, as the first of <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.
doth manifest.</p>
               <p>And so I do conclude, as these
were, so were all other Churches,
and that for these two Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. Because their wayes were the
same in every Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
               <p>2. Because they had a form of
Doctrine to deliver to them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34067:34"/>
as it is laid down, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2
the Apostle writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
in the 6 Chapter 17 <hi>vers.</hi> saith he,
<hi>You have obeyed from the heart the form
of Doctrine.</hi> Now what was that,
but repentance from dead works,
and faith towards God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even
all that our Saviour taught, even a
form?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now some may say,
We read of it no more then in those
places administred, and therefore
it was not the practise of all
Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer, This
proves nothing, no more then this
very objection, which is made by
Independents so called, against Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme;
because they finde it not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
in all, therefore all were
not under the practise thereof: but
this is false, even as the Objection
is untrue: for the wayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were the same in every Church,
and the Doctrine one that was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34067:34"/>
to them: and look what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
may be made against this
truth, the same, as is plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
(in the discourse between
Doctor <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> and Captain
<hi>Kiffin,</hi>) may be made against Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
Further, you may take notice
in how many Churches you read of
the breaking of Bread, in as many
you shall finde the laying on of
hands as breaking Bread was in
<hi>Iudea, Trod<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Corinth;</hi> so the laying
on of hands in the <hi>Hebrews, Samaria,</hi>
and <hi>Ephesia;</hi> yea, a fourth witness
we have unto this truth, which was
<hi>Pauls</hi> laying on his hands upon <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
as is before minded: so that
I say, persons may as well object
against other truths of Christ, as
against this. But this we know, In
the mouth of two or three witnesses,
every Word of Christ shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished;
therefore let us beware lest
we, as many do, Kick against this
truth of Christ; and as many do, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34067:35"/>
have done against Baptisme.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Reason.</hi> Because it is that which
is milk for Babes, a beginning-Word
of Christ, read <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13. <hi>You
are</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>such as have
need of milk, and not of strong meat.</hi>
Now consider, was it for Babes then,
and is it onely for strong men, now?
as many persons, who deny it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
as believers, yet will own it
for setting persons apart for office:
O what deceit is wrapped up in this!
But surely, this was for Babes, and
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> learnt it in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and this is certain, that which
was for Babes then, is for Babes
now; and that which was for strong
men then, is for strong men now;
for so the Apostle reasoneth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.
14. <hi>Strong meat belongeth unto strong
men, who by reason of use have their
sences excercised to discern both good and
evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now some object, that
laying on of hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. may
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34067:35"/>
be meant to heal the sick, according
to these Scriptures, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 18.
and <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 8. or else for setting
persons apart for office, according
to <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. or <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer, that it
cannot be so meant, for this reason:</p>
               <p>Because in none of those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
laying on of hands is laid
down as a foundation-principle, as
we see here, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. laying on
of hands is so laid down.</p>
               <p>For consider, those Scriptures,
<hi>Mark</hi> 16. 18. and <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 8. do
hold forth no such thing as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-principle;
but that particular
men may receive such a particular
gift of God, as to heal the sick, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as Christ promised, <hi>Mark</hi>
16. 18. and <hi>Paul</hi> received, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 8.
as also <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 8. and many
others, as many in the Church of
<hi>Corinth;</hi> which is no more a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-principle,
neither in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
milk for Babes, then laying on
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34067:36"/>
of hands, (which some make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of,) in <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 12.</p>
               <p>So likewife those Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi>
6. 6. and 13. 3. hold forth no more
a foundation-principle then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
and that,</p>
               <p>Because laying on of hands here,
was upon particular men, who were
set apart for particular offices, and
that for the good of the Church of
Christ: this was not to Babes, but
strong men; the Apostle reckons up
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Babes, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12.
but these were strong men, who
were fit to be imployed in the work
of the Ministry, such as the Apostle
speaks of, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of use, had their sences exercised to
discern both good and evil.</hi> Such who
were gone beyond those spoken of,
in the 12. and 13. <hi>vers.</hi> being in a
capacity of teaching others; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
laying on of hands in the fore-mentioned
Scriptures, upon persons
for healing, or for setting persons
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34067:36"/>
apart for office, cannot be that
meant, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. as the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or beginning-principle, which is
milk for Babes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
               <p>And therefore, I do conclude that
laying on of hands upon believers,
as believers, is the foundation-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
the beginning-Word of
Christ, that which concerns every
believing soul, which is food to it,
and nourishment to it; which is
that they are capable of, but not of
the former, they being not in the like
capacity.</p>
               <p>Therefore my Brethren, as we find
it written, we should not take away
the Childrens Bread, and give it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Dogs; so let us not take away
their milk, but feed them with it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. <hi>Reason.</hi> Because it is part of the
Word of the Lord, that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
unto us: that it was the Word
of Christ, hath been plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
it being that which he taught,
his Doctrine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. Also you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34067:37"/>
may see the first reason for the proof
of this.</p>
               <p>Now that it was confirmed to us,
read <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 20. <hi>And they went forth
and Preached everywhere, the Lord
working with them, and confirmed the
Word with signes following.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whereas some object, that
laying on of hands was for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the Gospel; they may
now by what hath been said, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see that it was part of the Word
of the Lord, or saying of Christ;
even his teaching unto which belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
as such were obedient, one part
of his Doctrine; which therefore
was (as the rest) confirmed with
signes, miracles, and gifts of the Holy
Spirit.</p>
               <p>But for further answer to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
we may consider, that which
confirmed the Word, and the Word,
were different: laying on of hands,
as you have heard, was the Word of
God, the teaching of Christ; but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34067:37"/>
signes, miracles, and gifts of the Holy
Spirit, were the confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>Mark</hi> 16. 20. they appeared,
whereby this word and way of God
was and is confirmed unto us to be
the stedfast Word of Christ. Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
are no foundation-principles;
they are not any part of the Word
of the beginning of Christ; but those
things by which the Word of God
was &amp; is confirmed unto us, to be the
stedfast Word of Christ; the neglect
of any part thereof, God will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish:
for saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2,
3. <hi>If the Word spoken by Angels, were
stedfast, and every transgression and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
deserved a just recompence of
reward: how shall we escape if we neglect
so great salvation, which at the first began
to be spoken by the Lord, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
unto us by them that heard him?</hi>
Therefore my Brethren, as the same
Apostle saith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. so my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
is unto you; <hi>See that you
refuse not him that speaketh: for if they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34067:38"/>
escaped not, who refused him that spake
on earth, much more shall not we escape, if
we turn away from him that speaketh
from Heaven.</hi> Now truth being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
the Lord requires obedience;
and therefore it lies as a duty upon
every believing Soul, to consider his
wayes, and with the good man <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
to turn his feet into the wayes
of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 59. and to set
shoulders to the work of the Lord,
that the breaches in <hi>Sion</hi> may be
again repaired, and the paths there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
may be again restored (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Word of the Lord, <hi>Isai.</hi>
58. 12. <hi>vers.</hi> 61. 4. <hi>vers.</hi>) and in so
doing, we shall be partakers of those
promises, which are annexed as the
reward of such service.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I shall proceed
to answer some objections which
many persons make further against
this truth, and then shall lay down
some Incouragements unto persons to
the performance of this duty: and in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34067:38"/>
the last place shall lay down some
grounds of our withdrawing from
those that obey not Christ in his
Ordinance, answering some objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The first and greatest of
them, is this: That we have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for the laying on of hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Now that we have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
appears, First, from Christs
teaching of it; there is a positive
Command for what he taught, as a
part of his service we are injoyned
to be obedient unto; but Christ did
teach this as a part of his service;
yea, as a principal part thereof, not
onely relating to the building, but to
the foundation of the building,
which is of more weight, as <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Now that this we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to observe; see how full that
Scripture comes upon us, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22.
<hi>A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise
up unto you, of your Brethren, like unto
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34067:39"/>
me, him shall you hear in all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he shall say unto you;</hi> yea, this
command is followed with a curse,
if we obey not, <hi>verse</hi> 23. <hi>And it shall
come to passe, that every Soul which will
not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed
from amongst the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Answer.</hi> VVe have a command,
and that also from the Apostles
teaching and practise of it: that they
did teach it, and practise it, you
have already heard in the second
Reason. Now as they did teach it,
and practise it, see how positive the
command lies upon us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 9.
<hi>Those things which you have both learned
and received, and heard, and seen in me,
do, and the God of love and peace shall
be with you:</hi> also minde, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 15.
<hi>Therefore Brethren stand fast, and hold
the Traditions which you have been
taught, whether by Word or our Epistle.</hi>
Now beloved, this was one of those
things, or of those traditions the
Apostles had delivered to the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34067:39"/>
Churches; yea, one of those things
they had both heard, learned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and seen in <hi>Paul,</hi> which the
Apostle commands them to do, to be
exercised in, to hold fast: and this is
<hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> and
that by way of command, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.
<hi>The things thou hast heard of me amongst
many witnesses, the same commit thou
unto faithful men, that they may be able
to teach others also.</hi> Now this was
one things that <hi>Timothy</hi> had heard and
learned of <hi>Paul,</hi> and that which he
received from him, as is plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in the 5 Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now whereas some may
object, and say, that <hi>Pauls</hi> laying on
his hands upon <hi>Timothy</hi> was to
office:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, that it was not to
office, but for the receiving of the
promised Spirit; which promised
Spirit God did so pour forth
upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Prophecies that went
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34067:40"/>
before of him, a good Souldier of
Christ, one fit to war in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to be exercised in the work
of the Lord, the ministerial office:
therefore saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1. 18. <hi>This charge I commit unto thee,
son</hi> Timothy, <hi>according to the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that went before of thee, that thou by
them mightest War a good warfare.</hi> This
charge, to wit, that you shall finde in
the 3 <hi>vers.</hi> to be this, that he should
<hi>charge some, they should preach no other
Doctrine:</hi> and whereas he saith, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Prophesies that went before of
thee, that thou by them mightest War a
good warfare;</hi> that was those revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that God manifested unto
some of his people; whereby he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<hi>Timothy</hi> to be one whom he
had chosen to the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry;
and so by them, that was
those Prophesies, the Apostle was
assured, that his calling was of God,
and that his blessing would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:34067:40"/>So that when <hi>Paul</hi> laid his hands
upon him, he received the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and that in such manner, as that
he was fitted abundantly for the
work of the Lord; which when this
was manifested, and he had by the
people of God, or Church of Christ,
a call thereunto; he was by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands of the Eldership or
Presbytery, set apart for the work
of the Ministry, as you may see,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p>So that it is plainly manifest, that
by the imposition of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands,
<hi>Timothy</hi> received the Spirit in the
gifts thereof, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>And by the imposition of the
hands of the Eldership, he was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
to the work of the Ministry,
according to the Prophesies that
went before of him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p>3. We have a command, and that
from the Commission the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
gave his Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20.
<hi>Teaching them,</hi> (to wit, those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34067:41"/>
and are Baptised,) <hi>to observe
all things whatsoever I have commanded
you.</hi> From whence this truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</p>
               <p>That if Christ did command the
Apostles to lay on hands, they
were to teach those whom they
should Baptize, to submit thereunto,
as the words do plainly manifest,
<hi>Teaching them to observe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Christ did command the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to lay on hands.</p>
               <p>For what they did in any service
of Christ unto believers, as such, was
by the command or authority of
the Lord Jesus; and therefore say
they, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Let a man so account
of us, as of the Ministers of Christ, and
Stewards of the Mysteries of God:</hi> and in
the 14 Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>If any man think
himself to be a Prophet or Spiritual, let
him acknowledge the things I write unto
you, are Commandments of the Lord:</hi>
this was the account they gave of
their authority. And it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34067:41"/>
I never knew that opposer yet
of this truth of Christ, that durst
affirm the Apostles had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for laying on of hands.</p>
               <p>So that I say, if they had a
command for laying on of hands,
the Observation thereof was taught
by them, and is that which God by
vertue of his Commission given doth
require of us; for saith Christ,
<hi>Teaching them,</hi> that is, those that are
Baptized, <hi>to observe all things, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I have Commanded you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now some will say,
Laying on of hands is not there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, Though it be not
expressed, it is plainly implyed; for
whatsoever the Apostles did teach
and practise, was by vertue of their
Commission received from Christ.</p>
               <p>But this they did teach, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12.
and also practise, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. and
19. 6. and therefore it was by vertue
of their Commission, received from
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34067:42"/>
Christ: And their very manner of
teaching and practising, discovers it
to be the mind and Command of
God unto believers, as such.
<list>
                     <item>1. Because they taught it, as a
first principle, or beginning-Word
of Christ unto young believers; and
therefore it's reckoned up <hi>milk for
Babes, Heb.</hi> 6. 1. &amp; 5. 12.</item>
                     <item>2. Because they taught it, as a
principle of the foundation of the
service of Christ, and that as <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
faith, Baptisme, Resurrection and
eternal Iudgement,</hi> Heb. 6. 1, 2.</item>
                     <item>3. Because they taught it, as that
which Christ taught unto them, or
gave in charge unto them, as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them to be Stewards of the
mysteries of God; and therefore they
witness it the Doctrine or teaching
of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. that which they
had received from him, even the
Lord Jesus Christ.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>So that from the Commission,
doth likewise appear the force also
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34067:42"/>
of this obedience; whereby those
that resist the truth, may be left
without excuse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But yet some will and do
say, The Apostles did lay on hands
by vertue of a particular gift which
God had given them, to give the
Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostles did never lay
on hands by vertue of those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
gifts they had received, but by
vertue of their ministerial office:
for laying on of hands being an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Christ, a way unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
as Baptisme, or other of his
appointments; The Apostles did
never officiate in them by vertue of
any particular gift, neither any
other Minister of the Gospel, but by
vertue of their ministerial office, as
they were called of God to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in those wayes to his people; and
so did, leaving the effect thereof unto
God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But some do say, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34067:43"/>
by laying on of hands, did give
the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, though this be one of
their greatest Objections and Blocks
against which they Stumble; Yet
our greatest opposers are herein
divided: for though some do affirm,
that the Apostles had power to give
the Spirit; yet others of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so believe: and who would think
men of such parts and wisdome as
they are, should so affirm; but that
indeed the carnal minde of man
will ever oppose the things of
God?</p>
               <p>2. I answer, and that positively,
that the Apostles by laying on of
hands, did give the Spirit of God,
no more in this Ordinance, then <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
did in the preaching of the Word,
<hi>Acts 10. 44. While he spake the Word,
the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard
it; and they spake with Tongues, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VVhy so it was, that while <hi>Peter,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34067:43"/>
Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were exercised in this
Ordinance, even laying on of hands,
God gave his Spirit to his people.</p>
               <p>But alas, what is <hi>Peter, Iohn</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> but Ministers by whom they
believed? the one may Plant, and
the other VVater, but it's God that
must give the increase, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>And surely this, what gifts Christ
is pleased to convey through Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
is not by any power that is in
them, as is plainly discovered from
<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 12.</p>
               <p>Neither was it ever in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
power, to give the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
unto any man; and so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
plainly declares unto me, in his
answer to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
did think, as too many do this
day, that the Apostles had power to
give the Spirit; and therefore he
offered them mony for that gift or
power: the Apostle thereby seeing
the corruption of his heart, saith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, <hi>Thy mony perish with thee,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34067:44"/>
because thou thinkest the gift of God
may be obtained with mony,</hi> Acts 8. 18,
19, 20.</p>
               <p>3. Further, take notice, that this
power or prerogative of giving the
Spirit, the Lord Jesus Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
keeps in his own hands, &amp; he
giveth it to whom he pleaseth, as
you may plainly see by these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 32, 33. <hi>This Iesus hath
God raised up, whereof we are al witnesses;
therefore being by the right hand of God
exalted, and having received of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the promise of the Holy Spirit, he
hath shed forth this which you now see
and hear.</hi> Mark this; he hath done it,
even this Jesus, but not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
               <p>And saith our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.
16, 17. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he
shall give you another Comforter, Even
the Spirit of truth:</hi> and in the 26 <hi>vers.
But the Comforter which is the Holy
Spirit, whom the Father will send in my
Name:</hi> the 15. 26. <hi>vers. But when the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34067:44"/>
Comforter is come, whom</hi> (saith
Christ) <hi>I will send unto you from the
Father, Even the Spirit of truth,</hi> Luke
11. 13. and <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 32. saith the
Apostle, <hi>We are witnesses of these
things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom
God hath given to them that obey
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which places it is plainly
manifest, that this power or prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of giving the Spirit, the Lord
Jesus Christ and God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alwayes keep in their own
hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. It is further <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anifest, that it
was not in the Apostles power to
give the Holy Spirit of promise, and
that from the administration of the
Ordinance, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 15. <hi>When</hi> Peter
<hi>and</hi> John <hi>came down to</hi> Samaria, <hi>they
prayed for them, that they might receive
the Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VVhich doth discover, it was not
in their power to give it; but they
prayed for them, that so indeed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34067:45"/>
God would give it to them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his promise.</p>
               <p>Again, as it is manifest that this
power belongs unto the Lord Jesus
Christ, he having received of his
Father this promise of the Holy
Spirit, and so gives it forth upon his
people:</p>
               <p>So likewise we may observe, that
he also gives the gifts or operations
thereof; or the Spirit of God doth
work and operate in poor Souls, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his wisdom.</p>
               <p>For as there are members of the
body of Christ, so every member
hath it's office given him of God:
this the Apostle plainly discovers,
1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> the 12 <hi>Chapter,</hi> in the 4. 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10. saith he, <hi>There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of gifts, but the same Spirit; and
there are differences of administrations,
but the same Lord; and there are diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of operations, but it is the same God,
which worketh all in all: but the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of the Spirit is given to every
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34067:45"/>
one to profit withall; for to one is given by
the Spirit the Word of wisdome:</hi> and so
he goes on making mention of the
gifts and operations thereof: and in
the 18 <hi>vers.</hi> thus declareth; <hi>But
now hath God set the members in the body
as it hath pleased him:</hi> again saith he in
the 27. and 28. <hi>vers. Now you are the
body of Christ, and members in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and God hath set some in the
Church; first, the Apostles; secondly,
Prophets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From all which, as before, we may
minde, that as the Spirit of God is
given to every believing obedient
Soul, and this by the Lord; so every
ones gift or office likewise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from him. Again, saith the
Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 7. speaking of the
Church; <hi>But unto every one of us is
given grace, according to the measure of
the gift of Christ.</hi> Now if any should
say, How would this appear? the
Apostle makes answer, <hi>vers.</hi> the 8.
<hi>Because he ascended up on high, he led</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:34067:46"/>
(speaking of Christ) <hi>Captivity
captive, and gave gifts unto men:</hi> and
<hi>vers.</hi> the 11. it's said, <hi>he gave some
to be Apostles, and some Prophets and
some Evangelists, and some Pastors and
Teachers,</hi> and this for the good of the
body of Christ: and this work of
Christ, of giving his Spirit unto
men, to be continued so long as the
Saints are to be perfected, and the
body of Christ to receive edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as we may plainly see, from the
12. and 13. <hi>verses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that to say, the Apostles had
power to give the Holy Spirit, or
Spirit of promise, is untrue, absurd
and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Again, some there are, who
make this a great obstacle in the
way, (thereby hindering poor Souls
from their obedience,) even the
Words of the Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 16.
<hi>for as yet he was fallen upon none of
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence they perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34067:46"/>
and labour to perswade
others, that the Apostles did lay on
hands by vertue of a particular gift
or power, which God had given
them, to give his Spirit. Now for
the removing of this stumbling-block,
I answer,</p>
               <p>First, If you consider what hath
been spoken to the last Objection,
you may plainly see, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did not lay on hands by vertue
of any particular gift, but of their
ministerial office. Neither was it
ever in their power to give the Spirit
of God to any man, as hath been
plainly manifested.</p>
               <p>2. Whereas the Apostle saith,
<hi>for as yet he was falne upon none of them,</hi>
it discovers to us, that it was an usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
thing in the Apostles dayes, for
the Spirit of God to be given, and
that in more then an ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and therefore well might <hi>Luke</hi>
thus write this parenthesis, in the
discourse of this Ordinance: for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34067:47"/>
as yet he was fallen upon none of
them.</p>
               <p>3. Again thirdly: VVhereas
<hi>Luke</hi> useth these words, <hi>for as yet he
was falne upon none of them;</hi> it might
very well be taken notice of. For
though <hi>Philip</hi> had wrought great
works in the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> as in
the 6. and 7. <hi>verses</hi> of this Chapter,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. insomuch that God bore wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from Heaven to those things
that <hi>Philip</hi> spake, that there was
great joy in that City; and that
<hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who of long time with
his Sorceries had bewitched the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
believed and was Baptized; yet
there was no givings forth of the
Spirit of God so immediately as at
other times: as for instance, when
<hi>Peter</hi> preached the VVord, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.
44. (even while he was speaking,)
the Holy Spirit fell on them that
heard it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Some do say, Why did not
<hi>Philip</hi> lay hands upon the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:34067:47"/>
as well as Baptize them? and from
hence they reason, that though <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
was instrumental for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
yet <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> must lay
hands upon them: and so by such
reasonings as this, laying on of
hands must be laid aside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, let us examine; hath
not this reasoning much of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in it, to set up <hi>Peter, Iohn</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> that so indeed we may come
to think of them above that which
is meet, as if they had power to do
that they had not? but for this, some
hath been already reproved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
12. <hi>Now this I say,</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
<hi>that every one of you say, I am of
Paul, and I of Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. and in the
3 Chapt. 5 vers. <hi>Who is Paul, and who
is Apollo; but Ministers by whom ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved?
Even as the Lord gave to every
man.</hi> Oh! that we could therefore,
<hi>cease from man, whose breath is in his
Nostrils,</hi> and give glory to God,
looking up onely unto him; who is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34067:48"/>
the giver of every good and perfect
gift.</p>
               <p>2. May there not be, or is there
not already too many, who make as
great a noyse to the crying down of
Baptisme, as this Objection doth of
laying on of hands, &amp; that in regard
of <hi>Philip,</hi> who did work Miracles,
and <hi>Ananias</hi> who had an immediate
Commission to Baptize <hi>Paul,</hi> as well
as the Apostles, for what they did?
O say many persons, none but those
that were immediately authorized,
and did work Miracles, did Baptize;
therefore your Baptisme is not right,
because you work no Miracles: and
hence they conceive no Baptisme,
but the Baptisme of the Spirit, which
they think the Apostles gave unto
those persons, upon whom they laid
on hands.</p>
               <p>3. The great thing in Answer
unto this question, is, to shew why
<hi>Philip</hi> did not lay hands on those
persons whom he converted and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34067:48"/>
Baptized: and now if this Reason,
could truly be rendred, something of
satisfaction possibly unto many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
would appear.</p>
               <p>But for my part, though persons
are never satisfied, I dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to know above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
and therefore, why he did not
lay hands upon those persons he
did Baptize, I dare not positively
determine.</p>
               <p>But this I know, and herein is my
satisfaction, that the work was done;
and I do believe the Apostles are as
good an example, and the thing is
of as much weight, (if not more) as if
<hi>Philip</hi> had done it.</p>
               <p>But Oh! what weak reasoning is
here, yet concurring with the rest to
make voyd the truth.</p>
               <p>I shall appeal to any mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
whether this be a sufficient
ground to keep any soul from the
doing of his duty, because he cannot
see why <hi>Philip</hi> did not lay on hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:34067:49"/>Surely you or I may suppose
many things; but which of us is able
to determine which is truth amongst
all? therefore it is good for us to
keep close unto this, that it is Gods
way, that wherein the Apostles as
Ministers of the Gospel did admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
and that whereunto believers
Baptized as such, were obedient; that
it was taught unto them as milk for
Babes, and that it was a principle of
Christs Doctrine, a beginning-word
of Christ unto believers: and herein
let us quiet our selves, not seeking a
reason for that the Lord doth not
give us; lest we are carried captive
by our carnal imaginations, and so
split our selves against the truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query.</hi> But now some may say, If
we practise this Ordinance; where
is the ground for our faith, seeing
whatever is not of faith is sin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, in all our Actions, I
do grant it is good for us to have a
ground for what we do, especially in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34067:49"/>
the service of God, in which service
we are to walk by rule. And here I
wish that those who walk in mixt
Communions, would consider what
VVord of God they have to bear
them out in that practise, whether
ever Christ left such a rule to walk
by.</p>
               <p>But secondly, I answer, The ground
of our faith in this Ordinance, is the
Word of the Lord, which doth not
only as you have heard discover unto
us this Ordinance, to be the mind of
God unto believers, a way wherein
he requires their obedience; but it
likewise discovers the very end of this
Ordinance, to be the promise of God;
which promise God first made unto
<hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Apostle bears witness
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. that the blessing of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
might come on the Gentiles, that
we might receive the promise of the
Spirit, through faith. VVhy we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe without the Spirit; yet
through believing it is, that we are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34067:50"/>
made partakers thereof, even of
the promise, which is the Spirit;
which promise God renewed, and
more plainly discovered by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ioel, Ioel</hi> 2. 28, 29. which the
Apostle takes notice of, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 16.
this was likewise hinted forth by
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 8. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Baptize you with water, but he
shall Baptize you with the Holy
Spirit: and this our Saviour himself
declared, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 38, 39. <hi>He that
believeth on me, out of his Belly shall
flow Rivers of living Water: this he spake
of the Spirit, which they that did believe
should receive.</hi> Now, as hath been
declared, they could not believe
without the Spirit; yet, through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
the promise of the Spirit is
made good unto poor souls.</p>
               <p>And this promise of the Spirit, the
Apostle doth annex unto faith and
Baptisme, as the right and portion
of every believing obedient soul, <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 38. <hi>Repent and be Baptized for the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34067:50"/>
Remission of sins, and you shall receive
the gift of the Holy Spirit.</hi> From which
Scriptures it is manifest, that the
promise of the Spirit is made unto
believers Baptized, as such; and
therefore the Apostle in the 39 <hi>vers.</hi>
doth apply it unto believers Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
as such, as their right and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>For the promise is unto you, and to
your Children, and to all that are afar
off; even as many as the Lord our God
shall call.</hi> Which promise of God in
general was the ground of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
assurance of faith in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that God would give his
Spirit in this his own appointment
to his people. So that a better
ground to Act upon in any way or
service of God, we cannot have, then
the Word and promise of God is.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the next place, for
your incouragement in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
consider these few things:
obedience to God is,</p>
               <p>First, that which makes a soul ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34067:51"/>
of knowing the mind of God:
therefore saith our Saviour to the
Jews; <hi>If you will do his will, you shall
know of the Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Obedience unto Christ, is
that whereby believers do enter
friendship with the Lord Jesus
Christ; even as by their profession
they do enter battle or wage war,
with the greatest Enemy; Even the
Dragon spoken of, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 17.
who is there said to <hi>make war with the
Woman, and the Remnant of her seed,
which keep the commands of God, and have
the Testimony of Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why so I say, they do enter by
their obedience unto Christ, the
greatest friendship that possible can
be in the World, <hi>Iohn 15. 14. You
are my friends,</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>if you do
whatsoever I command you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. There is much incouragement
to this duty, from the end of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of God, is that the soul
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34067:51"/>
stands in continual need of; yea, the
usefulness of the Spirit of God, is
very much discovered: First, in that
it is the Teacher of the Saints, the
first Epistle of <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 27. <hi>But the
anointing which you have received of
him, abideth in you, and you need not that
any man teach you, but as the anointing
teacheth you:</hi> Why, it is the office of
the Holy Spirit, to be the Teacher
of Gods people, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 26. <hi>But the
Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit, whom
the Father will send in my Name, he shall
teach you all things, and bring all things
to your remembrance, whatsoever I have
said unto you.</hi> Secondly, as he is their
Teacher, so he is their Comforter,
yea, and their Remembrancer, as in
this 26 <hi>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewise he is their Guide, and
their Leader, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 18. so he is
their strength, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 16. yea, by
the Spirit they have boldness at the
Throne of grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Because
ye are Sons, God hath sent forth the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34067:52"/>
Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying
Abba, Father.</hi> So also it is their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
at the Throne of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 26. saith the Apostle, <hi>We know
not what to pray for, as we ought; but the
Spirit helpeth our infirmities.</hi> Oh! how
useful is the Spirit of God, unto poor
souls! it's a quickning Spirit, and
therein also it is very useful: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God are apt to deadness and
coldness, in the things of God;
therefore saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
11. <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raised
up Christ from the dead, dwell in you, he
that raised up Christ from the dead, shall
quicken your mortal bodyes, by his Spirit
that dwelleth in you.</hi> Again, it's by
the Spirit, that we must mortifie
corruption, the deeds of the body; as
in the 13 <hi>vers.</hi> Many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
may be minded, wherein the
usefulness of the Spirit of God doth
consist; therefore let these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
incourage us, to wait upon
God in this his way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:34067:52"/>4. We have incouragement to
wait upon God in his way, even
in this Ordinance, and that from the
general promises in the Scripture,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13.</p>
               <p>5. A fifth ground of incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may be drawn from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why the Spirit of God is given
forth unto poor souls; and that
first, from the souls being in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the Lord: for among the
many precious promises of the new
Covenant, this you shall finde to be
one, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. I will put my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
within you, and cause you to walk
in my statutes, and ye shall keep my
Judgments, and do them: this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the Apostle also Renders, <hi>Gal.</hi>
4. 6. <hi>Because you are Sons, God hath
sent forth the Spirit of his Son,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from souls obedience;
the promise is made unto such, <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 38. &amp; 5. 32. such as walk in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
shall certainly be partakers of
the Spirit of promise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:34067:53"/>6. Another ground of incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I shall mention, may be taken
from the Necessity of the Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given with it's gifts and fruits
amongst the people of God; and that
may be,
<list>
                     <item>1. Either, first, for the Glory of
God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Rom.</hi>
12. 11.</item>
                     <item>2. For the general good of the
people of God, according to these
Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>The manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of the Spirit, is given to every
man, to profit withal:</hi> and so he goes
on, discovering in the 8, 9, 10. <hi>vers.</hi>
the several gifts and fruits of the
Spirit, from whence proceeds the
usefulness of the members of the
body of Christ, one unto another;
the Spirit of God <hi>dividing to every
man severally as he will,</hi> as in the 11.
<hi>vers.</hi> So that <hi>the Eye cannot say unto
the hand, I have no need of thee; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the head to the feet, I have no need
of thee,</hi> vers. 21. and the Reason is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34067:53"/>
given, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. <hi>that there should be no
schisme or division in the body, but that
the members should have the same care
one of another:</hi> read also 14. Chapt.
12 <hi>vers.</hi> and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 12.</item>
                     <item>3. For our particular good and
help, according to these Scriptures,
<hi>Iud.</hi> 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 5. and
the 16.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore now, let these incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
you to make use of that means
God hath appointed, even this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
wherein his people were
made partakers of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query.</hi> But now some do Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
What grounds we have that
practise laying on of hands, to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from those who are Baptized?
for (say they) could you have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with us, we could with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer, and
that first: Considering the frames
of your Spirits, your denial of the
truth, calling it error and delusion,
a Doctrine from beneath, an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34067:54"/>
of the Devil, that which is our
own tradition, a post we would set
up by the posts of God, that for
which we have no better ground
then the Common-prayer-book,
A new administration, which never
was either taught or commanded by
Christ in all the new Testament:
from hence,</p>
               <p>I would Query, by what rule of
Christ it is, that you could have
Communion with us; and the case
being thus, we can any longer
Communicate with you?</p>
               <p>For my part, I must profess be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, and before the whole
World, that, how to satisfie my
conscience, and maintain the truth
of God, in such Communion, I know
not: if I could, I should do it.</p>
               <p>I know it's that they reflect upon
us, that we want love to them, as the
ground why we cannot Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with them.</p>
               <p>But the Lord he is Judge, and he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34067:54"/>
knows that it's our love to the truth
of Christ, and the order he hath
prescribed in his house, that will not
suffer us; Especially as the case
stands with them, as is before
minded.</p>
               <p>And therefore, if there be any
love in them towards us, let us be
partakers of those weighty Reasons
grounded upon the Word of truth;
which may convince us, that it is our
duty still to have Communion with
them, notwithstanding their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
against this truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But by this some may say,
It seems, that if they did not oppose
the truth, you could Communicate
with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, No, for we have
no such custome, neither the
Churches of Christ: Search the
Scriptures, and see if ever Christ left
such a rule to walk by, or that God
allowed or approved of any such
practise. We are glad to hear, where
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34067:55"/>
there is any so moderate as not to
oppose it; and it is not burden some
to us, to wait upon God in his
way, labouring their convincement,
and imbracing of the truth; for it is
that which is their duty, as well as
Baptisme; and a part of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the house of God, as well as
repentance and faith: and therefore
to build with them, without this
principle in the foundation, were to
presume to do that, we have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for, and to make a breach in
that order God hath appointed, and
that in the very foundation of his
service.</p>
               <p>2. I Answer, that we have good
ground to maintain separation
from those, though Baptized, that
deny this Ordinance of laying on of
hands, and that</p>
               <p>1. Because we are Commanded
to keep the Ordinances, as they were
delivered, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Therefore
Brethren, standfast, and hold the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34067:55"/>
which you have been taught, whether
by Word, or our Epistle;</hi> and herein were
the Corinthians praised by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
which is also written for our
Example, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>Now I praise
you Brethren, that you remember me in all
things, and keep the Ordinances as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
them unto you.</hi> From whence it
is manifest, that to keep the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
as they were delivered, is that
which is praise-worthy to the Saints,
well pleasing unto God, and the
will and minde of God unto his
people.</p>
               <p>But to Communicate with those,
that do deny the laying on of hands,
will put us out of that capacity; this
our experience doth witness to us.
VVe might speak much unto this, &amp;
of the opposition we had, when I
was in such a condition.</p>
               <p>2. Because from those persons,
who do not hold the Ordinances as
they were delivered, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to withdraw, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 6.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34067:56"/>
                  <hi>Now we command you Brethren, in the
Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that you
withdraw your selves from every Brother
that walketh disorderly, and not after the
Tradition you have received of us:</hi> yea
a good ground we have to observe
this Command, from their oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in that they raile, print, speak,
and dispute against the truth, calling
it a <hi>Doctrine from beneath,</hi> a <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
thing;</hi> which gives us a good
ground to observe the Apostles Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>From such
withdraw thyself:</hi> and certainly as we
are to withdraw from those, who
are evil in their Conversation, so
likewise from those, who do declare
against that which is part of the
worship of God, yea a foundation-principle
of his service.</p>
               <p>3. Because laying on of hands, is
a foundation-Doctrine, a principle
upon which a right constituted
Church of Christ is built, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.
A Doctrine, which was (not notion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34067:56"/>
as many say, but) practically im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
by the first Churches; as the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and the
<hi>Ephesians,</hi> which were exactly built
according to the direction of Christ
himself. Now this is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that though there may be
Communion with persons, where
differences are in circumstantials;
yet not where they are in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals:
and for this reason, those who
are Baptized, have refused Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Independants; because
they erre in a fundamental point,
therefore they cannot build with
them: and is not this reason strong
for us, because laying on of hands is
a foundation-Doctrine or principle,
as well as Repentance, faith, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismes,
and Resurrection, and eternal
Judgement? therefore this being a
foundation-principle, we ought not
to build with those, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers
thereof: and therefore for
this Reason, we ought not to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:34067:57"/>4. Because they live in the Breach
of, and in opposion against a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, Even this begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-word
of Christ; and so indeed
to partake with them, were to make
our selves guilty of their sin. Now
that they are such, that they do so
live, is plainly manifest by their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
printing, preaching, and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
Thus opposing this Law &amp; ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. and as they do
thus live in the Breach of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, an oracle, and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Christ Doctrine; so certain
it is, that we cannot have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with them, without transgressing
the Command of the Spirit of God,
where we are exhorted to withdraw
from such, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>5. Because where there is not an
uniting in the principles of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the service of Christ, there
can be no safe or comfortable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
for indeed Union is the
ground of Communion, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 3.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34067:57"/>
                  <hi>Can two walk together, except they are
agreed?</hi> and saith our Saviour, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two of you shall agree on Earth as
touching any thing that you shall ask, it
shall be done for them of my Father which
is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 18. 19. from
whence it is plain, that where there
is no Union, no Agreement, there
can be no fellowship, no walking
together, no asking the Father for
any thing: for consider, how can we
ask the Spirit of God to be given, and
that according to his promise, with
or among them who do oppose the
means, to wit, laying on of hands? it's
abomination unto them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how can we have Communion
with them, or they with us?</p>
               <p>Surely, if things were rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
our separating from them
will be found upon as good ground,
if not better, then their separating
from the Independants so called: for
wherein do they differ, but in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing?
the practise of Baptisme they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34067:58"/>
deny not, though not rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
nor applyed; But the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of laying on of hands upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
Baptized, as such, is denyed by
our opposers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now some may say,
Though I am satisfied, that laying
on of hands, is an Ordinance of
Christ; yet they are good men that
I have Communion with, such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom I have found much
comfort, therefore I cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from them.</p>
               <p>1. We may take notice, as this is
an Objection made by some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Baptized people, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by some, that are Baptized, who
walk with the Independents, so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
O say they! they are good
men, and we walk lovingly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
therefore we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from them; not considering
that in this, they have no rule of
Christ, and that God never gave
unto persons such Liberty of loving
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34067:58"/>
each other, as that thereby his wayes
and truths should be rejected and
neglected by them.</p>
               <p>2. To the Objection, I answer,
that by this thou doest discover, how
little thy love is to the Lord Jesus
Christ and his wayes, and how low
an esteem thou hast of them, that
thou preferrest thy love to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
before thy love to thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>It is true, it is that which is thy
duty, to love those with whom thou
hast Communion, (yea thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,)
but in this thy loving of
them, thou must know, that thou art
to walk according to the Law or
rule of Christ towards them; for thy
love towards them, must be subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to thy love unto God and his
truth: and to this purpose Christ
speaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. that
<hi>if any man loved Father or Mother more
then him, he is not worthy of him;</hi> yea, if
a man doth not <hi>hate his own life,</hi> if
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34067:59"/>
once it come in Competition with
Christ, or any one of his Laws, that
he can rather part with truth, then
deny his life, <hi>he cannot be Christs Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou oughtest to praise thy duty
in its place, and to perform it; but if
once it come in Competition with
Christ or his truth, that thou must
either suffer the truth of Christ to
fall, or else be accounted of by some,
that thou hast little love in thee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; I say, if thou preferrest
thy love towards them before the
truth, that notwithstanding Christ
calls upon thee to be a follower of
him, yet thou wilt not, because it may
make a breach in thy love towards
them, thou discoverst thy self to
have little love in thee towards
Christ, and that thou art mistaken
in thy right loving of them.</p>
               <p>For thou canst not better love
them, then to be faithful unto God,
wherein thou wilt give them a good
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34067:59"/>
example; for that which is thy duty
in this particular, ought also to be
theirs, if so convinced of the truth,
as thou art.</p>
               <p>Especially in the consideration of
this, that there are several persons
amongst them, that have Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
from this truth and Doctrine
of Christ, that have declared for it,
and have been obedient unto Christ
therein; but now deny it, and are
great opposers of it: which if thou
hadst not ground from the Scripture
to maintain separation from them,
upon any other account, thou couldst
not according to order Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But say some, I dare not
deny them to be a Church of Christ,
as they say you do; and therefore
they will charge me, as they have
done others, that I do greatly sin in
departing from them.</p>
               <p>1. I Answer, do thou follow
Christ in his Word, according to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34067:60"/>
the form and order appointed by
him in his house; and though they
charge thee with departing from
them, God will Justifie thee: for it
is not their crying, <hi>the Temple of Lord,
the Temple of the Lord,</hi> that will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
their disobedience, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. 4. for
when truth is declared, he commands
all men to receive it, and therefore
when it once comes to thy Soul, he
requires thy obedience.</p>
               <p>For to what end doth God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
his truth, by any poor Soul, by
any of his people; but that others
should be obedient? consider, was it
not ever that, which followed that
old principle of confusion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
poor Souls were frighted by
them, if possible they could, into that
state, wherein both matter and
form, subjects and order, were all
contrary to the minde of God? Oh!
what a noise and cry did they make
after poor Souls, who for conscience
towards God did separate from
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34067:60"/>
them? O, say they! they leave the
Church; and O! what a great evil
would they make of this? thereby
possessing <hi>the people,</hi> as if they had
done very wickedly. Not to go for
further instance, Was not this the
practise of the Bishops and Prelates,
and after them the Presbyterians,
then the Independants? and now it
is come to be the practise of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
people, whereby it is manifest,
that this is but one of the last shifts
of a confused principle. When they
cannot overturn the truth, they will
labour to lay stumbling blocks in the
wayes of Gods people.</p>
               <p>2. I Answer, though they look
upon themselves to be a Church of
Christ; yet thou by the light of
truth manifested to thy Soul, doest
see, that they are short in a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the foundation thereof. Is not
the Church of Christ the house of
God? and is not Repentance, faith,
Baptismes, laying on of hands, the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34067:61"/>
Resurrection of the dead, and eternal
Judgement; the foundation thereof,
see <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. what will you say to
make void this truth? will you say, as
many do, Christ is the foundation?
but is he any otherwise a foundation
then in his Doctrine as he is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
and is not this his Doctrine or
Teaching? doth not the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 1. call it <hi>the Doctrine of Christ?</hi> and is
not his Doctrine one with himself?
Surely Christ &amp; his truth are one: &amp;
so far as a Soul knows Christ, he will
walk in obedience to him: and doth
not their disobedience to this way of
the Lord, discover the disorder they
are in, that indeed they build before
the foundation is rightly layed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
a principle thereof?</p>
               <p>3. Whereas they say, we deny
them to be a Church, it is not true;
For we desire not to enter Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in things that are too deep for
us. But this is that we have said,
and do still say, let them prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34067:61"/>
a Church of Christ: which if
they can so do, we can prove them
short in a foundation-principle of
the service thereof, and so disorderly.</p>
               <p>For consider, is it according to
the rule of Christ, to admit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
though Baptized, to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that shall say of a principle of
the foundation, of the service of
God, upon which he should stand to
go on to perfection, It is a lye, that
which Christ never taught, though it
be in so many words declared? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such a practise God will never
own; neither dare we, lest he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
us.</p>
               <p>But here I shall take liberty to
write Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> own Argument,
for the discovering of a true Church
of Christ, in the first Page of his
book of <hi>Right constitution:</hi> saith he,
<q>A true visible Church of Christ,
consisteth both of matter and
form, or of subjects and order:
for, saith he, it is Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34067:62"/>
and those subjects must be
such visibly as Christ owns, and
that form and order according to
Christs Rule; or else, saith he, it
cannot be Christs Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Surely, if what Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> writes,
and this truth of Christ, to wit,
laying on of hands, were rightly
weighed, what could he have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
more against himself, and for us
in this case? therefore let's try, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he hath thus spoken, whether he
doth own the form and order of
Christs house: which is plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
he doth not; for in that book,
as you may see, from the 70 Page to
the end thereof, he opposes a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of his Doctrine, a part of the
foundation of the service of Christ:
but I wish the Lord may give him,
and others to see this truth of Christ,
&amp; that they may be followers of him
therein. I shall now conclude, leaving
what I have written, to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all to whom it shall come,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34067:62"/>
desiring, that they would with the
noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to see if what I have said be
so or no; that they would seriously
weigh, as in the sight of God, the
things laid down in this discourse,
having their Eyes up towards God;
knowing what is written, That they
which seek the Lord understand all
things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 5.</p>
               <p>Further, my desire is, that if in
their Consciences they do finde any
convictions of the truth herein
asserted, they would take heed of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of it, and that, lest they be
found fighters against God.</p>

            <head>An ANSWER
To a discourse containing 4 <hi>Chapters</hi> in
opposition to this principle of Christs
Doctrine, (to wit) laying on of
hands upon believers Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
as such.</head>
            <p>I Having almost ended my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
discourse for the press; it
being a discovery and vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the truth; there was presented
to my hands a book (having no
Name thereunto) consisting of two
sheets of paper, put forth, as it doth
appear unto me, by several persons
in opposition to this Ordinance of
the Lord Jesus Christ (to wit) lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands upon believers Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
as such.</p>
            <p>To which, as the Lord shall help
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34067:64"/>
me, (with as much soberness and
moderation, taking as little notice as
possible I can, of their reproachful
speeches of us, and of the truth) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the measure I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
(having this opportunity)
give a brief answer thereunto, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
it may more tend to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of persons, it being particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
answered; although the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thereof is already answered
in my book: likewise not doubting,
but that other Servants of Christ,
who may be more able, will, as God
shall give opportunity, more fully
vindicate his truth from the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
thereof.</p>
            <p>Their book, as I have already said,
doth consist of 4 <hi>Chapters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, of the several ends of laying
on of hands.</p>
            <p>2. What laying on of hands is
not, and cannot be meant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.
2 <hi>vers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. What laying on of hands is,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34067:64"/>
and must be meant there.</p>
            <p>4. That the laying on of hands
practised by some in these dayes, on
all Baptized believers, was never
Instituted, Commanded, nor practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at all by Jesus Christ or his
Apostles, in all the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now their first <hi>Chapter</hi> contains,
(according to their Judgement,) the
several ends of laying on of hands;
and they are three.
<list>
                  <item>1. For healing of the sick.</item>
                  <item>2. For ministring or giving the
Extraordinary gifts of the Holy
Spirit.</item>
                  <item>3. For ordaining and appointing
of Officers.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Unto the first and last of these, I
shall not now speak; having spoken
my Judgement and Conscience of
them, in the beginning of my book,
which I do hope, is according unto
truth.</p>
            <p>And therefore shall now take a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34067:65"/>
little notice of what is written, as to
the other particular; desiring the
Reader to consider of what I have
written to the other two, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of my book.</p>
            <p>And now whereas they lay down,
and thereby would affirm, that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands was for giving the
Extraordinary gifts of the Holy
Spirit; and for the proof of this, they
say that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> to this end,
laid their hands upon them at <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
Acts 8. 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>I answer, first, that the end of this
Ordinance is missed by the Author
or Authors of this book: for the end
of this Ordinance is the promised
Spirit, which God will give to all
those, who from the heart obey his
Doctrine, are followers of his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for the gift of the Spirit is the
promise of God to all those who do
obey him, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, &amp; 5. 32 <hi>vers.</hi>
which promise of the Spirit is the
end of this Ordinance; which end
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34067:65"/>
also was assigned thereunto, see <hi>Acts</hi>
8. 15. and to which end the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did administer it, that those
persons, to wit, beleevers, who by
their obedience were under this
promise of God, might receive it of
God, whose gift this was, and who
alone, not the Apostles, did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
it unto his people, as these
Scriptures do witness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Acts</hi>
5. 32. &amp; 2. 33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.
16, 17. &amp; 15. 26. &amp; 16. 7.</p>
            <p>2. I Answer, that the giving the
Extraordinary gifts of the Spirit,
was never propounded as an end of
laying on of hands; neither can our
opposers prove it, that persons by the
submission to this Ordinance should
be partakers of the miraculous gifts
of the Holy Spirit, or that persons
were to expect this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
gift thereof; but that as before,
they might be partaker of the Spirit
of promise; that whereas now they
were to joyne themselves, according
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34067:66"/>
to their profession, with the body of
Christ; so they might Act in the
body, according to the will of
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But now some may say, By
laying on of hands, they received
the Holy Spirit, in an Extraordinary
manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That they did receive the
Holy Spirit in more then an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner, by laying on of hands,
I do grant: but that the Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
gifts of the Holy Spirit is
the end of this Ordinance, I do
deny.</p>
            <p>For did they receive the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
in a more then ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
through this Ordinance? <hi>Acts</hi>
19. 6.</p>
            <p>So they did through the preaching
of the Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44. yea, and
through prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 31. which
if considered, we shall finde the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
gifts of the Holy Spirit,
to be the end no more of laying on
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34067:66"/>
of hands, then of preaching the
Word and Prayer: they may be an
effect or fruit of each of them, but
not the end: for poor Souls, by their
obedience unto Christ, are made
partakers of the Spirit of promise,
which is the Producer of such effects,
or fruits in them.</p>
            <p>3. We may observe, that the
foundation of this discourse being
missed, and in the first place, that
which is untrue affirmed, (to wit,
that laying on of hands was for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Extraordinary gifts of the
Spirit,) it's no marvail they should
run themselves into so many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
understandings of those that
practise it, and the hard Censures
they put upon them, with their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious
Judgments about this truth,
which I pray God forgive them, for
they know not what they do: and so
I might put an end to their first
Chapter; only</p>
            <p>I shall take a little notice of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34067:67"/>
weight of those Reasons which they
bring to prove, that the end of this
Ordinance is the miraculous gifts of
the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>And their great Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Samaritans, <hi>Acts</hi> the 8.
were such as did believe, <hi>vers.</hi> 12.
and did receive the Word of God,
<hi>vers.</hi> 14. and were Baptized, <hi>vers.</hi>
16. all this, say they, could not be,
unless they had already received
the ordinary measures of the
Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
how this Reason doth hold
forth, that there is no receiving of
the Holy Spirit by that Soul, who
is already Partaker of the Spirit,
but what is in an Extraordinary
manner; which how false this is, I
shall leave to the Experience of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
to prove, yea, to the Raisers
of this Reason, if so be they have the
Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>2. VVhereas they say, we cannot
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34067:67"/>
believe without the Spirit; I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that unto those who do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
who receive the VVord of
God, and are Baptized, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the Spirit made: see <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.
14. <hi>that the blessing of</hi> Abraham
<hi>might come on the Gentiles, that we
might receive the promise of the Spirit
through faith.</hi> VVhy, we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
without the Spirit; yet, through
believing, those that do believe, are
made partakers of the promise
thereof: see likewise <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 38, 39.
saith our Saviour, <hi>he that believeth
on me, out of his belly shall flow Rivers of
living water; this he spake of the Spirit,
which they that did believe should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:</hi>
from whence I might Reason
as before. But further, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that this promise of the Spirit
the Apostle doth annex unto faith
and Baptisme, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. where
saith the Apostle, Repent and be
Baptized for the Remission of sins,
and you shall receive the gift of the
Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:34067:68"/>
               <hi>Query.</hi> Now I would Query of
you, was this promise proper onely
to some believers, or all believers? if
you say, To some, as your principle
must lead you to; for you must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tye it to some in the Apostles
times, or else to the time of the first
Apostles, who received the Word
at the mouth of Christ, to give unto
us: then I Answer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The following words may
stop your mouths: for the promise
hath a larger extent then you dream
of; it was unto them, and their
Children, and all that are afar of,
even to as many as the Lord our
God shall call.</p>
            <p>From whence I minde, the promise
of the Spirit is as much ours, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the wise disposing of
God,) who knows best in what
manner to bestow it on his people,
as it was theirs.</p>
            <p>And whereas you boast of parts
and gifts, beyond those that have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34067:68"/>
practised this Ordinance; yet let me
tell you, that herein is much vanity,
and your boasting is not good. For
though God injoyne us to the use
of Ordinances, yet himself is not
tyed thereunto: therefore if your
gifts be greater, learn to make a right
use of them, for Gods glory, and his
peoples comfort, and not to oppose
the truth. Surely, there will be one
day a sad account given of the gifts
God hath given unto men, who will
be found, that in stead of making a
right and good improvement of
them, for Gods glory, and his peoples
comfort and incouragement; they
have made a contrary use of them,
and that to their trouble and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
and with their lyes have
made the hearts of the righteous sad,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 22.</p>
            <p>I do believe, there were in the
Apostles dayes, those that boasted as
much of gifts as your selves, which
caused a disesteem of the Apostles
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34067:69"/>
among the Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10.
saith the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> (speaking of
himself and of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who were
Apostles of Christ, as you may see,
comparing the 6 <hi>vers.</hi> with the 9. &amp;
10 <hi>vers.</hi>) <hi>We are fools for Christs sake,
but you are wise in Christ; we are weak,
but you are strong; you are honourable,
but we are despised.</hi> So others, they
had <hi>a Name to live,</hi> and others they
said they were <hi>Rich, and had need of
nothing;</hi> but God had a reckoning
with them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. and the
16. and 17. <hi>verses.</hi> So there is in this
our day, those who are great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of some truths you your selves
profess, and yet in parts and gifts
not inferior unto you; but alas, what
Reasoning is this? the learned Scribes
and Pharisees in Christs time, cryed
out, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 49. those that knew not the
Law were cursed; as if indeed wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
must only centre in their
brests, or dy with them. Now hath
not your boasting of gifts, something
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34067:69"/>
of this nature in it, to beget a dise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
in believers hearts of this truth?
spiritual gifts are such things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
should covet after, for they
are very useful, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1. But
surely this parts and gifts without
wisdome, which is profitable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
to make a right and good use of
them, doth but puff up the soul, as is
too apparent this day. Therefore our
desire is, not so much to minde the
measure of receiving, as making a
good use of what we do receive, and
keeping close to the appointments
of our God, wherein is our safety;
because he hath there promised his
presence, and will there give forth
his loves, <hi>Esa.</hi> 64. 5. <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 12.</p>
            <p>So that I hope those that have not
their hearts prejudiced against this
truth of Christ, may plainly see your
mistake, in making that the end of
this Ordinance which is not, though
it may be an effect or fruit thereof, as
I have already proved it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34067:70"/>
an effect or fruit of other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of Christ, as of Preaching
and Prayer. But let's further consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is not this a wile whereby Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
labours to make void this truth
of Christ, as he hath done to others?
thus cunningly he works, when
Baptisme, as to the right subjects
and practise thereof, is found out:
O, saith he, it is to believers and their
Children; and why? for circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed: and
thus would keep up that old relick
and Pillar of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
which from the beginning it
was not so: Neither is now, blessed
be God, the mystery of Iniquity so
secret, But that God hath abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovered her, and made bare the
skirts thereof; and it is now through
the good hand of God plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
that there is now no seed of
<hi>Abraham</hi> according to the flesh, but
the natural Jews, who are beloved
for their Fathers sake; yet have no
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34067:70"/>
right to promise or Ordinances,
without believing in our Lord Jesus
Christ, until the Word of God be
fulfilled, that is, the time expired,
that the fulness of the Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come in, then all Israel shall be
saved; according as it is written, <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. Chapt.</p>
            <p>There are other reasons, which they
do urge, though to as little purpose;
but the substance of them being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in this, and fully confuted in
my book; I shall passe them over,
and proceed to their second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</p>
            <p>Which doth contain (according to
their Judgments,) which of those
laying on of hands is not, and cannot
be meant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>Now before you resolve this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
you grant that a laying on of
hands is a principle of Religion,
and a part of the foundation of
Christian building, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. &amp;
6. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:34067:71"/>And your Reason is, because the
Holy Spirit by this Penman, doth
Reckon it amongst those principles
of Religion, as repentance, faith,
Baptisme, the Resurrection, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Judgment; and these granted by
all under the least profession of
Christianity, to be the foundation-Doctrines.</p>
            <p>I have thought good to minde your
Reason, because it doth fully prove
laying on of hands to be a principle
of Religion, and a part of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Christian building.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the first place, it
is well that the Word of the Lord
hath so much weight upon you, that
you dare not deny it; but that you
do confess it to be a foundation-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
a part of the foundation of
Christian building. I am glad to
see you thus far own the truth; which
makes me hope, you may in time
come to a fuller acknowledgement
thereof, and to see wherein you
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34067:71"/>
are mistaken; and that when your
demises and denials will be found too
light, being weighed in the Balance
of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>2. I shall examine, which of those
laying on of hands, you say is not,
and cannot be that meant, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 2.</p>
            <p>And first, you say it cannot be
meant, of laying on hands for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
and that for these Reasons.
<list>
                  <item>1. Because the gift of healing, by
laying on of hands, is now ceased. But
you might better have answered,
because this laying on of hands was
never laid down a foundation-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple:
and this is that, which if you
please may be work for you, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who are more of that minde
then you are, to make appear, that
ever it was so laid down, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-principle.
As for laying on
of hands for healing, I do grant,
that no one ought to do, unless he is
partaker of that gift of healing, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34067:72"/>
so your second Reason is very true.</item>
                  <item>2. Because a foundation-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
concerns the whole, every part
of the building, to support and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it. And therefore I say, if there
were any that had this particular
gift of faith, the healing of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
member could not concern
the whole body as a principle. How
doth this confute Mr <hi>Harrisons</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
in the 8 page of his book,
which he draws from <hi>Mark</hi> 16. and
the 18 <hi>v.</hi> that laying on of hands for
healing is the principle mentioned
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. but that book of his was
fully answered by Mr <hi>Griffith.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. I would have you know, that
this was not the way those that did
believe, and were Baptized, did
wait upon Christ in for healing:
for amongst them, as a Church, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were not wrought, but for the
conviction of unbelievers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.
22. For signs were not for those,
who did believe, but for those that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34067:72"/>
believed not: But the way of God
for believers, to wait upon him in,
in the time of sickness, was prayer
and anointing with Oile, as in the
beginning of my book I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But secondly, you say, that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands for giving the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
gifts of the Holy Spirit,
cannot be here meant, and that for
these Reasons:
<list>
                  <item>1. Because the power of giving
the Extraordinary gifts of the Holy
Spirit is now ceased.</item>
                  <item>2. Because this laying on of hands
cannot be the principle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that laying on of hands is there
called a Doctrine, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and 2.</item>
                  <item>3. Because if this laying on of
hands, (to wit) upon believers Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
as such, were the principle; then
this Church of the Hebrews, the first
constituted Church of Christ in all
the New Testament after Christs
Ascention, which is (say you) the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34067:73"/>
same with that, in <hi>Acts</hi> the first and
second Chapters, had wanted a
principle in Religion; which were
very absurd to Imagine. These be
your Reasons, that the laying on of
hands we practise, cannot be that
meant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. Unto these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as the Lord shall help me,
I shall particularly give answer.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, taking notice that here is
still affirmed, that which never will
be proved, but is already disproved,
that laying on of hands was only
for the giving the Miraculous gifts
of the Holy Spirit; Therefore I say,
as I have made to appear, the giving
of the Extraordinary gifts of the
Holy Spirit, was never assigned the
end of this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>But you say, the power of giving
the Holy Spirit in the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
gifts thereof, is now ceased.</p>
            <p>1. To which I answer, first, if the
Apostles had power to give the Holy
Spirit, through laying on of hands,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34067:73"/>
then they had through the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word; but though through
their preaching the Word, the Holy
Spirit was given, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44. as
well as through laying on of hands,
<hi>Acts</hi> 19. 6. yet it was never in the
Apostles power, to bestow it upon
any, as is Ignorantly imagined,
and as I have already made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
and therefore so to think, were
absurd and ridiculous: for it is the
gift of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 32. and <hi>Acts</hi>
8. 20.</p>
            <p>2. I answer, you do much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
your selves, for the power of
giving the Holy Spirit, is not ceased,
for Gods hand is not shortened, he is
the same yesterday, to day, and for
ever: he that is unchangeable, is the
giver thereof; the Lord Jesus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of his Father this promise,
and this promise he hath given, and
doth give, and will yet make good
unto his people, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 39. 29. <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 38, 39.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:34067:74"/>
But to strengthen your Reason,
you say that this appears to be cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
by the practise thereof at this
day: for though so many persons
have hands laid upon them to this
end, yet those Extraordinary gifts
have never followed to any one of
them; but both they and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrators
are, and remain as other
men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, minde your absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity:
the power is not ceased, God
is the same.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas you say, we practise
it to this end; I answer,</p>
            <p>That here again you are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
though in your last Chapter
you are pleased to say, that some of
us do so; which is that I never yet
heard to be the Judgment of any
in this practise, and therefore I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you wrong us.</p>
            <p>3. But you say, For all this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
we remain as other men. I
answer,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:34067:74"/>It is very true, but we may easily
see your sore, which I wish the Lord
may heal among you, and that is
this; if you could see a sign or a
wonder, you would believe: But
take heed you may not be as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it, as the generation unto
whom Christ spake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 38, 39.
&amp; 16, 1, 2, 3. and 4.</p>
            <p>For my self, it was my Judgment
and practise in this way of God, that
I ought to be obedient, not for what
I should receive, but because the
Lord Jesus taught and left such a
way for believers to wait upon
him in. Yet I would have you know,
I did never yeeld obedience unto
Christ in any of his wayes, but I did
indeavour to exercise faith upon
him therein, and that for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and blessing with me in them:
and this I must tell you, that it is a
rotten-principle, and that which
God will never approve of, for any
one to yeild obedience to him,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34067:75"/>
meerly because they shall receive
such or such a gift from him.</p>
            <p>And I wish this may not be an
evil of many Professours in this our
day; not only those, who have been
in our practise, but in yours also;
who have upon such grounds sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
propounding such or such
benefits to themselves: then missing
of their ends, they have been offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and so have rejected the Word
of the Lord, and the good wayes of
God.</p>
            <p>Alas, we may say, when we have
done all, we are unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and having done the whole
will of God, we have need of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
            <p>We do confess we are weak, and
possible may come under that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
the Apostle gives the Hebrew
Church, (who were under this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Christs Doctrine, as well as
we,) that for the time we might
have been Teachers; yet we have
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34067:75"/>
need to be taught again: but this is
our Comfort, that God doth in any
measure accept of us; and though
we have but a little strength, yet it's
our duty to hold fast the Word of
the Lord; and in so doing, we are
confident he will approve of us, <hi>Rev.</hi>
3. 8, 9, 10. But this we know, that
the people of God, though never so
much indued with his wisdome,
were still fools in the wise Worlds
account, as possible we may be in
your eyes: and though we are so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
by you, yet learn to know,
that God makes use of foolish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.</p>
            <p>And therefore farther to this, I
may say, that what God bestows
upon us in this, or any of his wayes,
It is our duty to be thankful to him
for: and if we can learn this lesson,
to make a right use of what we have
received, we may be confident of
receiving more from God.</p>
            <p>Likewise to call this a principle,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34067:76"/>
(to wit, laying on of hands upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
Baptized, as such) is not to
grant, as you say, that one of the
foundation-stones is now lost; but is
indeed again restored, and that to
it's right use, which hath been for a
long season in a wrong manner
applyed, and now by you wholly
rejected.</p>
            <p>Your second Reason is, that this
laying on of hands cannot be the
principle, because this laying on of
hands is there called a Doctrine;
but that laying on of hands to give
the Holy Spirit, was never once
taught in all the New Testament, no
not by them that practised it.</p>
            <p>I answer, first, taking notice that
the opposers of this truth of Christ
agree not; for Mr <hi>Harrison</hi> in his
Touch-stone, as he calls it, of this
truth, affirms the laying on of
hands, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. to be meant
upon persons for healing, which is
the laying on of hands spoken of and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34067:76"/>
promised, in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 18. <hi>vers.</hi> and
Mr <hi>Kiffin,</hi> he affirmed in his dispute
with Doctor <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> that laying
on of hands, in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 6.
is not a Doctrine practicable to all
Saints; but was dispensed for the
confirmation of the Gospel: and this
is Mr <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yes</hi> Judgement, as you may
see in the 19 page of his book; and
so they understand <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>vers.</hi>
to hold forth: so that the one
holds forth laying on of hands for
healing, to be the foundation-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. and the other two,
to be for the Confirmation of the
Gospel, and so a foundation-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
as minded to the Hebrews.</p>
            <p>But now as Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Kiffin</hi> differ each from other; so do
these differ likewise from them: for
say they, laying on of hands here, in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. was upon persons to
office. All which, as you have
heard, and may plainly see, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Spiritual things together, are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34067:77"/>
untrue; but more of this in the next
Chapter.</p>
            <p>2. You say, this laying on of hands
(to wit, upon believers as such) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the principle, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the laying on of hands, in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. is there called a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi>
which laying on of hands, you
minde was upon persons to office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I do grant, that laying on
of hands upon persons to office, is
the Doctrine or Teaching of Christ,
his will and minde unto his people;
wherein they ought, as they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
to be exercised, &amp; that for the
good of the body of Christ: But I do
deny it, according to the answers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given in my book; and yet
shall minde unto this, in the 3
Chapt. that laying on of hands upon
persons to office, was ever laid down
a foundation-principle; Neither is it
your Reasons in your 3 Chapt. that
will make it so to appear, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot be that meant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:34067:77"/>
3. You say, the laying on of hands
upon believers as such, for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the Spirit, was never once
taught in all the New Testament;
no not by them that practised it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, that the Apostles did
teach this unto believers as such, see
the second Reason or ground, in my
book, laid down for the proof of this
truth of Christ, which you may
take notice of for the Confutation of
this Assertion.</p>
            <p>2. I answer further, that this were
very strange, that the Apostles should
administer in this way unto belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
whereunto believers as such
were obedient, (as I have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved,) and yet this way or
practise by the Apostles was never
taught them; they not once (say you)
taught or instructed thereunto: what
may we gather from this Teaching
of yours? why surely this, that there
were some wayes, wherein the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did administer, and whereunto
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34067:78"/>
believers as such were obedient;
wherein they knew their duty, and
the Apostles meanings, without their
Teaching. O! that you might see
your weakness in this your striving
against truth.</p>
            <p>3. That the Apostles did admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
unto believers in this way, and
that this practise of theirs believers
were obedient to, I think you dare
not deny. Now this being that as
hath been plainly manifested to be
the teaching, not onely of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
but of Christ himself, from
whom they received their authority
for what they did; then this being
so, for you to affirm the Apostles
never taught this unto believers,
Now what is this, but to put a lie
upon the Spirit of God, and lay a
stumbling block in the wayes of his
people?</p>
            <p>4. Let's minde further, was this
Ordinance performed without
prayer? <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 15. <hi>they prayed for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34067:78"/>
them, that they might receive the Holy
Spirit.</hi> Now were these believers
at <hi>Samaria</hi> in the Expectation and
practise of that the Apostles never
taught them? Surely, you have
cause to be humbled for this your
wresting of, and deceitful dealing
with the Word of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Again, herein you may see, what
confusion God leaves you to, who
are opposers of this truth: for Mr.
<hi>Kiffin,</hi> he affirms in his dispute with
Doctor <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> that though it
were a principle and Doctrine of
Christ, (to wit, laying on of hands
upon believers,) yet ought not to
be practised; but you deny it to be
either principle or Doctrine. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by this we may see, that Satan
will leave no stone unturned, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
he can overturn the truth.</p>
            <p>Your third Reason is, because if
this laying on of hands (to wit, upon
believers Baptized as such) were the
foundation-principle, then this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34067:79"/>
very Church of the Hebrews, the
first constituted Church in the New
Testament after Christs Ascension,
(this Church being the same with
that, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. and 2 Chapt.) had
wanted a principle in Religion;
which were very absurd to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
for they had not laying on of
hands to this end, <hi>Acts</hi> the 8. being
the first place, that ever this was
practised: and surely in all matters
about worship, the written word
must be our Rule, and to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
silence we must give consent,
according to the Proverb: where
God hath not a Mouth to speak, we
must not have an ear to hear.</p>
            <p>To which long discourse or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of yours, whereby the truth is
evaded, and something Eclipsed,</p>
            <p>I answer, that this Church of
Christ did wait upon God in this
way, contrary to what you have
spoken: and this I do affirm: for if
they continued in the Apostles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34067:79"/>
then in this practise; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Apostles did teach, (as
before is plainly discovered in the
second Reason; laid down in my
book, for the proof of this truth,
likewise in the answer there to an
Objection,) but they did continue
in the Apostles Doctrine, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42.
therefore in their obedience to this
truth: read the 41. and 42 <hi>verses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. was not the
first place that ever it was practised;
Neither were they in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this principle in Religion; for as
I have said, how should they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the Apostles Doctrine, and
yet short in the principles thereof?
and therefore the minde of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus declared, it plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
his mouth speaking to you,
and that your ears should be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
            <p>But you proceed further, and say,
they had not laying on of hands to
this end, because they received the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34067:80"/>
Extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
without it.</p>
            <p>I answer, first taking notice you
say, that those in <hi>Acts</hi> the 1. and 2.
were not under it but: this, as before,
is false: but if your saying were true,
that they were not under it, then I
pray you, to what end did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it? why, surely by your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they did not receive it. Yet you
say, they had not laying on of hands
to this end, because they received
the Extraordinary gifts of the Holy
Spirit without it; and so instance
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>vers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, they that are
there said to receive the Holy Spirit,
were under the promise thereof,
without any more Baptizing with
water: this was the promise, and
the Command of Christ unto them,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49, 50. <hi>Behold, I will send
the promise of my Father upon you: but
tarry ye at Ierusalem, until you be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with power from on high:</hi> and He
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34067:80"/>
               <hi>led them out, as far as to</hi> Bethany, <hi>and
lift up his hands and blessed them:</hi> and
Acts 1. 5. (saith Christ to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,)
John <hi>truly Baptized with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but you shall be Baptized with the
Holy Spirit, not many dayes hence:</hi> see
<hi>vers.</hi> the 4.</p>
            <p>Now though it were thus with the
Apostles, and those who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
under this promise; yet I
do affirm, that those three thousand,
who are in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. and 42. <hi>vers.</hi>
there said <hi>gladly to receive the Word,</hi>
and to be <hi>Baptized,</hi> and were <hi>added to
this Church,</hi> were under this practise;
and that,
<list>
                  <item>1. Because they (two wit, those
spoken of in the 41. and 42. <hi>vers.</hi>)
were not immediately under the
promise, (as those spoken of in the
2, 3, 4. and 5 <hi>vers.</hi>) but I may say
conditionally, as the Apostle saith
<hi>vers.</hi> 38. and 39. <hi>Repent and be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
for the Remission of sins, and you
shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34067:81"/>
for</hi> (saith he) <hi>the promise is to you,
and to your children, and to all that are
afar off, even to as many as the Lord our
God shall call;</hi> where you may see, he
doth annex the end of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
(to wit) the promised Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
unto faith and Baptisme.</item>
                  <item>2. If the Apostles did not teach
laying on of hands unto these Jews,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. they had been defective
in a principle of Christs Doctrine, of
what Christ taught unto them, as
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But the Apostles did teach laying
on of hands to these Jews, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.
and 12. compared with the 6. 1, 2.
<hi>vers.</hi> doth manifest; and therefore
were not defective in Christs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
which Hebrews by your own
confession, were the Jews spoken of,
in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Now I would query of you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you will still affirm, (upon due
consideration of this also)</p>
            <p>That the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> having
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34067:81"/>
told the Jews, in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. that
God would make good this promise
of giving his Spirit unto them, upon
their obedience unto him, whether
you will still affirm, that he did not
Act in the same manner, for their
being made partakers thereof, as he
did with those at <hi>Samaria,</hi> Acts 8. or
as <hi>Paul</hi> did with those at <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
Acts 19. or upon <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Derbe</hi>
or <hi>Lystra,</hi> as in my book I have
minded.</p>
            <p>Surely, I think, upon due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
you dare not so affirm; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deny what I have written, and
herein queryed, to be truth.</p>
            <p>So that it doth appear in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the Examination of your
second Chapt. that you are mistaken
in the laying on of hands, which, say
you, is not and cannot be meant,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>Your 3. Chapter contains, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your mistaken Judgement,
what laying on of hands is and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34067:82"/>
must be meant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>And therefore you begin: <q>For
the better resolving of this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we must take notice, that it
is laying on of hands here in the
singular Number; therefore can
be but one laying on of hands,
that is called here a principle; and
not more, as some would have it;
for then it should be layings on of
hands in the plural Number.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These are all your own Words,
which I do the rather cite, because
I do own them to be words of truth:
but I pray you, who would have it
in the plural Number? why surely
your selves; and therefore take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that herein you are also divided,
and agree not in crucifying of the
truth; see the 7 Page of Mr <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
Touchstone.</p>
            <p>But now, say you, this being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
we must remember what
went before, that it is not laying on
of hands for healing, nor for giving
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34067:82"/>
the Extraordinary gifts of the Holy
Spirit.</p>
            <p>I Answer, that it was not for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
I have before proved; and your
labour in the proof of this, might
have been spared, unless it had been
by any of us affirmed: But that it
was for the giving of the gift of the
Spirit, do affirm: for the gift of the
Spirit is the promise of God unto
believers Baptized, as such, <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 38.</p>
            <p>Now whereas you would have
the Extraordinary gifts of the Holy
Spirit, to be the end of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
you are still mistaken, as I
have already made to appear, that it
is the end no more of this ordinance,
then of the preaching of the word
and prayer: it may be an effect of
them, or a fruit of the Spirit of God,
being given therein; but the proper
end of neither of them.</p>
            <p>But say you, laying on of hands,
in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. must be meant for the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34067:83"/>
ordaining of officers: and this you
labour to make appear by several
Arguments.</p>
            <p>1. Say you, it must be laying on
of hands for healing the sick, or for
giving the Extraordinary gifts of the
Holy Spirit, or for ordaining of
officers; but neither for healing the
sick, nor for giving the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
gifts of the Holy Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for ordaining of officers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Your first proposition I do
grant, (considering what I have
spoken; wherein you have missed the
right end of laying on of hands,
which is the foundation-principle,)
for not the Extraordinary gifts of
the Spirit, but the Spirit it self is the
end of this Ordinance. This consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
I do grant, that one of those
3. laying on of hands, is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-principle;
yet if there be but 3
ends of laying on of hands in the
Scripture, then why did any of you
query about that wicked laying on
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34067:83"/>
of hands in <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 12. <hi>vers.</hi> as you
may see Mr. <hi>Griffith</hi> takes notice
thereof in the 38 Page of his book of
the 6 principles.</p>
            <p>Now to your second proposition:
say you, it is neither for healing the
sick, nor for giving the Holy Spirit;
hath been already proved in your
second Chapter.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, that it was
not for healing the sick, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
granted. But that it was for
the giving of the Holy Spirit, I have
as you may plainly see, in my Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of your second Chapt. plainly
discovered; and therefore your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
proves false, that it must be
for appointing of officers.</p>
            <p>2. Your second Argument, that
laying on of hands upon officers,
must be here meant; because laying
on of hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. is called a
Doctrine, and therefore must be a
laying on of hands, which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
else taught; but the other lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34067:84"/>
on of hands was never once
taught.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I have fully answered this
Argument, as may be plainly seen
in my Answer to your second Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
in your second Chapter; to
which I shall for the confutation of
this Argument refer you.</p>
            <p>But only thus much, I would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
minde you, that this laying on
of hands upon believers, as such, was
the Doctrine of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1.
The Word or Oracle of God, <hi>Heb.</hi>
1. 12. <hi>vers.</hi> and that for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
because God did bear witness
to it by his Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. &amp; 19. 6.
which if compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4.
is plainly discovered, that what God
did bear witness to by the gift of his
Spirit, was confirmed to be the
Word of Christ, which must not be
neglected, as in the 2. 3. <hi>vers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, to answer a query (of
your own making) you seek to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
at the heels of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34067:84"/>
I shall propound this Query.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query.</hi> Whether persons igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of laying on of hands, be a
sufficient ground to deny any one
the administration of Baptisme.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, No; and that
for this Reason:</p>
            <p>Because we do suppose young Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
to be Ignorant; and therefore
if any one doth propose himself for
obedience unto Christ, and that in
Baptisme, he is to be Baptized and
instructed; according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
our Saviour gives, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
19. and 20. <hi>Teaching them,</hi> (to wit,
those that are Baptized) <hi>to observe
all things,</hi> &amp;c. But if any after they
be Baptized and Instructed, shall
refuse submission to other of the
Commands of Christ, either through
ignorance or obstinacy, they are not
to be Communicated with, but to
be sharply reproved.</p>
            <p>And therefore whereas you say,
it is sore against our wills, if we may
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34067:85"/>
not suddenly lay hands on those we
do Baptize; if by the Word <hi>sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
you do minde a time for persons
to be instructed, that you do allow
of Instruction to come between
their being Baptized, and having
hands laid upon them, then we do
grant it; for there is no soul, that
desires to follow Christ, But is our
desire, they should receive and walk
in obedience to the whole Doctrine
of Christ.</p>
            <p>Further, I cannot but take notice,
how confident you are that laying on
of hands to office, in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 23. was
injoyned and Commanded by the
Holy Spirit, and that the laying on
of hands upon believers, was never
in the least commanded by the Holy
Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Surely, It is not there said
so, and therefore you do but suppose
it to be so; for is there any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
expressed in those <hi>verses,</hi> for
that practise? I grant there is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34067:85"/>
Example, which is of weight, and
ought to be followed:</p>
            <p>But whereas you say, we have no
Command for the laying on of
hands upon believers; Surely, if
such a Command as here you bring,
would have served you, your mouths
had been long before this stopped;
for is there not as much command
from the Apostles practise in these
Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. and 19. 6.
as there is for what you affirm, from
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3. But this know, for what
I now plead, we have Command as
well as Example, as is fully disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in answer to this Objection
made by you, (to wit,) that we have
no command for laying on of hands
upon believers Baptized as such.</p>
            <p>3. Your third Argument, because
this laying on of hands, (to wit) on
officers, this Church of the Hebrews
had practised amongst them, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6.
they laid their hands upon the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
to assign them to office; but
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34067:86"/>
none of the other laying on of hands
was practised amongst them, that
you finde.</p>
            <p>I Answer first, to the first part of
your Argument: that this laying on
of hands (to wit, upon officers) was
practised in this Church of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
I do grant, and so ought to
be the practise of all Churches in this
matter of appointing officers; it
being the way and order of God in
his house, according as they shall
finde occasion thereof.</p>
            <p>But that this laying on of hands
was ever laid down the foundation-principle
in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. I do deny:</p>
            <p>1. Because laying on of hands in
<hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. was (as I have minded in
my book) upon particular men, who
were set a part for particular offices,
and that for the good of the Church
of Christ; this was not to Babes,
but strong men: but the Apostle
reckons up the Hebrews Babes, <hi>Heb.</hi>
5. 12, 13. but these were <hi>strong men,</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:34067:86"/>
who were fit to be imployed in the
work of the Ministry, such as the
Apostle speaks of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Who
by Reason of use, had their sences exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
to discern both good and evil.</hi> Such
who were gone beyond those spoken
of in the 12. and 13 <hi>vers.</hi> being in a
Capacity of Teaching others, and
therefore this laying on of hands
cannot be that meant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>But we may safely conclude, that
laying on of hands upon believers,
for the receiving of the Holy Spirit,
may be here meant, and that for
these Reasons.
<list>
                  <item>1. Because every Babe is capable
thereof; which they are not of the
former.</item>
                  <item>2. Because every Babe hath need
thereof; which he hath not of the
former.</item>
                  <item>3. Because we finde Babes in the
practise thereof, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Acts</hi>
19. 6. yea, the Hebrews, when
Babes, were in this practise; they
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34067:87"/>
learnt it in that condition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.
12, 13.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>2. Because officers are not for the
being, but the well-being of a
Church of Christ. When things
are not in such a Capacity, as in
their beginning, to watch over one
another; then they are to consider of
some amongst themselves, according
to their wisdome, (who are faithful)
into whose hands, in the Name of
Christ, they give authority, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Charge of the house of God
unto them.</p>
            <p>Also we finde the foundation of
the service of God laid, and a house
unto God built, before there were
officers chosen amongst them, as
these Scriptures do witness, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.
1, 2, 3, 4. Chapt. 14. 23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>And therefore, laying on of hands
upon persons to office, is not the
foundation-principle minded in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>To the second part of your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34067:87"/>
whereas you say, that none
of the other laying on of hands was
practised amongst them: this is false;
for the contrary hath been already
proved, that the Jews in <hi>Acts</hi> the 2.
were under it; yea, they were in the
practise thereof, as it was milk for
Babes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. so that, (as your
former Arguments did not,) neither
doth this prove the laying on of
hands upon persons to office, to be
the foundation-principle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.
<hi>verse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Your fourth Argument is this.
Because this laying on of hands
(to wit) upon officers, onely remains
in force; the other two not capable
to be practised, nor have been for
many hundred of years.</p>
            <p>1. Whereas you say, this laying
on of hands, (to wit, upon officers)
only remains to be practised:</p>
            <p>To which I answer, you are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mistaken; For, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
manifest, laying on of hands
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34067:88"/>
upon believers as such, being an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Christ, is still in force for
their obedience, and therefore capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be practised.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas you say, that this
laying on of hands upon believers as
such, hath not been capable of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
for many hundred of years;</p>
            <p>I Answer, it is very true; but let's
consider what's the Reason that this
Ordinance of Christ was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be practised, is not the same
why other Ordinances of Christ
were uncapable of practise; was it
not because of that confusion, or
Mystery of Iniquity, that hath long
reigned, and doth to this day?</p>
            <p>3. I answer, if the promise of
God, which is the end of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
(to wit, laying on of hands
upon believers as such,) be now
made good upon his people, then
they are capable of this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>But the promise of God is still
made good unto his people, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34067:88"/>
38. it being made unto them: for
Christ is the same Yesterday, to day,
and for ever; and his Word, yea and
Amen. Likewise this Ordinance
was the way or means through
which God made good his promise,
as is plainly seen, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. &amp; 19. 6.</p>
            <p>Therefore I conclude, they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of this Ordinance: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neither doth this Argument of
yours, serve the purpose you bring
it to.</p>
            <p>5. Your fifth Argument; because
this laying on of hands (to wit, upon
officers) concerns the whole Church,
which is necessary a principle
should do; but the other do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the whole, as I have shewed.</p>
            <p>To which I answer,</p>
            <p>1. That there are many things
that do concern the whole Church
of Christ, which are no principles
of the foundation; as for Instance,
breaking of Bread, with many other
duties, (which may be minded)
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34067:89"/>
doth concern the whole, and yet no
principle of the foundation; and
therefore this considered, your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is void.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas you say, it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the whole body as a principle:</p>
            <p>But I pray, how doth your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
make it to appear, that it is
one of the principles, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>vers.</hi>
which if your Argument were good,
it should do.</p>
            <p>I do grant, that laying on of hands
upon officers, doth concern the
whole body, (and that thus) God
having appointed this way and order
in his house, for setting persons apart
for office. Now this way and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Church of Christ ought to
maintain; and this doth concern
them as well as a principle of the
foundation doth concerne them,
which yet is not the principle, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 2. and therefore you are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
for I have already shewed
you, how laying on of hands upon
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34067:89"/>
believers as such, doth concern the
whole body, yea every particular
member thereof, as the principle,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. and that as they are Babes
in Christ: which the other in this
sence doth not; but to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
who are strong men, as is before
minded, though of concernment to
the whole.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas you say, you have
shewed how the other doth not
concern the whole, you may by
what I have said, plainly see your
mistake, (which I wish the Lord may
shew unto you,) for laying on of
hands upon believers, as such, doth
concern the whole body, not only as
a principle, but as the principle, as
is before discovered.</p>
            <p>But you have a seeming Reason to
prove your Argument, which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
every member is bound to live
under the Government of the
Church, and to be obedient to their
officers, to whom the rule and care
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34067:90"/>
of the whole Church is committed;
and therefore this must be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I answer, granting
your proposition, yet denying your
conclusion: because it's every ones
duty to maintain communion with
the Church in breaking of Bread,
doth it therfore follow that breaking
of Bread is a foundation-principle?</p>
            <p>Thus you may see the weakness of
your Reasons, which you bring to
prove laying on of hands upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to office, to be the foundation-principle,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>As for your Phrase, of laying on
of hands upon persons to office, that
it holds forth the Government of the
Church: I shall not at this time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the debate thereof; though I do
Judge there is some exception in it,
as it's laid down by you.</p>
            <p>But you further say, to inforce
what you have spoken, that this is
the very order of the principles,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34067:90"/>
as they are laid down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>I Answer, that here again you are
mistaken: for laying on of hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
persons to office, is no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-principle,
as I have already
proved.</p>
            <p>And therefore what the principle
is we contend for, which is indeed
that in order there laid down; I shall
further clear unto you by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>That which was administred next
in order after Baptisme, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-principle.
But laying on of
hands upon believers Baptized, as
such, was administred next in order
after Baptisme; and therefore the
foundation-principle, as it is laid
down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>1. That it was administred next
in order after Baptisme, is very plain
from <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. and 19. 6. Where
when they were Baptized, they had
hands laid upon them: and in this
very order it is laid down, in <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:34067:91"/>
2. That this laying on of hands
was upon believers Baptized as such,
is likewise plain from those places of
Scripture; and therefore this laying
on of hands must be there meant,
the foundation-principle, in <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 2.</p>
            <p>And so in the next place, I say
with you, that Baptisme and laying
on of hands is necessary to a right
and orderly Church-constitution:
but whereas you say, Baptisme was
to admit believers into the Church,
(if you mean so as to joyn them
members of the body, then) I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it: for their addition to the
Church, followed after their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
as I have fully proved in my
book, ( in Answer to an Objection,
following my second Reason given
for the proof of this truth,) from
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Whereas you say, that this
is the Judgement of most Modern
and later VVriters upon this Text,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34067:91"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. for which you instance
Doctor <hi>Gouge, Wilson, Trap,</hi> and <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I fear you being so much
learned in these mens Judgements,
makes you the less knowing, in the
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>2. Had you had sufficient Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
for what you said from the
Scripture, as in your Reasons you
pretend to have, then what need you
instance these mens Judgements;
unless you did think, (as I think
you do not,) that what they spake
were Oracles? and therefore,</p>
            <p>3. Doth not this discover; in some
measure, the weakness of your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or arguments before minded,
for what in this Chapter you have
affirmed? Surely, by this your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
were not good, that you
must run to these mens Judgements;
and I wonder, (you having recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this Testimony for your Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in your third Chapter,) you
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34067:92"/>
were not ashamed (in your fourth
Chapter,) to declare, that our best
argument for this practise, is the
Common Prayer book, if the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men should end this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie:
unless you do Judge these
men you bring, did not love the
Common Prayer book, or there
were not amongst those that did love
it, men partakers of as much wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as these you instance.</p>
            <p>Now what would you say, if I
should now instance, that laying on
of hands according to the sence I
have minded, was the Judgements
of as good men, according to the test,
(although it was by them wrongly
applyed,) as those you do bring:
will you say, that this is therefore
true? I do think you would not,
otherwise you would not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced
the Common Prayer book:
well, though this may be done, yet
I must tell you, that we have a more
sure word of Prophesie, and this is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34067:92"/>
that I do desire to stand unto, and to
be tried by, and not by mens Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and therefore now do refer
what I have spoken, to be tryed by
the Scriptures; and the Lord hasten
a clear discovery of his truth, in what
I have now written, and make you
sensible wherein you have wrested
the good Word of the Lord, from
the proper and true meaning thereof:
and so I shall proceed to your fourth
and last Chapter.</p>
            <p>Your 4. Chapter, which doth
contain, according to your mistaken
Judgement, that the laying on of
hands, practised by some in these our
dayes, on all Baptized believers,
was never instituted, commanded, or
practised, by Christ or his Apostles,
in all the New Testament.</p>
            <p>And herein, say you, doth lie the
stress of this controversie; which
doth occasion this your writing, to
undeceive and reduce those who
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34067:93"/>
are under the vanity of this practise,
and to prevent others from owning
of, and submitting to such a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureless
thing as this is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, I hope the Reader
will well consider of what I have
written in Answer to your book, and
in the discovery I have made (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the measure of faith I
have received) in this book, of this
truth of Christ, before he do, (as
you too confidently have already
done) pass Judgement upon this
truth: the Lord give you to see it, and
to repent, lest God suffer you to go
on in labouring to turn poor Souls
aside from this truth, or right way
of the Lord, and so to deceive and
seduce those that are unstable, to the
belief of your lyes.</p>
            <p>2. I wish you may see the evil of
your Language (which this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contains little else in it,) which
you have vented forth against this
truth, and the maintainers thereof.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34067:93"/>
Oh! how little therein you have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
of grace, and how much the
vanity of your minde is discovered,
in seeking to possesse the hearts of
poor Souls, with that which is not:
and therefore I may truly say (in stead
of what you speak of us,) that
you speak evill of the things you
know not, and call that a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-principle,
which by your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
you prove not; Neither have
you the least word or warrant for it,
in all the New Testament.</p>
            <p>But now to make good your asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the ground of your
4. Chapter, you have framed this
Syllogisme.</p>
            <p>That which hath not one word of
institution, or command for it, in
all the New Testament, is no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Christ; but will-worship
and Superstition.</p>
            <p>But this laying on of hands on all
Baptized believers, hath not one
word of institution, or command for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34067:94"/>
it, in all the New Testament; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
no Ordinance of Christ, but
will-worship and superstition.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, that practise
which hath not one word of institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or command for it, in all the
New Testament, (I do grant) is
will-worship and Superstition.</p>
            <p>But that laying on of hands upon
believers Baptized as such, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
institution or command from
Christ; this I do deny, the contrary
being already made to appear, both
in my answer to your book, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
before, in what I have written in
my Book: and therefore it is not
your saying of what we do aleage,
(wherein you minde Scriptures we
minde not in this particular case,)
that will prove there is not; Neither
your sence and interpretations you
put upon those Scriptures we do
aleage.</p>
            <p>I wish you would consider, how
you have wrested those Scriptures,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34067:94"/>
which have been minded for the
proof of this truth, (to wit, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands upon believers Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
as such) and so by your wiles,
if possible, the truth of God out of
our hands.</p>
            <p>I wonder you Answer not the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
layd down by some for the
proof of this (to wit, that we have
a command for laying on of hands)
as for instance:</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Chamberlain</hi> in his dispute
with Mr. <hi>Kiffin,</hi> in the 16. page of
his book, saith he, For a command,
we have it in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. For
whatsoever is a Doctrine of the
Apostles, is the Command of
Christ. But imposition of hands
is a Doctrine of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>The minor is granted by you, in
your first Assertion, where you say,
you grant it is a Doctrine or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
but not to be practised: and the
Text doth also number it up amongst
the Doctrines and principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:34067:95"/>
The Major is the very words of
the Text: <hi>Teachings them, to observe
all things, whatsoever I have Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you;</hi> unless (saith he) you will
deny that Doctrine is Teaching, or
that the Apostles taught what they
were not commanded, as some have
presumptuously affirmed.</p>
            <p>This argument was indeavoured,
(yet not in the least answered) by
Mr. <hi>Perry,</hi> as you may see in the
23 page of his Book of animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>2. You may also see Mr. <hi>Griffiths</hi>
Arguments, one of which I shall
name, why this is so.</p>
            <p>Because, saith he, the Apostles did
administer such a thing on dipped
believers as such, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. and
19. 6. Now saith he, either they did
administer it, upon the account of
Christs Requirement, command or
injunction, or upon an account of
their own.</p>
            <p>But it was not upon an account of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34067:95"/>
their own; therefore it was upon
the account of Christs Requirement,
command or injunction. This he
proves, as you may see in the sixth
page of his book in answer to Mr.
<hi>Harrison:</hi> this was never that I know
of answered by any of you; with
many more he layes down in his
book of the six principles.</p>
            <p>Surely, you could not be ignorant
of those Arguments; and therefore
how you could retain this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when it hath been by such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
refuted, and yet not take
notice of those Arguments, so as to
answer them, I know not.</p>
            <p>3. You may likewise see what Mr
<hi>Tillam</hi> writes, in the 10, 11, 12, 13.
and 14 page of his book, (it being
an answer to Mr. <hi>Paul Hobson,</hi> and to
this very Objection.)</p>
            <p>4. Amongst the rest, for further
witness herein, I shall refer you to
what I have written in answer to
this very Objection, laid down and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34067:96"/>
answered in my book, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the Lord may help you to
weigh and consider of, that the
truth of God may have place in your
hearts. For I must tell you, it will
be little comfort to you, if Christ
(as he suddenly will come,) shall
finde you opposing the reformation
of his house. And further, I desire
the Lord may keep you from this
temptation, (which too many are
subject to run into) to wit, Now
truth is displayed, presently to make
war therewith, indeavouring the
suppressing thereof.</p>
            <p>There being little in this fourth
Chapter, then this bare Syllogisme
more then frivolous discourse, with
reflections, and unsavoury and hard
speeches, which do discover the
bitterness of the minde from whence
they proceeded; I shall take as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
notice as I can, (with wisdome)
of them, and draw to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of my answer to your book;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34067:96"/>
only shall observe some few things.</p>
            <p>1. You labour to darken the
truth, and that with your slighting of
those things that have been written
in the vindication thereof, and those
Scriptures which have been affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by those that have written;
thereby seeking to possess the minds
of people with an understanding
from several Scriptures, as if they
were ours; but is indeed your own
imagination, that thereby you
might hinder the proceeding of this
truth amongst the people of God.</p>
            <p>And therefore I do affirm, that
what hath been affirmed (by any of
us,) from those Scriptures, doth
still stand good to what they were
intended; and are true witnesses in
this case for the proof of this truth.</p>
            <p>And when by those persons that
shall duly weight and consider the
matter you have written, with the
answer thereunto, (without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of Spirit, but with love towards
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34067:97"/>
God, to finde out his truth,) they
will easily see your errour herein,
and that in this matter we have not
(as your selves have done,) handled
the Word of God deceitfully, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
2. 17. and 4. 2.</p>
            <p>2. You say, that we say you are
Babes; taking that as matter of great
disdain; but how like Children you
do and have acted, I do believe will
be easily seen, by those who have
their eyes open.</p>
            <p>3. And whereas you say, we are
much at loss about the end of this
Ordinance, and so by this would
cast dust into the eyes of persons, to
blind them the more:</p>
            <p>I Answer, that if there be any
that doth affirm this or that, or a
third thing, to be the end of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance;
yet I hope you will grant
us the same liberty to come to the
knowledge of this truth, you your
selves take to attain the highth of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
against it: is there not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34067:97"/>
among your selves, in your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of us? what's the Reason, that
you affirm one thing, Mr. <hi>Kiffin</hi>
another, and Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> a third?
Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> he saith, it is laying on
of hands for healing is the principle,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. Mr. <hi>Kiffin,</hi> he saith,
(missing the end of that we practise)
that it was only dispensed for the
confirmation of the Gospel. I could
tell you, that others who do oppose
it, do say, Not the practise of laying
on of hands, is the foundation-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
but the effects of laying on of
hands; which is as false, and the
words unsound: and you after all,
affirm laying on of hands upon
persons to office, to be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-principle,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. (which
is not so) therefore consider, w<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
is more at loss then your selves.
Remember what is written, and take
good cognizance of your books you
have written against us, and the
truth: surely your opposition is much
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34067:98"/>
heighthened, by the bitterness of
your Spirit against us; because we
cannot deny this Word of the Lord
we are conscious of; Not, because
the Bishops did practise it, (as you
say we do;) but because we finde it
written, as that which Christ and
his Apostles taught, and that unto
which believers as such were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
            <p>What though some among
us, (though I know not of any)
should understand the Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gifts of the Holy Spirit to be the
end of this Ordinance, wherein they
should be deceived with your selves;
doth this make voyd the truth of
God? God forbid.</p>
            <p>We know, that the Extraordinary
gifts of the Holy Spirit, did follow
the Preaching of the VVord, and so
was a fruit of that Ordinance, as
well as laying on of hands; but the
proper end, of neither of them. Is
there no gifts of the Spirit of God,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34067:98"/>
which believers then did, and do
now receive according to the promise
of God, but such as are given in an
Extraordinary manner? Surely you
dare not say there is not.</p>
            <p>But I shall leave this, and take as
little notice as possible, of the frames
of your Spirits, which are as if you
were bent and resolved to fight
against truth, and to tread under,
and render odious, the maintainers
thereof.</p>
            <p>The ground whereof, I conceive
is; because we cannot communicate
with you, who reject and deny this
teaching of Christ, and bring your
own with the new-conceited opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Doctor <hi>Gouge</hi> and others in the
room thereof: and though you are
pleased to say, that our best Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the Common prayer book,
yet we would give you to know, that
we have a more sure VVord of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. our witness is in
the word of truth; and your Reasons,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34067:99"/>
with all the wisdome of those men
you minded, in this case, will be
found too light, being weighed in
the Balance of the truth, that laying
on of hands, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. is meant
upon persons to office.</p>
            <p>But wherefore are we branded
with the names of censoriousness,
Rigid, Hatred, and such Judgments;
as if we had (as you say) received the
Spirit of Satan, in stead of the Spirit
of God?</p>
            <p>1. Is it because some of us, as you
say, forbid you their houses? but I
pray you in your writing of this, did
you carefully observe and remember
the frames of your Spirit? whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
your carriage was towards your
Brethren, of whom you thus speak,
I know not; yet sure I am, in this
your writing, you go beyond your
bounds: but what is this Spirit
which is discovered to be in you, but
that old Maligne Spirit, that seeks
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34067:99"/>
the destruction of the truth and way
of God, who alwayes reaps up the
failings, (if there be any) in any
poor soul, thereby to dishonour, and
cast dirt upon the face of truth? or</p>
            <p>2. Is it, because as you say, we
deny you Communion? why consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is it not upon the same ground
that you your selves have denyed
others? and have not you dealt with
some poor souls, who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of this truth, and for truths
sake, in duty towards God, have been
obedient thereunto?</p>
            <p>Surely to withdraw from those,
who deny truth, and turn their
backs upon truth, is from a better
understanding, and is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the minde of God, then
to withdraw from poor souls, who
are followers of truth: The first
is ours, the second your practise;
the Lord he is Judge, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Judge between us, and make
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34067:100"/>
his truth manifest: for it is time
for thee Lord to work, when men

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> would have thee take notice, that
whereas I have made mention of the
names of some particular persons in
my book; It is not from any Spirit of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
that I have toward them; for the
Lord he knows they are men I do love and
esteem: but my mentioning of them was for
this end, that believers might see the
weakness of their Objections, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that is in their understandings about
this truth of laying on of hands upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
Baptized as such: that so indeed
the great Mountains that are raised up
in the wayes of poor souls in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

be removed; and therefore I hope, there

I have minded; neither that others should
have ever the less esteem of them; but that
indeed so far as they follow truth, they
should be esteemed for the sake thereof:
and therefore I do desire that Satan may
have no advantage, by any thing I have
written; for I have indeavoured both in
my book and in my Answering of these
four Chapters, to write without reflecting
Language, which as I know it would not
profit my self nor the truth; So likewise
would but raise up the Spirits of those,
who are opposers thereof: and therefore
now, that God may give thee a Spirit of
Wisedome, that thou maist know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what is written, is the Prayer of
him, who is willing to serve thee, wherein
he may be instrumental for thy good: and
