            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Although they be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Artes or craftes, euerye one hath his finall intencion.</p>
               <p>¶ Example, Phiſike intendeth helth, &amp; knighthod victory, ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:4637:4"/>
worke intendeth ſailynge: Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance of houſolde intendeth to haue riches. There be Artes generall and artes alſo that bee ſpeciall. ¶ Example, The ſci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence of knighthode is generall vnder the whiche ben conteined other artes particulars, as Sa delars, Armorers, &amp; other craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes which may be nedeful in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and theſe vniuerſal be more worthy &amp; more noble than bene the particulars, becauſe, the particulars bee for the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalles, as thynges whyche bee made by nature, and beene an vtter and fynall vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge, vnto the whiche bene or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned al the operacion of theſe craftes. As a man that ſhoteth at his pricke for his marke: So euery craft hath his final intent
<pb facs="tcp:4637:4"/>
whiche doth ſet forth the worke. Then the art <hi>Ciuil</hi> that teacheth to rule Cities is principall and ſoueraine of all other artes, for vnder her ben conteined diuerſe artes. <hi>Rethorique</hi> is alſo righte noble, for why? ſhe dothe diſpoſe and ſet in order al the other that bee conteined vnder her: The fulneſſe whereof and end, is the fulnes and inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al the other. Than the wealth that foloweth hir ſcience is the welth of man, Becauſe, it doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrain from enyls. The ryghte doctryne is that a man procede therein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge as his nature maye ſuſtayne.</p>
               <p>¶ Example, He that teacheth Geometry, ought to procede by ſtrong argumentes, which bene named demonſtracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: &amp; he that
<pb facs="tcp:4637:5"/>
teacheth Rethorique oughte to procede by argumentes ſembla bles or very like. And this is for to witte, that euery artificer ſhoulde iudge well and ſaye the truthe of that whiche appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to his craft. The ſcience of rulyng of cities belongeth not to chyldren, nor to men that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth theyr owne wylles: For they be not wyſe in two ſortes, neither in age nor in manners, yet ſomtyme olde of tyme and young in maners, and childe of tyme and olde in maners, then to ſuche is conuenient to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of cities whyche be no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of maners nor folowers of their owne willes.</p>
               <p>¶ There be thynges whiche be manifeſt vnto nature, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that be manifeſte vnto vs,

               <p>¶ Example, the nature of the Stone is to goo down warde, and cannot be caſte ſo hygh but that it preaſeth downe agayne. The nature of the Fyer is to gooe vp: and can not bee dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo farre downe but that

we ſee that in theſe thynges of nature: the power goeth before the acte, and in thynges moral, all contrary, for the acte and the worke goeth before the power.</p>
               <p>¶ Example, A man hathe the vertue that is called Juſtice be cauſe he hathe dooen ofttymes the workes of Juſtice: Alſo the vertue of Chaſtitie: for that he hath diuerſe times wrought the workes of Chaſtitie. And ſo it is of Artificers, a man is called a Carpenter becauſe he hathe wrought lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in that art &amp; craft: Art wil not be had without lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g tyme beſtowed therin.

               <p>¶ Example, labour temperate is helth to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and if it be little it corrupteth, to much or to litel corrupteth, &amp; to kepe the meane conſerueth. ¶ Example, feare &amp; folyſhe hardineſſe corrupteth the valiantnes of man, for whi? the fearefull fleeth from euerye thyng. And the hardye aſſaileth euery thyng, beleuing in hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfe to bring it to paſſe: nother in the one nor in the other there is no doutineſſe, for prudence is in keping the meane betwene fear and folyſhe hardynes.

therefore ſuche woorkes haue praiſe and diſpraiſe. A man ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte rather to die, then to doc ſo fyithy a thing, as to kyll father or mother, or to do any ſuch like thynges.

               <p>¶ The Phyſicyan counſaileth vpon the lyfe of the ſycke, and counſayleth howe he maye he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale hym.

But the ſicke man doth al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye, for he iudgeth bitter to bee

ſwete, &amp; the ſwete bytter, and ſo vnto an euel man that which is good ſeemeth euell, and that is euyll good, and this is becauſe the euel man taketh not delight to be good, but that he delyteth to be euell: and there be manye ſicke of this naughty ſyckenes, becauſe the woorkes good and euell be in their iugeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Then it is in vs to do wel, &amp; alſo it is in vs to do euel, and ſomtymes it is by the workes of man as it is with chyldren, put the caſe that ſome be naught, the father thynketh hym good. And that good and euel is in vs, it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>areth by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that made the law, whiche ſcourgeth theim that do euell with dyuerie paynes, and geueth honoure to theym that do well. The lawes put men in
<pb facs="tcp:4637:25"/>
comforte to dooe wel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayne them from euell, and no man comforteth another to doo that thynge that is not in his power.

And it is to be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there is doble ignorance, one is this of the which a man is notcauſe, as the ignoraunce of the foole, and for thys a manne is not to bepuniſhed, another ignorance whereof a man is cauſe, as the ignoraunce of a dronken man,
<pb facs="tcp:4637:25"/>
And for that a man ought to be puniſhed, for euery manne that paſſeth the commaundementes of reaſon and of the lawe, ought to bee puniſhed, and euery man that is iuſte, or euill, is ſuche, becauſe he will bee ſuche. But when a man is made iuſte or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euill, he is not become iuſt, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would become iuſt: As it happeneth to a man that was wonte to bee whole and is ſicke and is not healed bycauſe he had no will that he would not belefe the Phiſicion, nor vſe the thynges that conſerueth health And ſuch like is he that caſteth a ſtone, that before he caſteth it, it is in his power to holde it: But when he hath caſte it, it is not in his power to holde it nor in his will. And ſo it is in a man
<pb facs="tcp:4637:26"/>
that becometh euil: in the begin nyng it is in his power to bee come good.</p>
               <p>
                  <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Malice is not onely in man by will: But more ouer it is in the body. As a man to bee blind andlame: and theſe euils maie be in two ſortes, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> one is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as he that is borne blind &amp; lame, the other maie come by a mannes owne foly. As by them that drinke theimſelfes blynde, or fall to ſtealyng or other euill dedees. Of ſuche there is no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bee taken excepte thei re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente and amende theim ſelfes. Then euery manne is the cauſe of his owne imaginacion, for that a manne hath naturall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng to knowe good and euill. Then ought wee to will to dooe well and to flie from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.
<pb facs="tcp:4637:26"/>
And it is the beſte thyng, and not impoſſible to take a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and doctrine in goodnes, and he that taketh it at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng and continueth, ſuche a man hath a good nature and perfight. And who that taketh the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary hath an euil nature But although it be euil he may make it good if he wil: For it is in him to take what he wil, then vertue and vice is according to the will of manne. But marke this, that operacion and habite bee not accordyng to the will of man in one ſorte but in diuerſe. For why? The operacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s from the beginnyng to the ende is in the power and will of manne.

And that whyche the one canne not dooe, the other dothe, and ſo they fulfyll theyr buſyneſſe: The chyldren be bondes whiche bynde the womanne to the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande in loue, becauſe the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren bee the common wealth of them bothe.</p>

By a prouerbe it is ſaied Frendes haue one life and one bloud, and all their thynges be bee equally comen: as the noſe to the face, the knee to the legge and the fynger to the hande. A manne ought to loue his frend, for in louing him he loueth him ſelf, and ſhould not be loued for honor or corporall delectacion, but rather for the very loue of

And the manne that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his frend in this ſorte, is a very frende, he helpeth and ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porteth with body and goodes, and with his life if nede be. The full felicitee of mankynde is in the obteignyng of frendes, for no man would haue al the goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the worlde to liue alone.

<pb facs="tcp:4637:77"/>
but rather Acte, to the whiche a man intendeth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men by him ſelf or by other. Beatitude is a thing out of it ſelf, the man that hath not taſted the ſweteneſſe of Beatitude in the whiche is the delight of the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng of man: hath his refuge to the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the body, in the whiche he hath put his truſte. And thei be not of a truth to be called de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectacions. Beatitude is not to bee choſen by boyes, but verely in this that ſemeth to be delecta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be good men. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite is not in ſporte and plaic, but rather in thynges had by la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bor and ſtudy. It is a manifeſt thyng of bleſſednes, when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laboreth with vertue in ordinat thynges &amp; in thynges of ſolace. And therfore it is ſaied: that the

And a more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerous delectacion is this, that a man hath whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he knoweth the thyng, then when he thinketh to knowe. Then the operacion of
