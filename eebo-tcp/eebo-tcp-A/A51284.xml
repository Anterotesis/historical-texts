            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

knowledge I have of your singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Vertues,</hi> has emboldened,
or to speak more properly, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to make choice of none other then
yourself for a <hi>Patronesse</hi> of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Treatise. For besides that I do your
Ladiship that Right as also this present
Age and succeeding Posterity, as to be
a witnesse to the World of such emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Accomplishments &amp; transcendent
Worth; so I do not a little please my self,
while I find my self assured in my own
conceit that <hi>Cebes</hi> his mysterious &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Piece of <hi>Morality</hi> hung up in
the Temple of <hi>Saturne,</hi> which was done
in way of Divine Honour to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Deity, was not more safely
<pb facs="tcp:62817:3"/>
and suteably placed then this carefull
<hi>Draught</hi> of <hi>Natural Theology</hi> or
<hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> which I have dedicated
to so noble, so wise, and so pious a Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.
And for my own part it seems to
me as reall a point of <hi>Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
to honour the <hi>Vertuous</hi> as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Necessitous,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Christianity
terms no lesse then a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Nor is
there any thing here of Hyperbolisme
or high-flow'n Language, it being agreed
upon by all sides, by Prophets, Apostles,
and ancient Philosophers, that holy
and good Men are the <hi>Temples of the
Living God.</hi> And verily the Residence
of <hi>Divinity</hi> is so conspicuous in that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical
<hi>Pulchritude</hi> of your noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that <hi>Plato</hi> if he were alive again
might finde his timorous Supposition
brought into absolute Act, &amp; to the enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment
<pb facs="tcp:62817:3"/>
of his amazed Soul might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<hi>Vertue</hi> become <hi>visible</hi> to his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sight. And truly Madame, I must
confesse that so Divine a <hi>Constitution</hi>
as this, wants no <hi>Preservative,</hi> being
both devoid &amp; uncapable of <hi>Infection;</hi>
and that if the rest of the World had
attain'd but to the least Degree of this
sound <hi>Complexion</hi> &amp; generous frame
of <hi>Minde,</hi> nay if they were but brought
to an aequilibrious Indifferency, and, as
they say, stood but Neutralls, that is, If
as many as are supposed to have no love of
God, nor any knowledge or experience of
the Divine life, did not out of a base
ignorant fear irreconcilably hate him,
assuredly this <hi>Antidote</hi> of mine would
either prove needless and superfluous, or,
if Occasion ever called for it, a most
certain <hi>Cure.</hi> For this Truth of the
<pb facs="tcp:62817:4"/>
               <hi>Existence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> being as clearly
demonstrable as any Theorem in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,</hi>
it would not fail of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as firm and as universall Assent,
did not the fear of a sad After-clap
pervert mens Vnderstandings, and
Prejudice and Interest pretend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
&amp; obscurity in so plain a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But considering the state of things
as they are, I cannot but pronounce, that
there is more <hi>necessity</hi> of this my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote</hi>
then I could wish there were.
But if there were lesse or none at all, yet
the <hi>pleasure</hi> that may be reaped in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal
of this Treatise, (even by such as
by an holy Faith &amp; divine Sense are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
held fast in a full assent to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
I drive at) will sufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate
the pains in the penning therof.
For as the best Eyes &amp; most able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb facs="tcp:62817:4"/>
the pure Light do not unwillingly
turn their backs of the Sun to view his
refracted Beauty in the delightfull co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of the Rainbow; so the perfectest
<hi>Minds</hi> &amp; the most lively possest of the
Divine Image, cannot but take content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; pleasure in observing the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Wisdome</hi> &amp; <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>God</hi> so
fairly drawn out and skilfully variega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the sundry Objects of externall
Nature. Which <hi>delight</hi> though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to all, yet not so much to any as to
those that are of a more Philosophicall
&amp; Contemplative constitution; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Madame, most of all to <hi>Yourself,</hi>
whose <hi>Genius</hi> I know to be so specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
&amp; <hi>Wit</hi> so penetrant, that in the
knowledge of things as well Natural as
Divine you have not onely out gone all of

can never be highly enough com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
that makes the best use that may
be of those ample <hi>Fortunes</hi> that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence has bestow'd upon you.
For the best result of <hi>Riches,</hi> I mean in
reference to ourselves, is, that we finding
ourselves already well provided for, we
may be fully Masters of our own time:

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Theisme</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> though
they seeme so extreamely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
one to another, yet in many
things they do very nearly agree. For to
say nothing of their joynt conspiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the true knowledge of God and
Religion, they are commonly entertain'd,
though successively, in the same Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion.
For that temper that disposes a man
to listen to the Magisteriall dictates of an
over-bearing fancy, more then to the calm
and cautious insinuations of free Reason,
is a subject that by turns does very easily
lodge and give harbour to these mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Guests.</p>
            <p>For as dreams are the fancies of those
that sleep, so fancies are but the dreams of
men awake. And these fancies by day, as
those dreams by night, will vary and
change with the weather &amp; present Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the body. So that those that have
<pb facs="tcp:62817:6"/>
onely a fiery Enthusiastick acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God; change of diet, feculent old
Age, or some present dampes of <hi>Melancholy</hi>
will as confidently represent to their fancy
that there is no God, as ever it was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
that there is one; and then having
lost the use of their more noble faculties
of Reason and Understanding, they must
according to the course of Nature, bee as
bold <hi>Atheists</hi> now, as they were before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<hi>Enthusiasts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do these two unruly Guests only
serve themselves by turns on the same
party, but also send mutuall supplies one
to another; being lodg'd in severall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
For the <hi>Atheist</hi>'s pretence to wit and
natural reason (though the foulenesse of
his mind makes him fumble very doting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the use thereof) makes the <hi>Enthusiast</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cure that reason is no Guide to God. And
the <hi>Enthusiast</hi>'s boldy dictating the carelesse
ravings of his own tumultuous fancy for
undeniable principles of divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
confirms the <hi>Atheists</hi> that the whole
<pb facs="tcp:62817:6"/>
buisinesse of religion &amp; notion of a God,
is nothing but a troublesome fit of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious
<hi>Melancholy.</hi> Therefore, I thought
I should not be wanting to Religion and
to the Publique, if I attempted, some way,
to make this fansifull <hi>Theosophy</hi> or <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magy,</hi>
as it is very ridiculous in it self, so
also to appeare to the world, and if it were
possible, to the very favourers of it; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the most effectuall means in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to remove this dangerous evill out
of the minds of men, and to keep it off
from theirs that are as yet untainted.</p>
            <p>And this I indeavoured in those two
late <hi>Pamphlets</hi> I wrote, namely my <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and my <hi>Reply.</hi> In both which I put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my self upon the merry pin (as you
see it was necessary so to do) and being
finely warm'd with Anger and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the mischief I had in designe
to remove, if I may seem after the manner
of men to have transgressed in any nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
yet the ingenuous cannot but be very
favourable in their censure, it being very
<pb facs="tcp:62817:7"/>
hard to come off so clearly well, in the
acting of so humorous a part; there scarce
being any certaine Judge of humours, but
the humour of every man that judges.</p>
            <p>And I am very well aware that some
passages cannot but seem harsh to sad and
weakly Spirits, as sick men love no noise
nor din, and take offence at but the smell
of such meats, as are the most pleasant and
strengthening nourishment of those that
are well. But as for my selfe I can truly
pronounce that what I did, I did in reason
&amp; judgment, not at all offending that Life
that dwelleth in mee. For there was that
<hi>Tonicall</hi> exertion, and steady <hi>Tension</hi> of my
Spirits, that every chord went off with a
cleare and smart sound, as in a well-tuned
Instrument set at a high Pitch, and was
good <hi>Musick</hi> to my self that throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the meaning of it. And my agile
and swift Motion from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even of those that were of very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
natures, was no harsh harmony at all
to mee, I having the art to stop the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:62817:7"/>
of the last stroke, as a skilfull <hi>Harper</hi>
on his <hi>Irish Harpe,</hi> and so to render the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
chord cleane, without the mixing
or interfaring of any tremulous murmurs,
from the strings that were touch'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
before.</p>
            <p>And I did the more willingly indulge
to my self this freedome and mirth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the <hi>Libertines</hi> whom I was severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sharply to reprove, and so made my
self as freely merry as I might, and not
desert the realities of Sobernesse, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might know, that no <hi>Superstitious
Sneaksby,</hi> or <hi>moped Legallist</hi> (as they would
be ready to fancy every body that bore no
resemblance at all with themselves) did
rebuke them or speak to them, but one
that had in some measure attain'd to the
truth of that Liberty, that they were in a
false sent after. Thus was I content to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Spectacle to the world, in any way
or disguise whatsoever, that I might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
possibly by any means gain some souls
out of this dirty and dizzy whirle-poole of
<pb facs="tcp:62817:8"/>
the Flesh, into the Rest and Peace of God;
and to seem a fool my self to provoke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to become truly and seriously wise.</p>
            <p>And as I thought to winne upon the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine</hi>
by my mirth and freenesse, so I
thought to gain ground upon the <hi>Enthusiast,</hi>
by suffering my self to be carried into such
high Triumphs and Exaltations of Spirit
as I did. In all which (though the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
cannot distinguish betwixt vain-glory
and Divine joy or Christian gloriation)
I do really nothing but highly magni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
the simplicity of the life of Christ above
all Magick, Miracles, Power of Nature,
Opinions, Prophecies, and what ever else
humane nature is so giddily and furiously
carried after, even to the neglecting of that
which is the sublimest pitch of happinesse
that the soul of man can arrive to.</p>
            <p>Wherefore many of those expressions
in my <hi>Reply</hi> that seem so turgent are to be
interpreted with allusion to what this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
life does deservedly triumph over,
and particularly what <hi>Magicians</hi> boast they
<pb facs="tcp:62817:8"/>
can do: As in that passage which seems
most enormous <hi>pag. 49<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I still the raging of
the Sea</hi> &amp;c. Which is the very same that
<hi>Medea</hi> vaunts of in <hi>Ovid,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Concussaque sisto,</l>
                  <l>Stantia concutio cantu freta, nubila pello.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And for the rest that has falne from me
in those free heats, I'me sure there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Expression nor Meaning that I cannot
not only make good by reason, but war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and countenance also by some thing
plainly parallell thereto, in Scripture, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
and Fathers, especially <hi>Origen,</hi>
whom I account more profoundly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and no lesse pious then any of them.</p>
            <p>But as I said the Drift and Scope of all
was, vigourously to witnesse to this buisy
and inquisitive Age, that the Simplicity of
the life of Christ, though it bee run over
by most and taken no notice of, that is,
that perfect Humility and divine Love,
whence is a free command over a mans
passions and a warrantable Guidance of
<pb facs="tcp:62817:9"/>
them, with all Serenity, becoming Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and Equity; that these are above all
the glory of the World, curiosity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and all power of Nature whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>And if the sense of this so plaine a truth
with all it's power and lovelinesse did so
vehemently possesse my soul, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for the present some sensible mutations
and tumults in my very <hi>Animall</hi> Spirits
and my body, the matter being of so great
Importance, it was but an obvious piece
of prudence to record those Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that professing my self so very much
moved, others might be the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
moved thereby; according to that
of the Poet
<q>
                  <l>—si vis me flere, dolendum est</l>
                  <l>Primùm ipsi tibi.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And I am no more to be esteemed an
<hi>Enthusiast</hi> for such passages as these, then
those wise and circumspect Philosophers,
<hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Plotinus,</hi> who upon the more
then ordinary sensible visits of the divine
<pb facs="tcp:62817:9"/>
Love and Beauty descending into their
enravish'd soules, professe themselves no
lesse moved, then what the sense of such
expressions as these will bear, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And to such <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> as is but the
Triumph of the soul of man, inebriated as
it were, with the delicious sense of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
life, that blessed Root, and Original of
all holy wisdome &amp; virtue, I am as much a
friend, as I am to the vulgar fanaticall
<hi>Enthusiasme</hi> a professed enemie. And eternal
shame stop his mouth, that will dare to
deny, but that the fervent love of God and
of the pulchritude of Vertue will afford the
spirit of man more joy and triumph, then
ever was tasted in any lustfull pleasure,
which the pen of unclean Wits do so
highly magnify both in verse and prose.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought fit to premise
concerning my two late Pamphlets, which
I have done in way of Civility to the
world, to whom I hold my selfe accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
especially for any publique Actions,
<pb facs="tcp:62817:10"/>
who now I hope will not deem those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Motions of mine so strange and
uncouth, they so plainly perceiving what
Musick they were measured to.</p>
            <p>But as for this present Discourse against
<hi>Atheisme,</hi> as there is no humour at all in it,
so I hope there is lesse hazzard of Censure.
For here is nothing to give offence, unlesse
we be so weak-sighted, that the pure light
of Reason &amp; Nature will offend us. Here's
no lavish Mirth, no Satyricall Sharpenesse,
no Writhing or Distorting the genuine
frame &amp; composure of mine own mind,
to set out the deformity of anothers, no
Rapture, no Poetry, no Enthusiasme, no
more then there is in <hi>Euclid's Elements,</hi> or <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
his <hi>Aphorismes.</hi> But though I have
been so bold as to recite what there is not
in this present Discourse, yet I had rather
leave it to the Quick-sightednesse of the
Reader to spie out what there is, then be
put upon so much Immodesty my self, as
to speak any thing that may seem to give
it any precellency above what is already
<pb facs="tcp:62817:10"/>
extant in the world about the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Onely I may say thus much, that I did
on purpose abstaine from reading any
Treatises concerning this subject, that I
might the more undisturbedly write the
easy <hi>Emanations</hi> of mine own mind, and
not be carried off from what should natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
fall from my self, by prepossessing
my thoughts by the inventions of others.</p>
            <p>I have writ therefore after no Copy but
the Eternall Characters of the mind of
man, and the known <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And all men consulting with these
that indeavour to write sense, though it
be not done alike by all men, it could not
happen but I should touch upon the same
heads that others have, that have wrote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who though they merit very
high commendation for their learned at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivements,
yet I hope my indeavours
have been such, that though they may not
deserve to be corrivalls or partners in their
praise and credit, yet I doe not distrust but
they may do their share towards that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb facs="tcp:62817:11"/>
good, that such performances u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
pretend to aime at.</p>
            <p>For that which did embolden me to
publish this present Treatise, was not, as
I said before, because I flatte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d my self in a
Conceit that it was better or more plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then what is already in the hands of
men: but that it was of a different sort, and
has it's peculiar serviceablenesse and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
apart and distinct from others;
whose proper preeminences it may aloofe
off admire, but dare not in any wise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with. So that there is no Tau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ology
committed in recommending what I have
written to the publique view, nor any les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening
the labours of others by thus offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fruit of mine own. For considering
there are such severall Complexions and
Tempers of men in the world, I do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
but that as what others have done,
has been very acceptable and profitable
to many, so this of mine may be well rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
of some or other, and so seem not to
have been writ in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62817:11"/>
For though I cannot promise my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that I shall entertaine him with so
much winning <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and pleasant <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lology,</hi>
as hee may find else where, yet I
hope hee will acknowledge, if his mind
be unpreiudic'd, that he meets with sound
and plain Reason, and an easy and cleare
<hi>Method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though I cannot furnish him with
that copious variety of Arguments that
others have done, yet the frugall careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and safenesse of choise that I have
made in them, may compensate their pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p>For I appeale to any man, whether the
proposall of such as will easily admit of
Evasions (though they have this peculiar
advantage that they make for greater
pompe and at first sight seem more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
for their multitude) does not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
the <hi>Atheist</hi> and make him fancy,
that because he can so easily turn the edge
of these, that the rest have no more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
then the former; but that if hee
<pb facs="tcp:62817:12"/>
thought good, and had leisure, hee could
with like facility enervate them all.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I have endeavoured to insist
upon such alone, as are not onely true in
themselves, but are unavoidable to my
Adversary, unlesse he will cast down his
shield, forsake the free use of the naturall
facultyes of his mind, and professe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a mere puzzled <hi>Sceptick.</hi> But if he
will with us but admit of this one <hi>Postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
or <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that <hi>Our Faculties are true,</hi>
though I have spoke modestly in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
it self, yet I think I may here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vanity or boasting, freely professe that
I have no lesse then demonstrated that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here is a God. And by how much more
any man shall seriously indeavour to resist
the strength of my Arguments, by so much
the more strong he shall find them; as he
that presses his weak finger against a wall
of Marble; and that they can appear
slight to none but those that carelessly and
slightly consider them. For I borrowed
them not from books, but fetch't them
<pb facs="tcp:62817:12"/>
from the very nature of the thing it
self and indelible <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Soul of
Man.</p>
            <p>And I found that keeping my self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
so narrow compasse as not to affect any
reasonings but such as had very clear affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and close connexion with the subject
in hand, that I naturally hit upon what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was materiall to my purpose, and so
contenting my self with my own, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
nothing from the great store and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of others. And what I might easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
of others, I could not let passe if
in my own Judgement it was obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
to evasion. For I intended not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon the Atheist, but really to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him. And therefore <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> whose
Mechanicall wit I can never highly enough
admire, might bee no Master of <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks</hi>
to mee. Whence it is that I make use
but of his first Argument only, if I may
not rather call it the Schooles or mine own.
For I thinke I have mannag'd it in such
sort and every way so propp'd it and
<pb facs="tcp:62817:13"/>
strengthened it, that I may challenge in it
as much interest as any.</p>
            <p>But as for his following reasons, that
suppose the <hi>Objective Reality</hi> of the <hi>Idea</hi> of
God does exceed the efficiency of the mind
of man, and that the mind of man, were
it not from another, would have conferr'd
all that perfection upon it self, that it has
the <hi>Idea</hi> of, &amp; lastly, that it having no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to conserve it self, and the present and
future time having no dependance one of
another, that it is continually reproduc'd,
that is conserv'd by some higher cause,
which must be God; these grounds, I say,
being so easily evaded by the <hi>Atheist,</hi> I durst
not trust to them, unlesse I had the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
wit to defend them, who was
handsomely able to make good any thing.
But they seem to me to be liable to such
evasions as I can give no stop to.</p>
            <p>For the mind of man, as the <hi>Atheist</hi> will
readily reply, may be able of her self
to frame such an actuall <hi>Idea</hi> of God, as is
there disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed of, which <hi>Idea</hi> will be but
<pb facs="tcp:62817:13"/>
the present modification of her, as other
notions are, and an effect of her essence,
and power, and that power a radicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of her essence. So that there is no
excesse of an effect above the efficiency
of the cause, though wee look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the mind it self, for she frames
this notion of God as naturally and as
much without the help of an higher
Cause, as she does any thing else whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>And as for the mind's contributing
those perfections on her self, shee has an
<hi>Idea</hi> of; if shee had been of her self, the
<hi>Atheist</hi> will say, it implyes a contradiction,
and supposes that a thing before it exists,
may consult about the advantages of its
own existence. But if the mind be of it
self, it is what it finds it self to be, and can
be no otherwise.</p>
            <p>And therefore lastly if the mind find it
self to exist, it can no more destroy it self,
then produce it self, nor needs any thing
to continue its being, provided that there
<pb facs="tcp:62817:14"/>
be nothing in Nature that can act against
it and destroy it; for what ever is, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
so to be, unlesse there be some cause
to change it.</p>
            <p>So likewise from those Arguments I
fetch'd from externall Nature, as well as in
these from the innate propertyes of the
mind of man, my careful choise made very
large defalcations, insisting rather upon
such things as might be otherwise, and yet
are farre better as they are, then upon such
as were necessary and could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
As for example; When I consider'd
the distance of the Sun, I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that his not being plac'd so low as
the Moone, or so high as the fixed Starres,
was any great argument of Providence,
because it might be reply'd that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it should be betwixt those two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
else the Earth had not been habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
&amp; so mankind might have waited for
a being, till the agitation of the Matter had
wrought things into a more tolerable fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or posture for their production.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62817:14"/>
Nor simply is the Motion of the Sun
or rather of the Earth, any argument of
divine Providence, but as necessary as a
piece of wood's being carried down the
stream, or straws about a whirle-poole.
But the Laws of her Motion are such, that
they very manifestly convince us of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and therefore I was fain to let
goe the former, and insist more largely
upon the latter.</p>
            <p>Nor thought I it fit, to Rhetoricate in
proposing the great variety of things, and
praecellency one above another, but to presse
close upon the designe and subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one thing to another, shewing
that whereas the rude motions of the
matter a thousand to one might have
cast it otherwise, yet the productions
of things are such as our own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
cannot but approve to bee best, or
as wee our selves would have design'd
them.</p>
            <p>And so in the consideration of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls,
I do not so much urge my Reasons
<pb facs="tcp:62817:15"/>
from their diversity and subsistence,
(though the framing of matter into the
bare subsistence of an Animall is an effect
of no lesse cause then what has some skill
and counsell) But what I drive at, is the
exquisite contrivance of their parts, and
that their structure is farre more perfect,
then will meerly serve for their bare exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
and continuance in the world;
Which is an undenyable demonstration
that they are the effects of wisdome, not
the results of Fortune or fermented Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Lastly when I descend to the History
of things miraculous and above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
course of Nature, for the proving
that there are Spirits, that the Atheist there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
may the easier bee induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there is a God, I am so cautious and
circumspect, that I make use of no
Narrations that either the avarice of the
<hi>Priest,</hi> or the credulity and fansifullnesse
of the <hi>Melancholist</hi> may render suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62817:15"/>
Nor could I abstaine from that Subject,
it being so pat and pertinent unto my
purpose, though I am well aware how ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
a thing it seems to those I have
to deale with. But their confident igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
shall never dash mee out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
with my well-grounded know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
For I have been no carelesse Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
into these things, and from my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to this very day, have had more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to believe the Existence of God and
a Divine Providence, then is reasonable
for mee to make particular profession
of.</p>
            <p>In this History of things Miraculous
or Super-naturall, I might have recited
those notable Prodigies that happened, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the birth, in the life, and at the death
of <hi>Christ;</hi> As the star that led the Wise
men to the yong Infant; Voices from
heaven testifying <hi>Christ</hi> to bee the Sonne
of God; and lastly that miraculous Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipse
of the Sun, made, not by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Moon, for shee was then
<pb facs="tcp:62817:16"/>
opposite to him, but by the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ion
or totall Involution, if you will,
of those scummy spots that ever more
or lesse are spread upon his face, but
now over-flowed him with such thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and so universally, that day-light
was suddainly intercepted from the asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
eyes of the Inhabitants of the
Earth. To which direfull Symptomes
though the Sunne hath been in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
at severall times obnoxious, yet that
those latent Causes should so suddainly
step out and surprise him, and so enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
at the passion of the <hi>Messias,</hi> hee
whose mind is not more prodigiously
darkened then the Sun was then Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
cannot but at first sight acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it a speciall designement of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>But I did not insist upon any sacred
History, partly because it is so well and
so ordinarily known, that it seemed lesse
need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull; but mainly because I know
the <hi>Atheist</hi> will boggle more at whatever
<pb facs="tcp:62817:16"/>
is fetch'd from establish'd Religion, and
fly away from it, like a wild Colt in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
at the sight of a bridle or an halter,
snuffing up the Aire and smelling a Plot
afarre off, as hee foolishly fancies.</p>
            <p>But that hee might not be shy of mee,
I have conform'd my self as neer his
own <hi>Garbe</hi> as I might, without parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his folly or wickednesse, that
is, I appeare now in the plaine shape of
a meere <hi>Naturalist,</hi> that I might van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
<hi>Atheisme;</hi> as I did heretofore affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly
symbolize in carelesse Mirth and
freedome with the <hi>Libertines,</hi> to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<hi>Libertinisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For hee that will lend his hand to help
another fallen into a ditch, must him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
though not fall, yet stoop and incline
his body: And hee that converses with
a Barbarian, must discourse to him in his
own language: So hee that would
gaine upon the more weake and sunk
minds of sensuall mortalls, is to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
himself to their capacity, who

about in such men as have adhered to Religion in a meere
externall way, either for fashion sake, or in a blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

them to an assent to that, which seemes so much for

they will gladly in their conceipt cast down also the very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

For it is possible that <hi>Mathematicall evidence</hi>

our nature is necessarily and perpetually obnoxious unto,
and that either fatally or fortuitously there has been in the
world time out of mind such a Being as we call <hi>Man,</hi>
whose essential property it is to be then most of all mistaken,
when he conceives a thing most evidently true. And why

may not this be as well as any thing else, if you will have

such arguments, that the Reader shall acknowledge so
strong as he shall be forced to confesse that it is utterly
unpossible that it should be otherwise. But they shall be
such as shall deserve full assent and win full assent from any
unprejudic'd mind.</p>
               <p>For I conceive that we may give full assent to that which
notwithstanding may possibly be otherwise: which I shall
illustrate by severall examples. Suppose two men got to
the top of mount <hi>Athos,</hi> and there viewing a stone in the
form of an <hi>Altar</hi> with <hi>ashes</hi> on it, and the <hi>footsteps of men</hi>
on those ashes, or some <hi>words</hi> if you will, as <hi>Optimo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximo,</hi>
or, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or the like, written or scralled out
upon the Ashes; and one of them should cry out, Assuredly
here have been some men here that have done this: But
the other more nice then wise should reply, Nay it may
possibly by otherwise. For this stone may have naturally
grown into this very shape, and the seeming ashes may
be no ashes, that is no remainders of any fewell burnt there,
but some unexplicable and imperceptible Motions of the
Aire, or other particles of this fluid Matter that is active
every where, have wrought some parts of the Matter into
the form and nature of ashes, and have fridg'd and plaid
about so, that they have also figured those intelligible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
in the same. But would not any body deem it a
piece of weaknesse no lesse then dotage for the other man
one whit to recede from his former apprehension, but as
fully as ever to agree with what he pronounced first, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62817:19"/>
this bare possibility of being otherwise?</p>
               <p>So of <hi>Anchors</hi> that have been digged up, either in
plaine fields or mountainous places, as also the Roman
<hi>Vrnes</hi> with ashes and inscriptions, as <hi>Severianus, Ful: Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and the like, or Roman <hi>Coynes,</hi> with <hi>the effigies</hi>
and <hi>names</hi> of the <hi>Caesars</hi> on them; or that which is more
ordinary, the <hi>Sculls</hi> of men in every Church-yard,
with the right figure, and all those necessary perforations
for the passing of the vessells, besides those conspicuous hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
for the Eyes and rowes of teeth, the <hi>Os Styloeides,
Ethoeides,</hi> and what not? if a man will say of them, that
the Motion of the particles of the Matter, or some hidden
Spermatick power has gendred these both <hi>Anchors, Vrnes,
Coynes,</hi> and <hi>Sculls</hi> in the ground, hee doth but pronounce
that which humane reason must admitt as possible: Nor
can any man ever so demonstrate that those <hi>Coynes, Anchors,</hi>
and <hi>Vrnes,</hi> were once the Artifice of men, or that this or that
<hi>Scull</hi> was once a part of a living man, that hee shall force an
acknowledgment that it is impossible that it should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
But yet I doe not think that any man, without doing
manifest violence to his facultyes, can at all suspend his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but freely and fully agree that this or that Scull was
once part of a living man, and that these <hi>Anchors, Vrnes</hi>
and <hi>Coynes,</hi> were certainly once made by humane artifice,
notwithstanding the possibility of being otherwise.</p>
               <p>And what I have said of <hi>Assent</hi> is also true in <hi>Dissent.</hi> For
the mind of man not craz'd nor prejudic'd will fully and
unreconcileably disagree, by it's own natural fagacity, where
notwithstanding the thing that it doth thus resolvedly and
undoubtingly reject, no wit of man can prove impossible to
bee true. As if wee should make such a fiction as this, that
<hi>Archimedes</hi> with the same individuall body that hee had
when the Souldiers slew him, is now safely intent upon his
Geometricall figures under ground, at the Center of the
Earth, farre from the noise and din of this world that might
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62817:19"/>
disturb his Meditations, or distract him in his curious deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neations
he makes with his rod upon the dust; which no man
living can prove impossible: Yet if any man does not as
unreconcileably dissent from such a fable as this, as from
any falshood imagineable, assuredly that man is next doore
to madness or dotage, or does enormous violence to the free
use of his Facultyes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is manifest that there may bee a very firme
and unwavering assent or dissent, when as yet the thing wee
thus assent to may be possibly otherwise; or that which
wee thus dissent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which point I have thus long and thus variously sported
my self in, for making the better impression upon my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it being of no small use and consequence, as well for
the advertising of him, that the Arguments which I shall

for winning a firme and unshaken assent, as if they were in

should give a free and full assent to the Conclusion. And

distemper, prejudice, or weaknesse, then the Arguments of

some advantage from my free confession, that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that I shall use are not so convictive, but that they
leave a possibility of the thing being otherwise, let him but
compute his supposed gains by adding the limitation of this
possibility (<hi>viz.</hi> that it is no more possible, then that the

that the Roman <hi>Vrnes</hi> and <hi>Coins</hi> above mentioned may
prove to be the works of Nature, not the Artifice of man,
which our facultyes admit to be so little probable, that it is

               <p>ANd now having premised thus much, I shall come
on nearer to my present designe. In prosecution
whereof it will bee requisite for mee, first to define <hi>what
God is,</hi> before I proceed to demonstration <hi>that he is.</hi> For
it is obvious for Mans reason to find arguments for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of a thing, from the explication of the Essence
thereof.</p>
               <p>And now I am come hither, I demand of any <hi>Atheist</hi>
that denies there is a God, or of any that doubts whether
there be one or no, what <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Notion</hi> they frame of that
they deny or doubt of. If they will prove nice &amp; squeamish,
and professe they can frame no notion of any such thing, I
would gladly aske them, why they will then deny or doubt
of they know not what. For it is necessary that he that would
rationally doubt or deny a thing, should have some settled
<hi>Notion</hi> of the thing hee doubts of or denies. But if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that this is the very ground of their denying or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether there be a God, because they can frame no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him, I shall forthwith take away that Allegation by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62817:20"/>
offering them such a Notion as is as proper to God as any
Notion is proper to any thing else in the world.</p>
               <p>I define God therefore thus, <hi>An Essence or Being fully
and absolutely perfect.</hi> I say <hi>fully and absolutely perfect,</hi> in
counterdistinction to such perfection as is not full and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
but the perfection of this or that <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Kind</hi> of
finite <hi>Beings,</hi> suppose of a Lyon, Horse or Tree. But to be
fully and absolutely perfect is to bee at least as perfect as the
apprehension of a Man can conceive, without a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But what is inconceivable or contradictious is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to us, for wee are not now to wagg one Atome
beyond our facultyes. But what I have propounded is so
farre from being beyond our facultyes, that I dare appeale
to any <hi>Atheist</hi> that hath yet any command of Sense and
Reason left in him, if it bee not very easie and intelligible at
the first sight, and that if there bee a God, he is to be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of us, such as this <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Notion</hi> sets forth.</p>
               <p>But if hee will sullingly deny that this is the proper No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, let him enjoy his own humour; this yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
undenyable that there is in Man, an <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Being
absolutely and fully perfect,</hi> which wee frame out by attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
all conceivable perfection to it whatsoever, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
no Contradiction. And this Notion is Naturall and
Essentiall to the Soul of Man, and can not bee wash'd out,
nor conveigh'd away by any force or trick of wit what<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oever,
so long as the Mind of man is not craz'd, but hath the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
use of her own facultyes.</p>
               <p>Nor will that prove any thing to the purpose, when as it
shall be alledg'd that this Notion is not so connaturall and
Essentiall to the Soul, because she framed it from some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
from without. For all those undenyable conclusions
in Geometry which might be help'd and occasion'd from
some thing without, are so Naturall notwithstanding and
Essentiall to the Soul, that you may as soon un-soul the
Soul, as divide her from perpetuall assent to those Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62817:21"/>
truths, supposing no distemper nor violence offered
to her Facultyes. As for example, shee cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in her self the <hi>Several distinct Ideas of the five Regular
Bodies,</hi> as also, <hi>that it is impossible that there should bee any
more then five.</hi> And this Idea of a Being absolutely perfect
is as distinct and indelible an Idea in the Soul, as the Idea
of the five Regular Bodyes, or any other Idea whatsoever.</p>
               <p>It remaines therefore undenyable, that there is an insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Being absolutely perfect</hi> ever residing, though

               <p>BUt now to lay out more particularly the perfections

Immateriality, Infinity as well of Duration
as Essence, Immensity of Goodnesse, Omnisciency, Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
and <hi>Necessity of Existence.</hi> Let this therefore bee the
description of a being absolutely perfect, that it is a <hi>Spirit,
Eternall, Infinite in Essence and Goodnesse, Omniscient,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62817:21"/>
Omnipotent, and of it self necessarily existent.</hi> All which
Attributes being Attributes of the highest <hi>perfection,</hi> that falls
under the apprehension of man, and having no discoverable
imperfection interwoven with them, must of necessity be
attributed to that which we conceive absolutely and fully
<hi>perfect.</hi> And if any one will say that this is but to dresse up
a Notion out of my own fancy, which I would afterwards
ssily insinuate to be the Notion of <hi>a God;</hi> I answer, that no
man can discourse and reason of any thing without recourse
to settled notions decyphered in his own mind. And that
such an exception as this implies the most contradictious ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
imaginable, to wit, as if a man should reason from
something that never entred into his mind, or that is utterly
out of the ken of his own facultyes. But such groundlesse
allegations as these discover nothing but an unwillingnesse
to find themselves able to entertain any conception of God,
and a heavy propension to sink down into an utter oblivion
of him, and to become as stupid and senselesse in divine
things as the very beasts.</p>
               <p>But others it may be will not look on this Notion as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
for the easie composure thereof out of familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
which the mind of man ordinarily figures it self into,
but reject it rather for some unintelligible hard termes in it,
such as <hi>Spirit, Eternall,</hi> and <hi>Infinite,</hi> for they do professe they
can frame no Notion of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that anything should be
<hi>Eternal</hi> or <hi>Infinite,</hi> they do not know how to set their mind in
a posture to apprehend, and therefore some would have no
such thing as a <hi>Spirit</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p>But if the difficulty of framing a conception of a thing
must take away the existence of the thing it self, there will be
no such thing as a <hi>Body</hi> left in the world, and then will all
be <hi>Spirit</hi> or nothing. For who can frame so safe a notion
of a <hi>Body,</hi> as to free himself from the intanglements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the
extension thereof will bring along with it. For this extended
matter consists of either indivisible points, or of particles
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62817:22"/>
divisible <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Take which of these two you will, and
you can find no third) you will be wound into the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
absurdityes that may be. For if you say it consists of
points, from this position I can necessarily demonstrate, that
every <hi>Speare</hi> or <hi>Spire-Steeple</hi> or what long body you will
is as thick as it is long; that the tallest <hi>Cedar</hi> is not so high
as the lowest <hi>Mushrome;</hi> and that the <hi>Moon</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi>
are so neere one another, that the thicknesse of your hand
will not go betwixt; that <hi>Rounds</hi> and <hi>Squares</hi> are all one
figure; that <hi>Even</hi> and <hi>Odde Numbers</hi> are Equall one with
another; and that the clearest Day is as dark as the blackest
<hi>Night.</hi> And if you make choice of the other Member of the
disjunction, your fancy will bee little better at ease. For
nothing can be divisible into parts it has not: therefore if a
body be divisible into infinite parts, it has infinite extended
parts: and if it has an infinite number of extended parts,
it cannot be but a hard mystery to the Imagination of
Man, that infinite extended parts should not amount to
one whole infinite extension. And thus <hi>a grain</hi> of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-seed</hi>
would be as well infinitely extended, as the
whole Matter of the Universe; and a thousandth part of
that grain as well as the grain it self. Which things are
more unconceivable then any thing in the Notion of a
<hi>Spirit.</hi> Therefore we are not scornfully and contemptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to reject any Notion, for seeming at first to be clouded
and obscur'd with some difficulties and intricacies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
sith that, of whose being we seem most assured, is
the most intangled and perplex'd in the conceiving, of any
thing that can be propounded to the apprehension of a
Man. But here you will reply that our senses are struck by
so manifest impressions from the Matter, that though the
<hi>nature</hi> of it bee difficult to conceive, yet the <hi>Existence</hi> is
palpable to us, by what it acts upon us. Why, then all
that I desire is this, that when you shall be reminded of
some actions and operations that arrive to the notice of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62817:22"/>
your sense or understanding, which unlesse we do violence
to our faculties we can never attribute to <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi>
that then you would not be so nice and averse from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of such a substance as is called a <hi>Spirit,</hi> though you
fancy some difficulty in the conceiving thereof.</p>
               <p>But for mine own part I think the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi>
is as conceivable, and easy to be defin'd as the nature of
anything else. For as for the very <hi>Essence</hi> or bare <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of any thing whatsoever, hee is a very Novice in
speculation that does not acknowledge that utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowable.
But for the <hi>Essentiall</hi> and <hi>Inseparable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,</hi>
they are as intelligible and explicable in a <hi>Spirit</hi> as
in any other subject whatever. As for example, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the intire <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi> in generall, or at least of all
finite created and subordinate <hi>Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to consist of these
severall powers or properties, viz. <hi>Self-penetration. Self-Motion,
Self-contraction</hi> and <hi>Dilatation,</hi> and <hi>Indivisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi>
and these are those that I reckon more absolute; I will
adde also what has relation to another, and that is the
power of <hi>Penetrating, Moving</hi> and <hi>Altering</hi> the <hi>Matter.</hi>
These properties and powers put together make up the
<hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby it is plainly distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from a <hi>Body,</hi> whose parts cannot <hi>penetrate</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is not <hi>Self-moveable,</hi> nor can <hi>contract</hi> nor <hi>dilate</hi> it
self, is <hi>divisible</hi> and <hi>separable</hi> one part from another; But
the parts of a <hi>Spirit</hi> can be no more separated, though they
be dilated, then you can cut off the <hi>Rayes</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> by a
paire of Scissors made of pellucide Crystall. And this
will serve for the settling of the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Spirit;</hi> the
proofe of it's <hi>Existence</hi> belongs not unto this place. And
out of this description it is plain that a <hi>Spirit</hi> is a notion of
more perfection then a <hi>Body,</hi> and therefore the more fit to
be an Attribute of what is <hi>absolutely perfect,</hi> then a <hi>Body is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now for the other two hard terms of <hi>Eternall</hi> and
<hi>Infinite,</hi> if any one would excuse himself from asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Notion of a <hi>God,</hi> by reason of the Incomprehensiblenesse
of those attributes, let him consider, that he shall whether
he will or no be forced to acknowledge something <hi>Eternal,</hi>
either <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>World,</hi> and the Intricacy is alike in either.
And though he would shuffle off the trouble of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
an <hi>Infinite De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty,</hi> yet he will never extricate himself out
of the intanglements of an <hi>Infinite Space;</hi> which Notion
will stick as closely to his Soul, as her power of <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Goodnesse, Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which are
the three following Attributes, are Attributes of <hi>perfection,</hi>
if a man consult his own Facultyes, it will be undoubtedly
concluded, and I know nothing else he can consult with. At
least this will be returned as infallibly true, that a <hi>Being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
perfect</hi> has these, or what supereminently containes
these. And that <hi>Knowledge</hi> or something like it is in God, is
manifest, because without animadversion in some sense or
other, it is impossible to be <hi>Happy.</hi> But that a <hi>Being</hi> should
bee <hi>absolutely perfect,</hi> &amp; yet not happy, is as impossible. But
<hi>Knowledge</hi> without <hi>Goodnesse</hi> is but dry Subtilty, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
Craft; and <hi>Goodnesse</hi> with <hi>Knowledge</hi> devoyd
of <hi>Power</hi> is but lame and ineffectuall: Wherefore what ever
is <hi>absolutely perfect,</hi> is <hi>Infinitely both Good, Wise and
Powerfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly it is more <hi>perfection</hi> that all this be <hi>Stable,
Immutable</hi> and <hi>Necessary,</hi> then <hi>Contingent</hi> or <hi>but Possible.</hi>
Therefore the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Being absolutely perfect</hi> represents to
our minds, that that of which it is the <hi>Idea</hi> is <hi>necessarily</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist.
And that which of its own nature doth <hi>necessarily</hi> exist,
must never fail to be. And whether the Atheist will call this
<hi>absolute perfect Being,</hi> God or not, it is all one; I list not
to contend about words. But I think any man else at the
first sight will say that wee have found out the true <hi>Idea</hi>
of <hi>God.</hi>

these outward objects are rather the reminders then the

I doe not mean that there is a certaine number of

Suppose a skilful <hi>Musician</hi> fallen asleep in the field upon the

is no <hi>actuall skill</hi> or Notion nor representation of any thing
musicall in him, but his friend sitting by him that cannot sing
at all himself, jogs him and awakes him, and desires him
to sing this or the other song, telling him two or three words
of the beginning of the long, he presently takes it out of his
mouth, and sings the whole song upon so slight and slender
intimation: So the <hi>Mind</hi> of <hi>man</hi> being jogg'd and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened

a more full and cleare conception of what was but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

               <p>ANd that this is the condition of the Soul is discovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by sundry observations. As for example, Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
to the Soul through the outward senses the figure of a

<hi>figure,</hi> and can adde forthwith that if it be perfect, all the

must be exactly <hi>Equal.</hi> In like manner shew her a <hi>Triangle,</hi>
she will straightway pronounce that if that be the right

<hi>points.</hi> But this accuracy either in the <hi>Circle</hi> or the
<hi>Triangle</hi> cannot be set out in any materiall subject, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it remains that she hath a more full &amp; exquisite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things in her self, then the Matter can lay open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62817:24"/>
her, Let us cast in a third Instance, let some body now
demonstrate this <hi>Triangle</hi> described in the Matter to have
it's three Angles equall to two right ones: Why yes saith
the Soul this is true, and not only in this particular <hi>Triangle</hi>
but in all plain <hi>Triangles</hi> that can possibly be describ'd in
the Matter. And thus you see the Soul sings out the whole
song upon the first hint, as knowing it very well before.</p>
               <p>Besides this, there are a multitude of <hi>Relative Notions</hi>
or <hi>Ideas</hi> in the Mind of Man, as well <hi>Mathematicall</hi> as
<hi>Logicall,</hi> which if we prove cannot be the impresses of

                  <hi>Proportion</hi> &amp; <hi>Analogy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Asymmetry,</hi> and
such like: All which <hi>Relative Ideas</hi> I shall easily prove to
be no materiall impresses from without upon the Soul, but
her own active conception proceeding from her self whilst
shee takes notice of <hi>externall Objects.</hi> For that these <hi>Ideas</hi>
can make no Impresses upon the outward senses is plain
from hence; because they are no <hi>sensible</hi> nor <hi>Physicall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
of the <hi>Matter.</hi> And how can that, that is no <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
affection</hi> of the <hi>Matter</hi> affect our corporeall Organs
of <hi>Sense?</hi> But now that these <hi>Relative Ideas,</hi> whether
<hi>Logical</hi> or <hi>Mathematicall</hi> be no <hi>Physicall, affections</hi> of the
<hi>Matter</hi> is manifest from these two arguments. First they
may be produced when there has been no <hi>Physicall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
nor alteration in the Subject to which they belong, nay
indeed when there hath been nothing at all done to the
Subject to which they doe accrue. As for example, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
one side of a Room whitened the other not touch'd or
medled with, this other has thus become unlike, and hath
the Notion of <hi>Dissimile</hi> necessarily belonging to it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there has nothing at all been done thereunto. So
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62817:25"/>
suppose two Pounds of <hi>Lead,</hi> which therefore are two <hi>Equal</hi>
Pieces of that Metall; cut away half from one of them,
the other Pound, nothing at all being done unto it,
has lost it's Notion of <hi>Equall,</hi> and hath acquired a new
one of <hi>Double</hi> unto the other. Nor is it to any purpose to
answere, that though there was nothing done to this Pound
of Lead, yet there was to the other; For that does not at
all enervate the Reason, but shewes that the Notion of
<hi>Sub <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>double</hi> which accrued to that Lead which had half
cut away, is but our <hi>Mode</hi> of conceiving, as well as the
other, and not any <hi>Physicall affection</hi> that strikes the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall
Organs of the Body, as <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Cold, Hard</hi> and
<hi>Soft, White</hi> and <hi>Black,</hi> and the like do. Wherefore the
<hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Equall</hi> and <hi>Vnequall, Double</hi> and <hi>Sub-double,
Like</hi> and <hi>Vnlike,</hi> with the rest, are no externall Impresses
upon the Senses, but the Souls own active manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
those things which are discovered by the outward
Senses.</p>
               <p>The second argument is, that one and the same part
of the Matter is capable at one and the same time, wholly
and entirely of two contrary <hi>Ideas</hi> of this kind. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
any piece of Matter that is a <hi>Middle proportionall</hi>
betwixt two other pieces, is <hi>Double,</hi> suppose, and <hi>Sub-dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
or <hi>Tripple</hi> and <hi>Sub-tripple,</hi> at once. Which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
signe that these <hi>Ideas</hi> are no affections of the Matter,
and therefore do not affect our senses, else they would affect
the senses of <hi>Beasts,</hi> and they might also grow good Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians
and Arithmeticians. And they not affecting our
senses, it is plain that wee have some <hi>Ideas</hi> that we are not
beholding to our senses for, but are the meer exertions of the
Mind occasionally awakened, by the Appulses of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
objects; Which the out-ward Senses doe no more
teach us, then he that awakened the <hi>Musician</hi> to sing
taught him his skill.</p>
               <p>And now in the third and last place it is manifest, besides
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62817:25"/>
these single <hi>Ideas</hi> I have proved to be in the mind, that there
are also severall complex Notions in the same, such as are
these; <hi>The whole is bigger then the part: If you take Equall
from Equall, the Remainders are Equall: Every number is
either Even or Odde;</hi> which are true to the soul at the very first
proposal; as any one that is in his wits does plainly perceive.</p>

for, viz; That the Soul hath <hi>actuall knowledge in her

is such, that shee will certainly and fully assent to some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
how ever shee came to the knowledge of them,
unlesse shee doe manifest violence to her own Faculties.
Which truths must therefore be concluded not fortuitous or
arbitrarious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Natural so the Soul: such as I have already

                  </gap> ever actually there.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is manifest, that we consulting with our own
natural light concerning the Notion of a <hi>Being absolutely
perfect,</hi> that this Oracle tells us, that it is <hi>A spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Eternal, Infinite in Essence and Goodness, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
Omniscient, and of it self necessarily existent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this answer is such, that if we understand the sense
thereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, we cannot tell how to deny it, and therefore it is
true according to the light of Nature. But it is manifest that
that which is <hi>Self-subsistent, infinitely Good, Omniscient</hi> and
<hi>Omnipotent,</hi> is the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of all things. For
<hi>Omnipotency</hi> signifies a Power that can effect any thing that
implies no contradiction to be effected; and <hi>Creation</hi> implyes
no contradiction: Therefore this <hi>perfect</hi> Being <hi>can create</hi>
all things. But if it found the Matter or other Substances ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting
aforehand of themselves, this <hi>Omnipotency</hi> and Power
of <hi>Creation</hi> will be in vain, which the free and unprejudic'd
Faculties of the Minde of man do not admit of. Therefore
the natural notion of a <hi>Being absolutely perfect,</hi> implies that
the same <hi>Being is Lord and Maker of all things.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Natural light that which is thus, is to be adored

shown it does, unlesse we will wink against our own naturall

<hi>that God does exist.</hi> Nor is it sufficient grounds to diffide
to the strength of this Argument, because our fancy can
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62817:27"/>
shuffle in this Abater, viz. That indeed this <hi>Idea</hi> of God,
supposing God did exist, shews us that his Existence is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,

For he that answers thus, does not observe out of what
prejudice he is inabled to make this Answer, which is this:
He being accustomed to fancy the Nature or Notion of
every thing else without Existence, and so ever easily sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
Essence and Existence in them, here unawares hee
takes the same liberty, and divides Existence from that Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

reply, If he did at all exist; by this answer you involve
your self in a manifest contradiction. For first you say with

it by intimating that notwithstanding this true <hi>Idea</hi> and

               <p>And to make this yet plainer at least if not stronger when
wee say that the <hi>Existence</hi> of God is <hi>Necessary,</hi> wee are to
take notice that <hi>Necessity</hi> is a <hi>Logicall Terme,</hi> and signifies
so firme a Connexion betwixt the <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Praedicate</hi> (as
they call them) that it is impossible that they should bee
dissevered, or should not hold together, and therefore if they
bee affirm'd one of the other, that they make <hi>Axioma Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarium,</hi>
an Axiome that is necessary, or eternally
true. Wherefore there being a <hi>Necessary Connexion</hi> betwixt
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Existence;</hi> this Axiome, <hi>God does Exist, is</hi> an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62817:27"/>
Axiome Necessarily and Eternally true. Which we shall
yet more clearly understand, if we compare <hi>Necessity</hi> and
<hi>Contingency</hi> together; For as <hi>Contingency</hi> signifies not onely
the <hi>Manner of Existence</hi> in that which is contingent accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its <hi>Idea,</hi> but does intimate also a <hi>Possibility</hi> of <hi>Actual
Existence,</hi> (so to make up the true and easy Analogy) <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
does not only signify the <hi>Manner of Existence</hi> in that
which is <hi>Necessary,</hi> but also that it does <hi>actually Exist,</hi> and
<hi>could never possibly do otherwise.</hi> For <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Necessity of Being and Impossibility of Not-being,
are all one with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> &amp; the rest of the <hi>Logicians.</hi>
But the <hi>Atheist</hi> and the <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> are usually such
profess'd Enemyes against <hi>Logick;</hi> the one meerly out of
Dotage upon outward grosse sense, the other in a dear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his stiffe and untamed fancy, that shop of Mysteryes
and fine things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee may further add, that whereas wee must
needs attribute to the <hi>Idea</hi> of God either <hi>Contingency, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility,
or Necessity</hi> of <hi>Actuall Existence,</hi> (some one of
these belonging to every <hi>Idea</hi> imaginable) and that <hi>Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency</hi>
is incompetible to an <hi>Idea of a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing absolutely perfect,</hi>
much more <hi>Impossibility,</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> of God being compiled
of no Notions but such as are <hi>possible</hi> according to the light
of Nature, to which wee now appeal: It remains therefore
that <hi>Necessity of Actuall Existence</hi> bee unavoidably cast
upon the <hi>Idea</hi> of God, and that therefore God does <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Exist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But fourthly and lastly, if this seem more subtile, though
it bee no lesse true for it, I shall now propound that which
is so palpable, that it is impossible for any one that has the
use of his wits for to deny it. I say therefore, that either
God or this corporeall and sensible world must of it self <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
exist.</hi> Or thus, Either <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>both doe</hi>
of themselves <hi>necessarily exist.</hi> If <hi>both,</hi> wee have what we
would drive at, the <hi>existency</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62817:28"/>
But yet to acknowledge the necessary existence of the
<hi>Matter</hi> of it self, is not so congruous and suteable to the
light of Nature. For if any thing can exist <hi>independently</hi> of
God, all things may; so that not onely the Omnipotency
of God might be in vain, but beside there would be a letting
in from hence of all confusion and disorder imaginable; Nay
of some grand Devill of equall Power and of as large
Command as God himself: Or if you will of six thousand
Millions of such monstrous Gigantick Spirits, fraught with
various and mischievous Passions, as well as armed with
immense power, who in anger or humour appearing in
huge shapes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might take the Planets up in their prodigious
Clutches, and pelt one another with them as boyes are wont
to do with snowbals; And that this has not yet happened will
bee resolved onely into this, that the humour has not yet
taken them. But the frame of Nature and the generation of
things would be still lyable to this ruine and disorder. So
dangerous a thing it is to slight the naturall <hi>dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes</hi>
and <hi>correspondencyes</hi> of our innate <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is there any Refuge in such a Reply as this, that the
full and perfect Infinitude of the power of God, is able easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to overmaster these six thousand Millions of Monsters,
and to stay their hands. For I say that six or fewer, may
equallize the infinite power of God. For if any thing may
be <hi>self-essentiated</hi> besides God, why may not a <hi>Spirit</hi> of
just six times lesse power then God exist of it self? and then
six such wil equallize him, a seventh will overpower him. But
such a rabble of <hi>self-essentiated</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> Deities, does
not only hazzard the pulling the world in pieces, but plainly
takes away the Existence of the true God. For if there be
any power or perfection whatsoever, which has its original
from any other then God, it manifestly demonstrates that
God is not God, that is, is not a <hi>Being absolutely and fully
perfect,</hi> because we see some power in the world that is not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62817:28"/>
his, that is, that is not from him. But what is fully and
wholly from him, is very truly and properly his, as the
<hi>thought</hi> of my minde is rather my mindes, then my
thoughts.</p>
               <p>And this is the only way that I know to demonstrate
that it is impossible that there should be any more then <hi>one</hi>
true God in the world; For if we did admit another beside
him, this other must be also <hi>self-originated;</hi> and so neither
of them would be God. For the <hi>Idea</hi> of God swallows up
into it self all power and perfection conceivable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
necessarily implies that whatever hath any Being, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
it from him.</p>
               <p>But if you say the <hi>Matter</hi> does only exist and not <hi>God,</hi>
then this <hi>Matter</hi> does <hi>necessarily</hi> exist of it self, and so we
give that Attribute unto the <hi>Matter</hi> which our Natural
Light taught us to be contain'd in the Essentiall conception
of no other thing besides <hi>God.</hi> Wherefore to deny that of
God, which is so necessarily comprehended in the true <hi>Idea</hi>
of him, and to acknowledge it in that in whose <hi>Idea</hi> it is
not at all contain'd (for <hi>necessary Existence</hi> is not contain'd
in the <hi>Idea</hi> of any thing but of a <hi>Being absolutely perfect</hi>)
is to pronounce contrary to our Natural light, and to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
violence to our Faculties.</p>
               <p>Nor can this be excused by saying that the Corporeall
<hi>Matter</hi> is palpable and <hi>sensible</hi> unto us, but <hi>God</hi> is not, and
therefore we pronounce confidently that it is, though God
be not, and also that it is <hi>necessary</hi> of it self, sith that which is
without the help of another must necessarily bee and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
               <p>For I demand of you then sith you professe your selves
to believe nothing but <hi>sense,</hi> how could <hi>sense</hi> ever help you
to that truth you acknowledged last, <hi>viz That that which
exists without the help of another, is necessary and eternall?</hi>
For <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> are no sensible Qualities, and
therefore are not the objects of any <hi>sense;</hi> And I have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62817:29"/>
ready very plentifully proved, that there is other knowledge
and perception in the Soul besides that of <hi>Sense.</hi> Wherefore
it is very unreasonable, when as we have other faculties of
knowledge besides the senses, that we should consult with
the senses alone about matters of knowledge, and exclude
those facultyes that penetrate beyond <hi>Sense.</hi> A thing that
the profess'd <hi>Atheists</hi> themselves will not doe when they
are in the humour of Philosophising, for their principle of
<hi>Ato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es</hi> is a businesse that does not fall under <hi>Sense,</hi> as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi>
at large confesses.</p>
               <p>But now seeing it is so manifest that the Soul of man has
other cognoscitive faculties besides that of <hi>Sense</hi> (which I
have clearly above demonstrated) it is as incongruous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there is a <hi>God,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> is not an object fitted to the
<hi>Senses,</hi> as it were to deny there is <hi>Matter</hi> or a <hi>Body,</hi> because
that <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter,</hi> in the imaginative Notion thereof, lies
so unevenly and troublesomly in our <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the contemplation whereof our understanding discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
such contradictious incoherencies, that were it not that the
notion is sustain'd by the confident dictates of <hi>Sense, Reason</hi>
appealing to those more crasse Representations of <hi>Fansy,</hi>
would by her shrewd <hi>Dilemma's</hi> be able to argue it quite
out of the world. But our Reason being well aware that <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi>
matter is the proper object of the sensitive faculty, she
gives full belief to the information of Sense in her own sphear,
slighting the puzzling objections of perplexed Fancy, and
freely admits the existence of Matter, notwithstanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements
of Imagination, as she does also the existence of
God, from the contemplation of his <hi>Idea</hi> in our soul, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the silence of the senses therein. For indeed it were
an unexcusable piece of folly and madnesse in a man, when
as he has cognoscitive faculties reaching to the knowledge of
God, and has a certain and unalterable <hi>Idea</hi> of God in his
soule, which he can by no device wipe out, as well as he has
the knowledge of <hi>Sense</hi> that reaches to the discovery of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62817:29"/>
Matter; to give necessary Self-existence to the <hi>Matter,</hi> no
Faculty at all informing him so; and to take necessary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
from <hi>God,</hi> though the natural notion of God in the
Soul informe him to the contrary; and only upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
because God does not immediately fall under the
Knowledge of the <hi>Senses;</hi> Thus partially siding with one
kind of Faculty only of the Soul, and proscribing all the
rest. Which is as humoursomely and foolishly done, as
if a Man should make a faction amongst the Senses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and resolve to believe nothing to be but what he
could see with his Eyes, and so confidently pronounce that
there is no such thing as the Element of <hi>Aire</hi> nor <hi>Winds</hi> nor
<hi>Musick</hi> nor <hi>Thunder.</hi> And the reason forsooth must be
because he can see none of these things with his Eyes, and
that's the sole sense that he intends to believe.</p>

That bare <hi>possibility</hi> ought to have no power upon the

We being delt with in all points as if there were a God,
that naturally wee are to conclude there is one.</head>
               <p>ANd hitherto I have argued from the naturall <hi>Notion</hi>
or <hi>Idea</hi> of God as it respects that of which it is the
<hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Notion.</hi> I shall now try what advantage may be
made of it, from the respect it bears unto our <hi>Souls,</hi> the
<hi>Subject</hi> thereof, wherein, it does reside.</p>
               <p>I demand therefore who put this Indelible Character of
God upon our Souls? why and to what purpose is it there?
Nor do not think to shuffle me off by saying, We must
take things as we find them, and not inquire of the finall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62817:30"/>
Cause of any thing; for things are necessarily as they are
of themselves, whose guidance and contrivance is from no
principle of Wisdome or Counsell, but every substance is
now and ever was of what nature and capacity it is found;
having it's Originall from none other then it self; and all
those changes and varieties we see in the World, are but the
result of an Eternall Scuffle of coordinate Causes, bearing
up as well as they can, to continue themselves in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state they ever are, and acting and being acted upon
by others, these varieties of things appeare in the world,
but every particular Substance with the Essential Properties
thereof is self-originated, and independent of any other.</p>
               <p>For to this I answere, that the very best that can be made
of all this is but thus much; that it is meerly and barely <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
nay if we consult our own faculties, and the Idea of
God, utterly impossible: but admit it possible; this bare
<hi>possibility</hi> is so laxe, so weak, and so undeterminate a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that it ought to have no power to move the
mind this way or that way that has any tolerable use of
her own Reason, more then the faint breathings of the
loose Aire have to shake a Mountaine of brasse. For if
bare <hi>possibility</hi> may at all intangle our assent or dissent in
things, we cannot fully mis-believe the absurdest Fable in
<hi>Aesop</hi> or <hi>Ovid,</hi> or the most ridiculous figments that can
be imagin'd; As suppose that <hi>Eares of Corn in the field
heare the whistling of the wind and chirping of the Birds;
that the stones in the street are grinded with pain when the
Carts go over them: that the Heliotrope eyes the Sun and
really sees him as well as turns round about with him:
that the Pulp of the Wall-nut, as bearing the signature of
the brain, is indued with Imagination and Reason.</hi> I
say no man can fully mis-believe any of these fooleries, if
bare <hi>possibility</hi> may have the least power of turning the
Scales this way or that way. For none of these nor a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
more such like as these imply a perfect and palpable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62817:30"/>
Contradiction, and therefore will put in for their right
of being deemed <hi>possible.</hi> But we are not to attend to
what is simply <hi>possible,</hi> but to what our <hi>naturall faculties</hi>
do direct and determine us to. As for Example, Suppose
the Question were, <hi>whether the Stones in the Street have
sense or no,</hi> we are not to leave the point as indifferent, or
that may be held either way, because it is <hi>possible</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
no palpable Contradiction, that they may have <hi>sense</hi>
and that a <hi>painfull</hi> sense too. But we are to consult with
our <hi>naturall faculties,</hi> and see whither they propend: and
they do plainly determinate the Controversy by telling us,
that what has <hi>sense</hi> and is capable of <hi>pain,</hi> ought to have
also progressive <hi>Motion,</hi> to bee able to avoyd what is
hurtfull and painfull, and we see it is so in all Beings that
have any considerable share of Sense. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> who
was no doater on a <hi>Deity,</hi> yet frequently does assume this
principle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, That <hi>Nature does nothing
in vain.</hi> Which is either an acknowledgment of a <hi>God,</hi> or
an appeale to our own <hi>Rationall Faculties.</hi> And I am
indifferent which, for I have what I would out of either,
for if we appeale to the naturall suggestions of our own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
they will assuredly tell us there is a God.</p>
               <p>I therefore again demand and I desire to be answered
without prejudice, or any restraint laid upon our naturall
faculties, to what purpose is this indelible <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi>
of God in us, if there be no such thing as <hi>God</hi> existent in
the world? or who seal'd so deep an Impression of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
upon our Minds?</p>
               <p>If we were travailing in a desolate <hi>wildernesse,</hi> where
we could discover neither Man nor house, and should meet
with <hi>Herds</hi> of <hi>Cattell</hi> or <hi>Flocks</hi> of <hi>Sheep</hi> upon whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
there were branded certain <hi>Markes</hi> or <hi>Letters,</hi> we
should without any hesitancy conclude that these have all
been under the hand of some man or other that has set his
name upon them. And verily when we see writ in our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62817:31"/>
Souls in such legible Characters the <hi>Name</hi> or rather the
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Idea</hi> of God, why should we be so slow and
backward from making the like reasonable inference? As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
he whose <hi>Character</hi> is signed upon our Souls, has
been here, and has thus marked us that we and all may
know to whom we belong. That <hi>it is he that has made us,
and not we our selves; that we are his people and the sheep
of his Pasture.</hi> And it is evidently plain from the <hi>Idea</hi> of
God, which includes omnipotency in it, that we can be
made from none other then he; as I have before demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.
And therefore there was no better way then by
sealing us with this <hi>Image</hi> to make us acknowledge our
selves to be his, and to do that worship and adoration to
him that is due to our mighty <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Creatour,</hi> that
is to our <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore things complying thus naturally, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
together, according to the free Suggestions of our
<hi>naturall Faculties,</hi> it is as perverse and forced a buisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to suspend assent, as to doubt whether those Romane
<hi>Vrnes</hi> and <hi>Coynes</hi> I spoke of digg'd out of the Earth be the
works of Nature or the Artifice of Men.</p>
               <p>But if wee cannot yet for all this give free assent to this
Position<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>God does Exist,</hi> Let us at least have the
Patience a while to suppose it. I demand therefore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
God did <hi>Exist,</hi> what can the Mind of Man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that this God should do better or more effectuall for
the making himself known to such a Creature as Man,
indued with such and such faculties, then we find really
already done? For God being a <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Infinite,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ever make himself known Necessarily, and Adaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ely
by any appearance to our outward <hi>Senses.</hi> For if he
should manifest himself in any outward figures or shapes,
portending either love or wrath, terrour or protection,
our faculties could not assure us that this were <hi>God,</hi> but
some particular <hi>Genius</hi> good or bad: and besides such da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeling
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62817:31"/>
and affrightfull externall forces are neither becoming
the divine Nature, nor suteable with the Condition of the
Soul of Man, whose better faculties and more free God
meddles with, does not force nor amaze us by a more
course and oppressing power upon our weake and brutish
senses. What remaines therefore but that he should mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
himself to our <hi>Inward Man?</hi> And what way imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
is more fit then the indelible Impression of the <hi>Idea</hi>
of himself, which is (not divine life and sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that's
an higher prise laid up for them that can win it, but) a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
representation of the God-head and a Notion of his
<hi>Essence,</hi> whereby the Soul of Man could no otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of him, then an <hi>Eternall Spirit, Infinite in goodnesse,
Omnipotent, Omniscient and Necessarily of himself Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent.</hi>
But this, as I have fully proved, we find <hi>de facto</hi>
done in us, wherefore we being every way dealt with as if
there were a God <hi>Existing,</hi> and no <hi>faculty</hi> discovering any
thing to the contrary, what should hinder us from the
concluding that he does really <hi>Exist?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is also very naturall for a man that follows honestly the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62817:32"/>
dictates of his own <hi>Conscience,</hi> to be full of good hopes, and
much at ease, and secure that all things at home and abroad
will goe successfully with him, though his actions or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
motions of his Mind act nothing upon Nature or the
course of the world to change them any way: wherefore it
implyes that there is a <hi>Superintendent Principle</hi> over Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the materiall frame of the world, that looks to it
so that nothing shall come to passe, but what is consistent
with the good and welfare of honest and conscientious Men.
And if it does not happen to them according to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this world, it does naturally bring in a belief of a
world to come.</p>
               <p>Nor does it at all enervate the strength of this Argument
that some men have lost the sense and difference betwixt
good and evill, if there be any so fully degenerate; but let
us suppose it, this is a monster, and I suspect of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
But this is no more prejudice to what I ayme at, who
argue from the <hi>Naturall constitution</hi> of a Man the <hi>Existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a God;</hi> then if because <hi>Democritus</hi> put out his Eyes,
some are born blind, others drink out their Eyes and cannot
see, that therefore you should conclude that there is neither
<hi>Light</hi> nor <hi>Colours:</hi> For if there were, then every one would
see them, but <hi>Democritus</hi> and some others doe not see them.
But the reason is plain, there hath been force done to their
<hi>Naturall Facultyes</hi> and they have put out their sight.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conclude from <hi>naturall Conscience</hi> in a
Man that puts him upon hope and fear of Good and Evill
from what he does or omits, though those actions and omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
doe nothing to the change of the course of Nature or
the affaires of the world, that there is an <hi>Intelligent Principle</hi>
over universall Nature that takes notice of the Actions of
Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is that <hi>there is a God;</hi> for else this <hi>Naturall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
would be false and vaine.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Adoration</hi> or <hi>Religious Worship</hi> it is as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
as mankind, there being no Nation under the Cope
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62817:33"/>
of heaven that does not do divine worship to something
or other, and in it to God as they conceive; wherefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ordinary <hi>naturall light</hi> that is in all men,
there is a God.</p>
               <p>Nor can the force of this Argument be avoyded, by
saying it is but an universall <hi>Tradition</hi> that has been time
out of mind spread among the Nations of the world. For
if it were so (which yet cannot at all be proved) in that it
is universally received, it is manifest that it is according to
the <hi>light of Nature</hi> to acknowledge there is a God. For that
which all men admit as true, though upon the proposall of
another, is undoubtedly to be termed true according to the
<hi>light of Nature.</hi> As many hundreds of <hi>Geometricall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations</hi>
that were first the inventions of some one
man, have passed undenyable through all ages and places
for true, according to the <hi>light of Nature,</hi> with them that
were but Learners not Inventours of them. And it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make a thing true according to the <hi>light of Nature,</hi>
that no man upon a perception of what is propounded and
the reasons of it (if it be not cleare at the first sight and need
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>easons to back it) will ever stick to acknowledge for a
Truth. And therefore if there were any Nations that
were destitute of the knowledge of a <hi>God,</hi> as they may
be it is likely of the Rudiments of <hi>Geometry,</hi> so long as
they will admit of the knowledge of one as well as of the
other, upon due and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it proposall; the acknowledgment
of a <hi>God</hi> is as well to be said to be according to the <hi>light of
Nature,</hi> as the knowledge of <hi>Geometry</hi> which they thus
receive.</p>
               <p>But if it be here objected that a thing may be universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiv'd of all Nations and yet be so farre from being
true according to the <hi>light of Nature,</hi> that it is not true at
all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for example that the <hi>Sun</hi> moves about the <hi>Earth,</hi>
and that the <hi>Earth</hi> stands still as the fix'd <hi>Center</hi> of the
world, which the best of Astronomers and the profoundest
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62817:33"/>
of Philosophers pronounce to be false: I answere that in
some sense it does stand still, if you understand by Motion
the translation of a body out of the vicinity of other bodyes.
But suppose it did not stand still, this comes not home to
our Case; For this is but the just victory of Reason over
the general prejudice of Sense; and every one will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that Reason may correct the Impresses of Sense,
otherwise we should admit the Sun and Moon to be no wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then a Sive, and the bodyes of the Starrs to be no bigger
then the ordinary flame of a Candle. Therefore you see here
is a clashing of the faculties one against another, and the
stronger carryes it. But there is no faculty that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to clash with the judgement of Reason and natural
Sagacity that so easily either concludes or presages that
there is a God: wherefore that may well go for a Truth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>light of Nature</hi> that is universally received of
men, be it by what faculty it will they receive it, no other
faculty appearing that can evidence to the contrary. And
such is the <hi>universall acknowledgment</hi> that <hi>there is a God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it much more materiall to reply, That though
there be indeed a <hi>Religious Worship</hi> excercised in all Nations
upon the face of the Earth, yet they worship many of them
but <hi>stocks</hi> and <hi>stones,</hi> or some particular piece of Nature, as
the <hi>Sunne, Moon,</hi> or <hi>Starrs;</hi> For I answer, That first it is
very hard to prove that they worship any Image or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
without reference to some Spirit at least, if not to the
omnipotent God. So that we shall hence at least win thus
much, that there are in the Universe some more subtile and
Immateriall Substances that take notice of the affairs of
Men, and this is as ill to a slow Atheist, as to believe that
<hi>there is a God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for that adoration some of them do to the <hi>Sunne</hi>
and <hi>Moon,</hi> I cannot believe they do it to them under the
Notion of mere <hi>Inanimate Bodies,</hi> but they take them to
be the habitation of some <hi>Intellectuall Beings,</hi> as that verse
does plainly intimate to us,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62817:34"/>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>The Sun that
hears and sees all things;</hi> and this is very neer the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But be this <hi>universall Religious Worship</hi> what it will,
as absurd as you please to fancy it, yet it will not faile to
reach very farre for the proving of a <hi>Deity.</hi> For there is no
naturall Faculties in things that have not their object in
the world; as there is meat as well as mouths, sounds as
well as hearing, colours as well as sight, dangers as well
as feare, and the like. So there ought in like manner to
be a <hi>God</hi> as well as a naturall propension in men to
<hi>Religious Worship, God</hi> alone being the proper <hi>Object</hi>
thereof.</p>
               <p>Nor does it abate the strength of the Argument that this
so deeply radicated property of <hi>Religion</hi> in Man, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be lost, does so ineptly and ridiculously display it self
in Manking.</p>
               <p>For as the plying of a <hi>Dogges</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eet in this sleep, as if there
were some game before him, and the butting of a yong
<hi>lambe</hi> before he has yet either hornes or Enemies to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
would not be in Nature, were there not such a thing
as a <hi>Hare</hi> to be coursed, and an <hi>horned Enemy</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
with horns: So there would not be so universall
an Excercise of <hi>Religious Worship</hi> in the world, though it
be done never so ineptly and foolishly, were there not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a due <hi>Object</hi> of this worship, and a capacity in Man for
the right performance thereof; which could not be unlesse
there were a <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Truth is, Mans Soul in this drunken drowsy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
she is in has fallen asleep in the body, and like one
in a dreame talks to the bed-posts, embraces her pillow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of her friend, falls down before statues in stead of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Eternall and Invisible God, prayes to stocks and
stones instead of speaking to him that by his word created
all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62817:34"/>
I but you will reply that a yong <hi>Lambe</hi> has at length
both his weapon and an <hi>Enemy</hi> to encounter, and the drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Dogge</hi> did once and may again pursue some reall
game; And so he that talks in his sleep did once conferre
with men awake, and may do so again; But whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for many successions of Ages have been very stupid
Idolaters, and do so continue to this day. But I answere
that this rather informes us of another great mystery, then
at all enervates the present argument or obscures the grand
truth we strive for. For this does plainly insinuate thus
much, that Mankind is in a laps'd condition, like one fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
down in the fit of an Epilepsy, whose limbes by force of
the convulsion are moved very incomposedly and illfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourdly;
but we know that he that does for the present
move the members of his Body so rudely and fortuitously,
did before command the use of his Muscles in a decent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of his progressive faculty, and that when the fit is
over he will doe so again.</p>
               <p>This therefore rather implyes that these poore barbarous
Souls had once the true knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and of his <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and by some hidden providence may be recover'd into
it again; then that this propension to <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> that
so conspicuously appeares in them, should be utterly in
vain: As it would be both in them and in all men else if
there were no God.</p>

               <p>VVE have done with all those more obvious facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the Soul of Man, that naturally tend to
the discovery of the Existence of a God. Let us briefly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62817:35"/>
wee loose from our selves and lanch out into the vast
Ocean of the Externall <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> consider
the Essence of the Soul her self, what it is, whether a meer
<hi>Modification</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Substance distinct</hi> therefrom;
and then whether <hi>corporeall</hi> or <hi>incorporeall.</hi> For upon the
clearing of this point wee may happily be convinced that
there is a Spiritual Substance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> really distinct from the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Which who so does acknowledge will be easilier indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to beleeve there is a God.</p>
               <p>First therefore if we say that the Soul is a meer <hi>Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of the <hi>Body,</hi> the Soul then is but one universall Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Body, or a many Facultyes put together, and those
operations which are usually attributed unto the Soul, must
of necessity be attributed unto the Body. I demand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to what in the body will you attribute <hi>Spontaneous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
I understand thereby a power in our selves of wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
or holding still most of the parts of our Body, as our
hand suppose or little finger. If you will lay that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the <hi>immission</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> into such and such Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
I would gladly know what does <hi>immit</hi> these <hi>Spirits</hi>
and direct them so curiously. Is it <hi>themselves,</hi> or the <hi>Braine,</hi>
or that particular piece of the Braine they call the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arion</hi>
or <hi>Pine-ker<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ell?</hi> whatever it be, that which does thus
immit them and direct them must have <hi>Animadversion</hi> and
the same that has Animadversion has <hi>Memory</hi> also and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
Now I would know whether the Spirits <hi>themselves</hi>
be capable of <hi>Animadversion, Memory</hi> and <hi>Reason:</hi> for it
indeed seemes altogether impossible. For these animall
Spirits are nothing else, but Matter very thin and liquid,
whose nature consists in this, that all the particles of it be in
Motion, and being loose from one another fridge and play
up and down according to the measure and manner of agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in them.</p>
               <p>I therefore now demand which of the particles in these
so many loosely moving one from another, has <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62817:35"/>
in it? If you say that they all put together have, I
appeal to him that thus answers how unlikely it is that that
should have <hi>Animadversion</hi> that is so utterly uncapable of
<hi>Memory,</hi> and consequently of <hi>Reason.</hi> For it is as impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to conceive <hi>Memory</hi> competible to such a subject, as it
is, how to write Characters in the water or in the wind.</p>
               <p>If you say the <hi>Brain</hi> immits and directs these Spirits, how
can that so freely and spontaneously move it self or another
that has no Muscles? besides <hi>Anatomists</hi> tell us that though
the Brain be the Instrument of sense, yet it has no sense at all
of it self; how then can that that has no sense, direct thus
spontaneously and arbitrariously the animall Spirits into
any part of the Body? an act that plainely requires deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
sense and perception. But let the Anatomists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
what they will, I think I shall little lesse then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
that <hi>the Brains have no Sense.</hi> For the same
thing in us that has <hi>Sense</hi> has likewise <hi>Animadversion,</hi> and
that which has <hi>Animadversion</hi> in us has also a faculty of
free and arbitrarious <hi>Fansy</hi> and of <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now consider the nature of the <hi>Brain,</hi> and see how
competible those operations are to such a Subject. Verily if
wee take a right view of this laxe pith or marrow in Mans
head, neither our sense nor understanding can discover any
thing more in this substance that can pretend to such noble
operations as free Imagination and sagacious collections
of <hi>Reason,</hi> then we can discern in a Cake of Sewer or a
bowle of Curds. For this loose Pulp, that is thus wrapp'd up
within our <hi>Cranium</hi> is but a spongy and porous body, and
pervious not onely to the Animall Spirits but also to more
grosse Juice and Liquor, else it could not well be nourished,
at least it could not be so soft and moistned by drunkennesse
and excesse as to make the understanding inept and sottish
in its operations. Wherefore I now demand in this soft
substance which we call the <hi>Brain,</hi> whose softnesse implyes
that it is in some measure liquid, and liquidity implyes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62817:36"/>
a severall <hi>Motion</hi> of loosned parts; in what part or parcell
thereof does <hi>Fancy, Reason</hi> and <hi>Animadversion</hi> lye? In this
laxe consistence that lyes like a Net all on heaps in the water,
I demand in what knot, loop, or Intervall thereof does this
faculty of free <hi>Fancy</hi> and active <hi>Reason</hi> reside? I believe you
will be asham'd to assigne me any: and if you will say in
all together, you must say that the whole brain is figured
into this or that representation, which would cancell Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
and take away all capacity of there being any distinct
Notes and places for the severall Species of things there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented.
But if you will say there is in <hi>Every part</hi> of the
brain this power of <hi>Animadversion</hi> and <hi>Fansy,</hi> you are to
remember that the brain is in some measure a <hi>liquid body,</hi>
and we must inquire how these loose parts vnderstand one
anothers severall <hi>Animadversions</hi> and <hi>Notions:</hi> And if
they could (which is yet very inconceivable) yet if they
could from hence doe any thing toward the <hi>immission</hi> and
<hi>direction</hi> of the <hi>Animall Spirits</hi> into this or or that part of
the Body, they must doe it by knowing one anothers minds,
and by a joynt contention of strength, as when many men
at once, the word being given, lift or tugge together for the
moving of some so masty a body that the single strength of
one could not deal with. But this is to make the severall
particles of the brain so many <hi>Individuall persons;</hi> A fitter
object for laughter then the least measure of beliefe.</p>
               <p>Besides how come these many animadversions to seem
but one to us, our mind being these, as is supposed? Or why
if the figuration of one part of the brain be communicated
to all the rest, does not the same object seem situated both
behind us and before us, above and beneath, on the right
hand and on the left, and every way as the Impresse of the
object is reflected against all the parts of the braines?
But there appearing to us but one animadversion and
one site of things, it is a sufficient Argument that
there is but one, or if there be many, that they are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62817:36"/>
not mutually communicated from the parts one to another,
and therefore there can be no such joynt endeavour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
one designe, whence it is manifest that the <hi>Braines</hi>
cannot <hi>immit</hi> nor direct these <hi>Animall Spirits</hi> into what
part of the Body they please.</p>
               <p>Moreover that the <hi>Braine</hi> has <hi>no Sense,</hi> and therefore
cannot impresse spontaneously any motion on the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
Spirits,</hi> it is no slight Argument in that some being
dissected have been found without Braines, and <hi>Fontanus</hi>
tells us of a boy at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> that had nothing but
limpid water in his head in stead of Braines; and the
Braines generally are easily dissolvable into a watry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
which agrees with what I intimated before. Now
I appeale to any free Judge how likely these liquid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
are to approve themselves of that nature and power
as to bee able by erecting and knitting themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a moment of time, to beare themselves so as with
one joynt contention of strength to cause an arbitrarious
ablegation of the Spirits into this or that determinate part
of the Body. But the absurdity of this I have sufficiently
insinuated already.</p>
               <p>Lastly the <hi>Nerves,</hi> I mean the Marrow of them which
is of the self same substance with the Braine, have <hi>no
Sense</hi> as is demonstrable from a <hi>Catalepsis</hi> or <hi>Catochus:</hi>
but I will not accumulate Arguments in a Matter so pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.</p>
               <p>As for that little sprunt piece of the Braine which they
call the <hi>Conarion,</hi> that this should be the very substance
whose naturall faculty it is to move it self, and by it's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Nods to determinate the course of the <hi>Spirits</hi>
into this or that part of the Body, seems to me no lesse foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and fabulous then the story of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that could change
the wind as he pleased by setting his Cap on this or that
side of his head.</p>
               <p>If you heard but the magnificent stories that are told
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62817:37"/>
of this little lurking Mushrome, how it does not onely
heare and see, but imagines, reasons, commands the whole
fabrick of the Body more dextrously then an <hi>Indian</hi> boy
does an <hi>Elephant,</hi> what an acute <hi>Logician,</hi> subtle <hi>Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
prudent <hi>Statesman,</hi> skillfull <hi>Physician</hi> and profound
<hi>Philosopher</hi> he is, and then afterward by dissection you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
this worker of Miracles to be nothing but a poor
silly contemptible Knobb or Protuberancy consisting of a
thin Membrane containing a little pulpous Matter much
of the same nature with the rest of the Braine,
<q>Spectatum admissirisum teneatis amici?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Would not you sooner laugh at it then goe about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it? And truly I may the better laugh at it now, having
already confuted it in what I have afore argued concerning
the rest of the braine.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore make bold to conclude that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
of <hi>Spontaneous Motion</hi> is neither from the <hi>Animall
Spirits</hi> nor from the <hi>Braine,</hi> and therefore that those opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that are usually attributed unto the Soul are really
incompetible to any part of the Body; and therefore that
the <hi>Soul</hi> is not a meer <hi>Modification</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> but a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
distinct</hi> therefrom.</p>
               <p>Now we are to enquire whether this <hi>Substance distinct</hi>
from what ordinarily we call the Body, be also it self a
<hi>Corporeall</hi> Substance, or whether it be <hi>Incorporeall.</hi> If
you say that it is a <hi>Corporeall</hi> Substance, you can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
no other then Matter more subtile and tenuious then
the Animall Spirits themselves, mingled with them and
dispersed through the vessells and Porosities of the Body,
for there can be no Penetration of Dimensions. But I need
no new Arguments to confute this fond conceipt, for
what I said of the <hi>Animall Spirits</hi> before, is applicable
with all ease and fitnesse to this present case. And let
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62817:37"/>
it be sufficient that I advertise you so much, and so be
excus'd from the repeating of the same things over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore that we conclude that that which

               <p>And now this prize that we have wonne will prove for
our designe of very great Consequence. For it is obvious
here to observe that the Soul of man is as it were <gap reason="foreign">

Substance and Motion of the vast <hi>Heavens</hi> on a little <hi>Sphere</hi>

of the <hi>All-mighty</hi> in this little <hi>Meddall of God,</hi> the
Soul of Man, enlarging to Infinity what we observe in our

those <hi>Circles</hi> which we view on the <hi>Globea</hi> to be vastly bigger

                  </gap>ow so bold as to conceipt any such thing,
let him examine his Faculties what they naturally conceive
of the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Matter.</hi> And verily the great Master of

of any <hi>Specificall difference</hi> in this universall Matter, out of
which this outward frame of the World should arise. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I think that any Man else will easily imagine but
that all the Matter of the world is of one kind for its very

               <p>Now therefore I demand concerning this universall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

(as indeed it is very hard to conceive it, the matter sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
homogeneall) but that it is inert and stupid of it self;
then it must be moved from some other, and thus of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
we shall be cast upon a God, or at least a Spirituall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
actuating the Matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Atheists are as much

               <p>But men that are much degenerate know not the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Emanations of their own Minds, but think of all things
confusedly, and therefore it may be will not stick to affirm,

others inclinable to <hi>Rest,</hi> and was ever so; for it
happened so to be, though there be no reason for it in the

a gap, that after this they will let in any thing, and take
away all pretence to any principles of Knowledge.</p>
               <p>But to scuffle and combat with them in their own dark

                  </gap>verns, let the universall Matter be a heterogeneall <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os</hi>
of Confusion, variously moved and as it happens: I say
there is no likelyhood that this mad <hi>Motion</hi> would ever
amount to so wise a Contrivance as is discernable even in the
generall Delineations of Nature. Nay it will not amount
to a naturall appearance of what we see and is conceived
most easy thus to come to passe, to wit, a round <hi>

                     </gap>,
Moon,</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> For it is shrewdly to be suspected that
if there were no <hi>Superintendent</hi> over the Motions of those
<hi>Aetheriall Whirle-pooles,</hi> which the French Philosophy
supposes, that the form of the <hi>Sun</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Starres</hi>
would be <hi>oblong</hi> not <hi>round,</hi> because the Matter recedes all
along the <hi>Axis</hi> of a <hi>Vortex,</hi> as well as from the <hi>Center,</hi> and
therefore naturally the Space that is left for the finest and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62817:40"/>
subtilest Element of all, of which the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Starres</hi> are
to consist, will be <hi>Long</hi> not <hi>Round.</hi> Wherefore this <hi>Round</hi>
Figure we see them in, must proceed from some higher prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
then the meere Agitation of the Matter: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
simply <hi>Spermaticall,</hi> or <hi>Sensitive</hi> also and <hi>Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
I'le leave to the disquisition of others who are more at
leasure to meddle with such Curiosities.</p>
               <p>The Businesse that lies me in hand to make good is this,
that taking that for granted which these great Naturallists
would have allowed, to wit, that <hi>the Earth moves about
the Sunne,</hi> I say the laws of its Motion are such, that if they
had been imposed on her by humane Reason and Counsell,
they would have been no other then they are. So that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to our own faculties, we are to confesse that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Starres,</hi> or of the <hi>Earth,</hi> as our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallists
would have it, is from a <hi>knowing Principle,</hi> or at
least has pass'd the Approbation and Allowance of such a
Principle.</p>
               <p>For as Art takes what Nature wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l afford for her purpose,
and makes up the rest her self; So the <hi>Eternall Mind</hi> (that
put the universall Matter upon Motion, as I conceive most
reasonable, or if the Matter be confusedly mov'd of its self,
as the Atheist wilfully contends) this <hi>Eternall Mind,</hi> I say,
takes the easy and naturall results of this generall Impresse
of <hi>Motion,</hi> where they are for his purpose, where they are not
he rectifies and compleats them.</p>
               <p>And verily it is farre more suteable to Reason that God
making the <hi>Matter</hi> of that nature that it can by meere
<hi>Motion</hi> produce something, that it should go on so farre as
that single advantage could naturally carry it, that so the
wit of Man, whom God has made to contemplate the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
of Nature, may have a more fit object to exercise
it self upon. For thus is the understanding of Man very
highly gratifi'd, when the works of God and there manner
of production are made intelligible unto him by a naturall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62817:40"/>
deduction of one thing from another: which would not
have been if God had on purpose avoided what the <hi>Matter</hi>
upon <hi>Motion</hi> naturally afforded, and cancelled the laws
thereof in every thing. Besides to have altered or added
any thing further where there was no need, had been to
<hi>Multiply Entities</hi> to no purpose.</p>
               <p>Thus it is therefore with Divine Providence; what that
one single Impresse of <hi>Motion</hi> upon the <hi>Vniversall Matter</hi>
will afford that is usefull and good, it does allow and take
in; what it might have miscarried in, or could not amount
to, it directs or supplies. As in little pieces of wood natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
bow'd like a Mans Elbow, the Carver does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
it, but carves an hand at the one end of it, and shapes
it into the compleat figure of a Mans Arme.</p>
               <p>That therefore that I contend for is this, that be the
<hi>Matter moved</hi> how it will, the <hi>Appearances</hi> of <hi>things</hi> are
such as do manifestly intimate that they are either appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all of them, or at least approved by an <hi>universall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
of <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Counsell.</hi>

the Sun stay so long describing his little Circles neer the

               <p>It remaines therefore that the posture of the <hi>Axis</hi> of the

forenamed Plane. And verily it is not onely <hi>inclining,</hi> but
in so fit proportion, that there can be no fitter excogi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ated,
to make it to the utmost capacity as well pleasant as habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
For though the course of the Sun be curbed within the
compasse of the <hi>Tropicks</hi> and so makes those parts very hot,
yet the constantgales of wind from the East (to say nothing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62817:42"/>
of the nature and fit length of their nights) make the <hi>Torrid
Zone</hi> not only habitable but pleasant.</p>
               <p>Now this best posture which our Reason would make
choise of, we see really establish'd in Nature, and therefore,
if we be not perverse and willful, we are to inferre that it was
established by a <hi>Principle</hi> that has in it <hi>Knowledge</hi> and
<hi>Counsell,</hi> not from a blind fortuitous jumbling of the
parts of the Matter one against another, especially having
found before in ourselves a <hi>knowing Spiritual Substance</hi> that
is also able to move and alter the Matter. Wherefore I say
we should more naturally conclude, that there is some such
<hi>universall knowing Principle,</hi> that has power to move and
direct the Matter; then to fancy that a confused justling of
the Parts of the Matter should contrive themselves into
such a condition, as if they had in them Reason and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
and could direct themselves. But this directing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
what could it be but <hi>God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to speake the same thing more briefly and yet more
intelligibly, to those that are only acquainted with the <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaicall
Hypothesis:</hi> I say that being it might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that the annuall course of the <hi>Sun</hi> should have been
through the <hi>Poles</hi> of the world, and that the <hi>Axis</hi> of the
Heavens might have been very troublesomely and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
moveable, from whence all those inconveniencies
would arise which I have above mentioned; and yet they
are not but are so ordered as our own Reason must approve
of as best; it is Naturall for a man to conceive, that they are
really ordered by a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Counsell,</hi> that
is, that they are made by an all wise and all-powerful <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will only adde one or two observables more, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Axis</hi> of the Earth and the course of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and
so I will passe to other things.</p>
               <p>It cannot but be acknowledged that if the <hi>Axis</hi> of the
Earth were <hi>perpendicular</hi> to the Plane of the Sun's <hi>Ecliptick,</hi>
that her Motion would be more easy and naturall, and yet
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62817:42"/>
for the conveniencies afore mentioned we see it is made to
stand in an <hi>inclining</hi> posture. So in all likelyhood it would
be more easy and naturall for that hand-maid of the
Earth the <hi>Moon,</hi> to finish her Monethly courses in the
<hi>Aequinoctiall Line,</hi> but we see like the Sun she crosses
it and expatiates some degrees further then the Sun him
self, that her exalted light might be more comfortable to
those that live very much North, in their long Nights.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conclude that though it were possible, that
the confused agitation of the parts of the Matter might
make a round hard heap like the <hi>Earth,</hi> and more thin and
liquid bodies like the <hi>Aether,</hi> and <hi>Sun,</hi> and that the <hi>Earth</hi>
may swimme in this liquid <hi>Aether</hi> like a rosted Apple in a
great bowle of wine, and be carried about like straws or
grasse cast upon a whirle-poole, yet that it's <hi>Motion</hi> and
<hi>Posture</hi> should be so directed and attemper'd as we our
selves that have Reason upon due consideration would have
it to be; and yet not to be from that which is <hi>Knowing</hi> and
in some sense <hi>Reasonable;</hi> is to our faculties, if they discerne
any thing at all, as absonous and absurd as any thing can
be. For when it had been easier to have been otherwise,
why should it be thus, if some <hi>Superintendent Cause</hi> did
not oversee and direct the Motions of the Matter, allowing
nothing therein but what our Reason will confesse to be to
very good purpose?</p>
               <p>But because so many <hi>Bullets</hi> joggled together in a
Mans Hat will settle to such a determinate figure, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Frost</hi> and the <hi>Wind</hi> will draw upon dores and
Glasse-windows pretty uncouth streaks like feathers, and
other fooleries which are to no use or purpose, to inferre
thence that <hi>all the Contrivances</hi> that are in <hi>Nature,</hi> even
the frame of the <hi>bodyes</hi> both of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> are from
no other principle but the jumbling together of the Matter,
and so because that this does naturally effect something
that it is the cause of all things, seems to me, to be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62817:43"/>
in the same <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> with that wise
Market-mans, who going down a Hill, and carrying his
<hi>Cheeses</hi> under his Armes, one of them falling and trundling
down the Hill very fast, let the other go after it, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them all to meet him at his house at <hi>Gotham,</hi> not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
but they beginning so hopefully would be able to
make good the whole journey. Or like another of the same
Town, who perceiving that his <hi>Iron Trevet</hi> he had bought
had three feet, and could stand, expected also that it should
walk too and save him the labour of the Carriage. So our
profound <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> according to the same
pitch of Wisdome do not stick to infe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e, because this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
<hi>Motion</hi> of the parts of the <hi>Master</hi> may amount
to a rude delineation of hard and soft, rigid and fluid, and
the like; that therefore it will go on further and reach to
the disposing of the Matter in such order as does naturally
imply a <hi>Principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that someway or other contains in it
exact <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Counsell.</hi> A position more beseeming
the Wise-men above mentioned, then any one that has the
least command of his naturall wit and faculties.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we having sufficiently detected the ridiculous
folly of this present Sophisme, let us attending heedfully to
the naturall emanations of unprejudic'd reason conclude,
that <hi>the Rising and Setting of the lights of Heaven, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude

ordered and guided, as if they had been settled by exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site

from the Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and so in the rest.
But I will not insist upon this, I will now betake my self
to what does more forcibly declare an Eye of Providence,
directing and determining as well as approving of the results
of the supposed agitation of the parts of the Matter.</p>
               <p>And that you may the better feel the strength of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
let us first briefly consider the nature of Man,
what faculties he has, and in what order he is in respect of
the rest of the Creatures. And indeed though his body he
but weak and disarmed, yet his inward abilities of Reason
and Artificiall contrivance is admirable. He is much given
to Contemplation, and the viewing of this Theatre of the
world, to trafick and commerce with forrain Nations, to
the building of Houses and Ships, to the making curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of Silver, Brasse or Steele, and the like. In a
word he is the flower and chief of all the products of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon this Globe of the Earth. Now if I can shew that
there are designes laid even in the lowest and vilest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of Nature that respect Man the highest of all, you
cannot deny but that there is an <hi>Eye</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> that
respecteth all things, and passeth very swiftly from the
Top to the Bottome, disposing all things wisely.</p>
               <p>I therefore now demand, Man being of this nature that
he is, whether these noble faculties of his would not be lost
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62817:44"/>
and frustrate were there not Materialls to excercise them
on. And in the second place I desire to know, whether the
rude confused <hi>Agitation</hi> of the <hi>particles</hi> of the Matter do
certainly produce any such Materialls fit for Man to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
his skill on or no; That is to say, whether there were
any Necessity that could infallibly produce <hi>Quarries</hi> of
<hi>Stone</hi> in the Earth which are the chief Materialls of all the
Magnificent Structures of building in the world; And the
same of <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Steel,</hi> without which there had been no
use of these stones; And then of <hi>Sea-Coal</hi> and other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<hi>Fewel,</hi> fit for the working or melting of these Metalls;
and also of <hi>Timber Trees,</hi> for all might have been as well
brush-wood and shrubs; And then assuredly there had
been no such convenient shipping, what ever had become
of other buildings; And so of the <hi>Load-stone</hi> that great
help to Navigation, whether it might not have laine so low
in the Earth as never to have been reached by the Industry
of Man; and the same may be said also of other <hi>Stones</hi> and
<hi>Metalls,</hi> that they being heaviest might have laine lowest.
Assuredly the <hi>Agitated</hi> Matter, unlesse there were some
speciall over-powering guidance over it, might as well have
over-slipt these necessary usefull things, as hit upon them:
But if there had not been such a Creature as Man, these very
things themselves had been uselesse, for none of the bruit
beasts make use of such commodities, Wherefore unlesse
a man will doe enormous violence to his faculties, he must
conclude that there is a contrivance of <hi>Providence</hi> and
<hi>Counsell</hi> in all those things, which reacheth from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the end, and orders all things sweetly. And that
<hi>Providence</hi> foreseeing what a kind of Creature she would
make <hi>Man,</hi> provided him with materialls from whence
he might be able to adorne his present Age, and furnish
History with the Records of egregious exploits both of Art
and Valour. But without the provision of the forenamed
Materialls, the Glory and Pompe both of warre and Peace
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62817:45"/>
had been lost. For men instead of those magnificent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
which are seen in the world, could have had no better
kind of dwellings, then a bigger sort of Bee-hives or Birds-nests
made of contemptible sticks and straws &amp; durty mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And instead of the usuall pompe and bravery of warre,
wherein is heard the solemne sound of the hoarse Trumpett,
the couragious beating of the Drumm, the neighing and
pransing of the Horses, clattering of Armour, and the terrible
thunder of Cannons, to say nothing of the glittering of the
Sword and Spear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the waving and fluttering of displayed
Colours, the gallantry of Charges upon their well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Steeds and the like: I say had it not been for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
provision of <hi>Iron, Steel</hi> and <hi>Brasse,</hi> and such like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Materialls, instead of all this glory and solemnity,
there had been nothing but howlings and showtings of
poor naked men belabouring one another with snag'd sticks,
or dully falling together by the eares at Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ti-cuffs. Besides
this, Beasts being naturally armed, and men naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
with any thing save their Reason, and Reason being
ineffectuall having no materialls to work upon, it is plaine
that that which made Men, Beasts and Metalls, knew
what it did, and did not forget it self in leaving Man desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of naturall Armature, having provided Materialls, and
giving him wit and abilityes to arme himself, and so to be
able to make his party good against the most fierce and
stoutest of all living Creatures whatsoever, nay indeed left
him unarmed on purpose that he might arme himself and
excercise his naturall wit and industry.</p>

been <hi>Sea</hi> or <hi>Quag-mire.</hi> Secondly though this distinction
of <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> be made, whether this watry Element
might not have fallen out to be of so <hi>thin</hi> a consistency as
that it would not beare Shipping; For it is so farre from

we know there is some kind of wood so heavy, that it will

               <p>Thirdly and lastly, I appeale to any mans reason, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not better that there should be a distinction of
<hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> then that all should be mire or water; and
whether it be not better that the Timber-trees afford wood
so light that it swim on the water, or the water be so heavy
that it will beare up the wood, then the Contrary. That
therefore which might have been otherwise, and yet is
settled according to our own hearts wish who are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and rationall Creatures, ought to be deemed by us
as established by <hi>Counsell</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> And the closer we

of those sagacious suggestions of his own mind, that is,
whether the <hi>Earth</hi> be every way <hi>round,</hi> and whether there
be any <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and the like; and by cutting the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall

the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> or rather wipes out that blot that lay upon
divine Providence, as if so great a share of the world had

the <hi>Beauty of Plants</hi> is an argument that they are from

               <p>HItherto we have only considered the more rude and

&amp; their great <hi>Vse</hi> as well for Medicine as Sustenance.
And that we may the better understand the advantage we
have in this closer Contemplation of the works of Nature,
we are in the first place to take notice of the condition of
that Substance which we call <hi>Matter,</hi> how fluid and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and undeterminate it is of it self: or if it be hard, how
unfit it is to be chang'd into any thing else. And therefore
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62817:47"/>
all things rot into a moisture before any thing can be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of them, as we soften the wax before we set on the Seal.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, unlesse we will be so foolish, as because
the uniforme motion of the Aire, or some more subtile cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall
Element, may so equally compresse or beare against
the parts of a little vapourous moisture as to forme it into
round drops (as we see in the Dew and other Experiments)
and therefore because this more rude and generall Motion
can do something, to conclude that it does all things; we
must in all Reason confesse that there is an <hi>Eternall Mind,</hi>
in vertue whereof the <hi>Matter</hi> is thus usefully formed and
changed.</p>
               <p>But meere rude and undirected Motion, because natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
it will have some kind of Results, that therefore it will
reach to such as plainly imply a wise contrivance of <hi>Counsell,</hi>
is so ridiculous a Sophisme, as I have already intimated,
that it is more fit to impose upon the inconsiderate Souls
of Fooles and Children then upon men of mature Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and well exercis'd in Philosophy. Admit that <hi>Raine</hi>
and <hi>Snow</hi> and <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Haile</hi> and <hi>Ice</hi> and such like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors
may be the products of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> or of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Rest</hi> of certaine small particles of the Matter; yet
that the usefull and beautifull contrivance of the <hi>branches,
flowers</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> should be so too (to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
yet of the bodyes of Birds, Fishes, Beasts and Men)
is as ridiculous and supine a Collection, as to inferre that
because mere Heat and Cold does <hi>soften</hi> and <hi>harden waxe</hi>
and puts it into some shape or other, that therefore this
mere Heat and Cold or Motion and Rest, without any
art or direction made the <hi>Silver Seal</hi> too, and graved upon
it so curiously some <hi>Coat of Armes,</hi> or the shape of some
<hi>Birds</hi> or <hi>Beasts,</hi> as an <hi>Eagle,</hi> a <hi>Lyon</hi> and the like. Nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this inference is more tolerable farre then the other,
these effects of <hi>Art</hi> being more easy and lesse noble then
those others of <hi>Nature.</hi>

Nor is it any botch or gap at all in the works of Nature
that some particular <hi>Phaenomena</hi> be but the easy results of
that <hi>generall Motion</hi> communicated unto the Matter from
God, others the effects of more curious <hi>contrivance</hi> or of

would not continue the Motion that it is put upon when it

from the highest perfection, it will be no uneven or

outward Creation, <hi>Man,</hi> in whom there is a principle of
more fine and reflexive Reason, which hangs on, though
not in that manner in the more perfect kind of Brutes, as

there be the effects of an inadvertent form (<gap reason="foreign">

it is no uneven jot, to passe from the more faint and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure

effects of <hi>generall Motion,</hi> in <hi>Mineralls, Metalls</hi>

               <p>But there is that Curiosity of <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> in the

harmony with the more refined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Touch being so sweetly gratifide by what it deprehends in

such like Objects but acknowledge that some hidden Cause
much a kin to his own nature, that is intellectuall, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver
&amp; perfecter of these so pleasant spectacles in the world.</p>
               <p>Nor is it all to the purpose to object, that this buisinesse
of <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>comelinesse</hi> of <hi>proportion</hi> is but a conceit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some men acknowledge no such thing, &amp; all things are
alike handsome to them, who yet notwithstanding have the
use of their Eyes as well as other folkes. For I say this rather
makes for what we a yme at, that pulchritude is convey'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
by the outward Senses unto the Soul, but a more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall
faculty is that which relishes it; as a <hi>Geometricall
Scheme</hi> is let in by the Eyes, but the demonstration is discern'd
by Reason. And therefore it is more rationall to affirm that
some <hi>Intellectuall Principle</hi> was the Authour of this <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude</hi>
of things, then that they should be thus fashion'd
without the help of that Principle. And to say that there is no
such thing as <hi>Pulchritude,</hi> because some mens Souls are so dull
&amp; stupid that they relish all objects alike in that respect, is
as absurd and groundlesse as to conclude there is no such
thing as <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Demonstration,</hi> because a naturall Fool
cannot reach unto it. But that there is such a thing as <hi>Beauty,</hi>
&amp; that it is acknowledged by the whole generations of Men
to be in <hi>Trees, Flowers</hi> and <hi>Fruits;</hi> the adorning and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying

Testimony. For what is more ordinary with them then the
taking in flowers and fruitage for the garnishing of their
work? Besides I appeal to any man that is not sunk into so

things as the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thing near this Geometricall accuracy, that we take notice
of it with much content and pleasure; As if it be but exactly

the Soul of man, that is rationall and intellectuall; and

<hi>Correspondency of parts</hi> is the discernment of <hi>Reason,</hi> not the
object of <hi>Sense,</hi> as I have heretofore proved.</p>
               <p>Now therefore it being evident that there is such a
thing as <hi>Beauty, Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Comelinesse of Proportion</hi>
(to say nothing of the delightfull mixture of colours)
and that this is the proper Object of the Understanding and
Reason (for these things be not taken notice of by the
Beasts) I think I may safely inferre that whatever is the
first and principall cause of changing the fluid and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated

as wee see in <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> is an <hi>understanding Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>

               <head type="sub">The <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>Signatures of Plants,</hi> arguments of a divine
Providence.</head>
               <p>I Say therefore in that every Plant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has its <hi>Seed,</hi> it is an
evident signe of divine Providence. For it being no
necessary Result of the Motion of the Matter, as the whole
contrivance of the Plant indeed is not, and it being of so
great consequence that they have <hi>Seed</hi> for the continuance
and propagation of their own <hi>Species,</hi> and for the gartify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of mans Art also, industry and necessityes, (for much
of husbandry and gradening lyes in this) it cannot but be an
Act <hi>of Counsell</hi> to furnish the severall kinds of Plants with
their <hi>Seeds,</hi> especially the Earth being of such a nature, that
though at first for a while it might bring forth all manner
of <hi>Plants,</hi> (as some will have it also to have brought forth
all kinds of <hi>Animalls</hi>) yet at last it would grow so slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish,
that without the advantage of those small compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Principles of generation, the graines of <hi>Seed,</hi> it would
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62817:49"/>
yield no such births; no more then a Pump grown dry will
yield any water, unless you pour a little water into it first, &amp;
then for one Bason-full you may fetch up so many Soe-fulls.</p>
               <p>Nor is it materiall to object that stinking <hi>weeds,</hi> and
<hi>poysonous Plants</hi> bear <hi>seed</hi> too as well as the most <hi>pleasant</hi>
and most <hi>usefull,</hi> For even those stinking <hi>weeds</hi> and <hi>poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Plants</hi> have their use. For first the Industry of Man is
excercised by them to weed them out where they are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Which reason if it seem slight, let us but consider that
if humane Industry had nothing to conflict and struggle
with, the fire of mans Spirit would be half extinguish'd
in the flesh, and then wee shall acknowledge that that
which I have alledged is not so contemptible nor invalid.</p>
               <p>But secondly who knows but it is so with poysonous
<hi>Plants,</hi> as vulgarly is phansied concerning <hi>Toads</hi> and other
poysonous <hi>Serpents,</hi> that they lick the venome from off the
Earth? so poysonous <hi>plants</hi> may well draw to them all the
maligne juice and nourishment that the other may be more
pure and defaecate, as there are Receptacles in the body of
Man and Emunctories to draine them of superfluous Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
Melancholy and the like.</p>
               <p>But lastly it is very well known by them that know any
thing in Nature and Physick, that those herbs that the
rude and ignorant would call <hi>weeds</hi> are the Materialls of
very soveraigne Medicines, that <hi>Aconitum hyemale</hi> or
<hi>Winter wolfes bane,</hi> that otherwise is ranck poyson, is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to prevaile mightily against the bitings of vipers and
scorpions, which <hi>Crollius</hi> assenteth unto. And that that
plant that bears death in the very name of it, <hi>Solanum Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiferum,</hi>
prevents death by procuring sleep, if it be rightly
apply'd in a feaver. Nor are those things to be deemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
whose use we know not yet, for all is not to be
known at once, that succeeding Ages may ever have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left to gratifie themselves in their own discoveries.</p>
               <p>We come now to the <hi>Signatures</hi> of Plants, which seems
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62817:50"/>
no lesse Argument that the highest originall of the works
of Nature is some <hi>understanding Principle,</hi> then that so
carefull provision of their <hi>seed.</hi> Nay indeed this respects
us more properly and adaequare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y then the other, and is a
certaine Key to enter Man into the knowledge and use of
the Treasures of Nature. I demand therefore whether it be
not a very easie and genuine inference from the observing
that severall herbs are marked with some <hi>marke</hi> or <hi>signe</hi>
that intimates their vertue, what they are good for; and
there being such a creature as Man in the world that can
read and understand these <hi>signes</hi> and <hi>characters,</hi> hence to
collect that the Authour both of Man and them knew the
nature of them both; For it is like the inscriptions upon
Apothecaries Boxes that the Master of the Shop <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Apprentise may read them; nay it is better, for here is

meere <hi>name.</hi> Nor is there any necessity that all should be
thus signed, though some be; for the rarity of it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
for otherwise it had been dull and cloying, too much
harping upon the same string. And besides divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
would onely initiate and enter mankind into the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
knowledge of her Treasures, leaving the rest to imploy
our industry that we might not live like idle Loyterers and
Truants. For the Theatre of the world is an excercise of
Mans wit, not a lazy <hi>Polyanthea</hi> or book of Common
places. And therefore all things are in some measure obscure
and intricate, that the sedulity of that divine Spark the Soul
of Man, may have matter of conquest and triumph when he
has done bravely by a superadvenient assistance of his God.</p>
               <p>But that there be some Plants that bear a very evident
<hi>Signature</hi> of their <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>use,</hi> I shall fully make good
by these following instances.</p>

unlike the beard of that lecherous Animall, is of all the
rest the most powerful Incentive to Lust.</p>
               <p>The leaves of <hi>Hypericon,</hi> are very thick prick'd, or
pinck'd with little holes, and it is a singular good wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herb,
as usefull also for deobstructing the pores of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scorpioides, Echium,</hi> or <hi>Scorpion-grasse</hi> is like the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
tayle of a Scorpion, and <hi>Ophioglossum</hi> or <hi>Adders-tongue</hi>
has a very plain and perfect resemblance of the tongue of a
Serpent, as also <hi>Ophioscorodon</hi> of the intire head and upper
parts of the body, and these are all held very good against
poyson and the biting of Serpents. And generally all such
plants as are speckled with spots like the skins of vipers or
other venemous creatures, are known to be good against
the stings or bitings of them, and are powerfull Antidotes
against Poyson.</p>
               <p>Thus did divine Providence by naturall <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi>
read short Physick lectures to the rude wit of man, that
being a little entered and engaged he might by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62817:51"/>
and endeavours search out the rest himself, it being
very reasonable that other herbs that had not such <hi>signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
might be very good for Medicinall uses, as well as
they that had.</p>
               <p>But if any here object that some herbs have the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of such things as cannot in any likelyhood referre to
Physick, as <hi>Geranium, Cruciata, Bursa Pastoris,</hi> &amp; the like;
I say they answer themselves in the very proposall of their
Objection: For this is a signe that they were intended
onely for ludicrous ornaments of Nature, like the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
about a great letter that signify nothing but are made
onely to delight the Eye. And 'tis so farre from being any
inconvenience to our first progenitours if this intimation of
<hi>signatures</hi> did faile, that it cast them with more courage
upon attempting the vertue of those that had no such <hi>signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
at all; it being obvious for them to reason thus, Why
may not those herbs have medicinall vertue in them that
have no <hi>signatures,</hi> as well as they that have <hi>signatures</hi>
have no vertue answerable to the <hi>signes</hi> they beare? which
was a further confirmation to them of the former conclusion.</p>
               <p>And it was sufficient that those that were of so present
and great consequence as to be Antidotes against poyson
that so quickly would have dispatch'd poore rude and
naked Antiquity, or to helpe on the small beginnings of
the world by quickning and actuating their phlegmatick
Natures to more frequent and effectuall Venery (for
their long lives shew they were not very fiery) I say it was
sufficient that herbs of this kind were so legibly <hi>sign'd</hi> with
<hi>Characters</hi> that so plainly bewrai'd their usefull vertues, as
is manifest in your <hi>Satyrions, Ophioglossum,</hi> and the like.
But I have dwelt too long upon this Theory, wee'l betake
our selves to what followes.</p>

of <hi>Plants, viz.</hi> their <hi>Vse</hi> &amp; <hi>Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablenesse.</hi>
And to say nothing now of those greater <hi>Trees</hi>
that are fit for <hi>Timber,</hi> and are the requisite Materials for
the <hi>building</hi> of Ships and magnificent Houses, to adorne the
Earth, and make the life of Man more splendid and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable;
as also for the erecting of those <hi>holy Structures</hi>
consecrated to divine Worship amongst which we are not
to forget that famous Aedifice, that glorious Temple at
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> consecrated to the great God of Heaven and
Earth: As indeed it was most fit that he whose Guidance &amp;
Providence permitted not the strength of the Earth to
spend it self in base gravel and pebbles insteed of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Stones, nor in briars and brush-wood instead of
Pines, Cedars and Okes, that he should at some time or
other have the most stately magnificent <hi>Temples</hi> erected to
him, that the wit and industry of Man and the best of
those materials could afford. It being the most suteable
acknowledgment of thanks for that piece of Providence
that can be invented. And it is the very consideration that
moved that pious King <hi>David</hi> to designe the building of
a Temple to the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> See now, sayes he, I
dwell in a house of Cedar, but the Arke of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

concerning these things being contented with what I have
glanced upon heretofore.</p>
               <p>We will now briefly take notice of the <hi>profitablenesse</hi> of
Plants for <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Food,</hi> and then paste on to the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of <hi>Animalls.</hi> And as for their <hi>Medicinall</hi> uses,
the large Herballs that are every where to be had
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62817:52"/>
are so ample Testimonies thereof, that I have said enough
in but reminding you of them. That which is most obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
here is this, that brute <hi>Beasts</hi> have some share in their
vertue as well as <hi>Men.</hi> For the <hi>Toad</hi> being overcharged
with the poison of the <hi>Spider,</hi> as is ordinary believed, has
recourse to the <hi>Plantane leafe.</hi> The <hi>Weasel</hi> when she is to
encounter the <hi>Serpent,</hi> armes her self with eating of <hi>Rue.</hi>
The <hi>Dog</hi> when he is sick at the stomach, knows his Cure,
falls to his <hi>Grasse,</hi> vomits, and is well. The <hi>Swallowes</hi>
make use of <hi>Celandine;</hi> the <hi>Linnet</hi> of <hi>Euphragia</hi> for the
repairing of their <hi>sight.</hi> And the <hi>Asse</hi> when hee's oppress'd
with Melancholy, eats of the herbe <hi>Asplenium</hi> or <hi>Milt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waste,</hi>
and so eases himself of the swelling of the <hi>Spleene.</hi>
And <hi>Virgill</hi> reports of the <hi>Dictamnum Cretense</hi> or <hi>Cretian
Dittany,</hi> that the <hi>wild Goats</hi> eate it when they are <hi>shot</hi> with
darts or arrowes, for that herb has the vertue to work them
out of their body and to heale up the wound.

               <p>Which things I conceive no obscure indigitation of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi>
For they doing that by instinct and nature, which
men who have free Reason cannot but acknowledge to be
very pertinent and fitting, nay such that the skillfullest
Physitian will approve and allow; and these Creatures ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no such reason and skill themselves, as to turne Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;
it must needs be concluded that they are inabled to do
these things by vertue of that <hi>Principle</hi> that contrived them,
and made them of that nature they are, and that that <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
therefore must have <hi>skill</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> that is, that
it must be <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come now to the consideration of Plants as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
<hi>Food</hi> both to Man and Beasts. And here we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that as there was a generall provision of <hi>water</hi> by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Mountains and Hills a broche, from whence through
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62817:52"/>
the Spring-heads and continued Rivulets drawn together
(that caused afterwards greater Rivers with the long wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
distributions of them) all the Creatures of the Earth
quench their thirst: So divine Providence has spread her
<hi>Table</hi> every where, not with a juicelesse green Carpet, but
with succulent <hi>Herbage</hi> and nourishing <hi>Grasse,</hi> upon which
most of the beasts of the field doe feed. And they that feed
not on it, feed on those that eate it, and so the generations
of them all are continued.</p>
               <p>But this seeming rather <hi>necessary</hi> then <hi>of choise,</hi> I will not
insist upon it. For I grant that Counsell most properly is
there implyde where we discerne a variety and possibility
of being otherwise, and yet the best is made choise of.
Therefore I will onely intimate thus much, that though it
were necessary that some such thing as <hi>grasse</hi> should be,
if there were such and such Creatures in the world, yet it
was not at all necessary that grasse and herbs should have
that <hi>colour</hi> which they have, for they might have been
red or white, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> some such colour which would have
been very offensive and hurtfull to our sight. But I will
not insist upon these things; let us now consider the
<hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> where I think it will appear very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly,
that there was one and the same Authour both of
Man and them, and that assuredly he knew what he did
when he made them. For could <hi>Apples,</hi> and <hi>Oranges,</hi> and
<hi>Grapes,</hi> and <hi>Apricocks,</hi> and such like fruit, be intended for
<hi>Beasts</hi> that hold their heads downward and can scarce
look up at them, much lesse know how to reach them?
When we feed our dogs, we set the dish or trencher on
the ground, nor on the Table. But you'le say that at last
these fruits will fall down, and then the beasts may come
at them: But one thing is, there are not many that desire
them, and so they would rot upon the ground before they
be spent, or be squander'd away in a moment of time, as it
might easily fare with the most precious of Plants the <hi>Vine.</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:62817:53"/>
But <hi>Man</hi> who knowes the worth of the <hi>Grape</hi> knowes to
preserve it a long season (for it is both eaten and drunk some
yeares after the vintage) as he does also gather the rest of
the fruits of the Earth, and layes up both for himself and his
Cattel: Wherefore it is plainly discoverable that Mans co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into the world, is not a thing of <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Necessity,</hi>
but <hi>a Designe,</hi> as the bringing of worthy Guests to a well
furnish'd Table.</p>
               <p>And what I have intimated concerning the <hi>Vine</hi> is as
eminently, if not more eminently, observable in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
kinds of <hi>Graine,</hi> as <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Barly,</hi> and the like,
which also like the <hi>Vine</hi> are made either <hi>Edible</hi> or <hi>Potable</hi>
by Mans Art and Industry; But that's not the thing that
I care so much to observe. That which I drive at now is
this: That <hi>Bread-corne</hi> that brings so considerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
by tillage and husbandry would scarce be at all
without it: for that which grows wildly of it self is worth
nothing: But it being so wholesome and strengthning a
food, that it should yield so plentifull increase, and that
this should not be without humane Art and Industry, does
plainly insinuate, that there is a divine <hi>Providence</hi> that
intended to excercise the wit of Man in <hi>Husbandry</hi> and <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage:</hi>
Which we may the more firmly assure our selves
of, if we add unto this the carefull provision of <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
so exactly fitted out for this imployment, <hi>viz.</hi> the
laborious <hi>Oxe,</hi> and the stout but easily manageable <hi>Horse;
Iron</hi> for the plough-share, and <hi>Ropes</hi> for the horse-geares
to pull by. And it is very seasonable to take notice of this
last, it belonging to this consideration of the profitablenesse
of <hi>Plants.</hi> And I appeale to any body that will but take
the pains a while to consider of what great use and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<hi>Cordage</hi> is in the affaires of Men, whether it was
not a palpable Act of Providence to send out such plants
out of the Earth which would affoord it. For we can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
no necessity in Nature that there must needs be such
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62817:53"/>
Plants as <hi>Hempe</hi> and <hi>Flaxe.</hi> Wherefore if we will but
follow the easy suggestions of free Reason, we muust cast
it upon <hi>Providence,</hi> which has provided Man-kind of such
a Commodity, that no lesse affaires depend upon, then all
the <hi>Tackling</hi> of Ships, their <hi>Sayles</hi> and <hi>Cable-ropes,</hi> and
what not? and so consequently all forraigne <hi>Traffick,</hi> and
then the transportation of wood and stone, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
materialls for building; or the carriage of them by
land in Waines and Carts, besides the ordinary use of <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes</hi>
or other <hi>Engines</hi> for the lifting up of heavy weights
which the strength of Man without these helps would not
easily master; besides what I hinted before concerning the
use of Cordage in <hi>Husbandry,</hi> in plowing and carrying
home the fruits of the Earth. The uses indeed of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Plants</hi> are so universall, and take place so in every
affaire of Man, that if it were lawfull to be a little merry in
so serious a matter, a man might not unfittingly apply that
verse of the Poet to this so generall a commodity;
<q>Omnia sunt homini tenui pendentia filo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That all the businesses of Men do very much depend
upon these little long fleaks or threds of <hi>Hempe</hi> and <hi>Flaxe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Or if you will say, that there may some scambling shift be
made without them in long chaines of Iron, or sayles of
Woollen and the like; yet we seeing our seives provided for
infinitely better, are in all reason to judge it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from no worse a Principle then <hi>divine Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might now reach out to <hi>Exotick Plants,</hi> such as the
<hi>Cinnamon</hi>-tree, the <hi>Balsame</hi>-tree, the Tree that beares the
<hi>Nutmegge</hi> invelloped with the <hi>Mace,</hi> as also the famous
<hi>Indian Nut</hi>-tree, which at once almost affords all the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
of life. For if they cut but the twiggs at Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
there is a plentifull and pleasant Juice comes out,
which they receive into Bottles and drink instead of <hi>Wine,</hi>
and out of which they extract such an <hi>Aqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vitae</hi> as is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62817:54"/>
very soveraign against all manner of sicknesses. The
branches and boughs they make their <hi>Houses</hi> of; and the
body of the Tree being very spongy within, though hard
without, they easily contrive into the frame and use of their
<hi>Canoes</hi> or <hi>boates.</hi> The kernell of the Nut serves them for
<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Meat,</hi> and the shells for <hi>Cups</hi> to drink in, and
indeed they are not mere empty <hi>Cups,</hi> for there is found a
delicious cooling Milk in them: Besides there is a kind of
Hemp that incloses the Nut, of which they make <hi>Ropes</hi>
and <hi>Cables,</hi> and of the finest of it <hi>Sailes</hi> for their ships; and
the leaves are so hard and sharpe-pointed, that they easily
make <hi>needles</hi> or <hi>bodkins</hi> of them, for stitching their Sailes
and for other necessary purposes. And that Providence
may shew her self benigne as well as wise, this so notable
a Plant is not restrain'd to one Coast of the world, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> but is found also in some parts of
<hi>Africa,</hi> and in all the Islands of the <hi>West-Indies, as Hispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola
Cuba,</hi> as also upon the Continent of <hi>Carthagena,</hi>
in <hi>Panama, Norembega,</hi> and severall others parts of the
new-found world.</p>
               <p>But I thought fit not to insist upon these things, but to
containe my self within the compasse of such Objects
as are familiarly and ordinarily before out eyes, that we
may the better take occasion from thence to return thanks to
him who is the bountiful Authour of all the supports of life.</p>

to Man-kind. And to dispatch this last first. It is
wonderfull easy and naturall to conceive, that as almost
all are made in some sort or other for humane uses, so some
so notoriously and evidently, that without maine violence
done to our faculties we can in no wise deny it. As to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in those things that are most obvious and familiar;
when we see in the solitary fields a <hi>Shepheard,</hi> his <hi>Flock,</hi>

<hi>This is he that
keepes the yard, the house and them within.</hi> Lastly when
we view in the open Champian a brace of swift <hi>Grey-hounds</hi>
coursing a good stout and well-breathed <hi>Hare,</hi> or
a pack of well tuned <hi>Hounds,</hi> and Huntsmen on their horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs

consider this so multifarious congruity and fitnesse of
things in reference to our selves, how can we withhold from
inferring, that that which made both <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Ducks</hi>
and <hi>Hares</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi> made them with a reference to us,
and knew what it did when it made them? And though it be
possible to be otherwise, yet it is highly improbable that the
flesh of <hi>Sheep</hi> should not be designed for food for men; and
that <hi>Dogs</hi> that are such a familiar and domestick Creature,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62817:55"/>
to Man, amongst other pretty feats that they doe for him,
should not be intended to supply the place of a servitour
too, and to take away the bones and scraps that nothing
might be lost. And unlesse we should expect that Nature
should make Jerkins &amp; Stockings grow out of the ground,
what could she doe better then afford us so fit materialls
for <hi>clothing</hi> as the <hi>Wooll</hi> of the Sheep, there being in Man
Wit and Art to make use of it? To say nothing of the <hi>Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme</hi>
that seems to come into the world for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Agains when we view those large Bodies of <hi>Oxen,</hi> what

them? Besides their <hi>Hides</hi> afford us <hi>Leather</hi> for <hi>Shooes</hi>

uses. And indeed Man seems to be brought into the world
on purpose that the rest of the Creation might be improved
to the utmost usefulnesse &amp; advantage; For were it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the <hi>hides</hi> of Beasts and their <hi>flesh</hi> should be made
so considerable use of as to <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>cloath</hi> Men, then that
they should rot and stink upon the ground, and fall short
of so noble an improvement as to be matter for the exercise
of the wit of Man, &amp; to afford him the necessary conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of life? For if Man did not make use of them, they
would either dye of Age, or be torne apieces by more cruel
Masters. Wherfore we plainly see that it is an Act of <hi>Reason</hi>

them srot upon the ground stinking and uselesse.</p>
               <p>Besides, all the wit and Philosophy in the world can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               </p>
               <p>But as for those <hi>Rebells</hi> that have fled into the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
and <hi>Deserts,</hi> they are to us a very pleasant subject of
naturall History besides we serve our selves of them as much
as is to our purpose. And they are not onely for ornaments
of the Universe, but a continuall Exercise of Mans Wit
and Valour when he pleases to encounter. But to expect
and wish that there were nothing but such dull <hi>tame</hi> things
in the world, that will neither bite nor scratch, is as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and childish as to wish there were no <hi>choler</hi> in the

               <p>I cannot insist upon the whole result of this warre,

own great advantage and ours. And verily he is so
fitly made for us, that we wight justly claim a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

and consequently his notable atchievements in <hi>war,</hi> where
he will knap the Speares a pieces with his teeth, and pull his
Riders Enemy out of the Saddle; and then that he might
be able to performe all this labour with more Ease, that
his <hi>hoofs</hi> are made so fit for the Art of the <hi>Smith,</hi> and that
round armature of Iron he puts upon them; it is a very
hard thing not to acknowledge, that this so congruous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of things was really from a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Wisdome</hi>

are pester'd with by reason of the abundance of some other
hurtfull Animalls, such as are <hi>Mice</hi> and <hi>Rats</hi> and the like;

               <p>We might add also sundry Examples of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that not onely bear a singular good affection to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,

make the succeeding chord goe off more pleasantly, as indeed
most of those momentany inconveniences that the life of
Man ever and anon meets withall they but put a greater
edge and vigour upon his Enioyments.</p>
               <p>But it is not hard to find very many Creatures, that are
either <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

that are either very <hi>goodly</hi> things and <hi>beautifull,</hi> or

some gallant <hi>Heros</hi> on his back, performing gracefully his
usefull postures, and practising his exploits of warre; who
can withhold from concluding that a providence brought
these two together, that are fitted so well to each other
that they seem but one compleat Spectacle of Nature?
which imposed upon the rude people neere <hi>Thessaly,</hi> and
gave the occasion of the fabulous <hi>Centaurs,</hi> as if they

               </p>
               <p>That which I drive at is this, there being that <hi>Goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
in the bodies of <hi>Animalls,</hi> as in the <hi>Oxe, Grey-hound</hi>

as in your best breed of <hi>Mastives;</hi> or <hi>Elegancy</hi> and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62817:57"/>
                  <hi>Prettinesse,</hi> as in your lesser <hi>Dogs,</hi> and most sorts of <hi>Birds,</hi>
all which are severall Modes or <hi>Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> being
an intellectuall Object, as <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> is
(which I proved sufficiently in what I spake concerning the
beauty of <hi>Plants</hi>) that which naturally followes from all
this is, that the <hi>Authour</hi> or <hi>Originall</hi> of these Creatures,
which are deemed <hi>beautifull,</hi> must himself be <hi>intellectuall,</hi>
he having contrived so gratefull objects to the Mind or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
of Man.</p>
               <p>After their Beauty let us touch upon their <hi>Birth</hi> or <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of <hi>Propagation.</hi> And here I appeale to any man whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the contrivance of <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> in living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
be not a genuine effect of <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Counsell;</hi> for
it is notoriously obvious that these are made one for the
other, and both for the continuation of the <hi>Species.</hi> For
though we should admit with <hi>Cardan</hi> and other Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
that the Earth at first brought forth all manner of
<hi>Animalls</hi> as well as Plants, and that they might be fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Navell to their common Mother the Earth,
as they are now to the <hi>Female</hi> in the Wombe; yet we see
she is growne steril and barren, and her births of <hi>Animalis</hi>
are now very inconsiderable. Wherefore what can it be
but a <hi>Providence,</hi> that whiles she did beare she sent out
<hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> that when her own Prolifick vertue
was wasted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet she might be a dry-Nurse or an officious
Grand-mother to thousands of generations? And I say it
is <hi>Providence,</hi> not <hi>Chance</hi> nor <hi>Necessity,</hi> for what is there
imaginable in the parts of the Matter that they should
necessarily fall into the structure of so much as an <hi>Animall,</hi>
much lesse into so carefull a provision of difference of Sexes
for their continuall propagation?</p>
               <p>Nor was it the frequent attempts of the moved Matter
that first light on <hi>Animalls,</hi> which perpetually were
suddainly extinct for want of the difference of Sexes,
but afterward by <hi>chance</hi> differenced their Sexes also,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62817:57"/>
from whence their kinds have continued. For what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall,
is not by <hi>chance;</hi> and the births that now are by
putrefaction shew that it is perpetuall. For the Earth still
constantly brings forth <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it any thing to the purpose to reply (if you will
make so large a skip as to cast your self from the land into
the water to dive for Objections) that the <hi>Eele,</hi> though it
be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>an Animall so perfect as to have bloud in
it,</hi> yet that it has no distinction of <hi>Sexe:</hi> For if it have
not, there is good reason for it, that creature arising out of
such kind of Matter as will never faile generation. For
there will be such like mud as will serve this end so long
as there be Rivers and longer too, and Rivers will not
faile so long as there is a Sea. Wherefore this rather
makes for discriminative Providence that knew afore the
nature and course of all things, and made therefore her
contrivances accordingly, doing nothing superfluously or
in vain.</p>
               <p>But in other <hi>Generations</hi> that are more hazardous,
though they be sometimes by putrefaction, yet she makes
them <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> as 'tis plain in <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Mice.</hi>
Nor are we to be scandalized at it, that there such carefull
provision made for such contemptible <hi>Vermine</hi> as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them: For this onely comes out of pride and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or a haughty presumption that because we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to believe that in some sense all things are made
for Man, that therefore they are not made at all for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
But he that pronounces thus, is ignorant of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God and the knowledge of things. For if a good
man be mercifull to his beast, then surely a good God is
bountifull and benigne, and takes pleasure that all his
Creatures enjoy themselves that have life and sense
and are capable of any enjoyment. So that the swarmes
of little <hi>Vermine,</hi> and of <hi>Flyes,</hi> and innumerable
such like diminutive Creatures, we should rather
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62817:58"/>
congratulate their coming into Being, then murmure sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly
and scornfully against their Existence; for they find
nourishment in the world, which would be lost if they were
nor, and are againe convenient nourishment themselves to
others that prey upon them.</p>
               <p>But besides, life being individuated into such infinite
numbers that have their distinct sense and pleasure and are
sufficiently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itted with contentments, those little Soules are
in a manner as much considerable for the taking off or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
away to themselves the over-flowing benignity of the
first Original of all things, as the <hi>Oxe</hi> the <hi>Elephant</hi> or <hi>Whale.</hi>
For it is <hi>sense,</hi> nor <hi>bulk</hi> that makes things capable of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it was fit that there should be a safe provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made for the propagation and continuance of all the
<hi>kinds</hi> of living Creatures, not onely of those that are <hi>good,</hi>
but of those also that we rashly and inconsiderately call
<hi>evill.</hi> For they are at least good to enjoy themselves
and to partake of the bounty of their Creatour. But if
they grow noysome and troublesome to us, we have
both power and right to curbe them: For there is no
question but we are more worth then they or any of the
brute Creatures.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the present point in hand; there are also
other manifest footsteps of Providence which the <hi>Generation</hi>
of living Creatures will discover to us, as for Example, the
maner of Procreation of <hi>Fishes</hi> and <hi>Birds.</hi> For there being
that notable difference in Animalls that some of them are
<hi>Oviparous,</hi> others <hi>Viviparous,</hi> that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as <hi>Philo</hi>
comprehends them by that generall terme) that <hi>Fishes</hi>
and <hi>Birds</hi> should be <hi>Oviparous</hi> is a plain signe of <hi>Counsell</hi>
and <hi>Providence.</hi> For though it will be granted that their
<hi>Species</hi> might continue and subsist, though they had been
<hi>Viviparous,</hi> yet it would have brought their Individualls to very small numbers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:62817:58"/>
For as for <hi>Fishes,</hi> since grasse and herbs are no fruit of
the Sea, it was necessary that they should feed one upon
another, and therefore that they should multiply in very
great plenty, which they could not have done any thing neer
to that fullnesse they now do, if they had been <hi>Viviparous</hi>
as four-footed beasts are: but being now <hi>Oviparous,</hi> and
the lesser kinds of them so many at first, and sending forth
such infinite numbers of Spawn, their generations are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extinct nor scanted, but are as plentifull as any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
on the Land.</p>
               <p>And the reason why <hi>Birds</hi> are <hi>Oviparous</hi> &amp; <hi>lay Egges</hi> but
do not bring forth their yong alive, is because there might
be moreplenty of them also, and that neither the Birds of
prey, the Serpent nor the Fowler should straiten their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
too much. For if they had been <hi>Viviparous,</hi> the
burden of their wombe, if they had brought forth any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
number at a time, had been so big and heavy, that
their wings would have failed them, and so every body
would <hi>have had the wit to catch the Old one.</hi> Or if they
brought but one or two at a time, they would have been
troubled all the yeare long with feeding their yong, or
bearing them in their wombe; besides there had been a
necessity of too frequent. Venery, which had been very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
to their dry carcases. It was very reasonable
therefore that <hi>Birds</hi> should propagate <hi>by laying of
Egges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not all the advantage we shall make of this
consideration. I demand further what is it that makes the
<hi>Bird</hi> to prepare her Nest with that Artifice, to sit upon her
Egges when she has laid them, and to distinguish betwixt
these and her uselesse Excrement? Did she learne it of her
Mother before her? or rather does she not do she knows not
what, but yet what ought to be done by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the most exquisite knowledge that is? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
something else has knowledge for her, which is the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62817:59"/>
Maker and Contriver of all things, the Omniscient and
Omipotent <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though you may reply that the <hi>Hatching</hi> of their
<hi>Egges</hi> be necessary else their generations would cease; yet
I answere that all the Circumstances and Curiosities of
<hi>Brooding</hi> them are not necessary. For they might have
ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e shift on the ground in the grasse, and not made
themselves such curious and safe <hi>Nests</hi> in Bushes and Trees.
Besides if all things were left to <hi>Chance,</hi> it is far easier to
conceive that there should have been no such things as
<hi>Birds,</hi> then that the blind Matter should ever have slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
on such lucky instincts as they that seem but barely
necessary.</p>
               <p>But you'le object that the <hi>Ostrich</hi> layes Egges and
hatches them not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o that these things are rather by <hi>Chance</hi>
then <hi>Providence.</hi> But this rather argues a more exquisite
discerning <hi>Providence</hi> then is any Argument against it.
For the heat of the ground (like those <hi>Ovens</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
speaks of) whereon she layes them, proves effectuall
for the production of her yong. So Nature tyes not the
Female to this tedious service where it is needlesse and
uselesse; as in <hi>Fishes</hi> also, who when they have spawn'd
are discharg'd of any further trouble: which is a most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
discovery of a very curious and watchfull <hi>Eye</hi> of
<hi>Providence</hi> which suffers nothing to be done ineptly and
in vaine.</p>
               <p>I will only make one advantage more of this Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Birth</hi> of <hi>Animalls,</hi> and then passe on to what
remains. It is observed by those that are more attentive
watchers of the works of Nature, that the <hi>foetus</hi> is framed
out of some homogeneall liquour or moysture, in which
there is no variety of parts of Matter to be contrived into
bones and flesh; but, as in an <hi>Egge</hi> for Example, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the third day the Hen has sate on it, in that part
where Nature beginnes to set upon her worke of efforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62817:59"/>
all is turned into a Crystalline liquid substance
about her, as also severall <hi>Insects</hi> are bred of little drops
of <hi>dew:</hi> So in all <hi>Generations</hi> besides it is supposed by
them, the Nature does as it were wipe clean the Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke
first, and then pourtray upon it what she pleaseth.
And if thus be her course to corrupt the subject Matter into
as perfect Privation of Form as she may, that is, to make it
as homogeneall as she can, but liquid and plyable to her
Art and Skill; it is to me very highly probable, if not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that there should be something besides this fluid
Matter, that must change it, alter and guide it into that
wise contrivance of parts that afterwards we find it. For
how should the parts of this liquid Matter ever come into
this exquisite Fabrick of themselves? And this may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
any <hi>Atheist</hi> that there is a Substance besides corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
Matter, which he is as loth to admit of as that there
is a God.</p>
               <p>For there being nothing else in Nature but <hi>Substantia</hi>
or <hi>Modus,</hi> this power of contriving the liquid Matter into
such order and shape as it is, being incompetible to the
liquid Matter it self, it must be the <hi>Modus</hi> of some other
substance latitant in the fluid Matter, and really distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shable
from it, which it either the Soul or some seminall
From or <hi>Archeus,</hi> as the <hi>Chymists</hi> call it, and they are all
alike indifferent to me at this time. I ayming here only at a
<hi>Substance</hi> besides the <hi>Matter,</hi> that thence the <hi>Atheist</hi> may
be the more easily brought off to the acknowledgment of
the existence of a <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can the force of this Argument be eluded by saying
the Matter is touched and infected by the <hi>life</hi> of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
whiles she bore the <hi>Egge,</hi> or that her <hi>Phansy</hi> gets
down into her wombe.</p>
               <p>For what <hi>life</hi> or <hi>Phansy</hi> has the Earth, which as
they say gendred at first all <hi>Animalls,</hi> some still? and
what similitude is there betwixt a <hi>Bee</hi> and an <hi>Oxe,</hi> or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62817:60"/>
a <hi>Waspe</hi> and an <hi>Horse,</hi> the those Insects should arise out
of the putrifide bodies of these Creatures? It is but some
rude and generall congruity of vitall preparation that sets
this <hi>Archeus</hi> on work rather then another. As mere
<hi>Choler</hi> engages the Phansy to dream of fiering of Gunns,
and fighting of Armies: <hi>Sanguine</hi> figures the imagintion
into the representation of faire Women, and beautifull Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
<hi>Phlegme</hi> transforms her into Water and Fishes; and
the shadowy <hi>Melancholy</hi> intangles her in colluctation
with old Hagges and Hobgoblins, and frights her with
dead mens faces in the dark. But I have dwelt on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

head, the Eye in the Forehead for they might have lived
and subsisted though they had been no better provided for
then thus. But it is evident that their having <hi>two Eyes</hi>
and <hi>two Eares,</hi> so placed as they are, is more safe, more
sightly, and more usefull. Therefore that being made so
constantly choice of, which our own Reason deemeth best,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62817:60"/>
we are to inferr that that choice proceeded from <hi>Reason</hi>
and <hi>Counsell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again I desire to know why there be no <hi>three-footed
Beasts,</hi> (when I speak thus, I doe not meane <hi>Monsters,</hi>
but a constant <hi>Species</hi> of kind of Animalls) for such a
Creature as that would make a limping shift to live as well
as they that have <hi>foure.</hi> Or why have not some beasts more
then foure-feet, suppose <hi>sixe</hi> &amp; the two middlemost shorter
then the rest, hanging like the two legges of a Man a
horse-back by the horse sides? For it is no harder a thing
for Nature to make such frames of Bodies then others that
are more elegant and usefull. But the works of Nature
being neither uselesse nor inept, she must either be wise her
self, or be guided by some higher Principle of <hi>Knowledge:</hi>
As that Man that does nothing foolishly all the dayes of
his life, is either wise himself, or consults with them that
are so.</p>
               <p>And then again for the <hi>armature</hi> of Beasts, who taught
them the use of their <hi>weapons?</hi> The <hi>Lyon</hi> will not kick with
his Feet, but he will strike such a stroke with his <hi>Tayle,</hi> that
he will breake the back of his Encounterer with it. The
<hi>Horse</hi> will not use his Tayle unlesse against the busy flyes,
but kicks with his <hi>Feet</hi> with that force that he layes his Enemy
on the ground. The <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Ram</hi> know the use of
their <hi>Hornes</hi> as well as the <hi>Horse</hi> of his <hi>Hoofes.</hi> So the <hi>Bee</hi>
and <hi>Serpent</hi> know their <hi>Stings,</hi> and the <hi>Beare</hi> the use of his
<hi>Paw.</hi> Which things they know merely by naturall instinct,
as the Male knowes the use of the Female. For they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not this skill by observation and experience, but the
frame of their nature carries them to it, as it is manifest in
young <hi>Lambes</hi> that will <hi>butt</hi> before they have horns. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is some higher <hi>Providence</hi> that has made them of
this nature they are. And this is evident also in <hi>Birds</hi> that
will <hi>flutter</hi> with their wings, when there is but a little Down
upon them, and they are as yet utterly unusefull for flying.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62817:61"/>
And now I have fallen upon the mention of this kind of
Creature, let me make my advantage of that generall stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
observable in them. The forme of their <hi>Heads</hi> being
<hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>sharpe,</hi> that they may the better cut the Aire
in their swift flight, and the spreading of their <hi>Tayles</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allell
to the <hi>Horizon</hi> for the better bearing up their Body;
for they might have been perpendicular as the Tayles of
Fishes in the water. Nor is it any thing that the <hi>Owle</hi> has
so broad a face, for her flight was not to be so swift nor so
frequent.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Fishes</hi> and the bladder of wind found in their
Bodies, who can say it is conveigh'd thither by <hi>chance,</hi>
but is contriv'd for their more easy swimming, as also the
manner of their <hi>finnes,</hi> which consist of a number of gristly
bones long and slender like pinnes and needles, and a kind
of a skin betwixt, which is for the more exactnesse and
makes them thin and flat like Oares. Which perfect ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
and accuracy might have been omitted and yet
they have made a shift to move up and down in the
water.</p>
               <p>But I have fallen upon a subject that is infinite and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible,
therefore that I be not too tedious I will confine
my self to some few observations in ordinary <hi>Beasts</hi> and
<hi>Birds</hi> (that which is most known and obvious being most
of all to our purpose,) and then I shall come to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of Man.</p>
               <p>And indeed what is more obvious and ordinary then a
<hi>Mole,</hi> and yet what more palpable Argument of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
then she? The members of her body are so exactly
fitted to her nature and manner of life: For her dwelling
being under ground where nothing is to be seene, Nature
has so obscurely fitted her with <hi>Eyes,</hi> that Naturalists can
scarce agree whither she have any sight at all or no. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
for amends, what she is capable of for her defence and
warning of danger, she has very eminently conferr'd upon
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62817:61"/>
her: for she is exceeding quick of <hi>hearing.</hi> And then her <hi>short
Tayle</hi> and <hi>short Leggs,</hi> but broad <hi>Fore-feet</hi> armed with
<hi>sharpe Clawes,</hi> we see by the event to what purpose they
are, she so swiftly working her self under ground and
making her way so fast in the Earth, as they that behold it
cannot but admire it. Her <hi>Leggs</hi> therefore are <hi>short</hi> that she
need dig no more then will serve the merethicknesse of her
Body. And her <hi>Fore-feet</hi> are <hi>broad,</hi> that she may scoup
away much Earth at a time. And little or no <hi>Tayle</hi> she
has, because she courses it not on the ground like the <hi>Rat</hi>
or <hi>Mouse</hi> of whose kinred she is, but lives under the Earth
and is fain to dig her self a dwelling there: And she ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her way through so thick an Element, which will not
yield easily as the Aire or the Water, it had been dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to have drawn so long a train behind her: for her
Enemy might fall upon her Reare and fetch her out
before she had compleated or had got full possession of her
works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cardan</hi> is so much taken with this contemplation, that
though I find him often staggering, yet here he does very
fully and finnely professe that the contrivance of all things
is from <hi>Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Counsell:</hi> his words are so generous
and significant that I hold them worth the transcribing.

the <hi>Hare,</hi> whose temper and frame of body are plainly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>For why is she made so full of <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Vigilancy</hi> ever

she so exceeding <hi>swift</hi> of <hi>foot,</hi> and has her <hi>Eyes</hi> so <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi>
and placed so that she can see better behind her then
before her? but that her flight is her onely safety, and it
was needful for her perpetually to eye her pursuing enemy,
against whom she durst never stand at the Bay, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but her long soft limber <hi>Eares</hi> to defend her. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that made the <hi>Hare</hi> made the <hi>Dog</hi> also, and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her with these Properties from her eager foe, that she
might not be too easy a booty for him, and so never be
able to save her self, or afford the Spectatour any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Pastime. And that the <hi>Hare</hi> might not alwayes get
away from the <hi>Grey hound,</hi> see how exquisitely his shape
is fitted for the Course: For the narrownesse and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
of his parts are made for speed; and that seeming
impertinent long <hi>Appendix</hi> of his body, his Taile, is made
for more nimble turning.</p>
               <p>There are other <hi>Animalls</hi> also whose particular Fabrick
of Body does manifestly appeare the Effect of <hi>Providence</hi>
and <hi>Counsell,</hi> though Naturallists cannot agree whether
it be in the behalf of the <hi>Beast</hi> thus framed or of <hi>Man.</hi> And
such is that Creature which though it be Exotick yet is
ordinarily known by the name of a <hi>Camell:</hi> For why are
those <hi>bunches</hi> on his backe, but that they may be instead of

<hi>Breast</hi> to lean on, but that being a tall Creature he might
with ease <hi>kneel</hi> down and so might the more gainly be
loaden?</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cardan</hi> will by no meanes have this the designe of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62817:62"/>
Nature, but that this frame of the <hi>Camell's</hi> body is thus
made for his own convenience: For he being a Creature
that lives and seeks his food in waste and dry deserts, those
<hi>Bunches</hi> he would have <hi>Receptacles</hi> of redundant <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi> from whence the rest of his body is to be supply'd in
a hard and tedious time of drought, and that his legges
being very long, he ought to have <hi>knees</hi> behind and a <hi>knob</hi>
beneath, to rest his weary limbes in the wildernesse, by sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or kneeling in that posture he does, for he could not
so conveniently lie along as the Horse or Asse or other
Creatures. But I should not determine this to either alone,
but take in both Causes, and acknowledge therein a richer

of having two Ventricles, and picking up stones to

I s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all content my self in taking notice only of some few
kinds of this Creature that familiarly come into our sight,
such as the <hi>Cock,</hi> the <hi>Duck,</hi> the <hi>Swan</hi> and the like. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
therefore concerning the <hi>Cock,</hi> why he has <hi>Spurres</hi>
at all, or having them how they come to be so fittingly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
For he might have had none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or so misplaced that they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62817:63"/>
had been utterly uselesse, and so his courage and pleasure
in fighting had been to no purpose. Nor are his <hi>Combe</hi> and
his <hi>Wattles</hi> in vaine, for they are an <hi>Ornament</hi> becoming
his Martiall Spirit, yea an <hi>Armature</hi> too, for the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gging
of those often excuses the more useful parts of his head from
harm. Thus fittingly does Nature gratify all Creatures
with accommodations sutable to their temper, and nothing
is in vaine. Nor are we to cavill at the red pugger'd attire
of the <hi>Turkey,</hi> and the long <hi>Excrescency</hi> that hangs down
over his Bill, when he swells with pride and anger; for it
may be a Receptacle for his heated bloud, that has such free
recourse to his head, or he may please himself in it as the
rude <hi>Indians,</hi> whose Jewells hang dangling at their Noses.
And if the bird be pleasur'd we are not to be displeased,
being alwaies mindfull that Creatures are made to enjoy
themselves, as well as to serve us, and it is a grosse piece of
Ignorance and Rusticity to think otherwise.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Swannes</hi> and <hi>Ducks</hi> and such like <hi>Birds</hi> of the
<hi>Water,</hi> it is obvious to take notice how well they are fitted
for that manner of life. For those that swim their <hi>Feet</hi> are
framed for it like a paire of Oares, their Clawes being
connected with a pretty broad Membrane, and their <hi>Necks</hi>
are long that they may dive deep enough into the water.
As also the <hi>Neck</hi> of the <hi>Herne</hi> and such like Fowl who
live of Fishes and are fain to frequent their Element, who
walk on long stilts also like the people that dwell in the
Marshes; but their Clawes have no such Membranes, for
they had been but a hindrance to those kind of birds that
onely wade in the water and do not swim. It is also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
how Nature has fitted other <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Prey,</hi> who
spy their booty from aloft in the Aire, and see best at that
distance, scarce see at all neere at hand. So they are both
the Archer and shaft, taking aime afar off, and then shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves directly upon the desired Mark, they seize
upon the prey having hit it. The works of <hi>Providence</hi> are
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62817:63"/>
infinite, I will close all with the description of that strange
bird of <hi>Paradise,</hi> for the strangenesse has made it notorious.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Bird</hi> that falls down out of the Aire dead,
and is found sometimes in the <hi>Molucco</hi> Ilands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that has no
Feet at all no more then an ordinary Fish. The bignesse of
her Body and Bill, as likewise the form of them, is much
what as a Swallows; but the spreading out of her Wings
and Tayle has no lesse compasse then an Eagles. She lives
and breeds in the Aire, comes not near the Earth but for
her buriall, for the largenesse and lightnesse of her Wings
and Tayle sustain her without lassitude. And the laying of
her Egges and brooding of her young is upon the back of
the Male which is made hollow, as also the breast of the
Female for the more easy incubation. Whether she live
merely of the dew of Heaven or of Flyes and such like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects,
I leave to others to dispute; but <hi>Cardan</hi> professes he
saw the Bird no lesse then thrice, and describes it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Nor does <hi>Scaliger</hi> cavill with any thing but the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Wings and littlenesse of the Body, which he
undertakes to correct from one of his own which was sent
him by <hi>Orvesanus</hi> from <hi>Java.</hi> Now that such contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
as these should be without divine <hi>Providence,</hi> is as
improbable to me as that the <hi>Copper Ring</hi> with the Greek
inscription upon it found about the Neck of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
<hi>Pike,</hi> should be the effect of unknowing Nature,
not the Artifice and Skill of Man.</p>

at home which we took the pains to seek for abroad. For

then the <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>structure</hi> of our own <hi>Bodyes.</hi>
The admirable <hi>Artifice</hi> whereof <hi>Galen,</hi> though a mere
Naturallist, was so taken with, that he could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
the honour of a hymne to the wise Creatour of it.
The contrivance of the whole and every particular is so
evident an argument of exquisite skill in the Maker, that
if I should pursue all that suites to my purpose, it would
amount to an entire Volume. I shall therefore only hint at
some few things, leaving the rest to be supply'd by Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.
And I think there is no man that has any skill in that
Art, but will confesse the more diligently and accurately
the frame of our <hi>Body</hi> is examined, it is found the more
exquisitely conformable to our own Reason, Judgement,
and Desire. So that supposing the same matter that our
bodyes are made of, if it had been in our own power to
have made our selves, we should have fram'd our selves no
otherwise then we are. To instance in some particular. As in
our <hi>Eyes,</hi> the <hi>number,</hi> the <hi>situation,</hi> the <hi>fabrick</hi> of them is
such that we can excogitate nothing to be added thereto, or
to be altered either for their <hi>beauty, safety</hi> or <hi>usefulnesse.</hi>
But as for their <hi>Beauty</hi> I will leave it rather to the delicate
wit and Pen of Poets and amorous persons, then venture
upon so tender and nice a subject with my severer style. I will
onely note how <hi>sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ly</hi> they are <hi>guarded,</hi> and <hi>fitly framed</hi>
out for that <hi>use</hi> they are intended. The <hi>Brow</hi> and the <hi>Nose</hi>
saves them from harder strokes: but such a curious part as
the <hi>Eye</hi> being necessarily lyable to mischief from smaller
matters, the <hi>sweat</hi> of the Forehead is fenced off by those two
wreaths of haire which we call the <hi>Eye-brows;</hi> and the <hi>Eye-lids</hi>
are fortify'd with little stiffe <hi>bristles</hi> as with <hi>Palisadoes,</hi>
against the assault of Flyes and Gnats, and such like bold
<hi>Animalcula.</hi> Besides the <hi>upper-lid</hi> presently claps down and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62817:64"/>
is as good a fence, as a <hi>Portcullis</hi> against the importunity of
the Enemy: Which is done also every night, whether there
be any present assault or no, as if Nature kept garrison in
this <hi>Acropolis</hi> of Mans body the <hi>Head</hi> &amp; look'd that such
lawes should be duly observ'd, as were most for his safety.</p>
               <p>And now for the <hi>Vse</hi> of the <hi>Eye</hi> which is <hi>Sight,</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that this Organ is so exquisitely framed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that not the least curiosity can be added. For first the
<hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>Tunicles</hi> are purely <hi>Transparent,</hi> to let in
light and colours unfoul'd and unsophisticated by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
tincture. And then again the parts of the Eye are
made <hi>Convex,</hi> that there might be a direction of many raies
coming from one point of the Object unto one point an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
in the bottome of the <hi>Eye;</hi> to which purpose the
<hi>Crystalline Humour</hi> is of great Moment, and without
which the sight would be very obscure and weake. Thirdly
the <hi>Tunica Vvea</hi> has a <hi>Musculous power,</hi> and can dilate &amp;
contract that round hole in it which is called the <hi>Pupill</hi> of
the Eye, for the better moderating the transmission of light.
Fourthly the inside of the <hi>Vvea</hi> is <hi>black'd</hi> like the wals of a
Tennis-court, that the rayes falling upon the <hi>Retina<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> may
not, by being rebounded thence upon the <hi>Vvea,</hi> be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the <hi>Vvea</hi> upon the <hi>Retina</hi> again, for such a reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion
would make the sight more confused. Fifthly the
<hi>Tunica Arachnoides,</hi> which invellops the <hi>Crystalline Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>
by vertue of its <hi>Processus Ciliares</hi> can thrust forward
or draw back that precious usefull part of the Eye, as the
neernesse or distance of the Object shall require. Sixthly
and lastly the <hi>Tunica Retina</hi> is <hi>white,</hi> for the better and
more true reception of the <hi>species</hi> of things (as they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
call them) as a white paper is fittest to receive those
Images into a dark roome. If the wit of Man had been to
contrive this <hi>Organ</hi> for himself, what could he have possibly
excogitated more accurate? Therefore to think that meer
Motion of the Matter, or any other blind Cause could have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62817:65"/>
hit so punctually (for Creatures might have subsisted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this accurate provision) is to be either mad or sottish.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Eye</hi> is already so <hi>perfect,</hi> that I believe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Man would have easily rested here, &amp; admir'd at it's
own contrivance: for he being able to move his whole head
upward and downward and on every side, might have una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
thought himself sufficiently well provided for. But
Nature has added <hi>Muscles</hi> also to the <hi>Eyes,</hi> that no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
might be wanting; For we have oft occasion to
<hi>move our Eyes,</hi> our Head being unmoved, as in reading and
viewing more particularly any Object set before us: and
that this may be done with more ease and accuracy, she
has furnish'd that Organ with no lesse then six severall
<hi>Muscles.</hi> And indeed this framing of <hi>Muscles</hi> not only
in the Eye but in the whole Body is admirable; For is it
not a wonder that even all our flesh should be so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
contriv'd into distinct pieces, whose Rise and Inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
should be with such advantage that they do serve to
move some part of the Body or other; and that the parts
of our Body are not moved only so conveniently as wil serve
us to walke and subsist by, but that they are able to move

down the <hi>Guts</hi> and so enlarging the <hi>Thorax</hi> that the

Muscles</hi> in deep Suspirations, when we take
more large gulps of Aire to coole our heart overcharged
with Love or Sorrow. Nor of the curious fabrick of the
<hi>Larynx</hi> so well fitted with muscles for the modulation of
the <hi>Voice,</hi> tunable <hi>Speech,</hi> and delicious <hi>Singing.</hi> You may
adde to these the notable contrivance of the <hi>Heart,</hi> it's two
<hi>Ventricles</hi> and it's many <hi>Valvulae,</hi> so fram'd and situated
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62817:65"/>
as is most fit for the reception and transmission of the bloud,
which comes about through the <hi>Heart,</hi> and is sent thence
away warm to comfort &amp; cherish the rest of the Body: For
which purpose also the <hi>Valvulae</hi> in the <hi>Veines</hi> are made.</p>
               <p>But I will rather insist upon such things as are easy and
intelligible even to Idiots, who if they can but tell the <hi>Joynts</hi>
of their <hi>Hands</hi> or know the use of their <hi>Teeth,</hi> they may
easily discover it was <hi>Counsel,</hi> not <hi>Chance,</hi> that created them.
For why have we <hi>three Joynts</hi> in our <hi>Leggs</hi> and <hi>Armes</hi> as
also in our <hi>Fingers,</hi> but that it was much better then having
but <hi>two</hi> or <hi>four?</hi> And why are our <hi>fore-Teeth sharp</hi> like
cheesells to cut, but our <hi>inward-Teeth broad</hi> to grind, but
that this is more exquisite then having them <hi>all sharp</hi> or <hi>all
broad,</hi> or the <hi>fore-Teeth broad</hi> and the <hi>other sharp?</hi> But we
might have made a hard shift to have lived though in that
worser co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition. Again why are the <hi>Teeth</hi> so luckily <hi>placed,</hi>
or rather why are there not Teeth in <hi>other bones</hi> as well as in
the <hi>jaw-bones?</hi> for they might have been as capable as these.
But the reason is, Nothing is done foolishly nor in vaine,
that is, there is a divine <hi>Providence</hi> that orders all things.
Again to say nothing of the inward curiosity of the <hi>Eare,</hi>
why is that outward frame of it, but that it is certainly
known, that it is for the bettering of our Hearing?</p>
               <p>I might adde to these that Nature has made the <hi>hind-most
parts</hi> of our body which wee sit upon most fleshy, is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for our Ease and making us a natural Cushion, as well
as for instruments of Motion for our <hi>Thighes</hi> and <hi>Legges.</hi>
She has made the <hi>hinder-part</hi> of the <hi>Head</hi> more strong, as
being otherwise unfenced against falls and other casualties.
She has made the <hi>Back-bone</hi> of severall <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> as being
more fit to bend, more tough &amp; lesse in danger of breaking
then if they were all one intire bone without those gristly
Junctures. She has strengthned our <hi>Fingers</hi> and <hi>Toes</hi> with
<hi>Nailes,</hi> wheras she might have sent out that substance at the
end of the first or second joynt, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> had not been so handsome

                  </gap>or usefull, nay rather somewhat troublesome and hurtfull.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62817:66"/>
And lastly she has made all the <hi>Bones</hi> devoid of <hi>sense,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were to bear the weight of themselves and of the
whole Body. And therefore if they had had <hi>sense,</hi> our
life had been painfull continually and dolorous.</p>
               <p>And what she has done for <hi>us,</hi> she has done proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
in the contrivance of all <hi>other Creatures;</hi> so that it is
manifest that a divine <hi>Providence</hi> strikes through all things.</p>
               <p>And therefore things being contrived with such exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<hi>Curiosity</hi> as if the most watchfull wisdome imaginable
did attend them, to say they are thus framed without the
assistance of some Principle that has <hi>Wisdome</hi> in it, &amp; that
they come to passe from <hi>Chance</hi> or some other blind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing
Originall, is sullenly and humorously to assert
a thing, because we will assert it, and under pretense of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding
Superstition, to fall into that which is the onely
thing that makes Superstition it self hatefull or ridiculous,
that is, a wilfull and groundlesse adhering to conceits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any support of Reason.</p>
               <p>And now I have considered the fitnesse of the parts of
Mans Body for the good of the whole, let me but consider
briefly the fitnesse of the <hi>Passions</hi> of his <hi>Minde,</hi> whether
<hi>proper,</hi> or <hi>common</hi> to him with the rest of Animalis, as also
the fitness of the <hi>whole Man</hi> as he is <hi>part of the Vniverse,</hi>
and then I shall conclude.</p>
               <p>And it is manifest that <hi>Anger</hi> does so actuate the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and heightens the Courage of men and beasts that it
makes them with more ease break through the difficulties
they incounter. <hi>Feare</hi> also is for the avoyding of danger,
and <hi>Hope</hi> is a pleasant praemeditation of enjoyment, as
when a Dog expects till his Master has done picking of the
bone. But there is neither <hi>Hope,</hi> nor <hi>Feare,</hi> nor <hi>Hate,</hi> nor
any peculiar Passion or Instinct in <hi>Brutes</hi> that is in vaine;
why should we then think that Nature should miscarry
more in <hi>us</hi> then in any other Creature, or should be so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the Fabrick of our <hi>Body,</hi> and yet so forgetfull or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62817:66"/>
in the framing of the faculties of our <hi>Soules;</hi> that that
<hi>Feare</hi> that is so peculiarly naturall to us, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>feare of
a Deity,</hi> should be in vaine, and that pleasant <hi>Hope</hi> and
Heavenly Joyes of the mind which man is naturally capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, with the earnest direction of his Spirit towards God,
should have no reall Object in the world? And so Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
affection which Nature has so plainly implanted in the
Soul of Man should be to no use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but either to make him
ridiculous or miserable: Whenas we find no <hi>Passion</hi> or
<hi>Affection</hi> in <hi>Brutes</hi> either common or peculiar but what is
for their good and welfare.</p>
               <p>For it is not for nothing that the <hi>Hare</hi> is so <hi>fearfull</hi> of
the <hi>Dog,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Sheep</hi> of the <hi>Wolfe;</hi> &amp; it there be either <hi>Fear</hi>
or <hi>Enmity</hi> in some Creatures for which we cannot easily
discerne any reason in respect of themselves, yet we may
well allow of it as reasonable in regard of us, and to be to
good purpose. But I thinke it is manifest that <hi>Sympathy</hi>
and <hi>Antipathy, Love</hi> and <hi>Enmity, Aversation, Feare,</hi> and
the like, that they are notable whetters and quickners of
the Spirit of life in all Animalls, and that their being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to dangers and encounters does more closely knit
together the vitall Powers, and makes them more sensibly
relish their present safety, and they are more pleased with
an Escape then if they had never met with any Danger.
Their greedy assaults also one upon another while there
is <hi>hope</hi> of Victory highly gratifies them both. And if
one be conquer'd and slaine, the Conquerour enjoyes
a fresh improvement of the pleasure of life, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over his Enemy. Which things seeme to me to
be contriv'd even in the behalf of these Creatures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that their vitall heat and moysture may not
alwayes onely simber in one sluggish tenour, but some
times boyle up higher and seeth over, the fire of life
being more then ordinarily kindled upon some emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:62817:67"/>
But it is without Controversy that these peculiar <hi>Passions</hi>
of Animalls many of them are usefull to Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as that
of the <hi>Lizards</hi> enmity against the <hi>Serpent</hi>) all of them

could Nature intend else in that Antipathy betwixt the
<hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Snayle,</hi> that that Beast that seems so boldly
to claime kinred of Man from the resemblance of his

to look back, as being affraid she would follow him as
<hi>Erasmus</hi> more largely and pleasantly tells the whole story?</p>
               <p>But that Nature should implant in Man such a strong
Propension to <hi>Religion,</hi> which is the <hi>Reverence of a Deity,</hi>
there being neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Angell</hi> nor <hi>Spirit</hi> in the world,
is such a Slurre committed by her as there can be in no

himself in the world. Wherefore <hi>Religion</hi> being convenient
to no other <hi>Species</hi> of things besides Man, it ought to be
convenient at least for himself: But supposing there were no

               </p>
               <p>For whether we look at the <hi>Externall Effects</hi> thereof,

God, that is, all that we have or can do, should be lively
and sensibly attributed to him, and we fully and heartily
acknowledge ourselves to be nothing, that is, be as little

if we had done nothing or were not at all in being) doe

that to be buried quick were lesse torture by farre, then
such darke <hi>privations</hi> of all the <hi>joyes</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> then such sad

consider these <hi>inward pangs</hi> of the Soul, or the <hi>externall
outrages</hi> caused by <hi>Religion</hi> (and Religious pretense will
animate men to the committing such violences, as bare
Reason and the single passions of the Mind unback'd with
the fury of Superstition will never venture upon) it is
manifest that if there were no <hi>God,</hi> no <hi>Spirit,</hi> no <hi>Life to
come,</hi> it were farre better that there were no such <hi>Religious
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62817:68"/>
propensions</hi> in Man-kind, as we see universally there is.</p>
               <p>For the feare of the Civill Magistrate, the convenience
of mutuall ayde and support, and the naturall scourge
and plague of diseases would contain men in such bounds
of Justice, Humanity and Temperance, as would make
them more clearly and undisturbedly happy, then they are
now capable of being, from any advantage <hi>Religion</hi>
does to either Publique State or private person, supposing
there were <hi>no God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore this <hi>Religious affection</hi> which Nature has
implanted, and as strongly rooted in Man as the feare of
death or the love of women, would be the most enormous
slip or bungle she could commit, so that she would so
shamefully faile in the last Act, in this contrivance of the
nature of Man that instead of a <hi>Plaudite</hi> she would deserve
to be hissed off the Stage.</p>
               <p>But she having done all things else so wisely, let us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suspect our own ignorance then reproach her, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that which is allowed in well approved Comedies,

                  </gap>, for nothing can unlose this knot but a
<hi>Deity.</hi> And then we acknowledging Man to dwell as it
were in the borders of the spirituall and materiall world
(for he is <hi>utriusque mundi nexus,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> truly calls
him) we shall not wonder that there is such tugging and
pulling this way and that way, upward and downward,
and such broken disorder of things; those that dwell in the
confines of two kingdomes, being most subject to disquiet
and confusion. And hitherto of the <hi>Passions</hi> of the mind
of Man, as well those that tye him down to the Body, as
those that lift him up towards God. Now briefly of the
<hi>whole Man</hi> as he is <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Vniverse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true if we had not been here in the world, we could
not then have missed our selves; but now we find our selves
in being and able to examine the reasonableness of things,
we cannot but conclude that our Creation was an Act of

very exquisite <hi>Reason</hi> &amp; <hi>Counsel.</hi> For there being so many

of the wisdome of the first Cause in framing their bodies,
and giving sundry observable instincts to <hi>Fishes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Birds</hi> and
<hi>Beasts?</hi> And lastly as there are particular Priests amongst
Men, so the whole <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Man-kind</hi> being indued with
<hi>Reason</hi> and a power of finding out God, there is yet one
singular end more discoverable of his Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> that he

and send up prayers and praises to the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
of all things in behalf of the rest of the Creatures.
Thus we see all filled up and fitted without any defect or

               <p>Wherefore the <hi>whole Creation</hi> in generall and <hi>every

by the World, but unpunish'd by divine Justice:
As is notorious in that Sacrilegious Wit, <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuse,</hi>
who spoiling <hi>Jupiter Olympius</hi> of his costly
Robe very stiff and ponderous with Gold, added this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologetical

was too heavy for the Summer, and too cold for the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

it was very unfit that the Son should wear a Beard when

               <p>That also was not inferiour to any of his Sacrilegious

himself, saying, that he received but what they of
their own accord gave him; adding that it were a gross
piece of foolishness, when as we pray to the Gods for all
good things, not to take them when they so freely offer
them with their own hands.</p>
               <p>These and other such like irreligious Pranks did this
<hi>Dionysius</hi> play, who notwithstanding fared no worse then
the most demure and innocent, dying no other death then
what usually other Mortalls do: as if in those Ages there
had been as great a lack of <hi>Wit,</hi> as there was here in
England once of <hi>Latin,</hi> and that he escaped a more severe
Sentence by the benefit of his Clergy. But others think
that he was pay'd home and punish'd in his Son that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him. But that, will the <hi>Atheist</hi> reply, is but to
whip the absent, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> wittily said to him that
told him that such an one did unmercifully traduce him
behind his back.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I hold it more convenient to omit such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
as may intangle us in such endless Altercations,
&amp; to bring only those that cannot be resolved into any <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
causes,</hi> or be phansyed to come by <hi>Chance,</hi> but are
so <hi>Miraculous,</hi> that they do imply the presence of some
free subtile understanding essence distinct from the brute
Matter, and ordinary power of Nature.</p>
               <p>And these <hi>Miraculous</hi> effects, as there is nothing more
cogent if they could be believed; so there is nothing more
hard to the <hi>Atheist</hi> to believe then they are. For <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionists</hi>
having for pious purposes, as they pretend, forged
so many false miracles to gull and spoile the credulous
people, they have thereby with the <hi>Atheist</hi> taken away
all belief of those which are true. And the childish &amp; super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious

                  <hi>Melancholy</hi> and disturbed <hi>Phansy.</hi> But that there should
be so universall a fame, and feare of that, which never
was, nor is, nor can be ever in the world, is to me the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<hi>Miracle</hi> of all.</p>
               <p>For if there had not been at some time or other <hi>true
Miracles</hi> (as indeed there ought to be, if the faculties of
Man, who so easily listens to and allowes of such things,
be not in vain) it is very improbable that Priests and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Deluders of the people would have ever been able so
easily to impose upon them by their <hi>false.</hi> As the <hi>Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
would never go about to sophisticate <hi>Metalls,</hi> &amp; then
put them off for <hi>true Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> but that it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that there is such a thing as <hi>true Gold</hi> and
<hi>Silver</hi> in the world. In like manner therefore as there is
an indeavour of deluding the people with <hi>false Miracles,</hi>
so it is a signe there have been and may be those that are
<hi>true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you'l say there is a <hi>Touch-stone</hi> whereby we may

whereby we may discover the truth of <hi>Miracles</hi> recorded
every where in History. But I answer there is; and it is this.</p>
               <p>First if what is recorded was avouched by such persons

               <p>Thirdly and lastly if these things which are so strange

recite some of few those many <hi>miraculous</hi> passages
we meet with in Writers, beginning first with the <hi>bare</hi> and
<hi>simple effects</hi> of <hi>Spirits,</hi> as I will aforehand adventure to
pronounce them, and then afterwards we shall come to
the <hi>Apparitions</hi> of <hi>Spirits</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>And of those <hi>bare effects</hi> we will not care to name what
may seem slightest first. <hi>Bodinus</hi> relates how himself and
severall others at <hi>Paris</hi> saw a young man with a Charme
in French, move a <hi>Sieve</hi> up and down. And that ordinary
way of Divination which they call <hi>Coskinomancy</hi> or finding
who stole or spoiled this or that thing, by the <hi>Sieve</hi> and
<hi>Sheares, Pictorius Vigillanus</hi> professeth he made use of
thrice, and it was with successe.</p>
               <p>A friend of mine told me this story concerning Charms,
that himself had an <hi>Horse,</hi> which if he had stood sound had
been of a good value. His servants carried him to severall
Farriers but none of them had the skill to cure him. At
last unknown to their Master, they led him to a Farrier,
that had, it should seem, some tricks more then ordinarie,
and dealt in Charms, or Spells, and such like Ceremoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s:
in vertue of these he made the Horse sound.</p>
               <p>The Owner of him after he had observ'd how well his
Horse was, asked his servants, how they got him cured,
Whence understanding the whole matter, and observing also
that there was an <hi>S. branded</hi> on his buttock, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62817:72"/>
stood for <hi>Satan,</hi> chid his servants very roughly, as
having done that which was unwarrantable and impious.
Upon this profession of his dislike of the fact, the Horse
forthwith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell as ill as ever he was, in so much that for his
unserviceablenes he was faine to be turned up loose in the
pasture. But a kinsman of the Owners coming to his house
&amp; after chanceing to see the Horse in the Grounds took the
adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage of a low price for so fair a gelding &amp; bought him.
The Horse had no sooner changed his Master but presently
changed his plight of body also &amp; became as sound as ever.</p>
               <p>Charming also of Serpents is above the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And <hi>Wierus</hi> tells us this story of a Charmer at <hi>Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
that when in the sight of the people he had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
all the <hi>Serpents</hi> into a ditch and killed them, at last
there came one huge one far bigger then the rest, that leapt
upon him, and winded about his wast like a girdle, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him into the ditch, and so killed the Charmer himself in
the conclusion.</p>
               <p>That also I will adventure to refer to the effects of <hi>Spirits</hi>
which I heard lately from one <hi>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Dark</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi>
concerning her own <hi>Husband;</hi> who being in the flower of
his Age, well in health and very chearfull, going out of
his house in the morning with an intent to return to dinner,
was, as he walked the streets, sensibly struck upon the thigh
by an invisible hand, for he could see no man near him to
strike him. He returned home indeed about dinner-time,
but could eat nothing, onely he complain'd of the sad
Accident that befell him, and grew forthwith so mortally
sick, that he dyed within three dayes. After he was dead
there was found upon the place where he was struck, the
perfect figure of a man's hand, the four fingers palme and
thumb black and sunk into the flesh, as if one should clap
his hand upon a lump of dow.</p>

things more strange, and yet as free from that suspicion as
the former.</p>
               <p>And to say nothing of <hi>VVinds sold</hi> to Merchants by
<hi>Laplanders,</hi> and the danger of losing the <hi>Third knot</hi>
(which was very frequent as <hi>Olaus</hi> affirmes before those

                  </gap> shall
content my self for the present with a true story W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I heard
from an eye-witnesse concerning these preternatural Winds.
At <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the raigne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> there was
two <hi>VVitches</hi> to be executed, the <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Daughter.</hi>
The <hi>Mother</hi> when she was called upon to repent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the <hi>Divel,</hi> she said, there was no reason for that, for
he had been faithfull to her these threescore yeares, and she
would be so to him so long as she lived; and thus she
died in this obstinacy. But she hanging thus upon the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
her <hi>Daughter</hi> being of a contrary mind renounced
the <hi>Divel,</hi> was very earnest in prayer and penitence; which
by the effect, the people conceived the <hi>Divel</hi> to take very
heinously. For there came such a sudden blast of Wind
(when as all was calme before) that it drave the <hi>Mothers</hi>
body against the ladder so violently, that it had like to have
overturned it, and shook the Gallows with such force, that
they were faine to hold the posts for fear of all being fung
down to the ground.</p>

do follow the performance of those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> but that
they had come to passe neverthelesse without them: which
the <hi>Divell</hi> foreseeing, excites the deluded Women to use
those <hi>Magick Rites,</hi> that they may be the better perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of his power. But whether there be any causall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
betwixt those <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and the ensuing <hi>Tempests</hi>
I will not curiously decide. But that the connexion of them
is <hi>supernaturall</hi> is plain at first sight. For what is <hi>casting
of Flint-Stones behind their backs towards the West,</hi> or
<hi>flinging a little Sand in the Aire,</hi> or <hi>striking a River with
a Broom,</hi> and so <hi>sprinkling the Wet of it toward Heaven,
the stirring of Vrine or Water with their finger in a Hole
in the ground, or boyling of Hogs Bristles in a Pot?</hi> What
are these fooleries available of themselves to gather <hi>Clouds</hi>
and cover the Aire with <hi>Darknesse,</hi> and then to make the
g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Aire terrible with frequent <hi>Lightnings</hi> and <hi>Thunder?</hi>
Certainly nothing at all. Therefore the ensuing of these
<hi>Tempests</hi> after such like <hi>Ceremonies</hi> must be either from the
prevision of the <hi>Divell</hi> (as <hi>Wierus</hi> would have it) who set
the Witches on work, or else from the power of the <hi>Divell</hi>
which he hath in his Kingdome of the <hi>Aire.</hi> And it seems
strange to me that <hi>Wierus</hi> should doubt this power, when he
gives him a greater; For what is the transporting of vapours
or driving them together, to the carrying of Men and Cattel
in the Aire, (of which he is a confident Asserter) unlesse it
require <hi>larger Divells</hi> or greater <hi>numbers?</hi> And that there
are sufficient <hi>numbers</hi> of such <hi>Spirits</hi> will seem to any body
as credible, as that there are any at all. But now for the
truth of this, that certain <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> do seem at
least to cause an alteration in the <hi>Aire</hi> and to raise <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests;
Remigius</hi> writes that he had it witnessed to him by
the free confession of neer two hundred men that he exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
Where he adds a story or two in which there being
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62817:73"/>
neither <hi>Fraud,</hi> nor <hi>Melancholy</hi> to be suspected, I think them
worth the mentioning. The one is of a <hi>Witch,</hi> who to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy

                  </gap>
Cloud to discharge upon what place they would appoint
her, which she made good in the sight of the Spectatours.</p>
               <p>The other Story is of a <hi>young Girle,</hi> who to pleasure her
Father complaining of a drought, by the guidance and help
of that ill Master her Mother had devoted and consecrated
her unto, rais'd a <hi>Cloud,</hi> and water'd her Father's ground
only, all the rest continuing dry as before.</p>
               <p>Let us add to these the Story of <hi>Cuinus</hi> and <hi>Margaret
Warine.</hi> While this <hi>Cuinus</hi> was busy at his Hay-making,
there arose suddenly great <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi> which
made him runne homeward, and forsake his work, for he
saw sixe <hi>Oakes</hi> hard by him overturned from the very
<hi>Roots,</hi> and a seventh also shatter'd and torn a pieces: he
was fain to lose his hat and leave his fork or rake for hast;
which was not so fast but another crack overtakes him and
rattles about his Eares; upon which Thunder-clap, he
presently espied this <hi>Margaret Warme</hi> a reputed <hi>Witch</hi>
upon the top of an Oake, whom he began to chide. She
desired his secrecy, and she would promise that never any
injury or harm should come to him from her at any
time.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Cuinus</hi> deposed upon Oath before the Magistrate,
and <hi>Margaret Warine</hi> acknowledged the truth of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any force done unto her, severall times before her death,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62817:74"/>
and at her death. [See <hi>Remigius</hi> Daemonolatr. lib. 1. cap.
29.] <hi>Remigius</hi> conceives she was discharged upon the
top of the Oake at that last <hi>Thunder clap</hi> and there
hung amongst the boughs; which he is induced to
believe from two Stories he tells afterwards. The one is
of a <hi>Tempest</hi> of <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning</hi> that the Herds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
tending their Cattell on the brow of the Hill <hi>Alman</hi>
in the field of <hi>Guicuria</hi> were f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighted with, who running
into the Woods for shelter suddenly saw two countrey
men on the top of the Trees, which were next them, so dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in such a pickle, and so out of breath, as if they had
been dragg'd up and down through thornes and miry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but when they had well eyed them, they were gone
in a moment out of their sight they knew not how nor
whither. These Herdsmen talked of the businesse, but the
certainty of it came out not long after. For the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
of those two men they then saw, being so exactly
agreeing with what the Herdsmen had related, made the
whole matter cleare and undoubted.</p>
               <p>The other Story is of the same Persons, known after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by their names, <hi>viz. Amantius</hi> and his partner <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius,</hi>
who having coursed it aloft again in the Aire, and
being cast headlong out of a cloud upon an house, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them being but a Novice and unexperienced in those
supernaturall exploites, was much astonish'd and affraid at
the strangenesse of the matter, but <hi>Amantius</hi> being used
to those feats from his youth, his Parents having devoted
him from his childhood to the <hi>Divell,</hi> made but a sport of
it, and laughing at his friend called him Foole for his feare,
and bad him be of good courage; for their Master, in whose
power they were, would safely carry them through grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dangers than those. And no sooner had he sayd these
words, but a <hi>Whirlwinde</hi> took them, and set them both safe
upon the ground: but the house they were carryed from, so
shook, as if it would have been overturn'd from the very
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62817:74"/>
foundations. This, both those men examin'd apart, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the same words, not varying their Story at all; whose
confessions exactly agreed in all circumstances with what
was observed by the country people concerning the time
and the manner of the <hi>Tempest</hi> and shaking of the
House.</p>
               <p>I will onely add one Story more of this nature, and
that is of a <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> who being vext that all her
neighbours in the Village where she lived were invited to
the wedding, and so were drinking and dancing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
merry, &amp; she solitary and neglected, got the <hi>Divell</hi> to
transport her through the Aire, in the middest of day, to a
Hill hard by the Village: where she <hi>digging a hole</hi> and
<hi>putting Vrine into it,</hi> rais'd a great <hi>Tempest</hi> of <hi>Haile,</hi> and
directed it so, that it fell onely upon the Village, and pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them that were dancing with that violence, that they
were forc'd to leave off their sport. When she had done
her exploite she returned to the Village, and being spied
was suspected to have raised the <hi>Tempest,</hi> which the
Shepheards in the field that saw her riding in the Aire knew
well before, who bringing in their witnesse against her, she
confess'd the fact. I might be infinite in such narrations,
but I will moderate my self.</p>

               <p>That which is generally observed in them both is this,
that in their <hi>fitts</hi> they are as if they had no Soule at all in
their Bodyes, and that whatsoever operations of sense,
reason or motion there seemes to be in them, it is not any
thing at all to them, but is wholly that stranger's, that hath
got into them. For so soone as their <hi>fitts</hi> are over, they are
as if they had been in so profound a sleep, that they did not
so much as dreame, and so remember nothing at all of what

they either said, or did, or where they had been; as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
by an infinite number of examples in the forenamed

were Eye-witnesses enough to take notice how strangely
they were handled, being flung up from the ground higher
then a mans head, and falling down again without harme,
swarming upon trees as nimbly as Cats, and hanging upon
the boughes, having their flesh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I would passe now to other <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> as
the conveying of <hi>knives, balls of haire,</hi> and <hi>nailes</hi> into the
bodyes of them that are <hi>bewitched;</hi> but that the mention of
these <hi>Nunnes</hi> puts me in mind of that famous story <hi>in
Wierus</hi> of <hi>Magdalena Crucia,</hi> first a <hi>Nunne,</hi> and then
an <hi>Abbatesse</hi> of a Nunnery in <hi>Corduba</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> Those
things which were miraculous in her were these; that
she could tell allmost at any distance how the affairs of the
world went, what consultations or transactions there were
in all the nations of Christendome, from whence she got
to her self the reputation of a very <hi>Holy woman</hi> and a great
<hi>Prophetesse.</hi> But other things came to passe by her or
for her sake, no lesse strange and miraculous; as that at
the celebrating of the holy <hi>Encharist,</hi> the Priest should all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
want one of his round wafers, which was secretly
conveyed to <hi>Magdalen,</hi> by the administration of Angells,
as was supposed, and shee receiving of it into her mouth
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and high reverence of the <hi>Saint.</hi> At the elevation
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62817:76"/>
of the Host <hi>Magdalen</hi> being near at hand, but yet a
wall betwixt, that the wall was conceived to open and to
exhibite <hi>Magdalen</hi> to the view of them in the chappell,
and that thus she partaked of the consecrated bread. When
this <hi>Abbatesse</hi> came into the chappel her self upon some
speciall day, that she would set off the solemnity of
the day by some notable and conspicuous miracle: For
she would sometimes be lifted up above the ground three
or foure cubits high; other sometimes bearing the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of Christ in her armes, weeping sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly, she would
make her haire to increase to that length and largenesse
that it would come to her heels, and cover her all over and
the Image of Christ in her armes, which anon notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
would shrink up again to its usuall size; with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such specious though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nprofitable miracles.</p>
               <p>But you'll say that the narration of these things is not
<hi>true,</hi> but they are <hi>feigned</hi> for the advantage of the <hi>Roman
Religion,</hi> and so it was profitable for the Church to forge
them and record them to posterity. A man that is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to admit of any thing <hi>supernaturall</hi> would please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with this generall shuffle and put-off. But when we
come to the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of the story he will find it quite
otherwise; for this <hi>Saint</hi> at last began to be suspected
for a <hi>Sorceresse</hi> as it is thought, and she being conscious,
did of her own accord, to save her self, make confession of
her wickednesse to the Visiters of the Order, as they are
called, viz. That for thirty yeares shee had been marryed
to the <hi>Divel</hi> in the shape of an <hi>Aethiopian;</hi> that another
<hi>Divel</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervant to this, when his Master was at dalliance
with her in her cell, supplyed her place amongst the <hi>Nunnes</hi>
at their publick Devotions; that by vertue of this contract
she made with this <hi>Spirit,</hi> she had done all those miracles
she did. Upon this confession she was committed, and
while she was in durance, yet she appear'd in her devout
postures praying in the chappell as before at their set houres
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62817:76"/>
of prayer; which being told to the Visiters by the Nunnes,
there was a strict watch over her that she should not stirre
out. Neverthelesse shee appeared in the chappell as before,
though she were really in the prison.</p>
               <p>Now what credit or advantage there can be to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Religion</hi> by this story, let any man judge. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is no figment of the Priests or Religious persons,
nor Melancholy, nor any such matter (for how could so
many spectatours at once be deluded by Melancholy?) but
it ought to be deemed a reall <hi>Truth:</hi> And this <hi>Magdalena
Crucia</hi> appearing in two severall places at once, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that there is such a thing as <hi>Apparitions</hi> of <hi>Spirits.</hi> But
I must abstaine as yet from touching that argument, I
having not dispatch'd what I propounded concerning the
vomiting up of <hi>Nailes,</hi> the conveying of <hi>Knives</hi> and
<hi>pieces of VVood</hi> into the Bodies of Men, and the like.
Which things are so palpable and uncapable of delusion,
that I think it worth the while to insist a little upon them.</p>

               <p>I might add seasonably hereunto what is so credibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of Mrs. <hi>Muschamp's</hi> Child, that it was seen to
vomit up pieces of <hi>VVood</hi> with <hi>Pinns</hi> stuck in it.</p>
               <p>But I will conclude all with that Story of about thirty
Children that were so strangely handled at <hi>Amsterdam</hi>
1566. of the truth whereof <hi>VVierus</hi> professeth himself
very well assured. They were tortured very much, and cast
violently upon the ground, but when they arose out of their
fitt knew nothing but thought they had been onely asleep.
For the remedying of this mischief they got the help of
<hi>Physicians, VVizards</hi> and <hi>Exorcists,</hi> but without successe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Onely while the <hi>Exorcists</hi> were reading, the Children vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
up <hi>Needles, Thimbles,</hi> shreds of <hi>Cloth,</hi> pieces of
<hi>Pots, Glasse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Haire,</hi> and other things of the like nature.</p>
               <p>Now the advantage I would make of these stories is this,
that these effects extraordinary and supernaturall being so
palpable and permanent, they are not at all lyable to such
Subterfuges as <hi>Atheists</hi> usually betake themselves to, as of
<hi>Melancholy,</hi> &amp; disturbance of <hi>Phansy</hi> in those that professe
they see such strange things, or any <hi>Fraud</hi> or <hi>Impost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re</hi> in
those that act.</p>
               <p>All that can with any shew of reason be alledged is
this, That such partyes in their <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itts</hi> of distraction may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure
such things as they vomit up, or at least put them
into their mouthes. But they that are by might easily see
that, distracted people doing things carelessly and openly.
And these things happen to those that are thus handled
against their wills; and as they are not discovered to doe
any such things, of themselves, so neither do they confess af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
that they did it, when they are come to their right
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62817:78"/>
senses; and ordinarily it is found out that some Woman
or other by <hi>Sorcery</hi> or <hi>VVitchcraft</hi> was the Authour of it.</p>
               <p>Besides it is evident that there can be no mistake at all
in some of these passages; For how can an iron <hi>Naile</hi> get
betwixt the skin and the flesh, the skin not at all ripped or
touch'd? Or how is it possible for any body to swallow
down <hi>Knives</hi> and <hi>pieces</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> a span long? which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that story of <hi>Vlricus Neusesser,</hi> is made good in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a young Wench, who when she had made cleane a
paire of shoes with a <hi>Knife,</hi> which she put in her bosome,
she after seeking for it, it could not be found any where, till
at length it began to discover it self in a swelling on her left
side, and at last was pulled out thence by the Chirurgion.
You may read the whole story in <hi>VVierus,</hi> lib. 4. It was
done at <hi>Levensteet</hi> in the Dukedome of <hi>Brunswick</hi> 1562.
An old Women had come to the house in the morning,
and a strange <hi>black Dog</hi> was found under the table.</p>
               <p>There are also other miraculous and supernaturall effects,
as in that maid of <hi>Saxonies</hi> speaking of Greek; and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Italy</hi> telling what was the best verse in all <hi>Virgill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another whom <hi>Caelius Rhodiginus</hi> profess'd he saw that
spoke from betwixt her legs. Another at <hi>Paris</hi> whom Dr.
<hi>Picard</hi> and other Divines would have dispossest, whom one
<hi>Hollerius</hi> a Physician deriding, as if it had been nothing
but Melancholy in the Woman and Ignorance in those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
was after convinc'd of the contrary, when he saw her
standing betwixt two other women and crying out of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
discerning her hands to be so fast bound that there was
no loosing of them without cutting the string. There was
not the appearance of any thing to any body but to the
<hi>possessed</hi> onely, who said she saw then a white cloud come
neer her when she was bound.</p>

him. And therefore the <hi>VVitch</hi> receiving some reall thing
from this or that other shape that appeared unto her, it is
an evident signe, that it was an externall thing that she
saw, not a mere figuration of her <hi>melancholy Phansy.</hi>
There are innumerable examples of this kind, but the thing
is so triviall and ordinary that it wants no instances. I will

examin'd 11. Aprill 1646. confessed as followes. <q>Having
lost his purse with seven shillings in it, for which he
suspected one in the family where he lived, he saith, that
on a Friday while he was making hay bottles in the barn,
and swore and curs'd and rag'd, and wisht to himself that
some <hi>wise</hi> body would help him to his purse a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d money
again, there appear'd unto him a <hi>Spirit</hi> in the shape of a
<hi>Beare</hi> but not so big as a <hi>Coney,</hi> who promis'd upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he would fall down and worship him, he would
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62817:80"/>
help him to his purse. He assented to it, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> told
him to morrow about this time he should find his purse
upon the floor where he made bottles, and that he would
then come himself also; which was done accordingly: and
thus at the time appointed recovering his purse he fell
down upon his knees to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and said, <hi>My Lord
and God I thank you.</hi> This <hi>Spirit</hi> brought then with him
two other, in the shape the one of a white <hi>Cat,</hi> the other
of a <hi>Coney,</hi> which at the command of the <hi>Beare-Spirit</hi> he
worshipped also. The <hi>Beare-Spirit</hi> told him he must
have his Soul when he dyed, that he must suck of
his body, that he must have some of his Bloud to seale the
Covenant. To all which he agreed, and so the <hi>Beare-Spirit</hi>
leaping up to his shoulder, prick'd him on the
head, and thence took bloud. After that, they all three
vanished, but ever since came to him once every twenty
four houres, and suck'd on his body, where the <hi>markes</hi>
are found. And that they had continually done thus for
this twenty nine yeares together.</q> That all these things
should be a mere <hi>dreame</hi> is a conceit more slight and
foolish than any dreame possibly can be. For that receiving
of his purse was a palpable and sensible pledge of the truth
of all the rest. And it is incredible that such a <hi>series</hi> of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
back'd with twenty nine yeares experience of
being suck'd and visited dayly, sometimes in the day time,
most commonly by night, by the same three <hi>Familiars,</hi>
should be nothing but the hanging together of so many
<hi>Melancholy Conceits</hi> and <hi>Phansies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth the <hi>sealing</hi> of <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>writing</hi> with
<hi>Bloud</hi> make such stories as these more to be suspected: For
it is not at all unreasonable that such Ceremonies should
passe betwixt a <hi>Spirit</hi> and a <hi>Man,</hi> when the like palpable
Rites are used for the more firmly tying of Man to God.
For whatsoever is crasse and externall leaves a stronger
Impresse upon the <hi>Phansy,</hi> and the remembrance of it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62817:80"/>
strikes the mind with more efficacy. So that assuredly the
<hi>Divel</hi> hath the greater hanck upon the Soul of a <hi>Witch</hi> or
<hi>Wizard,</hi> that hath been perswaded to complete their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi>
with him in such a grosse sensible way, and keepes
them more fast from revolting from him, than if they had
only contracted in bare words.</p>

               <p>BUt I shall now adde further stories that ought to gain
credit for the conspicuous effects recited in them. As
that which <hi>Paulus Grillandus</hi> reports of one not far from
<hi>Rome,</hi> who at the perswasion of his wife <hi>anointing</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as she had done before him, was carried away in the
aire to a great <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Wizards</hi> and <hi>VVitches,</hi> where
they were feasting under a Nut-Tree. But this stranger not

disappeared, and he poore man was left alone naked
an hundred miles off from home; whither when he had got
he accused his wife, she confess'd the fact, discovering also
her companions, who were therefore burnt with her.</p>
               <p>The same Authour writes a like story of a young girle
thirteen years old in the Dukedome of <hi>Spalatto,</hi> who being
brought into the like company and admiring the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the thing, and crying out <hi>Blessed God, what's here to
do!</hi> made the whole assembly vanish, was left herself in
the field alone, and wandring up and down was found
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62817:81"/>
by a countrey man to whom shee told the whole matter.</p>
               <p>So the Husband of the Witch of <hi>Lochiae,</hi> whom she
brought into the like Assembly, by saying <hi>O my God where
are we?</hi> made all to vanish, and found himself naked alone
in the field fifteen dayes journey from home.</p>
               <p>Severall other stories to this purpose <hi>Bodinus</hi> sets down,
which these sensible effects of being so far distant from home
and being found naked in the fields, shew to be no freakes
of <hi>Melancholy</hi> but certain <hi>truth.</hi> But that the <hi>Divel</hi> in
these junquetings appeares to the Guests in the form of a
<hi>Satyr, black Goat,</hi> or else sometimes in the shape of an ill-favoured
<hi>black man,</hi> is the ordinary confession of <hi>VVitches,</hi>
by this way discovered and convicted.</p>
               <p>Of his appearance in the shape of a <hi>man</hi> in <hi>black</hi> at
least, if not a <hi>black man,</hi> a young woman committed for
the suspicion of <hi>VVitchcraft,</hi> at the castle in <hi>Cambridge</hi> told
my learned friend <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Cudworth</hi> and my self this story.
How one <hi>Lendall-wife,</hi> who afterwards at <hi>Cambridge</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for a <hi>Witch,</hi> made a motion to her of procuring her
a husband; she accepted of it. The day and hour appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
her <hi>Sweet-heart</hi> met her at <hi>Lendall's</hi> house. He
brake the businesse to her; but in the middle of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
she did but turne her head aside and he was vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and instead of a good proper Yeomanlike <hi>Man</hi> there
was found in the chaire, where he did sit, nothing but a
young <hi>Whelp</hi> lying on the cushion.</p>
               <p>Shee told us also how upon a time when she dwelt with
a Dame in a little town near <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and was sent into
the fields to gather sticks, that <hi>Lendall-wife</hi> did meet her
there and urged the old businesse again, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cause she
would not consent to it, that shee beat her unmercifully,
pulled off all her cloathes, and left her naked and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
dead upon the ground, and that she thought, if her
Dame had not come to seek her, and had not found her,
she had died no other death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:62817:81"/>
She told us also how at another time the door being shut
and she going to bed, that her <hi>Sweet-heart</hi> came to her
himself, earnestly desiring that the Match might goe on:
which she as resolutely refusing, he grew very angry, and
asked her if she would make a fool of him, and gave her
such a parting blow upon her thigh that it was black and
blew a good while after. But that which I aime at hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
sometime betwixt these passages I have already
related.</p>
               <p>While this marriage was driving on, the Wench was
again invited to <hi>Lendall-wife's</hi> house, where she might
meet with her <hi>Sweet-heart</hi> at a supper. Shee told us, when
she was come, that shee waited <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> great while below, and
marvelled that there was neither fire nor rost-meat nor
any thing else that could promise any such entertainment
as was expected, nor did she see any thing brought into
the house all the while she was there, and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that at supper time the table was well furnish't as
well with <hi>guests</hi> as <hi>meat.</hi> He that did sit at the upper end
of the table was all in <hi>black,</hi> to whom the rest gave very
much respect, bowing themselves with a great deal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
whenever they spake to him. But what the wench
seemed most of all affected with, was that the company
spake such a <hi>Language</hi> as she understood not; and <hi>Lendall-wife</hi>
whom at other times, she said, she could understand
very well, when she spake then at table she could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
at all. Old <hi>Stranguidge</hi> (of whom there hath been
reported ever since I came to the Universitie that he was
carried over <hi>Shelford</hi> Steeple upon a <hi>black Hogge</hi> and tore
his breeches upon the weather-cock) was one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
I doe not remember any other she told us of that
wee knew; but there were severall that she her self knew
not. It was darke when they went to supper, and yet there
was neither candle nor candlestick on the board, but a <hi>move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
light</hi> hovered over them, that waf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed it self this way
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62817:82"/>
and that way in the aire betwixt the seeling and the table.
Under this glimmering lamp they ate their victuals and
entertain'd discourse in that unknown Dialect. She amazed
at the strangenesse of the businesse and weary of attending
of so uncouth a company, as she said, slunck away from
them and left them.</p>
               <p>As for my own part, I should have looked upon this
whole Narration as a mere idle <hi>fancy</hi> or sick mans <hi>dream,</hi>
had it not been that my beliefe was so much enlarged by
that palpable satisfaction I received from what wee heard
from foure or five <hi>VVitches</hi> which we lately examined
before: And yet what I heard was but such matters as are
ordinarily acknowledged by such <hi>VVitches</hi> as will confesse.
And therefore I shall rather leave my Reader to wait the
like opportunity, then trouble my self with setting down
any further examinations of my own.</p>
               <p>I will only adde a Story or two out of <hi>Remigius</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
these <hi>Conventicles</hi> of <hi>Witches,</hi> and then I will proceed
to some other proofs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Hembach</hi> was carried by his Mother being a
<hi>Witch</hi> to one of these Conventicles, and because he had
learnt to play on the <hi>Pipe,</hi> was commanded by her to
exercise his faculty &amp; to get up into a Tree, that they might
the better hear his Musick. Which he doing, &amp; looking upon
the Dancers, how uncouth and ridiculous they were in their
Motions and Gestures, being struck with admiration at
the novelty of the matter, suddenly burst out into these
words, <hi>Good God, what a mad company have we here!</hi>
Which was no sooner said, but down came <hi>John, Pipe</hi> and
all, and hurt his shoulder with the tumbling cast, who
when he called to the company to help him, found himself
alone, for they had all vanish'd, <hi>John of Hembach</hi> told
the story, but people knew not what to make of it, till some
of that mad Crue that danc'd to his pipe, were apprehended
upon other suspicions, as <hi>Catharina Praevotia, Kelvers
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62817:82"/>
Orilla,</hi> and others, who made good every whit what <hi>John</hi>
had before told (though they knew nothing of what he
told before) adding also more particularly that the place
where he pip'd to them was <hi>Maybuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other memorable Story that I shall relate out of
<hi>Remigius</hi> is this. One <hi>Nicolea Langbernhard,</hi> while she
was going towards <hi>Assenunturia</hi> along a hedge side, spied
in the next field (it was about Noon-time of day) a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of men and women dancing in a ring; and the posture
of their bodies being uncouth and unusuall made her
view them more attentively, whereby she discerned some of
them to have cloven feet, like Oxen or Goats (it should
seem they were <hi>Spirits</hi> in the shape of lusty <hi>Satyrs</hi>) she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
astonish'd with fear cryes out, <hi>Jesus help me and send
me well home.</hi> She had no sooner said so, but they all vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
saving onely one <hi>Peter Grospetter,</hi> whom a little after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
she saw snatch'd up into the aire and to let fall his
Maulkin (a stick that they make cleane ovens withall) and
her self was also driven so forcibly with the winde, that it
made her almost loose her breath. She was faine to keep
her bed three dayes after.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Peter</hi> (though at first he would have followed the
Law on <hi>Nicolea</hi> for slandring him, yet) afterward freely
confess'd and discovered others of his companions, as <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belia</hi>
the wife of <hi>Joannes Latomus, Mayetta</hi> the wife of
<hi>Laurentius,</hi> who confessed she danced with those cloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed
Creatures at what time <hi>Peter</hi> was amongst them.
And for further evidence of the businesse <hi>John Michaell,</hi>
Herds-man, did confesse, that while they thus danced, he
plaid upon his <hi>Crooked staffe,</hi> and struck upon it with his
fingers, as if it had been a <hi>Pipe,</hi> sitting upon an high bough
of an Oake; and that so soon as <hi>Nicolea</hi> called upon the
name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> he tumbled down headlong to the ground,
but was presently catch'd up again with a whirldwind, and
carryed to <hi>Weiller Meadowes,</hi> where he had left his Herds
a little before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62817:83"/>
Adde unto all this, that there was found in the place where
they danced a <hi>round Circle</hi> wherein there was the manifest
ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kes of the treading of cloven feet, which were seen from
the day after <hi>Nicolea</hi> had discover'd the businesse, till the
next Winter that the plough cut them out. These things
happened in the yeare 1590.</p>

professe they will tell what is done within so many
miles compasse, and afterwards to give a proof of their

(which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Were-VVolff;</hi> the French <hi>Loups

what the same reason of other <hi>Transformations.</hi> I shall not
trouble you with any Histories of them, though I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

of the Divell and mere Tragedies in Dreames, as they that

parties that have confessed themselves thus transformed
have been <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>sore</hi> with running, have been <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
and the like. <hi>Bodinus</hi> here also is deserted of <hi>Remigius,</hi>
who is of the same mind with <hi>VVierus,</hi> that sly, smooth

sure to load the <hi>Divell</hi> as much as he can, his shoulders

that <hi>Bodinus</hi> may very well make good his own, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any thing those do alledge to the contrary. For
that which <hi>Wierus</hi> and <hi>Remigius</hi> seem so much to stand
upon, that it is too great a power for the Divell and too
great indignity to Man, that he should be able thus to
<hi>transform</hi> him; are in my mind but slight Rhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no sound Arguments.</p>
               <p>For what is that <hi>outward mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>apement</hi> of <hi>Body</hi> to the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
deformity</hi> of their <hi>Souls,</hi> which he helps on so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously?
And they having given themselves over to him so
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62817:84"/>
wholy, why may he not use them thus <hi>here,</hi> when they
shall be worse used by him <hi>hereafter?</hi> And for the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>species</hi> of things, if that were a power too big to
be granted the Divell, yet it is no more done here, when he
thus transforms a <hi>Man</hi> into a <hi>VVolf,</hi> then when he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
<hi>himself</hi> into the shape of a <hi>Man.</hi> For this <hi>VVolf</hi>
is still a <hi>Man,</hi> and that <hi>Man</hi> is still a <hi>Divell.</hi> For it is so
as the Poet sayes it was in <hi>Vlysses</hi> his companions which
<hi>Circe</hi> turned into <hi>Hoggs,</hi> They had the Head, the Voice,
the Body and Bristles of <hi>Hoggs;</hi>
                  <q>—<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</q>
But their Understanding was unchanged, they had the Mind
and Memory of a <hi>Man</hi> as before. As <hi>Petrus Bourgotus</hi>
professeth that when his companion <hi>Michael Verdung</hi> had
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ointed his body and transform'd him into a <hi>Wolf,</hi> when
he look'd upon his hairy feet he was at first affraid of
himself.</p>
               <p>Now therefore it being plain that nothing materiall is
alledged to the contrary, and that men confesse they are
turn'd into <hi>Wolves,</hi> and acknowledge the salvage cruelties
they then committed upon <hi>Children, Women</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi>
that they find themselves exceeding <hi>weary,</hi> and sometimes
<hi>wounded;</hi> it is more naturall to conclude they were <hi>really</hi>
thus <hi>transformed,</hi> then that it was a mere <hi>Delusion</hi> of
<hi>Phansy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I conceive the Divell gets into their body, and by
his subtile substance, more operative and searching than any
fire or putrifying liquour, melts the yielding <hi>Compages</hi> of
the body to such a consistency, and so much of it as is fitt
for his purpose, and makes it plyable to his imagination:
and then it is as easy for him to work it into what <hi>Shape</hi> he
pleaseth, as it is to work the Aire into such forms and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
as he ordinarily doth. Nor is it any more difficulty
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62817:84"/>
for him to mollify what is hard, then it is to harden what is
so soft and fluid as the Aire.</p>
               <p>And he that hath this power, we can never stick to give
him that which is lesse, <hi>viz.</hi> to instruct men how they
shall for a time <hi>forsake their Bodies,</hi> and come in again.
For can it be a hard thing for him, that can thus melt and
take a pieces the particles of the Body, to have the skill and
power to loosen the Soul, a substance really distinct from
the Body and separable from it; which at last is done by
the easy course of Nature, at that finall dissolution of Soul
and Body which we call <hi>Death?</hi> But no course of Nature
ever transforms the body of <hi>Man</hi> into the shape of a <hi>Wolf;</hi>
so that this is more hard and exo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bitant from the order of
Nature then the other.</p>
               <p>I but you'l say the greatnesse and incrediblenesse of the
Miracle is this; That there should be an actuall <hi>separation</hi>
of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> and yet no <hi>Death.</hi> But this is not at all
strange if we consider that <hi>Death</hi> is properly a disjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Soul from the Body by reason of the <hi>Bodie's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitnesse</hi>
any longer to entertain the Soul, which may be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by extremity of <hi>Diseases,</hi> outward <hi>Violence</hi> or <hi>Age;</hi>
And if the Divell could restore such bodies as these to life,
it were a miracle indeed. But this is not such a miracle, nor
is the Body properly dead, though the Soul be out of it.
For the <hi>life</hi> of the Body is nothing else but that <hi>fitnesse</hi> to be
actuated by the Soul. The conservation whereof is help'd,
as I conceive, by the <hi>anointing</hi> of the Body before the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy;</hi>
which ointment filling the pores keeps out the cold
and keeps in the heat and Spirits, that the frame and temper
of the Body may continue in fit case to entertain th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mouth again, many looking on: when he waked he told how
he dream'd he had gone over an iron Bridge, and other
particulars answerable to what the spectatours had seen
afore-hand. <hi>Wierus</hi> acknowledgeth the truth of the
story, but will by all meanes have it to be the <hi>Divell,</hi> not
the <hi>Soul</hi> of the Man; which he doth in a tender regard to
the <hi>Witches,</hi> that from such a truth as this they might not be

               <p>BUt to return into the way, I might adde other stories of
your <hi>Daemones Metallici,</hi> your <hi>Guardian Genii,</hi> such
as that of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and that other of which <hi>Bodinus</hi> tells an
ample story, which hee received from him who had the
society and assistance of such an <hi>Angell</hi> or <hi>Genius,</hi> which
for my own part I give as much credit to as to any story
in <hi>Livy</hi> or <hi>Plutarch:</hi> Your <hi>Lares familiares,</hi> as also those
that haunt and vexe families appearing to many and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
very sensible effects of their appearings. But I will
not so farre tire either my self or my Reader. I will only
name one or two storyes more, rather then recite them.
As that of <hi>Cardan,</hi> who writes as you may see in <hi>Otho Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
that a <hi>Spirit</hi> that familiarly was seen in the house
of a friend of his, one night layd his hand upon his brow
which felt intolerably <hi>cold.</hi> And so <hi>Petrus Bourgotus</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:62817:86"/>
confessed that when the <hi>Divell</hi> gave him his hand to
kisse, it felt <hi>cold.</hi> And many more examples there be to this
purpose.</p>
               <p>And indeed it stands to very good reason that the bodies
of <hi>Divels</hi> being nothing but <hi>coagulated Aire</hi> should be <hi>cold,</hi>
as well as <hi>coagulated Water,</hi> which is <hi>Snow</hi> or <hi>Ice</hi> and that
it should have a more keen and piercing <hi>cold,</hi> it consisting
of more subtile particles, than those of <hi>water,</hi> and therefore
more fit to insinuate, and more accurately and stingingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to affect and touch the nerves.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Witches</hi> confessing so frequently as they do,
that the Divel <hi>lyes with them,</hi> and withall complaining of
his tedious and offensive <hi>coldnesse,</hi> it is a shrewd presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
that he doth lie with them <hi>indeed,</hi> and that it is not a
mere <hi>Dreame,</hi> as their friend <hi>Wierus</hi> would have it.</p>
               <p>Hence we may also discover the folly of that opinion that
makes the very essence of <hi>Spirits</hi> to be <hi>fire:</hi> for how unfit
that would be to coagulate the aire is plain at first sight. It
would rather <hi>melt</hi> and dissolve these consistencies then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringe
them and <hi>freeze</hi> them in a manner. But it is rather
manifest that the essence of <hi>Spirits</hi> is a substance specifically
distinct from all corporeall matter whatsoever. But my
intent is not to Philosophize concerning the nature of
<hi>Spirits,</hi> but only to prove their <hi>Existence.</hi> Which the story
of the <hi>Spectre</hi> at <hi>Ephesus</hi> may be a further argument of. For
that old man which <hi>Apollonius</hi> told the <hi>Ephesians</hi> was the
walking plague of the city, when they stoned him and unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the heap, appear'd in the shape of an huge <hi>black dog</hi>
as big as the biggest Lion. This could be no imposture of

of the truth of <hi>Ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>neus</hi> his <hi>Miracles,</hi> that he does not
stick to term him impudent, that has the face to deny them.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>English Chronicles</hi> also tell us of <hi>Apparitions; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
men, foot</hi> and <hi>horse, fighting</hi> upon the ground in the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62817:86"/>
North part of <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Ireland</hi> for many Evenings
together, seen by many hundreds of men at once, and that
the grasse was troden down in the places where they were
seen to fight their <hi>Battailes:</hi> which agreeth with <hi>Nicolea
Langbernhard</hi> her Story of the <hi>cloven-footed Dancers,</hi> that
left the print of their hoofs in the <hi>ring</hi> they trod down, for
a long time after.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>skirmishing</hi> upon the Earth puts me in mind of
the last part of this argument, and bids me look up into the
<hi>Aire.</hi> Where omitting all other Prodigies I shall only take
notice of what is most notorious, and of which there can by
no meanes be given any other account, then that it is the
effect of <hi>Spirits.</hi> And this is the appearance of <hi>armed men

not much higher then the house tops; as also in <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
where there was a Sea-fight appearing in the aire for
an houre or two together, many thousands of men looking
on. And to say nothing of what hath been seen in <hi>England</hi>
not long ago, there is lately a punctuall narration of such a
Sea-fight seen by certain <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and sent over hither

whose reports cannot be suspected to be in subserviency to

an acquaintance of <hi>Bodinus</hi>'s, freely told him, how that he
had a certain <hi>Spirit</hi> that did perpetually accompany him,

which he was then first aware of, when he had attain'd to
about thirty seven years of Age, but conceiv'd that the said

gathered from certain Monitory <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visions,</hi>
whereby he was forewarn'd as well of severall dangers as

what <hi>Religion,</hi> amongst those many that are contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

and therefore following <hi>Philo's</hi> counsell, that he offered
his <hi>Soul</hi> to God. And that after that, amongst many other
divine <hi>Dreames</hi> and <hi>Visions,</hi> he once in his sleep seemed to
hear the voice of God saying to him, <hi>I will save thy Soul,
I am he that before appeared unto thee.</hi> Afterwards that
the <hi>Spirit</hi> every day would knock at the doore about three
or four a clock in the morning, though he rising and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the doore could see no body, but that the <hi>Spirit</hi> persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in this course, and unlesse he did rise, would thus rouze
him up.</p>
               <p>This trouble and boisterousnesse made him begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that it was some <hi>evill Spirit</hi> that thus haunted him,
and therefore he daily pray'd earnestly unto God, that he
would be pleased to send a <hi>good Angell</hi> to him, and often
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62817:88"/>
also sung Psalmes, having most of them by heart.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the <hi>Spirit</hi> afterward knocked more gently at
the doore, and one day discovered himself to him waking,
which was the first time that he was assured by his senses
that it was he; for he often touched and stirred a Drinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse
that stood in his chamber, which did not a little
amaze him.</p>
               <p>Two dayes after when he entertain'd at supper a certain

that this <hi>Spirit</hi> was alwayes with him, and by some sensible

accosted him. If he was about to eat or drink any thing that

               <p>When he began to praise God in Psalmes and to declare
his marveilous Acts, that he was presently raised and
strengthened with a spirituall and supernaturall power.</p>
               <p>That he daily begg'd of God that he would teach him
his Will, his Law and his Truth; And that he set one day
of the week apart for reading the Scripture and Meditation,
with singing of Psalmes, and that he did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> out of his
house all that day; But that in his ordinary conversation he
was sufficiently merry and of a chearfull minde, and he
cited that saying for it, <hi>Vidi facies Sanctorum laetas.</hi> But
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62817:88"/>
in his conversing with others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he had talked vainly and
indiscreetly, or had some daies together neglected his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,</hi>
that he was forthwith admonished thereof by a
<hi>Dreame.</hi> That he was also admonished to rise betimes in
the Morning, and that about four of the clock a voice
would come to him while he was asleep, saying, <hi>Who
gets up first to pray?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He told <hi>Bodinus</hi> also how he was often admonish'd to
give <hi>Almes,</hi> and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> more <hi>Charity</hi> he bestow'd, the
more prosperous he was. And that on a time when his
enemies sought after his life, and knew that he was to go by
water, that his Father in a <hi>Dreame</hi> brought two <hi>Horses</hi> to
him, the one <hi>white,</hi> the other <hi>bay;</hi> and that therefore he bid
his servant hire him two horses, and though he told him
nothing of the colours, that yet he brought him a <hi>white</hi> one
and a <hi>bay</hi> one.</p>
               <p>That in all difficulties, journeyings and what other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes
soever, he used to ask counsell of God, and that
one night, when he had begged his blessing, while he slept
he saw a <hi>Vision</hi> wherein his Father seemed to blesse
him.</p>
               <p>At another time, when he was in very great <hi>Danger,</hi>
and was newly gone to bed, he said that the <hi>Spirit</hi> would
not let him alone till he had raised him again, wherefore he
watched and pray'd all that night. The day after he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the hands of his Persecuters in a wonderfull manner;
which being done, in his next sleep he heard a <hi>voice</hi> saying,
Now sing, <hi>Quisedet in latibulo Altissi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A great many other passages this Party told <hi>Bodinus,</hi> so
many indeed, that he thought it an endlesse labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
them all. But what remains of those he has recited, I
will not stick to take the pains of transcribing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bodinus</hi> asked him why he would not <hi>speak to the Spirit</hi>
for the gaining of the more plain and familiar converse with
it. He answered that he once attempted it, but the <hi>Spirit</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:62817:89"/>
instantly struck the doore with that vehemency, as if he had
knock'd upon it with an hammer, whereby he gathered his
<hi>dislike</hi> of the matter.</p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Spirit</hi> would not talk with him, yet he
could make use of his judgement in the reading of books and
moderating his studies. For if he took an <hi>ill book</hi> into his
hands and fell a reading, the <hi>Spirit</hi> would <hi>strike</hi> it, that he
might lay it down, and would also sundry times, be the
books what they would, <hi>hinder</hi> him from <hi>reading</hi> and
<hi>writing</hi> overmuch, that his minde might rest, and silently
meditate with it self. He added also, that very often while
he was <hi>awake,</hi> a small, subtile, inarticulate <hi>sound</hi> would
come unto his eares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bodinus</hi> further enquiring whether he ever see the <hi>Shape</hi>
and <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he told him that while he was <hi>awake</hi>
he never see any thing but a certain <hi>light</hi> very <hi>bright</hi> and
<hi>clear</hi> and of a <hi>round Compasse</hi> and <hi>Figure;</hi> But that once,
being in great jeopardy of his life, and having heartily
pray'd to God that he would be pleased to provide for his
safety, about break of day, amidst his slumberings and
wakings, he espyde on his bed where he lay <hi>a young Boy
clad in a white Garment tinctured somewhat with a touch
of purple, and of a visage admirably lovely and beautifull
to behold.</hi> This he confidently affirmed to <hi>Bodinus</hi> for a
certain truth.</p>

               <head type="sub">Certain Enquiries upon the preceding Story; as, What

               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:62817:89"/>
IT is beside my present scope, as I have already professed,
to enter into any more particular and more curious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions
concerning the nature of <hi>Spirits,</hi> my ayme being
now onely to demonstrate their <hi>Existence</hi> by those strange
<hi>Effects</hi> recorded every where in History. But this last
Narration is so extraordinarily remarkable, that it were a
piece of disrespect done to it, to dismisse it without some
Enquiries at least into such <hi>Problems</hi> as it naturally affords
to our consideration, though it may well seem plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the power of humane Witt, or lawes of Modesty to
determine any thing therein.</p>
               <p>In the first place therefore, it cannot but amuse a man's
minde to think what these officious <hi>Spirits</hi> should be, that
so willingly sometimes offer themselves to consociate with
a man; whether they may be <hi>Angels</hi> uncapable of incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
into humane Bodies, which vulgarly is conceived:
Or whether the <hi>Souls of the deceased,</hi> they having more
affinity with mortality and humane frailty then the other,
and so more sensible of our necessities and infirmities, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once felt them themselves; a reason alledged for the
Incarnation of <hi>Christ</hi> by the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi>
Which opinion has no worse Favourers then <hi>Plutarch,
Maximus Tyrius,</hi> and other <hi>Platonists:</hi> Or lastly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there may not be of <hi>both sorts.</hi> For separate Souls
being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in a condition not unlike the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
it is easy to conceive that they may very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the like Offices.</p>
               <p>Secondly we are invited to enquire, whether every man
have his <hi>Guardian Genius</hi> or no. That <hi>Witches</hi> have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
such as they are, their own confessions testify. The <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>
were of opinion that every man has two <hi>Genii,</hi> a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62817:90"/>
                  <hi>good</hi> one and a <hi>bad</hi> one. Which <hi>Mahomet</hi> has taken into
his Religion, adding also, that they sit on Mens shoulders
with table-books in their hands, and that the one writes
down all the <hi>good,</hi> the other all the <hi>evill</hi> a man does. But
such expressions as those I look upon as Symbolicall rather
then Naturall. And I think it more reasonable that a
man changing the frame of his minde changes his <hi>Genius</hi>
withall: Or rather, unless a man be very sincere and single-hearted
that he is left to common Providence, as well as if
he be not desperately wicked or deplorably miserable,
scarce any particular <hi>evill Spirit</hi> interposes or offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a perpetuall <hi>Assistent</hi> in his affaires and fortunes. But
extreme Poverty, irksome old Age, want of Friends, the
Contempt, Injury and Hardheartednesse of evill Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
working upon a Soul low sunk into the body and
wholy devoid of the Divine life, does sometimes kindle so
sharp, so eager, and so piercing a desire of Satisfaction and
Revenge, that the shreeks of men while they are a murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the howling of a Wolf in the fields in the night, or the
squeaking and roring of tortured Beasts do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o certainly
call to them those of their own kinde, as this powerfull
<hi>Magick</hi> of a pensive and complaining soul in the bitternesse
of it's affliction attracts the ayd of these over-officious
<hi>Spirits.</hi> So that it is most probable that they that are the
forwardest to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ang Witches</hi> are the first that <hi>made</hi> them,
and have no more goodnesse nor true piety then these they
so willingly prosecute, but are as wicked as they, though
with better luck or more discretion, offending no further
then the Law will permit them, and therefore they securely
starve the poor helpless <hi>man,</hi> though with a great deal of
clamour of justice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will revenge the death of their
<hi>Hogg,</hi> or <hi>Cow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly it were worth our disquisition, why <hi>Spirits</hi> so
<hi>seldome</hi> now adayes <hi>appear,</hi> especially those that are <hi>good;</hi>
whether it be not the <hi>wickednesse</hi> of the present <hi>Age,</hi> as I
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62817:90"/>
have already hinted; or the generall <hi>prejudice</hi> men have
against all <hi>Spirits</hi> that appear, that they must be straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<hi>Divells;</hi> or the <hi>frailty</hi> of <hi>humane nature</hi> that is not
usually able to bear the appearance of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> no more
then other Animalls are, for into what agonies <hi>Horses</hi> and
<hi>Doggs</hi> are cast upon their approach, is in every ones mouth,
and is a good circumstance to distinguish a <hi>reall Apparition</hi>
from our own Imaginations; or lastly whether it be the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
of <hi>Spirits</hi> themselves, who, it may be, without some
violence done to their own nature cannot become visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it being happily as troublesome a thing to them, to
keep themselves in one steady visible consistency in the
aire, as it is for men that dive, to hold their breath in the
water.</p>
               <p>Fourthly it may deserve our search, whether <hi>Spirits</hi>
have any settled <hi>forme</hi> or <hi>shape. Angells</hi> are commonly
pictured like good plump cher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is no wond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, the boldnesse of the same <hi>Artists</hi> not stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to picture God Almighty in the shape of an old man.
In both it is as it pleases the <hi>Painter.</hi> But this story seems
rather to favour their opinion, that say that <hi>Angells</hi> and
seperate <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uls</hi> have no settled <hi>forme</hi> but what they please
to give themselves upon occasion, by the power of their own
Phansy. <hi>Ficinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> as I remember, somewhere calls them
<hi>Aereall Starres.</hi> And the <hi>good Genii</hi> seem to me to be
as the benigne Eyes of God running to and fro in the world
with love and pitty beholding the innocent endeavours of
harmlesse and single-hearted men, ever ready to doe them
good and to help them.</p>
               <p>What I conceive of separate <hi>Soules</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
better expresse then I have already in my <hi>Poem</hi> of <hi>the
Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be better then my word, who in my <hi>Preface</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
no <hi>Poetry</hi> at all, but I shall not think much to offer
to your view these two Stanzas out of the forenamed <hi>Poem.</hi>

into his very <hi>Body,</hi> as well as the <hi>bad</hi> into the bodies
of the wicked, and that residing in his <hi>braine</hi> and figuring
of it, by thinking of this or that Object, as we ourselves
figure it when we think, the external senses being laid asleep,
those figurations would easily be represented to the <hi>Common
sense;</hi> and that <hi>Memory</hi> recovering them when he awaked,
they could not but seem to him as other <hi>Dreames</hi> did
saving that they were better, they ever signifying some
thing of importance unto him.</p>
               <p>But those Raptures of <hi>Devotion</hi> by day, might be by the
<hi>Spirits</hi> kindling a purer kinde of Love-flame in his heart, as
well as by fortifying and raising his Imagination. And how
far a man shall be carried beyond himself by this redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
soul in him, none, I think, can well conceive unlesse
they had the experience of it.</p>
               <p>And if this be their manner of communion, it may well
be enquired into, in the sixt place, whether <hi>all men</hi> be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of consociation with these <hi>good Genii. Cardan</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
intimates that their approaches are deprehensible by
certain <hi>sweet smells</hi> they cast. From whence it may seem
not improbable, that those bodies that smell <hi>sweet</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
where the mind does not stink with pride and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy,
have some naturall advantage for the gaining their
society. But if there be any peculiar <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

anguish, may well <hi>rectify</hi> all uncleannesse of nature; so that
no singularly good and sincere man can reasonably despaire
of their Familiarity. For he that is so highly in favour
with the <hi>Prince,</hi> it is no wonder he is taken notice of by his
<hi>Courtiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the last and most considerable question is, whether
it be lawfull to <hi>pray</hi> to God for such a <hi>good Genius</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell.</hi>
For the Example in the foregoing story seems a
sufficient warrant. But I conceive Faith and Desire ought
to be full-sayle to make such Voiages prosperous, and our

to such a free and universall sense of Charity as to be delighted
with the welfare of another as much as our own. They

answer, That I will not take my oath that the most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>THus have we gone through the many and manifold

his escape.</p>
               <p>And such are especially these two last I insisted upon, the

force of the former some indeavour to evade thus; <q>That
there hath ever been Man and Woman and other <hi>Species</hi>
in the world, and so it is no wonder that like should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate

its like, and therefore that there is no want of any
other invisible or materiall cause but the <hi>species</hi> of things
themselves: And so these admirable contrivances in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
must imply no divine <hi>VVisdome</hi> nor <hi>Counsell</hi> or any

               </p>
               <p>But here I demand whether there were <hi>ever</hi> any <hi>Man</hi>
that was not <hi>mortall,</hi> and whether there be any <hi>mortall</hi> that

that there hath been an <hi>infinite</hi> number of <hi>successions</hi> of

                  </gap>llfully to winke against the light of Nature, and do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the faculties of his minde. And therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
there must be at least one <hi>first Man</hi> and <hi>VVoman</hi>
which are first <hi>ordine Naturae,</hi> though <hi>infinity</hi> of time
reckoning from the present causeth a confusion &amp; obscurity
in our apprehensions. And these which are thus <hi>first</hi> in <hi>order</hi>
of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Causality</hi> must also exist first before there can
be any other Men or Women in the World. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
concerning these first it being manifest that they were
born of no Parents, it follows they were <hi>Created</hi> or rose
out of the Earth, and so the <hi>Evasion</hi> will be frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Besides if you affirm that there was <hi>never</hi> any <hi>Man</hi> in
the world but who was born of a <hi>VVoman,</hi> and so grew to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62817:93"/>
Mans estate by degrees, it will fall to some mans share to be
a <hi>Babe</hi> and a <hi>Man</hi> at once, or to be both <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Child,</hi>
For so soon as Mankind was (let it be from Aeternity, and
beyond Aeternity is nothing) those that then existed were
begot of <hi>some body,</hi> and there was <hi>nothing</hi> before them to
beget them, therefore they begot <hi>themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that they should at once then have been <hi>perfect
men,</hi> their substances being of alterable and passive mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that is wrought diversly and by degrees into that frame
it hath, is as rash, as if they should say that <hi>Bootes,</hi> and
<hi>Shooes,</hi> and <hi>Stockins,</hi> and <hi>Pyes,</hi> and <hi>Peels,</hi> and <hi>Ovens</hi> have
been together with all <hi>Aeternity:</hi> when as it is manifest
there ought to be an orderly intervall of time before these
things can be, wherein must precede the killing of Oxen,
and flaying of them, as also of Sheep, tanning, spinning,
cutting, and many more such like circumstances. So that it
is enormously ridiculous to say that <hi>Mankind</hi> might have
been at once from all <hi>Aeternity,</hi> unlesse the Omnipotency
of a God, who can do what ever we can imagine and more,
should by his unresistable <hi>Fiat</hi> cause such a thing in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so soon as himself was, which was ever, and he was
never to seek for either power or skill.</p>
               <p>But that the fluid <hi>Matter</hi> of it self should have been thus
raised up from all <hi>Aeternity</hi> into such compleat <hi>Species</hi>
of things, is very groundlesse and irrationall. I say, that
there ever should be such a thing as this in the world, a
<hi>man</hi> at once existing of himself in this corporeall frame
that we see, who notwithstanding did afterwards dye like
other mortalls; is a fable above all Poeticall Figments
whatsoever, and more incredible then the hardest Article
that any Religion ever offered to the <hi>Atheist's</hi> beliefe.</p>
               <p>Others therefore deserting this way of <hi>Evasion</hi> betake
themselves to another, which, though it seem more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
at first view, is fully as frivolous. They say that <q>all
the <hi>Species</hi> of things, <hi>Man</hi> himself not excepted, came

               <head type="sub">That the Evasions of Atheists against <hi>Apparitions</hi> are so
weak and silly, that it is an evident Argument that
they are convinced in their own Judgements of the Truth
of these kinds of Phaenomena, which forces them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
as well as they can, though they be so ill provided.</head>
               <p>NOw for their <hi>Evasions</hi> whereby they would elude the
force of that Argument for <hi>Spirits,</hi> which is drawn
from <hi>Apparitions,</hi> they are so weak and silly, that a man
may be almost sure they were convinced in their judgement
of the truth of such like Stories, else it had been better
flatly to have denied them, then to feigne such idle and
vain reasons of them.</p>
               <p>For first they say they are nothing but <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and
that there is nothing <hi>reall without us</hi> in such <hi>Apparitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But being beaten off from this slight account, for that
many see the same thing at once, then they fly to so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
a power of <hi>Phansy,</hi> as if it were able to change the
Aire into a reall shape and form, so that others may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it, as well as he that fram'd it by the power of his
<hi>Phansy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:62817:95"/>
Now I demand of any man, whether this be not a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Mysterie and more unconceivable then all the <hi>Magicall
Metamorphoses</hi> of <hi>Divells</hi> or <hi>Witches.</hi> For it is farre
easyer to conceive that some <hi>knowing thing</hi> in the <hi>Aire</hi>
should thus transform the Aire into this or that shape, being
in that part of the Aire it doth thus transform, then that the
<hi>Imagination</hi> of man, which is but a Modification of his own
mind, should be able at a distance to change it into such
like Appearances, But suppose it could, can it <hi>animate</hi> the
Aire that it doth thus metamorphize, and make it <hi>speak,</hi>
and <hi>answer</hi> to questions, and <hi>put things</hi> into mens hands,
and the like? O the credulity of besotted <hi>Atheisme!</hi>
How intoxicated and infatuated are they in their conceits,
being given up to sensuality, and having lost the free use of
the naturall faculties of their minde!</p>
               <p>But shall this force of <hi>Imagination</hi> reach as high as the
<hi>Clouds</hi> also, and make Men <hi>fight</hi> pitched Battails <hi>in the
Aire,</hi> running and charging one against the other?</p>
               <p>Here the same bold pretender to Wit and Philosophy
<hi>Caesar Vaninus</hi> (who cunningly and jugglingly endeavours
to infuse the poyson of <hi>Atheisme</hi> into the mind of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
on every occasion) hath recourse to those old cast rags
of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his. School, the <hi>Exuvious Effluxes</hi> of things;
and attempts to salve these <hi>Phaenomena</hi> thus; That the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours</hi>
of <hi>mens bodies</hi> and it seems of <hi>Horses</hi> too, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up into the <hi>Aire</hi> and fall into a certain proportionable
posture of parts, and so imitate the figures of them aloft
among the clouds.</p>
               <p>But I demand how the vapours of the <hi>Horses</hi> finde the
vapours of their <hi>Riders:</hi> and when and how long are
they coming together: and whether they appeare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there be any Armies in the Field to send up such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours:
and whether <hi>Harnesse</hi> and <hi>Weapons</hi> send up va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
too, as <hi>Swords, Pikes,</hi> and <hi>Shields:</hi> and how they
come to light so happily into the hands of those Aeriall men

And that is this: That these sigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Earth.</hi> But this in Nature is plainly impossible. For of
necessity these Armies thus fighting, being at such a <hi>distance</hi>
from the Spectatours that the same of the Battail never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
to their eares, their eyes can never behold it by any

the images more <hi>dim</hi> then <hi>direct</hi> sight, such a <hi>distance</hi> from
the Army to the clouds, and then from the clouds to our
eye, will lessen the <hi>Species</hi> so exceedingly that they will not
at all be visible.</p>
               <p>Or if we could imag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t there might be some times
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62817:96"/>
such an advantage in the figure of these clouds as might
in some sort remedie this <hi>lessening</hi> of the <hi>Species,</hi> yet their
surfaces are so exceeding <hi>rudely polish'd,</hi> and <hi>Reflection</hi>
which, as I said, is ever <hi>dim</hi> enough of it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is here so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
<hi>imperfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that they can never be able, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the course of Nature, to returne the <hi>Species</hi> of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall
Objects back again to our sight, it being so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that they are unfit for what is of farr less difficulty.
For we never finde them able to reflect the image of a <hi>Starr</hi>
when as not onely glass, but every troubled pool or durty
plash of water in the High-way does usually do it.</p>
               <p>But that it is far easier for a <hi>Star,</hi> then for any of <hi>these
Objects</hi> here upon Earth to be <hi>reflected</hi> to our Eyes by those
rude naturall Looking-glasses placed among the clouds,
sundry reasons will sufficiently inform us.</p>
               <p>For first, The <hi>Starrs</hi> do not abate at all of their <hi>usuall
magnitude</hi> in which they ordinarily appeare to us, by this
refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ction; the difference of many hundreds of Leagues
making no difference of magnitude in them, for indeed the
distance of the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Orbite</hi> of the Earth makes
none, as must be acknowledged by all those that admit of
the annuall motion thereof. But a very few miles do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
diminish the usuall biggnesse of the <hi>Species</hi> of an
<hi>Horse</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> even to that littlenesse, that they grow
invisible. What then will become of his <hi>Sword, Shield,</hi> or
<hi>Speare?</hi> And in these cases we now speak of, how great a
journey the <hi>Species</hi> have from the Earth to the cloud that
reflects them, I have intimated before.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is manifest, that a <hi>Starre</hi> hath the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
above these <hi>Terrestiall Objects,</hi> in that it is as <hi>pure</hi> a
light as the <hi>Sunne,</hi> though not so <hi>bigg,</hi> but they but <hi>opake</hi>
coloured bodies, and that therefore there is no comparison
betwixt the vigour and strength of the <hi>Species</hi> of a <hi>Starre</hi>
and of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly in the <hi>Night-time,</hi> the Eye being placed in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62817:97"/>
shadow of the earth, those <hi>reflections</hi> of a <hi>Starr</hi> will be
yet more easily visible; whenas the great light of the <hi>Sun</hi>
by <hi>Day,</hi> must needes much debilitate these reflected Images
of the <hi>Objects</hi> upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> his beams striking our Eyes
with so strong vibrations.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, there being <hi>Starres</hi> all over the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
so as there is, it should seem a hundred times
more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>asie for naturall Causes to hit upon a <hi>Paraster</hi> or
<hi>Parastron</hi> (for let Analogie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mbolden me so to call these
seldome or never seen <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> the image of a single
<hi>Starre</hi> or whole <hi>Constellation</hi> reflected from the clouds)
then upon a <hi>Parclios</hi> or <hi>Paraselenc.</hi> But now the story of
these is more then an hundred times more frequent then
that of the <hi>Paraster.</hi> For it is so seldome discovered that it
is doubted whither it be or no, or rather acknowledged not
to be, of which there can be no reason, but that the <hi>clouds</hi> are
so <hi>ill-polished</hi> that they are not able to reflect so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a light as a <hi>Starre.</hi> From whence I th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nk, we may
safely gather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is therefore impossible that they should
reflect so debile <hi>Species</hi> as the <hi>Colours,</hi> and <hi>Shapes</hi> of
Beasts and Men, and that so accurately, as that we may see
their <hi>swords, helmets, shields, speares,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is plaine that these <hi>Apparitions</hi> on high
in the <hi>Aire,</hi> are no <hi>Reflections</hi> of any <hi>Objects</hi> upon <hi>Earth;</hi>
or if it were imaginable that they were, that some <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
cause</hi> must assist to conglaciate &amp; polish the Surfaces
of the clouds to such an extraordinary accuracy of figure &amp;
smoothnesse, as will suffice for such prodigious <hi>Reflections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that these <hi>Spirits</hi> that rule in the <hi>Aire</hi> may not act
upon the Materials there, as well as <hi>Men</hi> here upon the
<hi>Earth</hi> work upon the parts thereof, as also upon the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Elements so farre as they can reach, shaping, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting,
and directing things, according to their own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and pleasure, I know no reason at all in Nature or
Philosophy, for any man to deny. For that the help of some

argument, they being according to the observation of
Historians, the <hi>Forerunners of Commotions and Troubles</hi> in

               <p>Yet neverthelesse as good Artificers as I here suppose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Nature. And <hi>Reflection</hi> will have its limits as well as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I have now compleated this present Treatise against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme</hi>
in all the three parts therof: upon which while I cast
mine eye and view that clear and irrefutable evidence of the
cause I have undertaken, the <hi>external Appearances</hi> of <hi>things</hi>
in the world so faithfully seconding the undeniable dictates
of the <hi>innate Principles</hi> of our own mindes, I cannot but w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence aver, That there is not any one Notion in all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
more certain &amp; demonstrable then that <hi>there is a God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And verily I think I have ransacked all the corners of
every kind of Philosophy that can pretend to bear any
stroke in this Controversie, with that diligence, that I may
safely pronounce, that it is mere brutish <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
no <hi>Skill</hi> in <hi>Nature</hi> or the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of things, that
can encourage any man to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>esse <hi>Atheisme,</hi> or to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it at the proposall of those that make profession of it.</p>
               <p>But so I conceive it is, that at first some famously <hi>learned</hi>
men being not so indiscreetly zealous and superstitious as
others, have been mistaken by <hi>Idiots</hi> and traduced for
<hi>Atheists,</hi> and then ever after some one vain-glorious Fool or

               </p>
               <p>But I dare assure any man, that if he doe but search into
the bottome of this enormous <hi>Disease of the Soul,</hi> as

cause thereof, but either <hi>Vanity</hi> of mind, or brutish <hi>Sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

&amp; an untamed desire of satisfying a mans own <hi>will</hi> in
every thing, an <hi>obnoxious</hi> Conscience, and a base <hi>Fear</hi> of

of second causes, a jumbled <hi>Feculencie</hi> and <hi>Incomposednesse</hi>
of the spirits by reason of perpetuall Intemperance &amp; Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
or else a dark bedeading <hi>Melancholy</hi> that so starves and
kils the apprehension of the Soul in divine matters especially,
that it makes a man as inept for such Contemplations, as
if his head was filled with cold Earth, or dry Grave-moulds.</p>
               <p>And to such slow Constitutions as these, I shall not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
