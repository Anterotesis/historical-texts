         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the tyrannical vsurper of the other, is Sathan, Again,
this also we are as clearely taught, that all men liuing
without exception, are eyther true subiects of the one,
or slaues vnto the other. For albeit, the Neuters of this worlde, dreame that

in them lyeth, the kingdome and Citie of God, and batter downe the holdes
of Sathan, must be numbred with the rebels and enemies of our Lord Christ,
when the warrefare shalbe ended. The enemies of Christ haue euer beene
many, some open, cruell, foes without: some subtill, close conspirators with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

principall meanes ordained of God for to confound and to discouer them. I
doe here therefore humbly aske your Honourable protection, for the defence
of the trueth and the glory of God, against all the patrones of all such vile
artes, and horrible abhominations. Thus doeing, your Honour shall not
onely encourage me, but also, imbolden others, which are better able, and wil

Nobilitie without godlines and vertue (as your Honour well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)

you are well assured, that it principally standeth in purchasing vnto
Christ and his Church, true honour and glorie, and in beating downe
(as much as in your Honour lyeth) all the holdes of Sathans

                     </gap> his kingdome will not last
long, and therefore now towards the end of the world, he is, and will be
more and more enuious, and deceitfull, working all the wonders that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he can, to blinde infidels, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 9. 10. and to deceiue if it were

doe, nor the red dragon wil<note n="m" place="margin">Rev. 12. 17.</note> not cease to make warre with the Saints, as
long as the world endureth. Againe, he is rather more wise in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and knowledge of all naturall causes, and therefore more readie in
his artes then euer he hath beene. And wherefore then Sathan for his
part, will not, or can not practise those former artes, it is impossible to be
prooued, and doe not we know, that Sathan hath multiplied, rather then
shortened the number of his artes? for we read and vnderstand, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

they haue at this day, more then in former times, that by Sathans

day, such knowledge in naturall causes as Iannes and Iambres

wordes, periapts, &amp;c. so doeth hee not a mans knowledge, to make
him his vassale to worke his woonders, vnlesse it be for this end, to vaile
and couer his delusions, as sundrie Sathanicall Astrologers in Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

wise in knowledge of all tongues, Philosophie, liberall artes, &amp;c. (as the
learned know) since the Gospell was preached, as euer was in any age
in Christendome. Wherefore if there was by meanes of naturall
knowledge, and humane industrie, a Sathanicall operation in witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
in elder times, I say, there may be the like at this day, and vnto the

no such historicall relations of the witches of our time: yet are they
mentioned there both in generall and speciall manner: in general, where
all the sinnes of idolatrie<note n="r" place="margin">Es. 47. 2. &amp; 21. 6. &amp; 23. 24.</note> and blasphemie are condemned; in speciall,
where the like sinnes are named. <hi>M. Cicero</hi> disputeth in his booke of
Divination, of the beeing of the old Auguries and magicall divinations
of his time: where after he hath distinguished them into two kindes: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
and artificiall: (Vnto the naturall, belong all those divinations
which we may call meere diabolicall, as coniurations, and al the practise
of Pythonistes, which haue an expresse league and confederacie with
Sathan: vnto the artificiall appertaine all those artes, which men (saith
hee) haue learned by long obseruation, Astrologie, Palmistrie, and such
like: these we say, are mixt diabolicall, and belong vnto the secret coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and confederacie, which Sathan hath with witches.) In the ende
he concludeth on this manner: <hi>Quid est igitur cur dubitandum sit,</hi>

such reasons this conclusion, how much more boldly may wee doe the
same, hauing not onely all these his arguments with vs: but also the
heauenly Oracles of God, the light, the lawes, the examples, and the
iudgements in Gods worde, denounced against these sinnes, which the
Scripture hath recorded for our instruction. Wherefore I conclude with

<pb facs="tcp:4352:5"/>
to be short, concerning this treatise which here I offer thee (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
albeit I cannot teach thee, as I would, to discouer and to auoide the
Sathanicall delusions of witchcraft: so variable, so straunge, and so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
are Sathans practises: yet that good which I purposed, I haue, I
trust, in some part performed. Whatsoeuer I haue written, in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
submission, I offer it to the Censure and iudgement of all the godly
learned in the Church of God. I was the more bolde to publish this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
for that but few haue written to any purpose any thing, which
may giue light in this argument, in the english tongue, master <hi>George
Gifford</hi> onely excepted vnto whom we are much bound in the Lorde.
An other cause which mooued me is the continuall trafficke and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
which the rude people haue with witches. For like as the old heathen
(as Tulli saieth) de reb. maiorib, semper aut delphis oraculum,<note place="margin">De Divinat. Lib. 1.</note>
                     <hi>aut ab Hammone, aut √† Dodona petebant,</hi> that is, <hi>in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
affaires sought alwaies after the master witches:</hi> and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
affaires hid their common auguries: so likewise our blockish Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
they haue their common base witches, and their master coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
vnto whom they ride and goe in all their neede, some twentie, some
thirtie, some fortie miles, and what is moste lamentable, such is their
brutish ignorance, they thinke it not vnlawfull for them so to doe.
Wherefore I doe here also humbly request all those, whome God hath
blessed with knowledge and giftes to discerne, in any measure these hid
and horrible abhominations, that they would with all their might helpe
to vncouer them. The ministers of Christ must both in doctrine and
conuersation oppose themselues vnto the ministers of Antichrist. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

doctrine of the Gospell, which we professe, is flat contrarie (we knovv)
vnto all the principles of poperie: so let our conuersation also be vnto
the practise of all the Romish prelates. The monkes, the friers, and all
of the shauen ministerie, were not in any account for learning, which
made not an open profession of these sciences: and of the Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

                     <p>The scripture hath no such words in the original tongue
for it is Hebrew &amp; Greeke, and these words are poeticall Latine
wordes. Againe one thing may haue many and diuers improper

Thessalian witches, <hi>Sagae,</hi> Wise women, <hi>Magae,</hi> Persian witches,

but a wicked man or woman that worketh with the deuill. But
as for the matter it selfe, which by those borrowed wordes the
Poets and other authours meant, the Scripture is mostrich and
plentifull for our instruction. Let vs then attend with reuerence
what the Lorde saith, and not doate on that manner about questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

practised by wicked men and women, Deut 18. 10. 11. v. for albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
most agree in the interpretation, yet some varie in the number,
The place is commonlie translated on this manner: <hi>Let none be
found among you that maketh his sonne or his daughter to go through
the fire, or that vseth witchcraft, or a regarder of times, or a marker of

cousenage, wherefore did this cousenage cease when the gospell
shined, for cousening hypocrites are in the Church, and will bee

                     <p>The witch of Endor is saide to be one of this sort: for
she is called 1. <hi>Sam. 28. v. 7. Bagnalah Aob,</hi> married to Aob, or

<pb facs="tcp:4352:10"/>
answer thee, note what obseruations that place of scripture
offereth vnto vs, in this question of witchcraft for our instruction.
First obserue there, the great feare this vile kind of witches are in,
for she was very loth, least her practise should be publikely noted,
espied, &amp; known. v. 9. 10. Secondly, how the deuil perswades wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
he must be coniured out of hell, &amp; out of the earth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> among
the dead, by characters, figures,<note n="e" place="margin">Heming. de superst. mag. c. 1.</note> pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iaptes, &amp;c. that his vassals
might be the more studious to serue him on that maner, &amp; that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
might haue his witches for their art in the more estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. v. 11. 12.
Thirdly how Satan can transfrome himself before his witch as he
please: for v. 13. she saith <hi>I saw gods, or an excellent person,</hi> which
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> appeareth forth with in the form of old Samuel himself. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
what Satan desireth most of his witches &amp; such as consult with
them: namely to adore him as a God, as Saul did the deuill in the
presence of the witch, v. 14. Lastly how bold Satan is somtimes in
predictions, either when he hath some warrant of gods word, or
is sent of God to execute his iustice vpon in sidels. For this deuill
speaking thus boldly of Saules death, it is like he knew gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
concerning him: for where hee wanteth knowledge, hee is
commonly most doubtfull in his prophesies, as those latine rimes
of Apollos oracle can teach vs.</p>

his disobedience against the<note n="i" place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 15. 23.</note> word of God: therefore no maruell

                     <p>It is most apparant by many places of Scripture,
that he was the deuils prophet, albeit the Lord made him speake
what he would not at that time, as he did <hi>Caiphas</hi> at the death of

night,</hi> ver. 8. that he might goe whisper in the night time, and seeke
some magicall revelations. For so it is written of him, Chap. 24. 1.
His custome was to goe, <hi>likrath nechashim, to fetch inchauntments.</hi>
Againe, how fayne he would haue wrought the deuils will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in it, albeit God had forbidden him to goe to Balak, ver.
12. yet hee purposed still in hart to goe, and went indeede. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
hauing his tongue tied from cursing, yet for lucre and vaine
glories sake, he invented and taught <hi>Balak</hi> in what sort he might
best annoy the Israelites, and that was by causing them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
whoredome and idolatrie. Which wicked counsell had also
that effect which he foreshewed: for as soone as occasion was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
the children of Israel fell into those impieties, whereupon
there dyed in<note n="x" place="margin">Num. 25. 9.</note> a plague foure and twentie thousand. <hi>Saint Iude</hi>
also, vers. 11. speaketh of the deceit of <hi>Balaam wages:</hi> and <hi>Saint
Iohn</hi> saith, that this was the doctrine of Balaam. Hee taught to
put a stumbling blocke before the children of Israel, that they
should eat of things sacrificed to idols and commit whoredome.
To be short, it is to be seene in his owne wordes, what little
hope he hath of Gods fauour and grace (for all magitians haue

                     <p>That these witches &amp; some also of the former practised
more then common coosenage, &amp;c. I can shew it by sufficient
proofe out of the Scripture on this manner. 1. All sinnes which the
Scripture calleth abhominations,<note place="margin">Note these Arg. &amp; applie them to all those kinde of withcrafts which Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses fauoured, &amp; Iosiah pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth with death.</note> are greater and more dreadfull
then any sleights of iugling, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon coosenage: but this kind is
so named, 2. King. 23. 24. therfore this sinne is not coosenage, &amp;c.
2. That sinne against the which the holy Ghost sheweth like, or
greater detestation, then against the vilest idolatrie, is farre more
dreadfull &amp; more wicked then common coosenage, &amp;c. The Lord
sheweth such detestation against this sinne in that place. <hi>Ergo.</hi> 3.
That sinne which is one great cause of the destruction of a whole
<pb facs="tcp:4352:16"/>
kingdome, is a most dreadfull impietie. This kind of witchcraft
was one of the foure which Manasses liked and<note n="s" place="margin">2. King. 21. 6.</note> fauoured, &amp; for
the which that kingdom<note n="t" place="margin">2. King. 24. 3.</note> was destroied: therefore it is one most
dreadfull sinne. 4. That kinde of witchcraft which the law of God
so abhorreth, &amp; against the which it pronounceth death without
mercie, is no doubt, a most deuelish and as Sathanicall a practise,
as all the rest: but the law of stoning to death (which was the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellest
death amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g the Iewes) was directly giuen against this kind.
<hi>If a man</hi>

That sinne which the noble prince <hi>Iosiah,</hi> by the aduise of his wise
Iudges and Magistrates, &amp;c. directed by the law of God, so sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punished, and sought after so dilligently, that his Church might

the contrarie: and that <hi>Iosiah</hi> did so, against these witches and
others, it is<note n="x" place="margin">2. King. 23. 24.</note> recorded by the holy Ghost for his euerlasting praise.
God put into the hartes of our Honourable Iudges to doe the like
in these times, where and when occasion is offered. And to this
end, <hi>Strilegius</hi> writeth against these witches, and to the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

knocke in the head (as thine Author saith) the sinnes of Sathan &amp;

to speake what I can for our old women, for I am greatly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to see the rude multitude so cruell against them, and some
Iudges so mercilesse, as to put these poore innocents to death.
I reason thus by law against this vniust crueltie: I say <hi>shee is iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouslie
dealt withall if shee be the deuills</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Dis. in epist.</note> 
                        <hi>instrument, in practising
his will, my reasons are. 1. Shee is put to death for an others offence.
2. Actions are not iudged by instrumentall causes:</hi> and therefore
<hi>I</hi> conclude these olde women may not dye for Witchcraft.
This is Lawyers Logicke <hi>I</hi> tell you,<note n="f" place="margin">Rostoch. disp. prop. 46.</note> Theophilus. What can you
say to this?</p>

                     <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                     <p>First, as for the ignorant people, they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away in deede with many fonde opinions concerning
witches, the Lorde graunt his Saintes his Worde and Spirit,
that they may truely discerne the delusions of Sathan, and
avoide them: and as for thine argument, if it be lawyers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
<hi>I</hi> tell the truelie, they be bad aduocates in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
cause. They reason as if they would haue the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Iudges to hang the deuill, and to suffer the witches to
escape. The same reason may serue anabaptisticallie appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a libertie vnto all finne, for why may not the Thiefe
and the Adulterour say the like: the Witch therefore
muste dye as accessarie to the cause, for the Iudges can

                     <p>I <hi>will see what may be saide in their behalfe,

Christ did<note n="g" place="margin">Dis. p. 39. A grosse er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> clearely remit Peter, though his offence were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                     <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                     <p>This reason is vnsufficient and very anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,
for it wrings out of the civill Magistrates hande all his
power and iurisdiction. Shall euery penitent malefactour be
deliuered from a temporall punishment, farewell then all
execution of iustice. But vnderstande here, <hi>Mysodaemon,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4352:19"/>
that where God remitteth his secret iustice, &amp; pardoneth sinnes
in Christ, there must not the ciuill Magistrate be remisse in bodily
punishment and iustice, except he haue an extraordinary warrant
and reuelation from God, for his direction. The lawe is, <hi>Thou shalt
not suffer a witch to liue,</hi> vnlesse the iudge haue warrant to repeale
this law from Iesus Christ (as Peter had) all witches lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
must haue their punishments answerable to their demerits.
Againe, thou dost not well to call our witchcraft misconceite &amp;
wicked imagination, for <hi>I</hi> tell thee, it is more. But thou art ouer

                     <p>Well, I rest my selfe, Theophilus, vntil I see what
you can speake of our witches. Let me heare then brieflie what
you can say. There are many things which are said to be in the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of our time, which were neuer heard of in these old witches,
mentioned in Scripture, as namely these points: there transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
there bargaine with the Deuill, there Sathanicall sabaoths,
there oyntments of the fatte of young children, their transformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and such like myracles or wonders (as you say, Theophilus.)
now prooue all these, or any of these points true in our witches, by
Scripture, or any good reason, or authoritie, and I wil beleeue that
we haue also in our time right diabolicall witches indeede.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> will assay to prooue them true, aske of them in

                     <speaker>Mysodaemon.</speaker>
                     <p>What say you then to transportations? for our
witches are said to flie in the ayer, and in the night season to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to places farre distant, to meere with <hi>Herodias, Diana,</hi>
and <hi>Minerva,</hi> and the same night to returne againe: incredible
wonders.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> will not denie, <hi>Mysodaemon,</hi> but the deuill may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
his witches many waies in these transportations, &amp; that many
fabulous pamphelets<note n="*" place="margin">Faustus. Drunken Dunstan. art. &amp; in p. 156.</note> are published, which giue little light and
lesse proofe vnto this point in controuersie. This first vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that whatsoeuer is saide of transportations, contrarie
to the nature of our bodies, as to ride on the moone to meete
Herodias, &amp;c. all such thinges are indeede but meere delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but this that learned men affirme of the transportations
of witches by Sathan, it hath no such impossibilitie in nature,
but that it may be performed. Peter Martyr<note n="q" place="margin">I. c. cl. 1. c. 10. s. 29.</note> writeth thus.
<hi>Cumque tantae sint daemonum vires, quantas antea descripsimus,
nihil obstat quin homines interdum tollere possint, atque auferre
in nemora. Seeing the Deuills haue such strength as vvee
haue before shewed, nothing can let them, to take vp, and carrie
men sometimes into vvoddes.</hi> Then hee addeth Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus
example, who was so famous for such flying in the aier, &amp;
other magicall trickes, that hee was adored (as <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Eccles. hist. 2. l. b. c. 13. 14.</note> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
in Samaria and at Roome also, and his picture was set
vp with this title, <hi>Simoni deo sancto, To Simon the holy god.</hi>
But Eusebius addeth,<note place="margin">Art. &amp; in p. 34.</note> that the Gospell did discouer him and
wrought his discredit in all places. Bodin<note n="s" place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 4. de Daemon.</note> saith, <hi>De expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione

after their annointing, they are carried away, and sometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
oyntments, vpon a goate, or winged horse, or a broome, or a staffe,
and sometimes without a staffe or any beaste.</hi> And we must not
imagine that all are but fables, which learned Authors in elder
times also haue written, as <hi>Plutarch </hi>of<hi> Romulus, Philostrates</hi> of
<hi>Appolonius Tyanaeus</hi> and others of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> transportations.
Neither must wee reiect all the late Inquisitors, which by the

                     <p>What saiest thou, <hi>Mysodaemon,</hi> to the transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Sauiour mentioned, Math. 4. 8. Luk. 4. 9. If Sathan durst
touch so pure and so blessed a bodie, as our Lord Christ had (when
God gaue him leaue) whereon he had no dominion, by reason of
sinne: if that he could also take vp and carrie Christ through the
aier vnto the pinacle of the Temple; no doubt, that bould cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
feareth not to handle, and to carie these vncleane and vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
bodies of sorcerers and witches, for that he knoweth before
that both their soules and bodies belong vnto him. If God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
Sathan power ouer the soules of sorcerers to seduce them
from the faith: it is much more like that he giueth him leaue both
to touch &amp; to beare their bodies: for God giueth him lesse authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and dominion ouer mens soules, then he doth ouer mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
as may be seene in Iobs example, Chap. 2. v. 6.</p>

                     <p>As <hi>I</hi> can in no wise abide the abuse of holy Scripture,
so can <hi>I</hi> not beare with any, which force good writers to speake
that which they would not. For M. Calvin doth not say resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the translation of our Sauiour was in a vision only: his own
words are, <hi>In re dubia &amp; quam abs<expan>
                              <am>

matter wherein I may be ignorant without daunger, I had rather
suspend my iudgement, then offer any occasion vnto contentious men of

that it was a reall transportation. And so much for the first point

                     <p>And canst thou imagine that Sathan would binde
him selfe to any of them (as the witch of Endor for example) to be

renounce God &amp; all religion,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 28.</note> &amp; adore him as her God: yea and

                        <hi>Master Fox in the storie of M. Luther, hath one
singular example for this purpose.</hi> There was <hi>(saith he)</hi> a young man
about Wittemberge, who beeing kept bare and needie by his father, was
tempted by way of sorcerie, to bargaine with the Deuill, or a familiar
<hi>(as they call him)</hi> to yeeld him selfe bodie and soule into the deuils pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
vpon condition to haue his wish satisfied with money: so that vpon
the same, an obligation was made by the young man, written with his
owne blood, and giuen to the deuill. This case you see how horrible it was,
and how damnable: now heare what followed. Vpon this sodaine wealth
and alteration of this young man, the matter first beeing noted, began
afterwaerdes more and more to be suspected, and at length after long &amp;
great admiration, was brought to M. Luther to be examined. The
young man whether for shame or feare long denied to confesse, and would
be knowen of nothing. Yet God so wrought beeing stronger then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
that be vttered vnto Luther the whole substance of the case, as well
touching the money as the obligation, Luther vnderstanding the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:4352:21"/>
and pittying the lamentable state of the man, willed the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
to pray: and he himselfe ceased not with prayers to labour, so
that the deuill was compelled at the last to throw in his obligation at the
window, and bad him take it againe vnto him. <hi>Thus farre Master Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

worke any magicall inuentions, I answer, <hi>Mysodaemon,</hi> it is none
at all. For oyntments can mooue Sathan, no more then figures,
crosses, circles, periaptes, the superstitious mutterings of holy
wordes, and such like abhominations. Secondly, that they haue

if this making of oyntementes, of the fatte of young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
seeme so straunge vnto thee, vnderstande this, that
albeit the deuill little regardeth such oyntementes, yet is hee
right glad to behould and see the murder and bloodshedding
of young infantes: for wherefore else did the Heathen kill
and sacrifice their children vnto Moloche? and that thou
maiest vnderstande also, what that abhominable practise was,
<pb facs="tcp:4352:23"/>
David sheweth that, complaining because this horrible idolatrie
crept into the Church: for he saith, <hi>They offered their sonnes and
daughters vnto deuills.</hi> And that the deuill stirreth Sathanicall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians,

                     <p>First, thou knowest, <hi>Mysodaemon,</hi> how the Lorde
in his Word chargeth vs to renounce the workes of the Gentiles:
the Apostle saith, <hi>This</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 4. 18. Lev. 18. 26, 27, 28. Deut. 14, 1, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>I say and testifie in the Lord, that you hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
walke not as other Gentiles walke in vanity of their minde:</hi> think
not that hencefoorth euery thing is lawfull vnto them, that the rest
of the Nations (which are without God in the world) thinke it not
vnlawfull for them to doe. The same charge Moses giueth often.
Now this practise was most rife among all those idolatrous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:
for the<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 41. 8. Exod. 7. &amp; 8. chap.</note> Egyptianes in all their neede called for their wise
men: so did the<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 22. 23. 24.</note> Moabites, so did the Petsians, and<note n="d" place="margin">Dan. 22. Esd. 47. 12, 13.</note> Babylonians.
So did the Romanes, as there histories record, euen there Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
Romulus, Nero, Maxentius, Iulian, and others: and the great
<hi>Chame</hi> of Tartary and the Persians (as<note n="e" place="margin">Dial. c. 6. p. 89.</note> Danaeus saith) seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
these helpes of the deuill in all their necessities, euen to this
day.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mysodaemon.</speaker>
                     <p>What manifest and cleare testimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
haue you against this practise?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                     <p>There is nothing cleare and manifest, <hi>Mysodae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
vnto those in<note n="f" place="margin">loh. 2. 14.</note> whome <hi>the word of God abideth not, and which
haue not ouercome that wicked one, which is the deuill:</hi> for Sathan so
amazeth them, that they are more ready to reele into euery sinne,
though it be neuer so monstrous, then to see the greatest light
that God offereth them. Are not those prohibitions of God in
his Law and in his Prophets so plaine and so evident, that (as the
Prophet saith) he that runneth, may reade and vnderstand them?
the Law of God is this,<note n="g" place="margin">Lev. 19. 31. 20. 6. Deu. 18. 10, 15</note> 
                        <hi>You shall not regard them that worke with
spirits, neither soothsayers, yea shal not seeke them to be defiled by them,
I am the Lord the God.</hi> Againe, anon after, to make the greatnes
of this sinne the better to appeare, he repeateth the same wordes
<pb facs="tcp:4352:25"/>
in more fearefull manner: <hi>If any turne after such as worke with
spirites, and after soothsayers to goe a whoaring after them, then will
I set my face against, that person, and will cut him of from his people.</hi>
And againe, that God people might be sufficiently warned, they
haue a third charge against this sinne in Deut. 18. where they
are commaunded in all there necessities to seeke vnto God, and
the ministerie of his worde: which place Es. commendeth
to the Church of his time, on this manner: <hi>VVhen they shall
say vnto you,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Es. 8. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>enquire at them that haue a spirite of diuination, and
at the soothsaiers which whisper and murmur, should not a people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
at their God? from the liuing to the dead? to the law and to the
testimonie, if they speake not according to this worde, it is because there
is no light in them.</hi> And thus, <hi>Mysodaemon,</hi> the Lord hath most
louingly warned, and most sharply charged his people to auoyde
this sinne.</p>

was published, no doubt, before his conuersion to the faith: and
as for the good that miserable men receiue of the sorcerers,
assure thy selfe, <hi>Mysodaemon,</hi> the more they seeme to benefite
mens bodies, the more harme they doe both soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
for who would receiue gold at an enemies hande without
feare, and good assurance for his safetie? and is not Sathan
the bloodiest enemie that man hath liuing? and lastly, where

God in heart, and all sincere obedience thereunto. 1. Sam. 15.

hee to murder David, and rested not till hee had slaine a great
number of the moste religious and innocent Priestes of the

in profession. 1. Sam. 26. 21. Vnto all these sinnes,
hee added this fearefull contempt of GOD, 1. Chron.

                     <p>The euill artes and workes of Sathan by witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
are for a signe of the contempt and fall of men from the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
and syncere profession of religion, wheresoeuer they be either
suffered or maintained, we see and knowe by daily experience,
that men haue but small measure of the pure light of God in that

                     <speaker>Mysodaemon.</speaker>
                     <p>This is to be seene most true in poperie, where
all superstition and magicall artes are bred, professed, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
and what is the second cause?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                     <p>The seconde cause why God suffereth Sathan
<pb facs="tcp:4352:28"/>
thus to triumph by his artes, and to rule ouer infidels, is, that he
might fatherly forewarne his Saintes to<note n="c" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 17.</note> passe their dwelling

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                     <p>The third cause of this permission is, that by these
delusions of the deuill, God might in iustice punish them which
would not receiue his trueth: for the Apostle saith, that they which
will not<note n="d" place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 11</note> beleeue the truth: <hi>God will send them strong delusions that

                     <p>It is most true we see: for such as hunt after
our doating witches are most sottish idiottes of all the people,
who when they bee stung by Sathan, runne foorthwith to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by him: what nowe is the fourth cause?</p>

                     <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                     <p>The tryall of Gods Saintes: for GOD per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
all heresies and superstitions to spring in his Church,
that those that are his, might be knowen, as the Lorde teacheth

                     <speaker>Myso-daemon.</speaker>
                     <p>Howe farre then may Sathans power reach,
when God so permitteth him, or sendeth him for the execution of

                     <p>Almightie God doeth vse Satan for to worke
his signes and iudgements in the heauens, in the ayer, and in the
earth, and to execute his iustice vpon all the children of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
yea and to afflict his Saintes, as ofter as the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it expedient for his glorie, and their saluation. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
speaketh plainelie, that he can driue downe lightnings and
flames of<note n="f" place="margin">Iob. 1. 10.</note> fire from heauen, to hurt the creatures vpon earth.
Againe, that he can infect and poyson the ayer and water with
pestiferous exhalations when God sendes him, as in the plagues
of Egypt, which were wrought by the ministerie of Sathan: for it
is written, that God cast foorth his indignation and wrath vpon
them in all those plagues,<note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 78. 49.</note> 
                        <hi>By sending out euill angels among them.</hi>
He can destroy also the other creatures, and man him selfe, by
<note n="h" place="margin">Iob. 1. Iudg. 9. 23. Esd. 19. 14. 1. Tim. 4. 12.</note> fyers, by windes and tempestes, when he is let loose against

                     <speaker>Myso-daemon.</speaker>
                     <p>The witches boast indeede that Sathan
<pb facs="tcp:4352:29"/>
can do much, and they likewise by their acquaintance with him;
but some thinke that all this is but to fray men, &amp; many men often
hurt themselues and others by fond imaginations.</p>

                     <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                     <p>As for Sathans might, it is but weake: if the Lorde
graunt him not strength to execute his will, he can not doe it: and
whereas some suppose that all these artes are but strong phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
they be greatly deceiued, for albeit that some doe hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with euill imaginations, &amp;c. yet let a witch or any other
imagine what he will against thee, his imagination can neither kill
thee, <hi>Myso-daemon:</hi> nor take away one haire from thy head, but we
knowe and see, that Sathan by witches can doe both, and this is the
confession of the witches of all times, nations and people, euen at

it is knowen by the experience of many learned phisitions, a thing
most difficult: the reason is, sathan vseth poisons that haue hidden,

vnknowne, and straunge operations in the bodies of men, for he is
an Empiricke of many yeeres experience; notwithstanding wee

                     <p>It is well you speake of great mens houses: for there
commonly are the greater sinnes. <hi>Nero</hi> could hardly rest for feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

sinnes defile any place, the greater libertie is giuen Sathan, &amp; the
more it is<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 12. 43.</note> swept and garnished for his continuall habitation. To
expell all such euills, these rules following in all such families must
be carefully practised. 1. The lords, masters, and fathers of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
must draw nere vnto God themselues by vnfained repentance,
that their owne bodies and soules may be truly sanctified: so must
the strong man be first conquered, Luk. 11. 21, 22. 2. Their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
also, with like diligence often purged, Gen. 35. 2 Ps. 101. 7.
Epist. to Philemon, Deut. 21. 18, 21. 3. In Gods most holy word
faithfully instructed, Gen. 18. 19. 1. Cor. 14. 34, 35. Deut. 6. 6. Eph.
6. 4. 2. Tim. 3. 15. 4. They must also go before, and direct their
houshold in praier &amp; thankesgiuing, when they be present: 10. 6.
11. Ps. 55. 17. 127. 1. Tim. 4. 4. that the seruants may doe the like,
when they be absent: Gen. 24. 12, 13. without interruption, 1. Pet.
3. 7. 5. They must dwell with their wiues as men of knowledge,
1. Pet. 5. 7. not bitter vnto them, Col. 3. 19. contract with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
onely, Gen. 6. 2, 3. in the Lord, 1. Cor. 7. 39. the marriage bed
sanctified with praiers. 1. Tim. 4. 3, 4. vsed to bridle and asswage, &amp;
not to feed &amp; stirre vp lust, Ro. 13. 14. abstaining it at certen times
<pb facs="tcp:4352:30"/>

seperation,</hi> Ezec. 18. 6. &amp; 22. 10. Lev. 20. 18. 6. The wifes subiect
to their husbands, Col. 3. 19. in pure conuersation which is with
feare, 1. Pet. 3. 1, 2. 7. The children brought vp in the informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the lord, Eph. 6. 4. obeying in al things their parents, Col. 3.
20. in the Lord, Eph. 6. 1. 8. The masters must do that which is
iust and equall to seruants, Col. 4. 1. without threatnings, Eph. 6. 9.
9. The seruants auoide eye seruice, do their dueties in Gods feare
as vnto the Lord, Col. 3. 21, 23. with feare &amp; trembling. Eph. 6. 5.
10. They must also direct, &amp; command their familie to a priuate
fast, when publique or priuate calamitie, or such like needful occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
so requireth. Hest. 4. 16. Neh. 1. 4. Act. 10. 30. 11. Conduct

Sathan if we can wisely handle it, as our Sauiour hath taught vs by

thought that he liued before the Lawe, because of his long life,
Chap. 42. 16. Psal. 90. 10. and sacrifices in a straunge land, which
by the Lawe were commanded to be done before the Arke, or in
the tabernacle of God. Some thinke that he was about the time
the Church was in Egypt. All the Patriarkes and holy fathers of
that time and before, had great knowledge and many yeeres ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and were preachers of the word of God in their families,
Gene. 18. 19. and receiued it partly by their fathers instruction,
Psal. 78. 3. partly by visions and sundrie other meanes from God
him selfe, Hebr. 1. 1. And as for Iob he had both instruction by
man, Chap. 42. 5. and reuelations from God, Chap. 38. and 42. 5.
and taught the same vnto his people, Chap. 1. 5. and 29. 22.
and 22. 22.</p>

                     <p>Repentance: the life of Gods saints is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
repentance; because of their continuall infirmities and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The penitent hath two good properties: One is, he feareth
God truely, and so is humbled: the other is, he resteth vpon God
<note n="z" place="margin">Iob. 13. 15. Psal. 147. 11.</note> faithfully, and so is strengthened. <hi>The Lord is greatly delighted in
them that feare him, &amp; attend vpon his mercie,</hi> but if any proude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
sinnes haue snared them, the Lord leaueth them as naked,
and as it were in Sathans iurisdiction, as<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 22. 1, 2, 77. 10, 69.</note> Dauid often, and<note n="b" place="margin">Cant. 5. 6.</note> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And as for Iob, he walked<note n="c" place="margin">Iob. 1. 20, 21, 22. 42. 6.</note> most circumspectly within the
<pb facs="tcp:4352:32"/>
boundes of true repentance before the Lorde his God. Whefore
<hi>Mysodaemon</hi> call mightely vpon God for this great blessing also:

                     <p>The prouidence of almightie God was his most
strong to wre and moste soueraigne preseruatiue against all euill.
Of this Dauid glorieth and singeth often sweetly in his Psalmes: as
in the 91. v. 9, 10, 11, 12. on this maner. <hi>Because (thou hast saide)
the Lord is mine help, and hast set the moste high for thy refuge: there
shall none euill come vnto thee, neither shall anie plague come neere thy
tabernacle: for he shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee
in all thy waies, they shall beare thee in their hands, that thou shalt not
hurt thy foot against a stone: thou shalt walke vpon the lyon and aspe, the
young lyon and the dragon shalt thou tread vnder thy foot.</hi> Nowe that
Iob was most safe vnder this shelter and could not be anoied by
Satan, the deuill confesseth it himselfe. For he saieth, he can not
come neere him by reason of a certen hedge wherewith he and all
his were compassed about: the wordes are these: <hi>Then Satan saide,
doth Iob feare God for nought?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob. 1. 9, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>hast thou not made an hedge about him
and about his house, and about al that he hath on euery side?</hi> And thus
thou seest, <hi>Mysodaemon,</hi> how Iob was preserued from Satan and
all his artes: wherefore if thou canst purchase these preseruatiues
for any price, or by any meanes come by them, I will assure thee
for thy safety in all dangers of bodie and soule.</p>

                     <speaker>Myso-daemon.</speaker>
                     <p>But I see not yet how hee was preserued: for

his goods.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                     <p>The deuill ouercame him not, nor could not work
his wil &amp; purpose vpon him. For Satans chiefe purpose against Iob
was to cause him to blaspheme God, to renounce God and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to fall from the faith, from repentance, and from the grace of
God. And to this end when the Lord<note n="*" place="margin">V. 12.</note> gaue him entrance, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied
his goods with strange fire and theeues, he murdered his
children with a tempest,<note place="margin">Ch. 2. 9.</note> he consumed his bodie with byles, and
mooued also his friends and his owne wife to reuile and to scorne
him and his profession.<note place="margin">Ch. 1. 22.</note> Notwithstanding all these engines of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
Iobs preseruatiues were so good and precious, that the deuill
was vtterly vnable to bring any of those euils he most desired vpon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4352:32"/>
him; for the Lord witnesseth of him, saying, <hi>In all this Iob sinned
not, nor charged God foolishlie.</hi> And to be short, when Satan had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
him with all extremities that could be deuised, albeit his
faith<note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 7. 15. &amp; 13. 15.</note> fainted, yet it failed him not: for he continued in faithfull
repentance<note n="b" place="margin">Iob 42. 5, 6. &amp; 16. 17.</note> and grace of God vnto the end. And thus haue I
taught thee, <hi>Mysodaemon,</hi> what things I thought expedient for
thee, and most needfull concerning witchcraft. I doubt not but
many of our friends could say more. Wherefore giue them no rest,
but cause them by al good meanes to communicate vnto vs both
