            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere is a horrible <hi>Libell</hi> come out against you, under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a <hi>Vindication;</hi> and it is so much the worse, for endeavouring to turn <hi>another Discourse</hi> written in <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of you into a <hi>Libell;</hi> and such a <hi>Libell</hi> too, as will not allow any <hi>Good</hi> that is spoken of you, to be <hi>True,</hi> nor any man that <hi>speaks</hi> it, to be <hi>Honest:</hi> But the most spitefull and audacious Circumstance of <hi>all,</hi> is the <hi>Dedicating</hi> of the affront to your <hi>self;</hi> and in such a <hi>stile</hi> and <hi>Way</hi> too, that a man had better be <hi>half-Gibbetted</hi> then so <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended;</hi> 'tis in such an <hi>Abject, Beastly, Dawbing</hi> way of <hi>Flattery.</hi> He says, y'are <hi>bespatter'd;</hi> and he goes such a way to work, as if he should wash you with the Reversion of a Glister, to make you clean again.</p>
            <p>This Libell is Entitled, <hi>An</hi> Additional Discovery <hi>of</hi> Mr. Roger L'Estranges <hi>his</hi> Further Discovery <hi>of the</hi> Popish Plot; <hi>Wherein</hi> Dr. Titus Oates, <hi>and the rest of the Kings Evidences are Vindicated, from the aspersions cast upon them in that Pamphlet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In a Letter to</hi> Dr. Titus Oates, <hi>by</hi> B. W.</p>
            <p>This Letter to a man in a Feaver might be pertinent enough, for it is so drowsy a piece, so arrant an <hi>Opiate,</hi> that if it had but come out time enough, the Old Poets should never have needed a <hi>Mercurial Rod</hi> for the Charming of <hi>Argus:</hi> And who knows but that this same <hi>B. W.</hi> may be Hir'd to write the <hi>Three Kingdoms asleep;</hi> and a <hi>Foreign Enemy,</hi> in the mean while, to come in, and catch us <hi>Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</hi> And yet <hi>this very Pamphlet,</hi> Doctor, has had the Honour of <hi>Your Countenance:</hi> I would you had <hi>Read</hi> it before you had <hi>recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> it: For, as the Case Stands, I have no other way of delivering ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther You or my Self from the Dint of this Venemous Paper but by exposing Some Remarks upon it, in a <hi>Second Dedication,</hi> to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi> You'l say perhaps, that I'm <hi>a Sawce-Box, for Presuming to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate any thing to</hi> You, <hi>without</hi> Your Leave. But 'tis all a case to Me, whether <hi>With</hi> it, or <hi>Without</hi> it; for I have a Common Right with my Adversary, to the Liberty of this Application, as well the <hi>One</hi> way as the <hi>Other.</hi> Upon the Perusall of it, you will finde it to be <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48393:3"/>
               <hi>Weak,</hi> and <hi>Silly;</hi> and yet <hi>Insufferably Abusive; Iesuitically False; Scurrilously Rude,</hi> and most <hi>Diabolically Malicious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He tells you Sir, <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. <hi>That you told</hi> L'Estrange, <hi>he was a</hi> Papist, <hi>and that he reported</hi> You <hi>for a</hi> Fanatick; whereas neither <hi>is L'Estrange</hi> a <hi>Papist,</hi> neither did <hi>You Say</hi> he <hi>was</hi> one but only by <hi>Hear-say,</hi> and that you had been <hi>told</hi> he was a Papist. So that he charges you with speaking a false thing, to the Disadvantage of your Evidence in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters. But for This abuse, he makes you amends in the same Page, by Comparing <hi>L'Estrange</hi> and the <hi>Doctor</hi> to the <hi>Devill</hi> and <hi>our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am sure</hi> (says he a little after) <hi>the</hi> Unerring Rule <hi>is, he that is not</hi> With, <hi>is</hi> Against.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>This Gentleman,</hi> (under favour) is <hi>not Sure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>;</hi> neither is <hi>That Rule Unerring;</hi> for there are <hi>Deliberations, Suspensions, Neutralities,</hi> in which Cases, we are neither <hi>With,</hi> nor <hi>Against.</hi> If This hold for a <hi>Maxim,</hi> it is but a Natural Conclusion from <hi>B.</hi> W'<hi>s</hi> premises, that Those that are not <hi>For</hi> the Legall Order of the Church and State, are <hi>Enemyes</hi> to it, and to be lookt upon as Cankers in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of the Government. And again.</p>
            <p>He Cites this Passage out of <hi>My further Discovery,</hi> Pag. 2. <hi>He tells you as a friend;</hi> (says he) <hi>I have more Charity for One Morall</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, <hi>then</hi> twenty Hypocriticall Christians. And in Reflection upon it (<hi>Pag.</hi> 4.) he has These Words. <hi>Indeed I have not learn'd this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of a</hi> Christian <hi>afore;</hi> but <hi>allways from the Woes pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Hypocrites, <hi>in the Scripture, I took them not to be</hi> Christians. Now the meaning of it upon the whole, is This. That <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has more <hi>Charity</hi> for <hi>Tully,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> then for <hi>Peters,</hi> and <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw.</hi> But see his Goodly <hi>Criticism</hi> now upon <hi>Hypocrite:</hi> The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> in <hi>Propriety</hi> of <hi>Speech,</hi> were <hi>not</hi> Hypocrites; and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively Speaking,</hi> we have but too many <hi>Christians</hi> that <hi>are</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; for <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> are only <hi>Spirituall Stage-Players.</hi> His next Citation is This: I have a Naturall <hi>Veneration for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and all that Love it; the Kings Loyall Witnesses, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of his Life.</hi> Now he has thought fit to leave out these words [<hi>in the First place; with an Equall Horrour, and Detestation for all his Enemyes, under what Masque or Form soever.</hi>] And then he falls in again, <hi>That I believe the Plot; as much of it as every Good Subject</hi> ought; leaving out, [<hi>or as any man in his Right Wits</hi> can <hi>believe.</hi>] Nay (Says he again) and pawns his Conscience (which doubtlesse is Large.) <hi>You</hi> do not believe <hi>more</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48393:3"/>Observe, First, that whereas <hi>L'Estrange</hi> says, he has <hi>Naturally</hi> a Veneration for the Government, He makes it a <hi>Natural Veneration,</hi> which in Nicety of Acceptance differs from the Other, as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principle</hi> differs from a <hi>Particular Bent,</hi> or <hi>Inclination:</hi> As I have <hi>Naturally</hi> a Love for Musick: This Sounds much stronger then I have a <hi>Natural</hi> Love for it. And so to say, I have <hi>Naturally</hi> a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the <hi>Presbyterian Discipline,</hi> is quite another thing, then to Say I have a <hi>Natural Veneration</hi> for't. He tells you a little after, that <hi>the</hi> Plot <hi>is in a great measure one of the things of</hi> God; <hi>and not rightly to be understood by meer</hi> Natural men: Which is the grossest Affront, perhaps, to the Kings Evidence, that has been yet Attempted. You will take notice, in his First Omission, that his Conscience flew in his face, upon that Latitude, of the <hi>Kings Enemies, under what Masque soever;</hi> And so he left it out. And then for the <hi>Second Omission</hi> of the Words, <hi>As any man in his right Wits can believe,</hi> he says nothing on't, for'tis enough in all Conscience to believe so <hi>much</hi> of the Plot as none but a <hi>Mad</hi> man can believe <hi>more.</hi> Good Doctor observe him now in his Descant upon the <hi>Quotation</hi> abovementioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am</hi> (says he) <hi>of a quite Contrary Opinion; for I know you are of a sharper sight, Doctor, then to have your Iudgment eclipsed with a Fogg.</hi> So that <hi>your sharpnesse of Sight,</hi> is made the Cause of <hi>his Contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> I do assure you, Sir, if you'l be so kind as to Read it, I'le put you up a Bill for him, when you preach next; for no Flesh is able to hold out long, at this Ridiculous rate. And yet when <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Grammer</hi> fail, the <hi>Malice</hi> goes on still. Now here's <hi>Another Iesuitism</hi> for you Doctor. He tells you <hi>that</hi> L'Estrange <hi>cannot believe what he does not, nor cannot:</hi> which Expression, together with the <hi>learned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>of Butter'd Turnips, he makes use of as a Reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> You; <hi>because it plainly intimates your Evidence is as little to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that Assertion.</hi> Now <hi>L'Estranges</hi> Words are these. <hi>The whole Earth</hi> (says he, <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. and 3.) <hi>can never bring me to</hi> believe, <hi>or</hi> to say <hi>that I believe, That which I neither</hi> do, <hi>nor</hi> can <hi>believe: As the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse of</hi> Bedingfields <hi>being alive again, or that I my Self am in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy.</hi> See, first, how he has <hi>Falsify'd</hi> the <hi>Quotation</hi> it self; and then let any body shew me the <hi>Reflexion.</hi> Why does he not <hi>point</hi> to it with his Fools finger, and say, <hi>There 'tis.</hi> But for a man to be hookt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>dangerous Reflexions,</hi> for not <hi>believing</hi> things <hi>Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,</hi> or for not <hi>saying</hi> that he <hi>Does</hi> believe that which he does <hi>Not</hi> believe; deal frankly with me, Doctor, Is it reasonable or not? But the Reader has the matter here before him, and let him try what he can make on't, beyonda Loyall Affection to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48393:4"/>
and the Inculcating of a Necessary Caution, in dubious, and Improbable Cases, in order to a fuller Discovery, and Eviction of the Truth: For otherwise <hi>B. W.</hi> shall cram me with <hi>Tennis-Balls</hi> and make me Swear they're <hi>Sugar-Plumbs,</hi> under pain of being Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd by every little <hi>Schismaticall Setter,</hi> as <hi>a Blaster of the Kings Evidence;</hi> which is <hi>L'Estranges</hi> Case in this very Paragraph; where he's charg'd with <hi>Affronting King, Lords, and Commons, the Lord Chancellor, the Bench, Iury, and Evidence, in his unworthy Reflexions, not to be</hi> forgiven <hi>or</hi> forgotten. This is a Teizer, and probably of the Old stamp, he flies at the Throat so; and nothing but Bloud will Content him. You see here Doctor what a Deduction he has made, and the Ground of it: And your Candour cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Inference to be <hi>Folly, Rudenesse,</hi> and <hi>Malignity</hi> to a very High degree.</p>
            <p>Mark now what <hi>another fling</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>at the Doctor,</hi> this <hi>Wizzard</hi> has found out. <hi>L'Estrange has a Value for him, and believes him as far as he OUGHT;</hi> now <hi>B. W</hi>'s Quarrell is; that <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has not a <hi>higher Value</hi> for him, and that he does not believe him <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> then he <hi>ought.</hi> He pretends to be Scandaliz'd at <hi>L'Estranges Equivocall meaning;</hi> but the thing that troubles Him in <hi>Truth,</hi> is, that <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has <hi>Worded</hi> the matter so <hi>cautiously,</hi> that a <hi>Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Spy</hi> can lay no <hi>hold</hi> on't. But pray'e read the <hi>Context</hi> to <hi>This Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Pag. 4. <hi>It was never my Humour</hi> (<hi>as a</hi> French-droll <hi>has it</hi>) <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend an</hi> Orator, <hi>for an</hi> Excellent Head of Hair; <hi>or a man of</hi> State, <hi>and</hi> Bus'ness, <hi>for the Government of his</hi> Beard; <hi>or to spend three or four Pages, upon such an Occasion as This, in</hi> Flattery, <hi>and</hi> Panegyrick. So that <hi>L'Estrange</hi> (ye see) did <hi>purposely</hi> avoid the Temptation of falling into a Vein of <hi>Servile Flattery,</hi> by any pompous <hi>Recitall</hi> of your <hi>Good Qualities:</hi> And rather chose to tell you, like a Gentleman, (Short and Round) that he valu'd ye as he <hi>OUGHT.</hi> But this is <hi>Heathen Greek</hi> now to Him that is not verst in the true <hi>Ayre</hi> and <hi>Stile</hi> of <hi>Good manners. L'Estrange</hi> values the <hi>Doctors Function</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> too as he <hi>ought,</hi> as well as his <hi>Employment.</hi> Why does he not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the Bishops, that he mocks the <hi>Ecclesiastical Order,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Doctor,</hi> that he Abuses <hi>Him;</hi> for they are both equally concern'd in the same Period?</p>
            <p>He Cites <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> Saying, Pag. 5. that <hi>he's a Friend to Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Dealing; to Liberty of Speech; an Easy Glasse, and an Easy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> The <hi>First,</hi> he does not <hi>believe,</hi> he says, but the <hi>rest</hi> he <hi>does;</hi> (with a Bobb at the end on't.) And yet to many peoples thinking <hi>L'Estrange</hi> deals as <hi>plainly</hi> with <hi>Himself,</hi> and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> as a body
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48393:4"/>
would wish. And for the Rest, it is so far True, that <hi>L'Estrange</hi> had much rather drink his Majesties <hi>Health</hi> in a Glasse of <hi>Wine,</hi> then his <hi>Confusion</hi> in a Dish of <hi>Association-Coffee;</hi> and that he's a Profest Enemy to all sorts of Sniveling Formalities whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B. W.</hi> Proceeds now to certain <hi>Scholasticall Distinctions</hi> betwixt <hi>Rogue,</hi> and <hi>Rogue;</hi> and has found out an Admirable Invention for the bringing of <hi>You,</hi> and <hi>Mee,</hi> Doctor, to call one another <hi>Rogues</hi> by <hi>Consent;</hi> and to shew you Sir, how far you may call any man <hi>Rogue,</hi> without danger of the <hi>Law.</hi> His words are These,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He tells you,</hi> Doctor, <hi>of your calling him</hi> Rogue <hi>twenty times; for which he</hi> thanks <hi>you, and</hi> Forgives <hi>you; but this is but a Coppy of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and used as a meer shooing-horn, to draw on the Like likewise, of calling</hi> you Rogue. <hi>I know its a word you often use, and its Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to one you were Right,</hi> Nineteen <hi>of the</hi> Twenty, <hi>if not</hi> all: <hi>But it's not to be taken in the</hi> Common sense <hi>of the</hi> Vulgar Usage <hi>to a man of</hi> vile <hi>and</hi> base Actions; <hi>but as a differing Character of an</hi> Adversary <hi>to</hi> yours <hi>and</hi> Others Evidence <hi>in the great matter in question.</hi> So that he has here made <hi>L'Estrange</hi> to be precisely <hi>Nineteen Rogues,</hi> and <hi>Nineteen Twentieth Parts</hi> of another. But then to make me amends, they are <hi>Rogues,</hi> you see, of <hi>Quality;</hi> that is to say, they are '<hi>Plot-Rogues, Sham-Rogues,</hi> or some other of the more <hi>Creditable</hi> sort of <hi>Rogues.</hi> This Fellow has no Commission, I hope, to treat men of our Condition at this Course rate.</p>
            <p>And a little further, he says, that because <hi>Currs</hi> hunt <hi>Me,</hi> I take the Freedom to <hi>reflect</hi> upon <hi>You; slighting your Favours, and setting you at Defiance (Pag.</hi> 4. of my <hi>Further Discovery.</hi>) Pray'e mind the Shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Shuffling of this <hi>Fanatical Iesuit</hi> My words are These. <hi>There is no Design in this Paper, Sir, to bespeak your Favour, in case of any Imputation upon me, either for my Words, Actions, or Writings; for I defy Malice it self to charge me with any sort of Malevolence, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Church or State.</hi> Now from my Defying of <hi>Malice</hi> in the <hi>Abstract,</hi> does he most abusively inferr my <hi>defying</hi> of the <hi>Doctor</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Notion: whereas any man that runs, may read my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be This. <hi>Here am I threaten'd,</hi> Doctor, <hi>with</hi> Articles, <hi>and</hi> Impeachments, <hi>by a Pack of Rascalls; and here am I at the same time,</hi> making <hi>Court to</hi> You. <hi>Do not imagine Sir, that This is to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with you for your Protection against these Blood-hounds; for my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence will support me against the very Devil and his Angels.</hi> Now this is so far from being a <hi>Reflection</hi> upon you, that it would imply a High Confidence in your Integrity, even if I should have so little Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as to <hi>defy</hi> you. For it would be as who should say; <hi>The Doctor</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48393:5"/>
               <hi>can do me no Hurt upon the</hi> Square, <hi>and I'le trust his</hi> Conscience, <hi>for setting</hi> false Dice <hi>upon me.</hi> And now what's the ground of all This Exception? Nothing in the world but <hi>L'Estranges</hi> saying, that <hi>he has a great value for your</hi> Function, Imployment <hi>and</hi> Character.</p>
            <p>He picks another Quarrel with me for calling <hi>the Detestable Plot,</hi> a <hi>MYSTERY;</hi> as if it were a denial of the <hi>Fact:</hi> whereas I speak only of the <hi>Project</hi> or <hi>Contrivance,</hi> 
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>not of the <hi>Fact;</hi> tho' after all this Discovery there's a great deal in matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> that lies yet in the <hi>Dark.</hi> And then he has a Bout with me for saying, that <hi>it is no New thing, for a Popular Outcry in the matter of</hi> Religion, <hi>to have a</hi> State-Faction <hi>in the belly on't.</hi> Whereupon he modestly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that <hi>he cannot understand how</hi> Religion <hi>is concerned in the least: Especially the difference betwixt the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the</hi> Dissenters <hi>from it.</hi> Now as to the <hi>Plot,</hi> We are told that <hi>Religion</hi> is the very <hi>Root</hi> of it: and for the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> they have almost all Sorts of <hi>Heresies</hi> among them; which I take to be matter of <hi>Religion.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that we have our <hi>Agenda,</hi> as well as our <hi>Credenda;</hi> and our <hi>Practical Cases</hi> relating to <hi>Civill Obedience, Brotherly Charity, Peace, Order,</hi> &amp;c. wherein the <hi>Dissenters</hi> do exceedingly differ from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in matters also of <hi>Religion.</hi> He has Another Touch at me, for <hi>arraigning the Iudgments of the Representatives of the Nation in Parliament,</hi> in saying, that <hi>nothing was ever more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly Sifted, or more vigorously Discourag'd then This Conspiracy.</hi> And yet (says he) the neglect of it was <hi>one</hi> part of the Earl of <hi>Danby's</hi> Charge, which was not (again) without due Consideration of <hi>Authentique Proofs,</hi> to make it good. But <hi>bare Charges</hi> are no <hi>Proofs;</hi> and 'tis well for me that they are not; for if they were, <hi>B. W's</hi> Libell would have hang'd me Twenty times over. But I am glad to hear the Dignity, and Prudence of That Assembly, so well support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the world is well amended, since the House of <hi>Commons</hi> was Libell'd for <hi>an Unanimous Clubb of Voters;</hi> an <hi>Infernal Regiment</hi> of <hi>Pensioners:</hi> Since they were call'd a <hi>Treacherous,</hi> and a <hi>Lewd Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi> and since a Reverend Divine told some of the Members to their Teeth, that <hi>they were a pack of as Arrant Rascalls as ever layd their Heads together:</hi> And every day some Pamphlet or other to the same Tune.</p>
            <p>There's a long Paragraph (Pag. 6.) which is only a Huddle of words, and not three Lines in the whole, for a man to make either Earnest, or Sport of. The man is willing, Sir. to do you a Civill Office; but then he goes so Awkwardly to work, and with such a deal of <hi>Nauseous, Fulsom Flattery,</hi> 'tis half a <hi>Vomit</hi> to <hi>think</hi> on't. But
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48393:5"/>
at last, after mighty pains taken to no end, he passes sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Intents</hi> and <hi>purposes;</hi> and has found it out at the long Run, that <hi>the getting of a small Reward for my Pamphlet, the vindicating of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and crushing of the Fanatiques, are the three Ends of my Scribling.</hi> All which (do assure you Dr.) he speaks by <hi>Revelation;</hi> but gives you, in the Conclusion the hopes of making it out by <hi>Demonstrations</hi> to come: By my Troth, Sir, this is a strange Mortification for a man to be ty'd in good manners to bear all this Impertinence as if he were oblig'd to his <hi>Persecutor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He begins his 7th <hi>Page</hi> with a <hi>Flower;</hi> and pray'e intend it. <hi>But now warmly clad with These won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully Erroneous Considerations, that incumbered his Disturbed Brains, with the help of taking your Works to pieces; he had now fallen under such a Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which the world might expect such a Product, as was expected from the Mountain; but you know that prov'd a Mouse.</hi> This is nothing in the world but the water-Poets Nonsense turn'd into Prose: One Line more on't would make me call for a Bason.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph, I am arraign'd over again, for a <hi>Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourer</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> the <hi>Governours</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Kings Wittnesses:</hi> and all This for calling it the <hi>allmost Inextricable Labyrinth of the Plot.</hi> At the next word he makes half a <hi>Iesuit</hi> of me: and says <hi>I vilisie the Doctor, under a Disguise of Friendship:</hi> And <hi>I think</hi> (Says he) <hi>he hath cause to rejoyce that he is not question'd for a Seditious Pamphleteer.</hi> This Charge is founded, Doctor, upon my saying, that <hi>none can fall foul upon my</hi> Further Discovery, <hi>without wounding</hi> Your Evidence. This gives him occasion to deny your <hi>Swearing</hi> that the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> herd with <hi>Nonconformists;</hi> and yet you tell us, how they contrived the late War, by inslaming Partyes; that they had their Instruments in <hi>Scotland,</hi> expressly to <hi>Preach</hi> to the <hi>Disaffected;</hi> and that <hi>Blundel</hi> did actually teach the youth in the City of <hi>London, Treasonable,</hi> and <hi>Seditious Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> He says, <hi>I'm in Wrath,</hi> and speaks as if I doubted your Evidence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and the <hi>Forty thousand Black-bilts;</hi> when my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48393:6"/>
business is to set before the People the Danger of that defigne taking effect, if the <hi>Priests</hi> be still suffer'd to lurk among the <hi>Fanatiques.</hi> And then when I speak of <hi>Infidells,</hi> as of those that will not <hi>believe</hi> this Mixture; he turns the word <hi>Infidells,</hi> into <hi>Dissenters;</hi> and so makes a Slander of the <hi>Propriety</hi> only of the <hi>Term,</hi> Pag. 8.</p>
            <p>Take notice, I beg of you Sir, how he poysons all my Respects towards you; when I tell you that I have <hi>Read, Consider'd,</hi> and <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd</hi> you; and the Sense I have of <hi>the Roundnesse of your Periods, the Luxuriancy of Your Invention, (where there is Scope for it) the Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your Stile, and the Harmony of Your Conceptions.</hi> What is it that makes him call These Expressions <hi>Ironies?</hi> but that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>values you, as if you were a person that had no sort of Title to these Civilities. Nay, he will not so much as allow you the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faculty that Distinguishes <hi>Men</hi> from <hi>Brutes;</hi> that is to say, CONCEPTIONS: For <hi>I know not</hi> (says he) <hi>of any Conceptions in all your Works.</hi> He says, indeed, that <hi>if you had made your Trade</hi> of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>and getting Dinners by Scribling; or had you employ'd your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius That way, if it had been in making a Play against your own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> what work you'd have made with your <hi>Syllogisms</hi> and <hi>Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</hi> &amp;c. This is some devillish Wipe, Doctor, if a body could but hit the drift on't: But for the Trade of <hi>getting Dinners by Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> 'tis the Honourable Trade of the Nation, from the <hi>Prime Minister,</hi> to the <hi>Sub-Sizer.</hi> And truly, Doctor, as the world goes, 'tis well if an Honest man can keep himself clear of the <hi>Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basket,</hi> or turning <hi>Mendicant</hi> from <hi>door to door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now he whips me up again for <hi>Poysonous Principles,</hi> and <hi>Frothy Strains of Wit;</hi> with <hi>Paper-Squibs,</hi> audaciously <hi>Traducing,</hi> and <hi>Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Face</hi> of <hi>Governours,</hi> and <hi>Government:</hi> and this is only for saying, that the present humour of <hi>France</hi> runs upon <hi>Poysoning;</hi> the <hi>Enemyes</hi> of our <hi>Government</hi> altogether upon the Vein of <hi>Plotting.</hi> What's your Opinion, Sir, of these Inferences? To the business now of being a <hi>Papist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do not remember,</hi> (says he) Pag. 9. <hi>one Authentique Proof, nor any other Rational Argument, yet produced by L'Estrange, that he is</hi> not <hi>a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</hi> Now <hi>I</hi> thought Sir, that <hi>One</hi> mans Oath might be as well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for being <hi>no Papist,</hi> as <hi>Anothers</hi> for being a <hi>Protestant:</hi> And That Proof I have given for't. There was indeed a perjurious Race of men, that in despite of the Late Kings <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Practice; Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Protestations,</hi> and <hi>Sacramentall Professions</hi> to the Contrary, brought him to the <hi>Block,</hi> under the <hi>Same Pretence,</hi> where at last he deliver'd himself up a <hi>Martyr</hi> for the <hi>English Communion.</hi> But it is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48393:6"/>
not with the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of men of <hi>Consciences,</hi> as it is with the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Mercenaryes,</hi> and the <hi>Covenants</hi> of <hi>Conspirators,</hi> that look one way and work another. But since my hand is <hi>in,</hi> Doctor, I'le go a little farther with you.</p>
            <p>I had the Honour in the late times, (and being Then in Exile) to passe a matter of Eight months in the House of the Cardinal of <hi>Hesse;</hi> where I was as kindly receiv'd, as if I had been at my own Fathers. I wanted neither <hi>Invitations,</hi> nor <hi>Arguments,</hi> to carry me over to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> besides the Private Temptations of a <hi>Hopelesse Interest</hi> (as to the King) and a <hi>Broken Fortune.</hi> Now if I had been so easily disposed to Truck my <hi>Religion,</hi> for <hi>Mony;</hi> (as the whole <hi>Litter</hi> of the <hi>Town-Scriblers</hi> will have it) I do assure you Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, I could then have made my Market. But after this Assertion of the Faith I was brought up in, I do declare to you, that I reckon my self yet bound, as a <hi>Christian,</hi> to entertain a Tendernesse for the whole Race of Mankinde. I abhor the thought of seeing men of any Perswasion <hi>Worry'd,</hi> for a bare <hi>Appellation:</hi> I should reckon my self a <hi>Villain,</hi> if <hi>I</hi> were not <hi>Iust,</hi> and <hi>Grateful,</hi> even to many <hi>Papists;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in diverse Extremities, receiv'd Offices of great Honour, Piety, and Humanity, from People of That Perswasion. Beside that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> was pleas'd to make <hi>Some Loyall Papists</hi> the Instruments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering my <hi>Sovereign</hi> out of the hands of Other <hi>Protestant Rebells.</hi> And yet after all This; <hi>I</hi> am not such a Noddy, as not to see the Plot; though You may look further perhaps into a Mill-Stone, then <hi>Another man:</hi> But still <hi>I</hi> discern enough on't, to make my heart ake. Pray'e forgive me this Digression.</p>
            <p>He blunders, in the next Paragraph, at something, as if he would hint to the Reader that <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has plaid <hi>Iack on both sides:</hi> Now in good truth, Doctor, I never had that shifting Faculty; and I dare Appeal to my most malicious Enemies to say that ever I falter'd in my Duty to my Sovereign, in any kind, or degree whatsoever. And I can safely affirm, that in <hi>Thought, Word,</hi> or <hi>Deed,</hi> I did never so much as <hi>Countenance</hi> any <hi>disloyal Pretext</hi> toward his <hi>Majesty.</hi> From This, he passes into a Rapture concerning the <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and for a matter of a Page and three quarters, <hi>Doll Common</hi> in her <hi>Fits</hi> was not half so wise as his Worship.</p>
            <p>He takes me to task again (<hi>Pag.</hi> 11.) where I am commented upon, for saying <hi>the Dissenters from the Church of</hi> England <hi>cannot any way be ayding in a Reformation, but by their Prayers, and good Wishes, upon pain of Sedition.</hi> Now certainly (says he) <hi>as men, and Subjects under his Majesties Obeysance, the</hi> Dissenters <hi>are as Capable, and Legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48393:7"/>
               <hi>of serving his Majesty in any such Commands, as any other men, or Subjects whatsoever.</hi> Now my words are These. <hi>Put the Case that the Design strikes at all that call themselves</hi> Protestants <hi>in</hi> Generall; <hi>as well</hi> Non-Conformists, <hi>as</hi> Church-men; <hi>The</hi> Dissenters <hi>must yet range themselves under the Government, to Oppose it; and without intermedling any other way too, then by their Prayers and Good Wishes, upon pain of Sedition.</hi> So that the <hi>Dissenters</hi> are not excluded any <hi>Publique Service,</hi> but subjected to the <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> and not to Act beyond That Sphere, any otherwise then by their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>good wishes;</hi> and the word <hi>REFORMATION</hi> not so much as mention'd in the Case.</p>
            <p>But now Sir let me look to my self, sor I <hi>think</hi> (says he) <hi>no man in his Right wits will conceive</hi> L'Estrange <hi>knows what he says;</hi> and he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders exceedingly that I should dare to tell you Doctor, that <hi>Religion is a Spirituall Notion;</hi> And for <hi>this Notion</hi> he would have me to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,</hi> and <hi>legally judg'd, SEDITIOUS.</hi> I am affraid that this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman takes <hi>Religion</hi> for a <hi>Manufacture:</hi> You will now do me a kindnesse, Doctor, to give me a Hint, upon what <hi>Statute</hi> I am to be Indicted for <hi>Notions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To see now this Envious Creature again. I never give you a <hi>kind word,</hi> but I'm sure to have a <hi>Lash</hi> for't. <hi>They are wonderfull things</hi> (say I) <hi>that you have done already; and I am perswaded that you are yet reserved for more wonderfull things.</hi> And This does the Malevolent spleen of <hi>B. W.</hi> interpret only a <hi>Ieer,</hi> and <hi>Scoff,</hi> in contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Proof</hi> of the whole <hi>Nation:</hi> And so he calls it a <hi>Flurt at your Name,</hi> to presage that <hi>Time shall render your</hi> Name <hi>as Famous to Posterity</hi> (Pa. 21.) <hi>as your Virtue has made it to the present Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> Yes, yes Sir; I do predict it over again; that your Name shall be so: For this grand Revolution, wherein you have supported so Eminent a part, will transmit your Name to future Ages so long as there shall be any Memorialls Extant of the present Government.</p>
            <p>He is at me again for <hi>wounding and unworthily traducing the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Iustice of the Governours of this Nation, by turning their Transactions in this affair, into meer</hi> Sophisticall Ridicule. And this I get for saying (as he has translated me <hi>Pag.</hi> 12.) that <hi>none in his Right wits should take you for no Friend to the Church of</hi> England. And now Dr. 'tis your turn to be abus'd, for he says that it was <hi>forreign,</hi> and <hi>remote</hi> from the <hi>Scope,</hi> and <hi>drift</hi> of <hi>your Evidence,</hi> to give the <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> so great a blow, as I affirm that Evidence to have done: Which truely I take, to be little lesse, then <hi>Actionable;</hi> for if a man shall be condemn'd in <hi>damages</hi> only for saying of a <hi>Taylor, He's but a Botcher,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48393:7"/>
because of the Loss it may cause him in his <hi>Trade;</hi> of much greater Moment is it, to disparage a <hi>Divine,</hi> in so necessary a part of his <hi>Qualification;</hi> to the hindrance of him in his <hi>Ecclesiastical Preferments.</hi> For <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> and <hi>Church-Dignities</hi> will not stand together. Now see Sir, what work he makes with my saying that <hi>It is a matter of absolute Necessity to fetch these Plotters out of their Holds.</hi> From hence, he concludes, that I would have all the <hi>Dissenters</hi> from the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be <hi>destroy'd,</hi> as <hi>Plotters:</hi> which is none of my Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; but only to put them to the <hi>Test,</hi> that we may <hi>distinguish,</hi> and <hi>Separate</hi> the <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> from <hi>Other People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He comes now to passe Sentence upon me, as a <hi>Blaster</hi> of the <hi>Kings Evidence,</hi> and a <hi>favourer</hi> of the <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> for supporting the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Your Testimony,</hi> and the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Proceeding Congruously</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>His next advance is to my <hi>Further Discovery of the Plot, from your Narrative, and Depositions:</hi> He denies it to be a <hi>Further Discovery;</hi> but how and how, I am not able to comprehend.

               <hi>But whatever there is further in that Pamphlet, but in truth its no further Discovery of your Discover'd Plot, but of his own it is, and what that is, what I have by my Observations already made, to that of which part of this is in matter but Repetition, and of that of which I shall make to that which is New; I doubt not Doctor but will give you full and Evident Satisfaction.</hi> I should be very glad, Sir, to see this Clause unriddled.</p>
            <p>It will concern me now I perceive to look about me; for <hi>B. W.</hi> sticks close to me for <hi>calling the just Proceedings of the Authority of the Nation</hi> a <hi>Havock,</hi> and saying, <hi>after all this</hi> Havock <hi>made of the Papists. I</hi> pray'e take notice, Doctor, that I have Solemnly expounded my self upon this poynt (Pag. 3.) <hi>where Authority has past a Sentence there is no longe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any place for Hesitation, or Demurre.</hi> So that <hi>His meaning</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48393:8"/>
is out of doors: And now give me leave to tell you <hi>mine:</hi> When <hi>Goods</hi> are <hi>taken away</hi> from <hi>one</hi> man, and either <hi>given,</hi> or <hi>Sold</hi> to <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> when Books, good and bad, are swept away together; or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of contrary to the Direction of <hi>Law;</hi> This <hi>I</hi> call making <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> make use of this word too with all possible Veneration to the Sacrednesse of Publique Justice. <hi>I</hi> must needs rectify one mistake in the next Paragraph, wherein <hi>B. W,</hi> (not for want of <hi>Ignorance</hi>) follows my <hi>Printer,</hi> and instead of <hi>Indue</hi> says that <hi>the Priests will</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure <hi>all Shapes:</hi> He gives me here a Lick by the <hi>By,</hi> for <hi>Fiddling</hi> to <hi>Oliver,</hi> and then pronounces that <hi>without all peradventure</hi> a <hi>Discovery must and doth imply new Fact; otherwise it's no discovery:</hi> and so infers that for want of <hi>New Fact, mine</hi> is not a <hi>Further</hi> Discovery. But by <hi>B. W's.</hi> favour, <hi>one Discovery</hi> leads to <hi>Another;</hi> as several other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries have been superinduc'd upon the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the Bloud; and yet the matter of <hi>Fact</hi> still the same; as This <hi>Additional Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> in a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> has produc'd a <hi>Further Discovery</hi> of the <hi>Authour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now blesse your self Doctor, at <hi>B. W</hi>'s <hi>Amasement</hi> (pag. 14.) <hi>with what confidence</hi> L'Estrange <hi>dares write such things:</hi> that is to say, <hi>that That part of the Designe against his Majesties Life is broken to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purposes, but we are beholden to you, for the Discovery of Other, and Further Plots, in defaming the King and Government, subversion of our establisht Religion, and Disturbance of the Peace, so that our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is but half done.</hi> Observe now, how <hi>Iesuitically</hi> this <hi>Fanatique</hi> has guelt this Passage, by leaving out These Words; so that [<hi>unless the remaining and the still growing Difficulties and Hazzards be encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with Timely and Effectual Remedies,</hi>] the work of our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is but half-done; Beside the maiming of the Period through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Now am I to be <hi>question'd</hi> and <hi>punisht</hi> over again, for my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slike of that which I call (<hi>pag.</hi> 26.) <hi>a remote and undutiful Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kings Death.</hi> But I adhere to that <hi>Dislike;</hi> for it is our part to do all we can to preserve his Sacred <hi>Life,</hi> and not by the supposal of his Majesties <hi>Death</hi> to set Parties and Factions a <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting.</hi> And for This, I'me fetch'd up again, for giving the <hi>Lye</hi> to the <hi>Representative of the Commons of the Nation:</hi> This Fellow calls for <hi>Iustice,</hi> as if he went a snip with the <hi>Hangman,</hi> for an old Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwig.</p>
            <p>You cannot imagine Doctor, how it comforts me that I am now entring upon the <hi>16th</hi> Page; where he takes it very ill to have the <hi>Church-of-England-Members</hi> clear'd of any hand, or Interest in This Plot; and to palliate the matter, <hi>neither he, nor any man</hi> (says he) <hi>can say, that there was not members of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>on both</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48393:8"/>
               <hi>sides, in those unhappy Wars.</hi> Now, Doctor, I am Positive, that there was not <hi>one Church-of-England-man</hi> in the <hi>Parliaments Army</hi> (as they cal'd it:) For how should it be Otherwise? when the <hi>Order,</hi> the <hi>Discipline,</hi> and the <hi>Service</hi> of the Church were wholly <hi>Extinguisht</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; the use of the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> made <hi>Penall;</hi> and the whole <hi>Masse</hi> of that Seditious Body was only a <hi>Confederate Union</hi> of so many <hi>Schisms,</hi> to oppose the <hi>Eeclesiastical Government.</hi> It will not yet down with <hi>B. W.</hi> Doctor, that you have altogether clear'd the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and her sons, from the calumny of being either mediately, or immediately guilty of this horrid Plot; and his Reason is, that you are <hi>Impartiall.</hi> It is not sayd that you have <hi>Spar'd,</hi> but <hi>clear'd</hi> them, and so you have; in not <hi>accusing</hi> them.</p>
            <p>He reflects (Pag. 7.) upon my Contradicting my self in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the <hi>Numbers</hi> of Papists; One while not above <hi>One</hi> to <hi>three Thousand; but now</hi> (says he) <hi>Tables must be turn'd upon Dissenters</hi> to <hi>the Church of</hi> England; <hi>Then because of some of the Dissenters Scruple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness in swearing, his Opinion is chang'd; for now there is a great deal of Danger he says.</hi> This man is no fair Dealer, Doctor; for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is <hi>three thousand</hi> to <hi>one</hi> in <hi>Sight:</hi> and then, the fewer they are that appear, the greater is the number, and consequently the danger of them in their Retreats. This is not to presse a Totall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation neither, as <hi>B. W.</hi> weakly and malitiously suggests; but some such means of distinction as may rationally secure the Peace of the Government. He values himself much upon one Argument out of my own mouth. <hi>Because many of the Dissenters will not take Oaths</hi> (says he) <hi>therefore There, the</hi> Jesuits <hi>may hide themselves: And so also, many of the</hi> Jesuits <hi>will take the Oaths of Allegeance, and Supremacy, and so will the Members of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>If so, then what can hinder the</hi> Jesuites <hi>to herd, and hide There.</hi> The Answer to This, Doctor, is Obvious; They have not the <hi>Means,</hi> in <hi>one</hi> Place, for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ends, that they have in the <hi>Other;</hi> the <hi>Rule,</hi> and the <hi>Forms</hi> of the Church are <hi>Stated,</hi> and <hi>Certain;</hi> and there's no <hi>Preaching,</hi> but under <hi>due Circumstances</hi> and <hi>Qualifications:</hi> Whereas in <hi>Conventicles,</hi> they can take all <hi>Libertyes,</hi> and vent what Doctrines they please: the People being already prepared by the humour of <hi>Separation</hi> to entertain <hi>undutifull Impressions.</hi> All the remainder now amounts to no more then the <hi>Fagg-end</hi> of a <hi>Narrative;</hi> and a great deal of pains taken, Doctor, to tell you so particular a Story of Your own Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, as no Mortal can honestly pretend to know, but your self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48393:9"/>You have had enough, Sir, I suppose, of the Stile, and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Author of this Pamphlet, I should be glad now to learn something more particularly concerning the <hi>man himself:</hi> For this same <hi>B. W.</hi> may be <hi>Cloven-Footed,</hi> for ought I know; and the spirit of <hi>slander</hi> couch'd under those two Letters. The best way to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> him, is to read him <hi>backward;</hi> as <hi>Enemy</hi> for <hi>Friend,</hi> and <hi>Friend</hi> for <hi>Enemy; Truth</hi> for <hi>Falshood,</hi> and <hi>Falshood</hi> for <hi>Truth:</hi> And This <hi>Unciphers</hi> him. One while I phansy him to be a <hi>Iesuit;</hi> for he's so damnably Cunning, that as he carries it, a body would think he had no more Brains then a Dormouse. But then methinks, on the Other side, if he <hi>were</hi> one, You should have met him at <hi>Madrid,</hi> or <hi>Salamanca,</hi> Doctor, or somewhere else abroad in your Travels. I would you'd cast a Figure for him, Sir, for <hi>nothing but a Di-a-mond,</hi> you know, <hi>can cut a Di-a-mond.</hi> And yet upon comparing this <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Discoverer,</hi> with the <hi>Marks,</hi> and <hi>Tokens</hi> of a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> as you have <hi>describ'd</hi> him; I am half-perswaded that <hi>B. W.</hi> may come to be found a <hi>Iesuite</hi> yet at last. Do the <hi>Iesuites</hi> change their <hi>Shapes?</hi> So does <hi>he:</hi> Are they <hi>Cruel,</hi> and <hi>Sanguinary?</hi> So is <hi>he.</hi> Have they their <hi>Equivocations,</hi> and <hi>Mentall Reservations?</hi> So has <hi>he:</hi> And not only his <hi>Own</hi> neither, but he pronounces upon the Mentall Reservations of <hi>Other men,</hi> and brings <hi>Thought</hi> against <hi>Thought,</hi> into <hi>Evidence.</hi> Are the <hi>Iesuites</hi> given to <hi>Scandalize,</hi> and <hi>Undermine Societies?</hi> to <hi>add,</hi> and <hi>Substract,</hi> in the matter of <hi>Truth?</hi> Are they <hi>Pragmaticall</hi> in affairs out of their own Province? Are they <hi>Officious</hi> toward men of <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</hi> and <hi>Power?</hi> so is <hi>He</hi> you see.

Now That's the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I conceive, betwixt <hi>a Conventicle-Iesuit,</hi> and <hi>Another.</hi> He does all he can in the world to possesse you that he is <hi>Your friend,</hi> and <hi>my Enemy:</hi> And yet, upou the Issue, in despite of his Hearts blood; he proves himself to be <hi>Your Enemy,</hi> and <hi>my Friend.</hi> How can <hi>That man</hi> be <hi>Your Friend,</hi> that calls it <hi>Abusing</hi> of you, to speak <hi>Well</hi> of you? His very <hi>Flatteryes,</hi> are as <hi>Childish,</hi> and as <hi>Cloying</hi> as <hi>Suger-plumbs;</hi> there's no <hi>Ayr,</hi> no <hi>Grace,</hi> no <hi>Vigour</hi> in them; nay his very <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are <hi>Scandalls.</hi> He treats you with an <hi>Old-fashion'd Legg</hi> to a <hi>Queen-Elsabeth-Iustice;</hi> and he shall pay the same Homage to one of Your <hi>Lacquays,</hi> if you should but send him to him of an Arrand.

You Swear point-blank</hi> that the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> haunt the <hi>Conventicles:</hi> and <hi>He,</hi> as audaciously on the <hi>Other</hi> side, <hi>denys</hi> it, and gives the <hi>Ly, point-blank</hi> to your <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> Pray'e tell me, Sir, if you should say now that <hi>L'Estrange</hi> is a very <hi>Honest, Loyall Fellow;</hi> and <hi>B.

            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I beseech you, Doctor, do but observe, when the <hi>smooth, Supple Humour</hi> goes off with him, how <hi>Magisterially</hi> he behaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and how he <hi>Grows</hi> upon you: Under the Colour of a <hi>Friend,</hi> how he takes <hi>upon</hi> him, and plays the part of a <hi>Governour.</hi> He tells you what you are to <hi>Think,</hi> in <hi>This</hi> case, and what you are to <hi>Do</hi> in <hi>That: How</hi> to understand <hi>One</hi> Poynt, and <hi>how, Another: Here</hi> he <hi>Spells</hi> for you, and <hi>There,</hi> he <hi>puts Together:</hi> And all This, with the <hi>Weaknesse</hi> of a <hi>School-boy,</hi> and the <hi>Arrogance</hi> of a <hi>Pedant.</hi> And what's his End; but to have it thought in the World, that you are Rul'd, and Influenc'd by <hi>His Dictate?</hi> But This is not the First time that <hi>other people</hi> have layd Claim to the Reward of <hi>Your Merits.</hi> I lost a Friend I'm sure, my self once, because I would not License a Book for Another Person, as the <hi>First Discoverer of the Plot.</hi> And it cannot be expected, that a man in your <hi>Post,</hi> and <hi>Station,</hi> should live without <hi>Envy.</hi> But yet how far it may stand with your <hi>Credit,</hi> or <hi>Good Liking</hi> to suffer your self to be <hi>Cokes'd,</hi> and thus <hi>Impos'd</hi> upon by every Little <hi>Sir-Politique Would-be,</hi> is submitted to your Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. In One word Sir, can any man be <hi>Your</hi> (or indeed <hi>any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys) Friend,</hi> that has neither <hi>Brains,</hi> nor <hi>Shame,</hi> nor <hi>Good manners,</hi> nor <hi>Good Nature,</hi> nor <hi>Truth,</hi> nor <hi>Honour</hi> in him? This, I do assure you, Doctor, is the <hi>just Character</hi> of <hi>my Antagonist,</hi> if a body may measure the <hi>Man</hi> by his <hi>Discourses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be objected perhaps; <hi>what does it concern</hi> L'Estrange, <hi>the</hi> vanity <hi>of this mans setting up for the</hi> Doctors Friend, <hi>and</hi> Adviser; <hi>or how he behaves himself, in the Execution of That Office? If what the</hi> One Does, <hi>the</hi> Other <hi>thinks fit to</hi> permit, L'Estrange <hi>is but a Coxcomb for medling.</hi> (Nay and 'tis well if he scape so too) for he has been call'd

               <hi>Rogue, Rascall, Thief, Turnspit,</hi> for much Lesse.) It must needs be acknowledg'd, Doctor, that what <hi>You Two</hi> agree upon betwixt <hi>your selves,</hi> is nothing at all to <hi>me;</hi> but by my Faith, Sir, when I come once to be represented to you as a <hi>Papist, Plotter,</hi> or <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Government;</hi> and to the <hi>Kings Witnesses; This touches my Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;</hi> and 'tis well for me that I'm fallen into Good hands; for such an nformation, given to a man that would have ventur'd an <hi>Oath</hi> upon <hi>Hearsay,</hi> might have been as much as my Neck's worth.</p>
            <p>But 'tis a double Happynesse to me, <hi>First,</hi> that <hi>You believe</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all This; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> that <hi>he proves</hi> as little: for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pitch upon any One Line in the whole Pamphlet, and say, <hi>This is the point I le Charge him with.</hi> But when he has flutter'd, from <hi>One Surmise,</hi> to <hi>Another; Falsify'd</hi> my <hi>Sentences,</hi> taken up here and there a word by <hi>Snaps,</hi> and left the <hi>Connexion, behind him;</hi> he is yet forc'd at last to fly from the <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>Genuine Sense</hi> of my <hi>Expressions,</hi> to the <hi>Mysticall Possibility</hi> of <hi>Another Intention.</hi> Make it your own case, Doctor: Suppose I should see you upon your knees at the Sacrament, and tell some body, <hi>Look ye: now is that Damn'd Doctor making a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with the Devil:</hi> Or that you should see me (tho' with all the Devotion imaginable) poring upon the <hi>Four Evangelists,</hi> and cry out, <hi>do ye see that dogg</hi> L'Estrange? <hi>Now is he turning the History of our Saviour into</hi> Burlesque. Why where's <hi>Christian Charity</hi> at This rate? what becomes of the <hi>Common Methods</hi> of <hi>Intercourse,</hi> and the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Human Society;</hi> If when a mans <hi>Words</hi> are <hi>Open,</hi> and the <hi>Construction Obvious,</hi> his <hi>Heart</hi> shall be torn out of his Breast, for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Meaning? The Sun shines;</hi> that is to say, '<hi>Tis Midnight: Wee'l make him a Glorious King;</hi> that is to say, <hi>wee'l cut off his Head.</hi> This is a <hi>Fanaticall figure</hi> Sir, and of no account among the <hi>Orthodox.</hi> And yet upon such grounds as These, am I most zealously recommended, by <hi>B. W.</hi> to your Care Doctor, <hi>to see me hang'd, drawn and quarter'd,</hi> in time Convenient.</p>
            <p>You will see at large, Sir, in this Angry Tract of his, that as the Gentleman has render'd <hi>me</hi> to be <hi>Your Enemy,</hi> under the <hi>Masque</hi> of a <hi>Friend,</hi> he is no lesse <hi>My Friend,</hi> in the <hi>Shape</hi> of an <hi>Enemy. First,</hi> he's an <hi>Incomparable Foil;</hi> such a <hi>Setter-off,</hi> that when you come to compare us, I'le leave You to be the Judge, (and I'me sure you'l not spare me) if <hi>even L'Estrange</hi> himself be not an <hi>Angell</hi> to him. Now and then, 'tis true, he stumbles upon a <hi>Right number,</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> but the <hi>Nominative Case</hi> and the <hi>Verb</hi> are <hi>Mortall Enemies</hi> with him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the whole piece is but <hi>One Grin,</hi> from <hi>End,</hi> to <hi>End;</hi> without ever <hi>fastening</hi> upon any thing; and at last, he <hi>proves me</hi> to be

               <hi>Innocent,</hi> by <hi>proving,</hi> with much labour, that he <hi>cannot</hi> prove me to be <hi>Guilty. Thirdly,</hi> his <hi>Frauds,</hi> and <hi>Fallacies</hi> are as <hi>Palpable</hi> as <hi>Egyptian Foggs;</hi> so <hi>grosse,</hi> they may be <hi>felt:</hi> Which does but all serve to Illustrate <hi>My Integrity,</hi> and <hi>Credit.</hi> If <hi>These</hi> be not the Offices of a <hi>Friend,</hi> pray what <hi>are?</hi> And then all is perform'd too, in such a way of <hi>Gravity, Weighing</hi> (forsooth) <hi>Considering, Pondering,</hi> and <hi>Advising,</hi> at such a Supercilious Rate; a body would have thought he had had the whole <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> in his <hi>Belly:</hi> And yet at length, when he comes to <hi>Open,</hi> out comes just nothing but <hi>Gall,</hi> and <hi>Clamour.</hi> Pray'e advise him Sir, if he falls in your way, to be <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,</hi> and <hi>Temperate,</hi> and not to bear so hard upon <hi>a poor decayed Gentleman,</hi> (as a learned Author has it in his <hi>Courant) that lives by his Fingers End.</hi> Consider, Sir, It has been your own Case; and yet you see the Advantages that many times attend <hi>Resolution,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,</hi> under the Blessing of a <hi>Propitious Fate.</hi> We are all of us the <hi>Sport</hi> of <hi>Fortune.</hi> She <hi>Raises</hi> from the <hi>Alms-Basket,</hi> and <hi>casts down</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Dungeon;</hi> She sets <hi>Beggers</hi> a <hi>Horse-back,</hi> and turns their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters afoot;</hi> She brings <hi>Princes</hi> to the <hi>Block,</hi> and advances <hi>Traytors</hi> to the <hi>Throne;</hi> She gives <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> to those that <hi>wanted</hi> it; and <hi>takes</hi> from those that had it in <hi>abundance.</hi> And thus the World Rolls, as her slippery Ladyship pleases.</p>
            <p>It is cast in my Teeth, I know, at every Turn, that <hi>I write for Bread;</hi> which is either <hi>True,</hi> or <hi>False:</hi> If <hi>True,</hi> it is one of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Oates</hi>'s, and the <hi>L'Estranges</hi> are two Names very well known in <hi>Norfolk.</hi> So that I shall not need to tell you, Doctor (being your Country-man) that I am a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> beside, that I am to presume You, Doctor, to be Read as well in the <hi>Heralds,</hi> as the <hi>Schoolmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a long time, Sir, that you have done me the Honour to mention my <hi>Name;</hi> and still with <hi>Rogue, Rascall, Villain, Papist,</hi> or some such Mark of your displeasure along with it: Now These are Terms which <hi>B. W. distinguishes</hi> from Reflexions upon <hi>Persons,</hi> or <hi>Qualities,</hi> and imputes them only to an <hi>Impetuous Fervor,</hi> of <hi>Zeal,</hi> that transports you, <hi>impartially,</hi> &amp; without <hi>distinction</hi> into <hi>those Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;</hi> So often as difference of <hi>Opinion,</hi> upon the Main, happens to be the thing in <hi>Question;</hi> Now I know very well that when a man's Tongue has got a Habit of walking One way, he can no more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear <hi>speaking</hi> what comes <hi>Next,</hi> then <hi>spitting,</hi> for 'tis only matter of Course: And I do absolutely discharge you, Sir, of any <hi>Malicious Intent</hi> toward <hi>me,</hi> in the Heat of That Language; upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, that it was all grounded upon the <hi>Mistake</hi> of My <hi>Principle,</hi> and an <hi>Opinion</hi> that I did not stand right, as to the matter of the <hi>Plot,</hi> without any <hi>Malignity</hi> (as I said e'en now) either to my <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> or <hi>Person.</hi> Nay I have heard you my self (in Confirmation of <hi>B. W</hi>'s. Remark) frankly, and openly affirm that <hi>Laud</hi> (the <hi>Martyr</hi>) was a <hi>Rascall,</hi> and a <hi>Traytor; and that ere long you'd tell the World as much in Print.</hi> And what was all this, but still the <hi>Impulse</hi> of a <hi>Transcendent Zeal,</hi> upon a full belief that the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> was a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist?</hi> But who can tye up the <hi>Winds,</hi> or set <hi>Limits</hi> to the Dictates of a <hi>Boundlesse Spirit?</hi> I have heard of a <hi>beyond-sea-Divine,</hi> (a Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Asserter of the <hi>Romish Communion</hi>) that would familiarly run thorough <hi>whole Royall Families</hi> of <hi>Protestant Professors,</hi> by the Names of <hi>Rogues,</hi> and <hi>Bitches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, Sir, let it be granted, (for Peace sake) that I am <hi>that wretched fellow, that Pittyfull Rascall, that Scribbles for Bread,</hi> as you were pleas'd, in Great, and Reverend Company, but upon <hi>Good-Fryday-last,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48393:11"/>
to call me. (I could wish This had rather fall'n out upon a <hi>Shrove-Tuesday,</hi> for <hi>Good-Fryday</hi> is not a proper day for such a piece of <hi>Masquerade.</hi>) Why faith, Sir, Blesse your stars, that you your self are struck into a better way; and leave me to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of taking up what fair Employment I think fit for an Honest Lively-hood. Where's the <hi>Hurt,</hi> or the <hi>Shame</hi> of This I beseech you; if I can make a shift by this means to do my <hi>Duty,</hi> and my <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse?</hi> I know there are more <hi>Expedite,</hi> and <hi>Beneficiall</hi> ways of Thriving in the World, if I could but bring my Conscience to <hi>Bear;</hi> as <hi>Iuggling, Treppaning, Cross-biting, Canting, Swearing,</hi> &amp;c. But alas, Sir, I am <hi>Old;</hi> and for a man to begin late, and go to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil before he has done his Jobb, would not do so well. Alack, alack, Sir! what can a man get by a Snip in a poor Pamphlet of 4 or 5 sheets of Paper? No, no, Doctor, 'tis your <hi>Narratives,</hi> that Sweep all. Those are the <hi>Swingeing Coppies.</hi> I heard you say my self once, that you lost <hi>500l.</hi> at <hi>One Bout,</hi> by having your <hi>Narrative</hi> Printed upon you. Now your <hi>Narrative</hi> was precisely <hi>Nineteen sheets.</hi> And I am assur'd that you have Six hundred more at this Instant, Ready for the <hi>Presse;</hi> which in Proportion will be worth to you, <hi>Sixteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand seven hundred</hi> and <hi>seventy pounds six shillings</hi> and <hi>eight pence,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Fraction. Nay, 'tis <hi>Forty Guinnyes,</hi> the bare <hi>signing</hi> a <hi>Narrative</hi> of <hi>Another mans Writing.</hi> But Doctor, that I may not be behind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with you, in <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> I do really <hi>write</hi> for my <hi>Bread;</hi> and which is more, for my <hi>Head</hi> too, into the Bargain: Nay, upon my Soul, according to my Estimat of the Case, I write <hi>My Part</hi> for the very <hi>Bread</hi> of my <hi>Master;</hi> and to shew the people the Snares that are laid by <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>that Brood,</hi> (as well as <hi>Papists</hi>) for the <hi>Government.</hi> You see, Sir, what an <hi>Out-cry</hi> this same Little <hi>Fanatical Faux</hi> makes about <hi>my Further Discovery;</hi> which only advises the plucking of the <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> out by the <hi>Ears,</hi> from among the <hi>Conventicles;</hi> where <hi>your Testimony,</hi> and <hi>Depositions</hi> have <hi>Lodg'd</hi> them. And this is done too with as much <hi>Respect,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> to your <hi>self,</hi> as any man <hi>Can</hi> pay you, that Scorns to <hi>Flatter</hi> you: And with a most <hi>Dutyfull Passion</hi> for the well-fare of the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But on the <hi>Other</hi> hand; tho' every day brings forth Multitudes of <hi>Poysonous, Seditious,</hi> and <hi>Schismaticall Libells,</hi> that strike at the very <hi>Root,</hi> and <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Government; This Officious Zelote</hi> (I'le Warrant you Sir) is as blind on That side, as a Beetle. The <hi>Kings Authority</hi> may be <hi>Invaded;</hi> his <hi>Person Lampoon'd;</hi> the <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> Themselves <hi>affronted,</hi> as well as their <hi>Function:</hi> As at the <hi>Essex-Election,</hi> and elsewhere: And here's no Libelling taken notice of in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48393:12"/>
               <hi>These Cases.</hi> But if a man puts in a Sober, and a Moderate Word an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way, presently the <hi>Plot,</hi> and the <hi>Kings Witnesses</hi> are <hi>Topt</hi> upon him. <hi>The People may Remove wicked Kings</hi> (says One) and what says the Author of the <hi>Free-holders Choice? I believe</hi> (says he) <hi>Good Father</hi> Jacob <hi>had a Foresight of these Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>when in his Last Will and Testament he left them a</hi> Curse <hi>for a</hi> Legacy, <hi>instead of a</hi> Blessing. <hi>And if the whole world were now to make their Wills, all but</hi> Knaves, <hi>and</hi> Fools <hi>would do the like.</hi> Here's no threatening of men with <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> or Arraigning of them for <hi>Traytors</hi> upon <hi>These points;</hi> which does evidently shew a Designing <hi>Partiality,</hi> and <hi>Disaffection.</hi> And after all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This, I am so far from questioning the <hi>Plot,</hi> that it strikes me with horror, the Apprehension where it will end. But still give me your pardon, Sir, if I reckon it to be worth the care of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to <hi>discourage</hi> and <hi>Suppresse Treasonous Principles,</hi> as well as to <hi>punish Treasonous Practises:</hi> For <hi>Thought</hi> is but the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Action.</hi> I would have the Conspiracy sifted to the Last man; but yet that which is found <hi>Criminall,</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> hand, I would not have it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the <hi>Multitude,</hi> as <hi>Lawfull,</hi> as the <hi>Other:</hi> For it is much more dangerous to have the <hi>People</hi> possest, that such or such an <hi>Ill</hi> thing <hi>may</hi> be done, then <hi>Privately</hi> to contrive the Doing of it.</p>
            <p>We shall now Sir, if you please, put all the <hi>Rogues, Rascals, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, Sauce-boxes, Papists, Turn-Spits, pittifull Fellows,</hi> and <hi>Scriblers for Bread,</hi> upon the account of an <hi>Exuberant Zeal</hi> in matter of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural Opinion.</hi> But when you come to matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> (if I may be so bold Sir,) you should really do well to be a little Tender: As when you were pleas'd to say <hi>Positively</hi> the Other day, that <hi>L'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange</hi> was one of <hi>Nolls Fidlers.</hi> The businesse was, <hi>He came in once in the middle of a Consort, where I was playing a Part; and that was all.</hi> Now This is a great Scandal to me, Sir; aud you must allow me to tell you in your <hi>Personall Capacity,</hi> that the <hi>Aspersion</hi> is as <hi>false</hi> as <hi>Hell;</hi> But I have nothing to say to you in your <hi>Political Capacity</hi> but with <hi>Submission,</hi> and <hi>Respect.</hi> For it is <hi>Doctor Titus Oates</hi> that <hi>defames Me</hi> in This Particular, without aspersing the <hi>Kings Witnesse.</hi> So that the <hi>Falshood</hi> of the <hi>Person</hi> does not at all Invalidate the <hi>Strength</hi> of the <hi>Evidence.</hi> Pray'e Doctor take into your Consideration how great a Sufferer I am render'd by This Slander: For it will be understood, either that I went over to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> to betray the <hi>King:</hi> Or else I must be taken to have pretended my self reconciled to his Interest, and under That Colour to <hi>Swear</hi> and <hi>Abjure</hi> to the Pit of Hell, for the gaining of some other Point. As to the making of me a <hi>State-Rogue,</hi> That would have been pardonable yet, if you had not made
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48393:12"/>
a <hi>Fiddling-Rogne</hi> of me; a <hi>Common Statute-Rogne.</hi> Why, Doctor, how shall I have the face to shew myself in <hi>White-hall</hi> again, uuder <hi>This Character?</hi> What will: People think of <hi>L'Estrange</hi> at This rate? especially having the Authority of the <hi>Great Witnesse</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> for the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Report.</hi> But <hi>Infallibility,</hi> Sir, in matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> is a point that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self could never yet be brought to swallow; so that a man may contradict some of your Mistakes, without any <hi>Offence</hi> at all, either to your <hi>Testimony,</hi> or <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You were pleased at the same time Sir (according to your wont) to enlarge your self upon some other <hi>Loose Topicks</hi> too, concerning mee; and with so little regard, either to <hi>Candour</hi> or <hi>Caution</hi> in your <hi>Reports,</hi> that really, Doctor, I should chide you, if I durst, for <hi>defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Kings Evidence:</hi> And, under favour, it is not well done to take up <hi>Infamous Stories</hi> upon the High-way, and vent them again presently for <hi>Pos<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ve Truths:</hi> especially for a Person under your Circumstances, the Credit of whose Testimony does so much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Nation. The <hi>Subject</hi> being <hi>Clamour,</hi> and <hi>Reviling,</hi> was in it self a very unfitting Theme for a <hi>Church-man.</hi> But for a <hi>Divine,</hi> upon a <hi>Good-Fryday,</hi> after a <hi>Passion-Sermon,</hi> and in his <hi>Preparatory</hi> for the <hi>Solemn Festival</hi> of <hi>Easter,</hi> to abandon himself to such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of <hi>Outrage,</hi> without either <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Provocation,</hi> and in so <hi>venerable</hi> a <hi>Presence</hi> too; (I need not tell you where Sir) nor, as I am a Christian, did I come to the Knowledge of This directly or indirectly from any Member of the Family.) Why will you suffer a violent Passion to carry you thus beyond all bounds of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Consideration?</hi> It takes away your <hi>Reason,</hi> Doctor; and in these Fits rather then not do <hi>me</hi> a <hi>Mischief,</hi> you care not what you say: For you do no more believe me to be as you have represented me, then I believe you to be the Ghost of <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi> I have not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd one syllable here, without a due Respect, both to <hi>what</hi> I <hi>say</hi> and to <hi>Whom</hi> I <hi>speak:</hi> and if every Particle in This paper should be put to the Torture, to force an Evidence from it against the <hi>Authour;</hi> 'tis no more then I look for. But so secure am I in the <hi>Conscience</hi> of my own <hi>Integrity,</hi> and so well satisfi'd in the <hi>Title</hi> I have to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right of defending my self;</hi> that I am not at all sollicitous about the Event of This Freedom. And to shew you that I have not enter'd rashly upon This Undertaking, I'le give you a clear prospect of my Thoughts upon the Question, with submission to be better inform'd, where I'm mistaken.</p>
            <p>You cannot but observe, Doctor, that the stresse of <hi>B.</hi> W's. Charge

upon <hi>L'Estrange</hi> lyes with its whole weight upon <hi>These Four Poynts,</hi> viz. that he <hi>Favours</hi> the <hi>Papists, Lessens</hi> the <hi>Blot, Disparages</hi> the <hi>Wittnesses,</hi> and <hi>Arraigns</hi> the <hi>Government:</hi> And all this serves only as a <hi>Common-place to work</hi> upon, when any man is to be render'd <hi>Odious</hi> to the <hi>People:</hi> For 'tis a thing <hi>easily sayd, greedily swallow'd;</hi> of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Operation,</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> to be <hi>disprov'd;</hi> which is a very great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, when a man comes to be arraign'd for his <hi>Thoughts,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>clearing</hi> himself. It is a thing that extreamly <hi>Confounds,</hi> and <hi>Misleads</hi> us in This Affair, the Governing of our selves by the <hi>Common Forms</hi> of <hi>speaking,</hi> and according to the <hi>Vulgar understanding</hi> of the matter in hand. As for the purpose; we make a Favourer of the <hi>Plot;</hi> a Favourer of <hi>Popery,</hi> and a Favourer of <hi>Papists</hi> to signify, for the most part, one and the same Thing: And 'tis no matter which comes out First, when we would throw Dirt at a man: Whereas in <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> there is a great difference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> betwixt them; as will better appear by taking them apart, and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the One from the Other.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Papists</hi> is properly intended the <hi>whole Party</hi> among us of <hi>That Perswasion.</hi> By <hi>Popery,</hi> the <hi>Opinions,</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> of That Party. By the <hi>Plot,</hi> is to be understood, the <hi>Conspiracy;</hi> which is a <hi>Third Consideration,</hi> separate from the <hi>Other Two.</hi> So that a man may be a Favourer of the <hi>Plot,</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and yet an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and to the <hi>Party;</hi> For we see, That the same Designe has been formerly <hi>Carry'd on,</hi> and <hi>Executed</hi> by men of <hi>Opposite Iudgements.</hi> And likewise a man may have a <hi>Kindnesse</hi> for the <hi>Opinion,</hi> and yet be an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Plot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> As (in Despite of Detraction) we have seen many Instances. And Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a man may have a <hi>Tendernesse</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> for the <hi>Party,</hi> without Leaning at all to the <hi>Opinion,</hi> and with a perfect <hi>detestation</hi> of the <hi>Execrable Confederacy.</hi> [Well Doctor, but you will tell me that This <hi>Popish Plot</hi> is a <hi>Complicated Plot;</hi> and not barely a Plot upon the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> but a <hi>Plot</hi> also supported upon <hi>Popish Principles,</hi> and carry'd on by a <hi>Popish Party,</hi> for the <hi>Extirpation</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi> It is not Sir, to extenuate the <hi>Guilt,</hi> and the <hi>Foulnesse</hi> of This <hi>Plot,</hi> if I tell you, that the <hi>Fanatical Revolution</hi> matcht it in every <hi>point.</hi> There was, <hi>First,</hi> a <hi>Confederacy;</hi> and then, a <hi>Design</hi> layd: a <hi>Change</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> resolv'd, the <hi>Lawfullnesse</hi> of it <hi>Debated,</hi> and <hi>Asserted;</hi> and the <hi>Instruments</hi> that carry'd it on, were the <hi>Fanatical Party:</hi> And all Terminated in the <hi>Snppression</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Religion:</hi> That is to say, if the Church of <hi>England</hi> was <hi>Protestant:</hi> Or if <hi>Otherwise,</hi> and if they that <hi>destroy'd</hi> This Glorious Church were <hi>Protestants Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48393:13"/>
from <hi>such Protestants good Lord deliver us.</hi> But you will say, Sir, that <hi>Prelacy, Ceremonyes, Habits,</hi> and <hi>set Forms of Prayer</hi> are not to be accounted matters of <hi>Religion.</hi> I beseech you, Sir, what <hi>Religion</hi> is there in a <hi>Messe of Porridge;</hi> or in <hi>looking out at the Window</hi> to see what a <hi>Clock</hi> 'tis? And yet I take it to be a very <hi>material Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> in point of <hi>Religion,</hi> to throw That Porridge in the face of my <hi>Father,</hi> in the <hi>One</hi> case, or to resuse upon his command, to look out at the <hi>Window</hi> on the <hi>Other.</hi> For <hi>Religion</hi> consists in <hi>Doing,</hi> as well as <hi>Believing,</hi> and in the Conservation of <hi>Unity,</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance betwixt the <hi>Face</hi> and the <hi>Glasse,</hi> is scarce liker then these <hi>Two Cases;</hi> and I do not know why the <hi>same way</hi> of <hi>Reasoning</hi> may not hold as well too, upon things so agreeing betwixt Themselves. The <hi>Popish Plot</hi> is <hi>Impious,</hi> for so much as concerns the destroying of the <hi>King,</hi> and the laying of the <hi>Nation</hi> in <hi>Confusion,</hi> and <hi>bloud;</hi> And so was the <hi>Schismaticall Plot</hi> too, And This is a poynt that all men, even of all Perswasions in <hi>Religion;</hi> that have either <hi>Honour,</hi> or <hi>Brains</hi> will easily accord. But you'l say that <hi>This Plot</hi> is prov'd by <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and <hi>Iudgments;</hi> and give me leave, Doctor, to tell you, that the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was also prov'd, by <hi>Fact,</hi> and the <hi>Final Execution</hi> of a <hi>Fore-layd Design.</hi> Well, but you'l say Sir, that the <hi>Iesuits Principles</hi> are <hi>Bloudy,</hi> and <hi>Dangerous:</hi> As That of <hi>Keeping no Faith wiih Heretiques;</hi> and the Doctrine of <hi>Absolving Subjects from their Obedience</hi> to <hi>such Princes.</hi> These are <hi>Hellish Positions</hi> 'tis true; but in the History of our <hi>Late Troubles,</hi> and in That of the <hi>Kirks Proceedings</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> you I find these <hi>Maxims</hi> taught in the very <hi>Schools,</hi> and <hi>Pulpits;</hi> Nay, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted too, by the most Eminent <hi>States-men</hi> and <hi>Divines:</hi> and not only so; but authoriz'd by <hi>General Assemblyes,</hi> and the <hi>Votes,</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> of a <hi>Mock-Representative</hi> of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Nay and it went further yet; for all these <hi>diabolicall Illusions</hi> were put in <hi>practice.</hi> They <hi>sought the Lord,</hi> for a <hi>Complement</hi> of the Wickednesse; they put the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Death,</hi> as by a <hi>Revelation;</hi> and glory'd in the thing done, as a favourable Dispensation of <hi>Providence.</hi> Once again, Sir, There were none but <hi>Papists</hi> (you'l say) in <hi>This Plot:</hi> there were none but <hi>Schismatiques</hi> in the <hi>Other;</hi> so that vou see the streights of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> betwixt these two <hi>Extreames;</hi> and the <hi>Danger</hi> is as mortal on the <hi>Right hand</hi> as on the <hi>Left.</hi> And give me leave to think Doctor, that as the <hi>Danger</hi> is <hi>Equall,</hi> so the <hi>Affliction</hi> is much <hi>bitterer,</hi> from those of <hi>our Own Family,</hi> then from <hi>strangers;</hi> the Prophet <hi>David</hi> himself seem'd to stagger a little under the weight of it: <hi>If it had been an Open Enemy, he could have born it,</hi> but to be wounded by Those, with whom he had taken <hi>Counsell, and</hi>

               <hi>walkt in the House of God as Friends;</hi> This was the almost Insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Aggravation of his Calamity.

            </p>
            <p>From <hi>This Parallell,</hi> if you please Sir, I will proceed to an Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what is <hi>Past,</hi> to our <hi>present Use,</hi> and <hi>purpose.</hi> I could wish that every man that had any part whatsoever in the promoting, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming, or upholding of our Late Troubles, would now upon This Occasion lay his hand upon his Heart, and tell his Story: What a variety of <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> would This Tale, truly told, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alas, I was but young</hi> (says one) <hi>and meerly drawn in; I meant no more Hurt to the King</hi> (God knows) <hi>then to my own Heart,</hi> cries A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. <hi>They told me the King was gotten into the Papists hands, and that they only intended to bring him back to his Parliament: But when I was once</hi> In, <hi>there was no getting</hi> out again. <hi>I never thought</hi> (says a Third) <hi>that it would have gone so farr; but I should have been well enough content to have seen some Grievances Redrest. One had a</hi> Father, <hi>or a</hi> Son <hi>on the</hi> Kings side, <hi>and he took the</hi> Other, <hi>to save stakes.</hi> Some were frighted into the Cause by Stories of <hi>German Horse, Massacres,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I was in the Parliament-quarters, and my Estate must have gone for't, if I had not comply'd. One</hi> had a good <hi>Office,</hi> a <hi>Benefice,</hi> or an <hi>Estate</hi> to lose; a <hi>Family</hi> to provide for; <hi>Another</hi> had a <hi>Court-grudg,</hi> and took his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> or fought only for <hi>Pay,</hi> as a <hi>Soldier of Fortune:</hi> And at This rate people were hookt in, some through <hi>weaknesse,</hi> but with <hi>good Intention;</hi> Others, by <hi>Interest, Fear,</hi> or <hi>Misguided Conscience,</hi> and not one man of a Thousand that Acted Originally, against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, either by <hi>Malice,</hi> or <hi>Design.</hi> I would have these people that have been thus seduc'd themselves, soberly to reflect upon it. We are all of us Flesh and Blood alike; why may not <hi>Other</hi> men be missed as well as <hi>we?</hi> Or why should we grudg <hi>Others</hi> the same measures of <hi>Tendernesse,</hi> and <hi>Remission,</hi> that we our selves have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Well, but those are <hi>Papists;</hi> and the Other are <hi>Schismatiques.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> are men of <hi>dangerous Principles,</hi> and so are the <hi>Fanatiques;</hi> but then <hi>some</hi> of the <hi>Dissemers</hi> are better then <hi>Other;</hi> and so are <hi>some</hi> of the <hi>Papists.</hi> If the <hi>Papists</hi> lie under the Lash of the <hi>Law,</hi> so do the <hi>Non-Conformists;</hi> and in short, <hi>This Plot</hi> (we hope) has <hi>miscarry'd,</hi> the <hi>Other succeeded;</hi> and yet only the <hi>Express Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> were singled out for <hi>Exemplary Iustice,</hi> and all the rest of the <hi>Criminals,</hi> and <hi>Common Actors</hi> in the <hi>Rebellion</hi> were pardon d in the <hi>Conspiracy</hi> that took <hi>effect.</hi> Now let me ask you,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48393:14"/>
Doctor, if you would have the <hi>Innocents, Men, Women, and Children</hi> promiscuouly exposed to more <hi>Rigour</hi> in the case of a <hi>Plot</hi> that is <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed,</hi> then the <hi>Nocents</hi> were on the <hi>Other hand,</hi> where an Unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld Rebellion took place. Give me leave now, Sir, to put a question; not to the <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> but to the <hi>Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Modesty</hi> of the <hi>Men:</hi> For let the <hi>Prosecution,</hi> on the part of the <hi>Government,</hi> be never so <hi>necessary,</hi> there may yet be some Regard had to the Circumstances of the Prosecutors. I would have those men, I must confess, that have been so <hi>Frankly</hi> pardon'd, <hi>Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> (even for the <hi>Consummated Destruction</hi> of <hi>Three Kingdoms,</hi>) be a little Tender in pressing an utter <hi>Extirpation</hi> of an <hi>Entire Party,</hi> because of a <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> among <hi>Some Particulars</hi> of <hi>That Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi> and a <hi>Conspiracy</hi> too, that is crusht by <hi>Providence,</hi> in the very <hi>Egg.</hi> What would you think on't, Sir, if you should see a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of fellows that have been in at a <hi>hundred Robberyes</hi> and <hi>Murthers, Themselves,</hi> and got their <hi>Pardons,</hi> and still keep their <hi>Bootyes;</hi> what would you think, (I say) to see These men, of all Others, the fiercest sticklers for <hi>Extremityes</hi> upon <hi>Other Felons</hi> that had only <hi>design'd</hi> the <hi>Outrage</hi> which they themselves had <hi>actually accomplisht?</hi> Besides Sir, that it seems to Carry a very <hi>suspicious Countenance</hi> to have Those men pretend the <hi>greatest zeal</hi> for the <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> that are most <hi>Notoriously known</hi> to be <hi>Disaffected</hi> to it. And yet upon the <hi>Mayn,</hi> we finde none so eager and prone, as some of these people are, to Calumniate the <hi>Iustice</hi> of the Nation by <hi>Remonstrances,</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Addresses;</hi> and by <hi>Violent Importunities</hi> to <hi>Precipitate</hi> Councils, as who should say, <hi>We</hi> are the <hi>Arbitrators</hi> of the great Affairs of the <hi>Government,</hi> and take more care of it, then the <hi>Government</hi> does for it <hi>Self.</hi> Pray'e take notice Doctor, that This is intended only of <hi>Licencious,</hi> and <hi>Illegall Proceedings,</hi> with due <hi>Submission</hi> to all <hi>Forms, Orders,</hi> and <hi>Resolutions</hi> of <hi>State:</hi> And that I do not speak of any sort of favour toward <hi>Criminals;</hi> and more Especially in the matter of <hi>Sir Edmund Bury-Godfrey;</hi> and this late barbarous Inhumanity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the person of <hi>Mr. Arnold;</hi> which I look upon to be two Instances, allmost <hi>Unpardonable: And I do here protest before the Living God, if I either knew or could make a farther Discovery, or if I ever can get the means of doing it, I would, and I will, (though the neerest Friends I have in the world) deliver them up into the hands of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as there appears some affinity betwixt the <hi>Case,</hi> and <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> of <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Extreams,</hi> (as to the <hi>Government,</hi>) be pleas'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me Sir, if there may not be allow'd some <hi>Proportion</hi> also of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion</hi> from the <hi>Government,</hi> in the matter of <hi>Mitigation,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48393:15"/>
toward <hi>both these Partyes.</hi> To which opinion I finde my self induced by these following Considerations, but with great ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be overrul'd by better Judgements.</p>
            <p>In the First place, Doctor, we are all of us <hi>Christians,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take a surer Measure for the Government of our <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> then the <hi>precepts,</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> of <hi>Our blessed Saviour.</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us in the Gospell, <hi>to</hi> Blesse <hi>those that</hi> Curse <hi>us, to do</hi> good <hi>to them that</hi> Hate us. And <hi>These Precepts</hi> to his Disciples, he made good upon the <hi>Crosse;</hi> in praying for his very <hi>Crucifyers.</hi> Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our reprov'd his Disciples for urging him <hi>to call for fire down from Heaven:</hi> There was no calling <hi>Rogue,</hi> and <hi>Rascall,</hi> but the great work of our <hi>Redemption</hi> was wrought out with <hi>Meekness,</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is a regard to be had likewise to the matter of <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> as we are all of us <hi>Men,</hi> and liable to the same <hi>Infirmityes,</hi> and <hi>Errours.</hi> It is the <hi>Condition</hi> of being <hi>forgiven Our selves,</hi> the forgiving of our <hi>Neighbours;</hi> and it concerns those men, of all others, that do the most <hi>need</hi> and <hi>presse</hi> for <hi>Relaxation,</hi> and <hi>Mercy, Themselves,</hi> not to oppose it, in some degree to <hi>Others.</hi> And it is another Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we are <hi>Fellow-subjects</hi> and Members of the <hi>same Community;</hi> for <hi>all Dissenters</hi> from the <hi>Rule</hi> are equally liable to a <hi>Cheque</hi> from the <hi>Government,</hi> and ly under the <hi>Same Ty,</hi> of <hi>Conformity,</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> It does not belong to me Sir, to speculate upon <hi>Political Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediences,</hi> one way or another; I could otherwise tell you how much we are <hi>Underpeopl'd</hi> already, and the <hi>greater</hi> the <hi>Depopulation</hi> the <hi>Deader,</hi> upon Necessity, must be our <hi>Trade;</hi> the Circulation of <hi>Money</hi> must be <hi>Lesse;</hi> our <hi>Lands fall,</hi> our <hi>Commodityes</hi> ly upon our <hi>Hands,</hi> and our <hi>Taxes</hi> still run <hi>higher:</hi> and Consequently, the lesse able shall we be dayly, to defend our selves, in case of a <hi>Foreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion:</hi> For 'tis a Foolery to talk of any more <hi>Holy Wars,</hi> the Hot Fit of that <hi>Unwarrantable</hi> and <hi>Romantique Zeal</hi> is long since over, and out of the world; and the Bone of <hi>Contention</hi> among Princes, is <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> not <hi>Religion.</hi> If I have sayd any thing here contrary to <hi>Law, Conscience,</hi> or <hi>Humanity,</hi> I shall submit my self to a Fayr Tryall for't: But if I keep my self within the Terms of <hi>Christianity, Humanity,</hi> and <hi>Civill respect</hi> to my <hi>Superiours,</hi> I do but discharge the part of an <hi>Honest man,</hi> and a <hi>good Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here's more work Sir, for <hi>B. W.</hi> to ground an action of <hi>Popery</hi> upon; and you have a sure Card at a Dead Lift, when he stands at Your Elbow, to help you out with an <hi>Enformation.</hi> But see Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, how far, (and no farther) I approve my self in This Paper to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48393:15"/>
an <hi>Advocate</hi> for the <hi>Papists;</hi> and that is to say, just so far as I am an <hi>Advocate</hi> for <hi>Fanatiques;</hi> I wish, with my Heart, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were Clear of <hi>all Plotters</hi> on <hi>Bothsides;</hi> and that the <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Honest Mixture</hi> in <hi>Both Partyes</hi> might have as much <hi>Ease,</hi> as may stand with the <hi>Security</hi> of the State. Now having thus equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my Kindnesse; it shall be <hi>Cross,</hi> or <hi>Pile</hi> (if you please, Doctor,) whether <hi>I</hi> am a <hi>Papist,</hi> or a <hi>Fanatique, I</hi> must confess, <hi>I</hi> abhor the Thought, of <hi>Christians</hi> worrying one another, worse than <hi>Wolves;</hi> and This, as well on the <hi>One</hi> side, as on the <hi>Other.</hi> But where People of <hi>Either Perswasion,</hi> will be <hi>Vexatiously,</hi> and <hi>Pragmatically Troublesome</hi> to the <hi>Publique Peace,</hi> it is but Reason they should suffer for't. But then there are several ways of <hi>Approach,</hi> or <hi>Advance</hi> toward the <hi>same End; Seditious Positions</hi> are every jot as <hi>Ill,</hi> as <hi>Seditious Actions,</hi> but much <hi>meaner:</hi> For the <hi>One</hi> is the <hi>Authorizing</hi> of a <hi>Villany,</hi> as the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is the <hi>Executing</hi> of it. There is something of <hi>Bravery</hi> in him that <hi>Attempts</hi> it; but the <hi>Setter on,</hi> is a <hi>Scandall,</hi> even to <hi>his own Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>I</hi> have now Competently explain'd my self concerning the <hi>Plot, Popery,</hi> and <hi>Papists.</hi> For the First, <hi>I</hi> have a perfect <hi>Abhorrence;</hi> and no sort of <hi>Kindnesse</hi> for the <hi>Other Two,</hi> as <hi>Such.</hi> And yet as <hi>Papists</hi> are <hi>Christians,</hi> (and <hi>I</hi> my self one) <hi>I</hi> cannot but have a <hi>Conscientious respect,</hi> in Common for <hi>all the members of That Profession.</hi> Beside that as they are <hi>men</hi> too, there are Indispensable Offices of <hi>Humanity</hi> due from <hi>One man</hi> to <hi>Another;</hi> and then there are Certain Considerations of <hi>Alliances, Acquaintances,</hi> and <hi>Society,</hi> which we cannot wholly divest our selves of, without a violence to the very Instincts of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Nature,</hi> and degenerating into <hi>Beasts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to the poynt of <hi>Popery,</hi> so far as it is made use of as a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall Engine</hi> to loosen <hi>Societyes,</hi> and to Authorize <hi>Disobedience; I</hi> look upon it as a Plot upon the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> in That way of applying it: As the <hi>Disciplinarian Presbytery;</hi> (on the <hi>Other</hi> hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) which is the very <hi>Counter-part</hi> of it. But taking it <hi>nakedly,</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractedly</hi> as a <hi>Particular Scheme</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> without any relation to <hi>Temporall</hi> matters; my being of <hi>Another Opinion</hi> will not hinder me yet from having the <hi>Same Charity</hi> for <hi>Another man</hi> in that which appears <hi>Erroneous</hi> to <hi>me,</hi> which, in a thousand Cases, <hi>I</hi> my self may stand in need of from <hi>Others.</hi> And This Softnesse has something in it of <hi>Complexion,</hi> as well as <hi>Iudgment. I</hi> cannot endure to see Children tormenting of poor <hi>Birds</hi> and spitting of <hi>Flyes:</hi> And it has cost me many a Six pence, the redeeming of <hi>Puppyes,</hi> and <hi>Kitlins</hi> from the <hi>Cruelty</hi> of <hi>Boys</hi> in the Streets, that were Tearing them to pieces.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48393:16"/>
And This, Doctor, may be done, I hope, without being of <hi>Pusses,</hi> or <hi>Ringwoods Religion.</hi> But here's more pains taken then needs, to gratify <hi>Iohn a Nokes,</hi> and <hi>Iohn a Stiles;</hi> for my Adversaryes have yet This Modesty in them, that they are asham'd both of their <hi>Names,</hi> and <hi>Faces.</hi> These <hi>Lihellers</hi> follow the Example of their <hi>Fellow Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers;</hi> they ly in wait for the <hi>Innocent;</hi> and it is the work of the <hi>One</hi> to <hi>Godfrey Honest men</hi> out of their <hi>Reputation,</hi> as the Other did that worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> out of his <hi>Life.</hi> But It shall suffice that my <hi>Conscience</hi> as well as <hi>my Acquaintances,</hi> will acquit me in the matter of <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Rites,</hi> as well as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which I have ever asserted, both with my <hi>Pen,</hi> and <hi>Practice;</hi> and fully answer'd all the <hi>Tests</hi> of my <hi>Profession,</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> requires.</p>
            <p>It will be cast in my Dish, I know, that This pretended <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> toward <hi>Dissenters</hi> is only introduced in favour of a <hi>Common Indulgence,</hi> wherein the <hi>Papists</hi> may come in for a <hi>share;</hi> and wholly <hi>Inconsistent</hi> with the <hi>Rigour</hi> I have promoted in all my Writings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> But I must desire you, Doctor, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that <hi>I</hi> never opposed the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Thought</hi> in <hi>Disagreeing Perswasions;</hi> for 'tis impossible to bring all men to the same appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of the same thing. But my business has been always, in This Case, to lay open the danger of permitting a <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> which must of Necessity dissolve the <hi>Order,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Government:</hi> For it is (effectually) a <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> from the <hi>Magistracy</hi> to the <hi>People;</hi> and a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> and <hi>Intent</hi> of <hi>Laws;</hi> when the <hi>Rule</hi> prescribes to us the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>This,</hi> or <hi>That,</hi> and the <hi>License,</hi> on the <hi>Other</hi> side, says we may do what we please.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>I</hi> have wip'd off all these <hi>Aspersious,</hi> of favouring either <hi>Plot, Popery,</hi> or <hi>Papists;</hi> or of so much as <hi>Implying</hi> any <hi>Iniquity</hi> in the proceedings of the <hi>Government:</hi> (nay, <hi>I</hi> have, on the Contrary, asserted the <hi>Iustice</hi> of it, in This matter;) It only rests, that <hi>I</hi> purge my self in the point of a becoming Resignation, and Respect to the <hi>Kings Witnesses;</hi> which is the hardest thing in the world to do, because there appears no <hi>Foundation</hi> for the <hi>Charge;</hi> and how shall a man prove, or make <hi>any thing</hi> out of <hi>Nothing?</hi> at least, if O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people can, <hi>I</hi> must confess that <hi>I</hi> have not yet the Faculty of doing it. But since there is no substantial <hi>Ground</hi> for <hi>This Charge,</hi> Pray'e Doctor do but cast your Eye upon the <hi>Pretence.</hi> I give you the Character of a <hi>Loyal, Orthodox man,</hi> a <hi>Lover</hi> of your <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48393:16"/>
and a <hi>Master</hi> of your <hi>Pen;</hi> I tell the Government, out of your own Mouth, where they shall finde the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuites;</hi> so that 'tis but pursuing the way that you have chalkt out, for the <hi>Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> of them. I magnisie your <hi>Discoveries. I</hi> set a just value upon your <hi>Performances, I</hi> prophesy that you will be <hi>famous</hi> to <hi>Posterity;</hi> and that the <hi>great things</hi> you have <hi>already</hi> done will be follow'd with <hi>greater.</hi> How comes it now that those Expressions which would be <hi>Panegyricks</hi> from <hi>another</hi> man, should be <hi>Libels</hi> from me? Or how can any man call it a <hi>Scandall,</hi> to speak well of him that endeavours to support the <hi>Government,</hi> without implying it to be matter of Reputation to designe the <hi>Overturning</hi> of it? And how again comes B. W. to lug into his <hi>Title-Page,</hi> by head and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, a <hi>Vindication</hi> also of the <hi>Rest of the Kings Evidences,</hi> without any Hint, or Mention, in the Book he pretends to answer, of any other but your self? The Mystery is this. There are a sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that will call a man a <hi>Defamer of the Kings Evidence,</hi> not as a <hi>Charge,</hi> but 'tis a kinde of giving the <hi>word</hi> to the <hi>Rabble.</hi> As we cry <hi>he sweats,</hi> to a <hi>Dog</hi> when we would have him take a man by the <hi>Collar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as the <hi>Offence</hi> ought to be <hi>punish'd,</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> hand, so the <hi>Scandal</hi> methinks should not go <hi>Free,</hi> on the <hi>Other:</hi> and it were well if <hi>both Parts</hi> were <hi>agreed,</hi> First, upon the <hi>Force,</hi> and <hi>Intend <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nt</hi> of That which is called the <hi>Kings Evidence;</hi> and <hi>Secondly,</hi> what it is, to <hi>defame</hi> it. Every body knows, what it is to <hi>swear</hi> for the <hi>King;</hi> and that the Witnesse must be <hi>Famae Integrae,</hi> and <hi>Probus.</hi> But now how far That Qualification extends, will be the Question. He that gives <hi>Evidence</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> is no further the <hi>Kings Witnesse,</hi> then for so much as concerns the <hi>subject matter</hi> of his <hi>Testimony;</hi> though there are some, I know, that will have the <hi>WHOLE MAN</hi> to be <hi>swallow'd up,</hi> in a manner, and <hi>Transubstantiated</hi> into the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> as, if every <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> (for the purpose) of <hi>L'Estrange</hi> were to be reputed as the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Kings Witnesse:</hi> (supposing <hi>Him</hi> so to <hi>be;</hi>) And that nothing could be spoken of him in <hi>One Capacity,</hi> without affecting him in the <hi>Other.</hi> Now under favour, Sir, This would be so dangerous a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,</hi> that upon the Admittance of it, there would be no longer any Security either for <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>I Pople.</hi> For if my speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that is <hi>False</hi> of one of my <hi>Fellow Subjects,</hi> should invalidate the <hi>True Evidence</hi> I have given for his <hi>Majesty;</hi> what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of our <hi>Sovereign?</hi> And again, if my being an <hi>Evidence</hi> for the <hi>King,</hi> should entitle me to a <hi>priviledge</hi> of <hi>Abusing</hi> and <hi>Scandalizing</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48393:17"/>
other men at pleasure; what becomes then of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi> So that though This Qualification gives me more <hi>Credit,</hi> and <hi>Esteem</hi> in the world, according to the weight of the Cause in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it gives me no more <hi>Power</hi> yet, or <hi>Advantage,</hi> over my <hi>Fellow-Subjects,</hi> in Other cases, then <hi>I</hi> had before. Yours (<hi>I</hi> must Confess, Doctor,) is very Particular, in regard of the Important Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that depend upon it: And yet This does not hinder, but that the same Rule holds good throughout.</p>
            <p>As for example Sir; supposing me now to be one of the <hi>Kings Witnesses,</hi> would This Character Authorize <hi>me</hi> to place the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> in the <hi>People;</hi> to say that the <hi>King</hi> is only as <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Peers,</hi> and that the <hi>House of Commons</hi> made him what he is; To give out, how I'le Order the matter of the <hi>Succession;</hi> and what course I'le take with the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> when the <hi>Parliament</hi> meets? to represent <hi>his Majesty</hi> to be <hi>Popishly Affected;</hi> (though a <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire</hi> by the <hi>Statute;</hi>) to Garble the <hi>Bench</hi> as <hi>I</hi> please; and to say who shall <hi>Out,</hi> or who <hi>Continue;</hi> to call <hi>Princes, Traytors,</hi> and <hi>Canary-Birds;</hi> To pronounce upon <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi> man; and say <hi>which Officer</hi> shall <hi>stand,</hi> and <hi>which, Fall;</hi> whose <hi>Offices</hi> I'le <hi>shake,</hi> and what <hi>Lawn-steeves</hi> I'le <hi>Ruffle;</hi> to Inveigh against the <hi>Bishops,</hi> as <hi>Popish;</hi> with their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Christian Holy-days?</hi> to say <hi>I'le be the Death of this man;</hi> or <hi>I'le have the Bloud of t'other,</hi> as the Toy takes me in the Crown: And all This, as if my being the <hi>Kings Evidence</hi> had made me <hi>Controller</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> and Subjected the <hi>Lives, Libertyes,</hi> and <hi>Reputations</hi> of <hi>his Majestyes good Subjects to my Arbitration? These are Excesses</hi> that a man cannot well-suppose: But however, This may suffice to shew that <hi>all things</hi> are not <hi>allowable,</hi> even to the <hi>Kings Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But still as the <hi>Witnesses</hi> are Limited, the <hi>One</hi> way; by the Rules of <hi>Good Manners,</hi> and <hi>Law.</hi> So it is not sit for people to make <hi>Sport</hi> with them the <hi>Other;</hi> and (as B.

in a Compliment to your <hi>Testimony?</hi> You tell People that I was a <hi>Common Fidler</hi> to <hi>Oliver,</hi> which allmost half the Nation knows to be <hi>False;</hi> And from this Instance, you would infer my Truck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to that <hi>Usurper.</hi> You do not imagine that I will yield my self to be a <hi>Rascall</hi> now, for fear of disobliging any man by a <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> I do here affirm to you, Doctor, that I never took <hi>Oath, Covenant,</hi> or any <hi>Engagement</hi> whatsoever, from that <hi>Party;</hi> or in any sort whatsoever <hi>comply'd</hi> with them. Do but you prove the Contrary, and I'le allow my self to be all the <hi>Rascalls</hi> you call me. Nay, it is publiquely known, that when I lay in <hi>Newgate,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to be <hi>Hang'd</hi> for serving his Majesty, I had the <hi>Intercessions</hi> offer'd me of very <hi>Powerfull Men</hi> in the <hi>Party,</hi> if I would take the <hi>Covenant,</hi> to endeavour to bring me off, and I refused it. And, <hi>in fine,</hi> since I am forc'd upon't, I shall here annex <hi>Three Papers</hi> out of <hi>Twenty</hi> at least, upon the same Occasion, which I publish'd upon that bloudy <hi>Crisis</hi> in 1659. here in the Town, (and honest <hi>Harry Brome</hi> got them <hi>Printed</hi> too, to his very great Hazzard) when I do assure you Doctor, I did not write for Bread.</p>
            <p>You may perhaps take me to be a little Bolder in This Freedom, then becomes me; but truly I did not think it safe to discourse this matter to you by word of mouth, for fear of enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming you further: And to deal Freely with you, Sir, I had not gone thus far neither, if you had not most injuriously broken in upon my <hi>Family,</hi> in a more Tender point: A Nicety, that I must <hi>entreat you not to proceed any further upon, without advice of</hi> Counsell.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Personal Unkindnesse</hi> of yours shall not at all lessen the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem</hi> I have for you as you are the <hi>Kings Evidence:</hi> I shall go on ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Reputation of your Services, celebrating the good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices you have rendred the <hi>Church</hi> as well as the <hi>State,</hi> in your plain-dealing with <hi>Fanatiques</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> alike. But yet I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, Doctor, that you are a little too easie of <hi>Belief:</hi> 'Tis a <hi>great wrong</hi> to <hi>mee,</hi> and a <hi>greater</hi> yet to your <hi>self,</hi> This way of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king things upon <hi>Trust;</hi> For <hi>Truth</hi> should be as <hi>Sacred</hi> in a <hi>Word,</hi> as in an <hi>Oath.</hi> I have at This Instant before my Eyes all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences that can possibly arise from This way of Exposing my <hi>Vindication. First,</hi> I know that you are apt enough to take Fire of your self, Sir, and that you do not want Malevolent Spirits nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to push you forward. I do know very well also your <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> with all the Ill Consequences that can attend it. I know likewise the <hi>Rancour</hi> of a Company of little <hi>Prostigate Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48393:18"/>
that will be forward enough to cover their <hi>Malice</hi> under your <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Protection;</hi> and in my Conscience (to give the men their due) will not stick out at any thing, to do my business: Fellows that will make no more of <hi>Kissing a Book,</hi> then of <hi>Kissing a Back-side.</hi> But Sir, I shall oppose my <hi>single Honesty</hi> to all these <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and value their <hi>Swearing,</hi> as little as I do their <hi>Lying,</hi> tho' I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that they are conferring Notes upon That point already. And remember what I tell you, Sir; if ever they come to <hi>Agree</hi> upon't, <hi>That Perjury</hi> will be found allmost the fairest part of their <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another sort of <hi>Malignants,</hi> that please themselves mightily in the Contemplation of having <hi>L'Estrange Run down,</hi> (as they call it) at the next meeting of <hi>Parliament. I</hi> shall take my time likewise to vindicate <hi>That Honourable Assembly</hi> from the Scandal of That Character which these People would give them in the world: As if we were now coming to be Govern'd by <hi>Ordinances</hi> again; and that <hi>Honest men,</hi> for discharging their <hi>Duties</hi> to their <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> were now a <hi>Second time</hi> to be <hi>Sacrific'd</hi> to a <hi>Faction.</hi> No, no Sir; <hi>I</hi> have no Apprehension of any hard measure from that <hi>Illustrious Assembly,</hi> to the degree of Oppressing me <hi>Contrary to Law;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> have as little Apprehension from the Dint of any <hi>Known Law</hi> that <hi>I</hi> have <hi>Transgrest.</hi>

            <p>Give me your favour, Doctor, but for One word more. My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of the <hi>Plot,</hi> under certain <hi>Restrictions,</hi> and <hi>Qualifications,</hi> is by <hi>B.

What do you think, Sir, of the quality of those <hi>Inflaming Papers</hi> that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht in the <hi>Witnesses Names,</hi> and yet are only the <hi>Contrivances</hi> of a <hi>Knot of Booksellers,</hi> for their own Advantage? <hi>Papers</hi> of manifest <hi>Scandal</hi> against the <hi>Royall Family;</hi> some of the <hi>Loyall Protestant Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> and in Generall, against his Majesties most <hi>Faithfull Subjects?

            </opener>
            <p>WE have waited for the good you have promised us; with a ridiculous Patience: but we find you Men of the <hi>Originall,</hi> and to be <hi>read backward. We</hi> are for the Religion of the <hi>Heart,</hi> not that of the <hi>Nose;</hi> and for the <hi>Law of</hi> the <hi>Land, not that of the Sword;</hi> we are likewise for the <hi>Charter</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> and for the <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Free-born Englishmen;</hi> with which we are resolv'd to Stand and Fall. It is high time for us to look to our selves, when we are coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Guard of your Chusing, and when we have only this Choice left us, whether we will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Adventure</hi> to <hi>destroy You to Day,</hi> or <hi>be sure to be destroyed our Selves to Morrow.</hi> That's the short of the Case; for, a <hi>Massacre</hi> is not only the <hi>Design,</hi> but the <hi>Profession</hi> of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48393:19"/>
you have Arm'd against us; 'tis their very Exchange-talk at noon day; But the work will be either too hot, or too heavy: for my Masters, we are determined to suffer these affronts no longer, we are now come to understand one another, <hi>The Ruine of the Nation is Your Interest, the Peace and Preservation of it, Ours,</hi> and the mischief of it is, your destruction is as <hi>Easie,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Necessary:</hi> for every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which either Loves <hi>God,</hi> or his <hi>Countrey, Hates</hi> You. You have not so few as 200000 Enemies in This Town, to dispute the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with some half a dozen of you; not to multiply words, your <hi>Practices</hi> are such as a <hi>Generous</hi> Nature cannot <hi>Brook,</hi> and your <hi>Power</hi> so <hi>despicable,</hi> that a <hi>Coward</hi> needs not <hi>Fear</hi> it. You have made the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but a Cage of Broken Merchants; Tradesmen are ready to Perish for want of Businesse; and their Families for want of Bread; nor have the Poor any other Employment than to Curse you. Those few amongst you that have any thing, are but Cover'd with the Spoiles of the Nation, and out of the Scum of the People you have composed your inconsiderable Rest. Well Gentlemen, play your own Cards your selves, Wee'll play Ours: you'll have no Single Person in the <hi>State,</hi> wee'll have none neither in the <hi>City;</hi> at least, we'll have no <hi>White-Hall-Major;</hi> we will neither extend our Priviledges an Inch, nor abate an Hair of them. And in the matter of Blood-shed, so let Heaven prosper Us, as we shall proceed tenderly: But if there be no other way left us than violence whereby to preserve our selves in our Just Rights, what Power soever shall presume to Invade the Priviledge of a Citizen, shall finde 20000 Brave Fellows in the Head on't.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This we do Unanimously Remonstrate to You, and to the World, to be our Firm, and Finall Resolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After This, the Citizens presented a <hi>Petition</hi> to the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> pressing for a <hi>Free Parliament:</hi> But they were put off for the present, and upon <hi>Munday, December</hi> 5. 1659. <hi>Horse and Foot</hi> were dispatch'd into the <hi>City,</hi> by violence, to hinder the Re-inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Petition.</hi> But there was a great number of brave young Fellows that opposed them: And if the <hi>Factious Magistracy</hi> (at That time) had not by a <hi>Wile,</hi> perswaded them Home again, the Work had certainly been done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Bout. Upon This, after five or six days expectation what this affront would produce, I Printed this following Paper, to quicken them; Entitled,</p>

            <p>ALthough, as <hi>Citizens</hi> we are <hi>reduced</hi> to a <hi>Necessity</hi> of Violence; and as <hi>Christians,</hi> obliged to the <hi>Exercise</hi> of it; Unlesse we will rather prostitute our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Libertyes, Fortunes</hi> and <hi>Reputations;</hi> Nay our very <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Altars,</hi> to the Lusts of a <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious</hi> Enemy: We have yet so great a tendernesse for Christian bloud, as to leave unattempted no means of probability to save it. This is it which hath prevayl'd with us to Declare, First to the World, what we <hi>Propose,</hi> and <hi>Resolve,</hi> ere we proceed to further Extremities: and to <hi>satisfie</hi> the <hi>Publique,</hi> as well in the <hi>Reasons</hi> of our Undertakings, as to <hi>Iustifie</hi> our <hi>selves,</hi> in the <hi>Menage</hi> and <hi>Event</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>We find, in the Middest of us, <hi>the House of Prayer converted into a Den of Theeves:</hi> Our <hi>Counsels</hi> Affronted by Armed <hi>Troups,</hi> our <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens knock'd on the head, like Dogs,</hi> at their own doors, for not so much as <hi>Barking:</hi> Nay, 'tis become Death, now to desire to Live; and Adjudg'd Treason, but to Claim the benefit of the Law against it. Witnesse those <hi>Infamous Murthers</hi> committed but Monday last, upon our <hi>uuarm'd friends:</hi> and the glorious <hi>Insolencies</hi> of that <hi>Rabble,</hi> towards such of the rest, as they seized, and carried away. But this is nothing: to make us a Compleat <hi>Sacrisice,</hi> we are to be <hi>Burnt</hi> too: a thing not only <hi>threatned,</hi> in the Passion of the Tumult, but soberly <hi>intended;</hi> for they have layd in their Materials for the work alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: (a <hi>prodigious Quantity of Fire-Balls in Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Gresham College</hi>) Briefly, We are design'd for <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> and <hi>Pillage:</hi> and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us now, to look a little better to our <hi>gracious Guards.</hi> (Not to insist upon the losse of Trade; how many thousand Families have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now to do, but <hi>Beg,</hi> and <hi>Curse</hi> these wretches?) The <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> lyes at stake: and God so blesse us, as we'll fall together. We will not live to see our Wives, and Daughters ravish'd: our Houses Rifled, and our Children Beggers, that shall only live to Reproach their cowardly Fathers: and all this done too by a People, which we can as <hi>easily destroy,</hi> as <hi>mention:</hi> by a Party, so <hi>Barbarous,</hi> and so <hi>Inconsiderable together,</hi> that, certainly, no creature can be <hi>mean</hi> enough, either to <hi>suffer</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>fear</hi> the <hi>other.</hi> In this Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of Affairs, we have found it both our <hi>Duty</hi> and our <hi>Interests</hi> to

               <hi>Associate;</hi> and we desire a Blessing from Heaven upon us, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than as we do <hi>vigorously,</hi> and <hi>faithfully</hi> pursue what we here Remonstrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First; We do engage our selves, in the presence of Almighty God, with our lives and fortunes, to defend the Rights and Liberties of the City of</hi> LONDON; <hi>and if any person that subscribes to this Engagement, shall be molested for so doing; We will unanimously, and without delay, appear as one Man to his Rescue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next; we demand, that all such <hi>Troups</hi> and <hi>Companies,</hi> as do not properly belong to the <hi>Guard</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> nor receive <hi>Orders</hi> from the <hi>lawfull Magistrates thereof:</hi>—that such Forces <hi>withdraw</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Liberties, within 12. hours after the Publication of This: upon pain of being deemed <hi>Conspirators,</hi> and <hi>of being Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against accordingly,</hi> (for to this extent, both of Judgment, and Execution, is every Individual qualified in his own defence.)</p>
            <p>We are next, to demand the Enlargement of our Fellow Citizens, which were taken away by Force, and in a tumultuous manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the known Laws of the Place, and Nation.</p>
            <p>This being performed, we shall acquiesce, in the Enjoyment of those Liberties, which we will not lose but with our Lives. In Fine, to remove all Impediments of the peace we desire: We do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, both as Men of Credit, and Justice; that such of the Souldiers as will betake themselves to honester Employments, shall receive their Arrears from the City, and such a further care of their future well-being, as is sutable to the Necessitys of the One part, and the Charity of the Other.</p>
