         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ister Elizabeth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth more help effectuallye to get a good and a vertuous lyfe. Then if a soule when it is dull and vnlustie without deuotion, neyther disposed to prayer, nor to any other good worke, may be sturred or quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned agayne by fruiteful meditacion. I haue therfore deuised vnto you this meditation that followeth. Praying you for my sake and for the weale of your owne soule, to reade it at suche tymes as you shall feele your selfe most heauie and slouthfull to doe any good worke. It is a maner of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion and sorowfull complaynyng made in the person of one that was hastily preuented by death, (as I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you euery creature may be) none other suretie we haue, liuing in this
<pb facs="tcp:10251:3"/>
worlde héere. But if you will haue any profite by reading of it, thrée things you must do in any wise. First when you shall reade this meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deuise in your mynde as nigh as you can, all the conditions of a man or woman sodaynlye taken and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyshed by death: and thynke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wyth your selfe that yée were in the same condition so hastily taken, and that incontinent you must néedes dye, and your soule depart hence, &amp; leaue your mortall bodie, neuer to returne again for to make any amendes, or to doe any release to your soule after this houre.</p>
            <p>Seconly, that yée neuer reade thys meditation but alone by your selfe in secrete maner, where you maye be most attentyue therevnto. And when ye haue the best leasure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let of other thoughtes or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinesse. For if you otherwyse behaue your selfe in the reading of it, it shall anon lose the vertue and quicknesse in stirring and mouing of your soule when you woulde ratherest haue it sturred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10251:3"/>Thirdly, that when you intende to read it, you must afore lifte vp your minde to almightie God, and beséech him that by the helpe and succour of his grace the readyng thereof may fruitfully worke in your soule a good and vertuous life, according to hys pleasure and say, <hi>Deus in adiutorium meum intende, Domine adiuvandum me festina. Gloria patri. &amp;c. Laus tibi domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne rex eternae glorie. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas, alas, I am vnworthily take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, all sodaynly death hath assayled me, the paynes of his stroake be so sore and gréeuous that I may not longe endure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, my last home I perceiue well is come. I must now leaue thys mortall bodie, I must nowe departe hence out of this world neuer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe into it. But whether I shall goe, or where I shall become, or what lodgyng I shall haue thys night, or in what company I shal fal, or in what countrey I shall be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or in what maner I shall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, God knoweth for I knowe not. What if I shall be dampned in the perpetuall pryso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hell, where be
<pb facs="tcp:10251:4"/>
paynes endelesse and without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Gréeuous it shall be to them that be dampned for euer, for they shall be as men in moste extreame paynes of death, euer wishing and desiryng death, and yet neuer shall they dye. It should be nowe vnto mée muche wearie, one yeare continually to lye vpon a bed were it neuer so soft, how weary then shall it be to lye in the most painefull fyre so many thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of yeares without number? And to be in that most horrible company of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils most terrible to beholde, full of malice and crueltie. O wretched and miserable creature y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am, I might so haue liued and so ordered my lyfe by the helpe and grace of my Lorde Christ Iesu, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this houre might haue bene vnto mée much ioyous &amp; greatly desired. Many blessed &amp; holy Sayncts were full ioyous and desirous of this houre, for they knewe well that by death their soules shuld be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated into a new life: To the life of all ioye and endlesse pleasure, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> streightes and bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage of this corruptible body, into a very libertie and true fréedom
<pb facs="tcp:10251:4"/>
mong the company of heauen, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the miseries &amp; gréeua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of this wretched world, to be aboue with God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort inestimable y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can not be spoken ne thought. They were assured of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promises of almightie god which had so promised to all them that bée hys faithfull seruauntes. And sure I am that if I had truly &amp; faithfully serued him vnto thys houre, my soule had bene partner of these promises. But vnhappie &amp; vngracious creature that I am, I haue bene negligent in hys seruice, and therefore now my harte doeth waste in sorowes séeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of death, and considering my great slouth &amp; negligence. I thought full little thus sodainly to haue bene trapped: But (alas) now death hath preuented me, and hath vnwarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached mée, &amp; sodainly oppressed mée with his mightie power, so that I know not whither I may turne mee for succour, nor where I may séeke now for helpe, ne what thing I may doe to get any remedy: If I myght haue leasure and space to repent mée and amende my lyfe, not compelled
<pb facs="tcp:10251:5"/>
with this sodayne stroake but of my owne frée will and libertie, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the loue of God, putting asyde all slouth &amp; negligence. I might then safely dye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any dread, I might then be glad to departe hence and leaue my manifold miseries &amp; encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of this world. But how may I think that my repentance or mine amendement commeth now of myne own frée will, sith I was before thys stroake so colde and dull in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of my Lord God. Or howe may I thinke that I doe this more rather for his loue, then for feare of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshement, when if I had truelye loued hym, I should more quickely and more diligently haue serued him héeretofore? Mée séemeth now that I caste away my slouth and negly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence compelled by force. Euen as a Merchaunt that is compelled by a greate tempest in the sea to cast his merchandice out of the Shippe, it is not to bée supposed that hée would cast away his ryches of hys owne frée will, not compelled by the storme? And euen so lykewyse doe I if thys tempeste of death were
<pb facs="tcp:10251:5"/>
not now raysed vppon mée, it is full like that I would not haue cast from me my slouth and negligence. O woulde to God that I might nowe haue some farther respet, and some longer tyme to amend my self of my frée will and libertie. O if I might entreat death to spare me for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but that will not bée, death in no wise will be entreated, delay he will none take, respet he will none giue, if I would giue him all the ryches of this worlde, no if all my louers and friends would fall vppon their knées and pray him for mée. No if I &amp; they would wéepe (if it wer so possible) as many teares as there be in the seas droppes of water, no pietie may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine him. (Alas) when oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of tyme was, I would not vse it well, which if I had done, it would nowe bée vnto mée more precyous then all the treasures of a Realme. For then my soule as nowe should haue béene cloathed wyth good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes innumerable, the which shuld make mée not to be ashamed when I should come to the presence of my
<pb facs="tcp:10251:6"/>
Lorde God, where now I shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare loaden with sinne myserably, to my confusion &amp; shame. But (alas) to negligently haue I letted passe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me my tyme not regardyng howe precious it was, ne yet howe muche spirituall riches I might haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therein, if I would haue put my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and studie thervnto. For assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly no déede that is be it neuer so little, but it shall be rewarded of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. One draught of water giuen for the loue of God, shal not be vnrewarded: And what is more easie to be giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> water. But not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly déedes, but also the least wordes and thoughtes shall be in likewise. O how many good thoughtes, déeds, and workes might one thinke, speak, and doe, in one day? But how many more in one whole yere. O (alas) my great negligence, O (alas) my foule blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, O (alas) my sinfull madnesse that knew this well, and would not put it in effectuall executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. O if now all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of this world were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent héere to sée &amp; know the perillous condition that I am in, &amp; howe I am
<pb facs="tcp:10251:6"/>
preuented by the stroake of death, I would exhort to take me as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to them all, &amp; while they haue leasure and time to order their liues and caste from them slouth and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; to repent them of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behauior towardes God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle their offences, to multiplye good workes, and to let no tyme passe by them vnfruitfully. For if it shall please my Lorde God that I might any longer liue, I would otherwyse exercise my self then I haue done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now I wishe that I may haue time and space, but rightuously I am denyed. For when I might haue had it I would not well vse it: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now when I would well vse it, I shall not haue it. O ye therefore that haue and may vse this precyous tyme in your libertie, imploy it wel, and be not to wastfull thereof, least peraduenture when you would haue it, it shall be denyed you likewise, as now it is to mée. But now I repent me full sore of my great negligence, and right much I sorow that so little I regarded the wealth &amp; profit of my
<pb facs="tcp:10251:7"/>
soule, but rather tooke héede to the vayne comfortes and pleasures of my wretched bodie. O corruptible bodie, O stinking carion, O rotten earth to whom I haue serued, whose appetites I haue followed, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire I haue procured, now doest thou appeare what thou arte in thy own likenesse. That brightnesse of thy eyes, that quicknesse in hearing, that lyuelinesse in thy other sences by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall warmenesse, thy swiftnesse and nimblenesse, thy fayrenesse and bewtie. All these thou hast not of thy self, they were but lent vnto thée for a season, euen as a wall of earth that is fayre painted without for a season with freshe and goodly colours, and also gylted with golde, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth goodly for the tyme to suche as consider no déeper then the outward crafte thereof. But when at the last the colour faileth, and the gilting fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth away, then appeareth it in hys owne lykenesse. For then the earth playnely sheweth it selfe. In lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise my wretched bodie for the time of youth it appeareth fresh and lustie,

Now thou wilt refuse me and leaue mée to the ieoperdie of
<pb facs="tcp:10251:10"/>
all this matter. O (alas) many yeares of deliberation suffice not before so great a Iudge to make answer which shall examyne me of euerie idle word that euer passed my mouth. O then howe many idle wordes, how many euill thoughtes, howe many déedes haue I to make answere for, &amp; such as we set but at lyght, full greatlye shall be weyed in the presence of hys most high maiestie. O (alas) what may I doe to get some helpe at thys most daungerous houre? Wher may I séeke for succour? Where may I resorte for any comforte? My body forsaketh me, my pleasures be vany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed away as the smoke, my goods will not goe wyth mée. All these worldly things I must leaue behinde mée: if any comforte shall be, either it muste bee in the prayers of my friendes, or in myne own good déeds that I haue done before. But as for my good déedes that shoulde be auayleable in the sight of God: (alas) they bée fewe or none that I can thynke to bee auayleable, they must bee donne pryncipallye and purely
<pb facs="tcp:10251:10"/>
for his loue. But my déedes when of their kynde they were good, yet did I linger them by my folly. For eyther I did them for the pleasure of men, or to auoyde the shame of the world, or els for my owne affection, or els for dreade of punishment. So that seldome I dyd any good déed in that puritie and streaightnesse that it ought of ryght to haue bene done. And my misdéedes, my lewde déedes that be shamefull and abhominable be without number, not one day of all my lyfe, no not one houre I trow was so truely expended to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God, but many déeds, words, and thoughtes, miscaped me in my lyfe. (Alas) little trust then may I haue vppon my déedes. And as for the prayers of my friendes suche as I shall leaue behynde mée, of them manye peraduenture bée in the same néede that I am in. So that where theyr owne prayers myght profytte them selues, they can not so profitte an other. And many of them will bee full neglygente, and some forgetfull of mée. And
<pb facs="tcp:10251:11"/>
no meruaile, for who shoulde haue béene more friendly vnto mée then myne owne selfe. Therefore I that was most bounden to haue done for my selfe, forget my owne weale in my lyfe tyme, no meruaile therefore if other doo forget me after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hence. Other friendes there be by whose prayers soules may be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as by the blessed and holy saincts aboue in heauen, which verely will be myndfulll of such as in earth here haue deuoutly honored them before. But (alas) I had special deuotion but to a fewe, &amp; yet them I haue so faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honored, and to them so coldly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for fauour, that I am ashamed to aske ayde or helpe of them. At thys tyme in déede, I had more effectually ment to haue honored them, &amp; more diligently to haue commended my wretched soule vnto their prayers, and so to haue made them my special friendes: but nowe death hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented me so, that no other hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth but onely in the mercye of my Lord God, to whose mercy I doe now offer my self, beséeching him not
<pb facs="tcp:10251:11"/>
to looke vppon my desertes, but vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his infinite goodnesse and abundaunt pietie. (Alas) my dutie had bene much better to haue remembred this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble houre, I should haue had this dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger euer before my eyes, I shoulde haue prouided therefore, so that now I might haue bene in a more ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against the comming of death, which I knew assuredly would come at the last, albeit I knew not when, where, or by what maner, but well I knewe euery houre and moment, was to him indifferent, and in his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. And yet my madnesse euer to be sorowed. Notwithstanding thys vncertaintie of his comming, and the vncertaintie of the tyme thereof, I made no certayne nor sure prouision against this houre. Full often I tooke great studie and care to prouyde for litle dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, only bicause I thought they might hap, and yet happed they neuer a deale. And but tryfles they were in compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this, how much rather should I haue taken study and care for this so great a dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger which I knew wel must necessarily fall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:10251:12"/>
mée once. For thys can not be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chued in no wyse, and vppon thys I ought to haue made good prouision: For in this hangeth all our wealth, for if a man dye well, he shall after his death nothing want y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would desire, but his appetite shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate in euerie poynte at the full. And if he dye amisse, no prouysion shall auayle him that euer he made before. This prouision therefore is most effectually to bée studied, sithens this alone may profit without other, and without thys none can auayle. O yée that haue tyme and space to make your prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agaynst the houre of death, defarre not from day to day lyke as I haue done. For I often did thinke and purpose with my self that at some leasure I would haue prouided, neuerthelesse for euery try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felous buzinesse I put it aside, and delayed thys prouysion alway to an other tyme, and promysed with my selfe that at suche a tyme I would not fayle but doe it, but when that came an other buzinesse arose,
<pb facs="tcp:10251:12"/>
and so I deferred it agayne vnto an other tyme. And so (alas) from time to tyme, that now death in the mean tyme hath preuented mée, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was good, but it lacked executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: My will was strayghte, but it was not effectuall, my mynde well intended, but no fruite came therof. All for bicause I delayed so often and neuer put it in effect, that, that I had purposed. And therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it not as I haue done, but before all other buzinesse put this first in suertie, which oughte to bée chiéefe and princypall buzinesse. Neyther buildyng of Colleges, nor makyng of Sermons, nor giuing of almes, neyther yet anye other manner of buzynesse shall helpe you without this.</p>
            <p>Therefore first and before all things prepare for thys, delaye not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wyse, for if you doe, you shall be deceyued as I am now. I read of manye, I haue hearde of manye, I haue knowne many that were disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted as I am nowe. And euer I thought and sayde, &amp; intended, that
<pb facs="tcp:10251:13"/>
I would make sure and not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the sodayn comming of death. Yet neuerthelesse I am now decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and am taken sléeping, vnprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that when I least wéened of his comming, and euen when I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned my selfe to be in most healthe, and when I was most buzie, and in the middest of my matters. Therfore delaye not you any farther, nor put your trust ouer much in your friends: Trust your selfe while ye haue space and libertie, and doe for your self now while you may. I would aduyse you to doe that thing that I by the grace of my Lord God would put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if his pleasure were to sende me longer lyfe. Recounte your selfe as dead, &amp; thinke that your soules were in pryson of Purgatorie, &amp; that there they must abyde till that the Raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som for them be truly payde, eyther by long sufferance of payne there, or els by suffrages done héere in earth by some of your speciall friendes.

               <p>WHat lyfe is more paynefull and laborious of it self then is the life of Hunters which most early in the mornyng breake their sléepe and ryse when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe take their rest and ease, and in his labour he may vse no playne high wayes and the softe grasse, but he must treade vppon the fallowes, runne ouer the hedges, &amp; créepe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the thicke bushes, and crye all the long day vppon his dogges, and so continue without meate or drinke vntill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verie night dryue him home, these labours be vnto him pleasaunt and ioyous, for the desire &amp; loue that he hath to sée the poore Hare chased with dogges. Uerely, verely, if hée were compelled to take vppon hym
<pb facs="tcp:10251:15"/>
such labours, and not for thys cause he would soone be wearie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them full tedious vnto him: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he ryse out of his bed so soone, ne faste so longe, ne endure these other labours vnlesse he had a verie loue therin For the earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of his mynd is so fixed vppon his game, that all these payns be thought to him but verie pleasures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may well say that loue is the principall thyng that maketh anye worke easie, though the worke bée right painfull of it selfe, &amp; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loue no labour can be comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dooer. The loue of this game deliteth him so muche that he careth for no worldlye honour, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with full simple and homely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray. Also the goodes of the world hée séeketh not for, nor studieth howe to attayne them. For the loue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of his game so greatly occupyeth his mynde and harte. The pleasures also of his flesh he forgetteth by wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse and wasting of hys bodie in earnest labour. All his mynde, all his soule, is buzied to knowe where the
<pb facs="tcp:10251:16"/>
poore Hare may be founde. Of that is his thought, and of that is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and all his delight is to heare and speake of that matter, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie other matter but this, is tedious for him to giue eare vnto, in all other things he is dull and vnlustie, in this onely quicke and sturryng, for thys also to be done, there is no office so humble, ne so vyle, that he refuseth not to serue hys owne dogges hym selfe, to bathe theyr féete, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynte them where they be sore, yea and to clense their stinkyng Cannell where they shall lye and rest them. Surely if religious perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest a mynde and desire to the seruice of Christ, as haue these Hunters to sée a corse at a Hare, their lyfe should be vnto them a verie ioye and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. For what other be the paynes of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but these y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of. That is to say, much fasting, crying, and comming to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quire, forsakyng of worldly honours, worldly riches, and fleshly pleasures, and communication of the world, humble seruice, &amp; obedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his soueraigne, &amp; charytable
<pb facs="tcp:10251:16"/>
dealyng to his sister, which payns in euerie pointe, the Hunter taketh and sustayneth more largely for the loue that he hath to his game, then doeth many religious persons for the loue of Christ. For albeit, the relygious person ryseth at mydnight, which is painefull to hyr in verie déede, yet shée went before that to hyr bedde at a conuenyent houre, and also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth after to hyr bedde agayne. But the Hunter ryseth early, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth foorth all the long day, no more returning to his bed vntill the verie night, and yet peraduenture he was late vp the night before, and full ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp all the long nightes. And though the religious woman fall vntill it be noone, the which must be to hir payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter yet taketh more payn which fasteth vntill the verye night, forgetting both meate and drink for the pleasure of his game. The religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous woman singeth all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forenoone in the quier, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> also is laborious vnto hir, but yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hunter singeth not, but he cryeth, halloweth, &amp; shooteh all the long day, &amp; hath more greater pains.
<pb facs="tcp:10251:17"/>
The religious woman taketh much labour in comming to the quyer and sitting there so long a season, but yet no doubt of it more labour taketh the Hunter in running ouer the fallow and leaping ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hedges, &amp; créeping thorow the bushes then that can bée. And would to God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in other thyngs that is to say, touching worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, worldly ryches, worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, would to God that the relygi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s many of them might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite as much in myndfulnesse in sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Christ, as the Hunter doeth in séeking of his game, &amp; yet all theyr comforte were to common and speak of Christ, as the Hunters hath all their ioye to speake of the poore Hare, and of their huntyng. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, would to God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons would content them selues with the humble seruice done to their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, and with charitable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour vnto their sisters, and with as good a harte and mynde as the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters acquit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to serue their heu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. I wisse it is a thing much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to loue and serue reasonable
<pb facs="tcp:10251:17"/>
creatures made to the Image of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, rather then to loue and serue dogges which be vnreasonable creatures. And rather our dutie were to speake of Christ, and of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his honour, then of the vaine worldly matters which be but very trifles in déede. And also wyth more attentyue mynde we shoulde séeke after our sauiour Christ Iesu, to knowe our very comforte in him, wherein resteth the great merite of our soules. Then the Hunters should séeke after the Hare, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they haue no great gaines thereby. But as I sayde the cause why that so many religious persons so diligently pursue not the wayes of religion as doe the hunters, is the want of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obseruation of their game which is nothing els but the lack of loue. For verely as I thinke the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest loue and hartie desire of game maketh all labours and paynes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunte and ioyous vnto the Hunter. And if there were in religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as great fauour and loue to the seruice of God, as be in Hunters to
<pb facs="tcp:10251:18"/>
their game all their lyfe should bée a verie Paradise and heauenly ioye in this worlde. And contrariwise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this feruor of loue it can not bée but painfull, wearie, and tedious to them. My purpose therefore deare si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is to minister vnto you some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <head>The first consideration.</head>
               <p>THe first consideration may be this: First consider by your owne mynde and reason, that almightie God of his owne singular goodnesse &amp; frée will dyd create you and make you of naught, whervnto he was not bounde by any necessitie, nor drawen by any commoditie that might ryse vppon him by your crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

This good sister take for a very truth &amp; firmly beleue it, for so it
<pb facs="tcp:10251:18"/>
is in verye déede innumerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more then euer were made or euer shall be made, hee myght haue made if it had bene so pleasing vnto him. For how many suppose you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed men and maryed weomen haue bene and shall be héereafter in thys world, that neuer had ne neuer shall haue any children, yet they full glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would haue had, and by possibilitie of nature might haue had many, if it had so pleased almightie God to haue made and to haue giuen vnto them children. But all those be lefte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made, and amongest them he myght haue lefte you also vnmade, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue put his hande to the making of you, if he had so would. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse as I sayde it pleased his goodnes herein to prefer you of his special fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he bear vnto you, leauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made other moe innumerable, elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you, &amp; appointing you to be made refusing &amp; setting apart all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wold peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered his speciall grace &amp; fauour more louingly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you hitherto haue don.

seruice then euer you did, and you oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie the roome and place that some of them might haue occupyed by lyke fauour, as almightie God hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto you. Ah deare sister howe much should this one consideration moue you to the earnest loue of thys our so gracyous a Lorde, that thus hath appoynted and chosen you to bée his creature, before so many other where hée might haue, taken any of them at his pleasure, &amp; repelled you, and left you as naught, without any maner of being.</p>

               <head>The second consideration.</head>
               <p>THe second consideration is this, where there is manye maner of beings, some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue a goodly béeyng, some haue an vngoodly being. It is a more goodly beinge Margarite of a precious stone, then of a peble stone, of the fayre bright golde, then of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie yron, of a goodly Fesaund then of a venemous Serpent, of a prettie Faune then of a foule Toade, of a
<pb facs="tcp:10251:19"/>
reasonable soule, then of an vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable beast. And it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but almightie God might haue giuen to any of them, what being so euer he woulde, &amp; might haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed eche of those into the nature and kynde of any of the other at hys pleasure and will. For of the stones he might make men, as in the gospel our sauiour doeth affyrme, <hi>potens est deus de lapidibus istis suscitare filios Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he.</hi> Almightie God is of power to make of these stones the children of Abraham. And contrariwise he might of men haue made stones as the wife of Loth was turned into a salt stone. And in likewise me or you or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man or woman, he might haue made a stone, or a Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or a Toad, for his pleasure. There is no creature so foule, so horrible, or so vngoodlie, but he might put you in the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the most loathly of them be put in, and them, in contrariwise he might haue put in the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that you be in. Consider now by your reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if you had bene made in the lykenesse of an Owle, or of an
<pb facs="tcp:10251:20"/>
Ape, or of a Toade, howe deformed you shoulde haue bene, and in howe wretched &amp; myserable condition. And thank your Lord God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you a more excele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nature, yea, such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as excelleth in noblenesse, in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, all other bodilie natures: For it is made to the verie lykenesse and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of almightie God: wherevnto none other bodily creature doth reach néere.

               <p>THe fourth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration is this, that where sithens that tyme of your baptisme and that you were made a christian woman, you haue many tymes vnkindely faulne into deadly sinne, and broken hys lawes and commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, setting at naught all these benifites which he before had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to you following your wretched pleasures, to the great dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure and contempt of his moste

This may euidently be shewed vnto you by this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple folowing. If before any Image of our sauior were disposed &amp; set in a

But as to the likenesse it selfe it shall be as full and as whole in euerie one glasse as though there were but one. Now to my purpose, if you consider lykewise that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good soules that be scourged from deadly sinne, be in the maner of glasses set in an order to receiue the loue of our sauiour Christ Iesu. Such soules as by true pennaunce doing, by sighing, by wéeping, by praying, by watching by fasting, &amp; by other lyke, be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better scoured and clensed from the spottes and mallice of deadly sinne, they bée
<pb facs="tcp:10251:29"/>
the brighter glasses and more cléerly receyue this loue, &amp; such also be néere vnto our Sauior, for nothing putteth vs farre from him but onely sinne. And therefore they that haue more diligently scoured their soules from the rust of sinne, be néerer vnto him, then the other that so haue not done. Such soules also as of their parte en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them selues to a great loue and to a more ample feruor, they doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the capacitie of their soules, to receyue a more large abundaunce of loue agayne, those that lesse enforce them, haue a lesse capacitie in recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and therfore so much the lesse they receyue of this loue. Euen as a man that openeth his bosome wyde and enlargeth it, is more able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a greater thing into it, then hée that doeth not. But yet as I haue sayde before of the glasses, euery one of the soules receyue as full and as whole a loue of Iesu Christ, as though there were no moe soules in all the world but that one alone, for the loue of Christ Iesus infinite. And therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> innumerable of soules
<pb facs="tcp:10251:30"/>
haue euerie one of them receyued as much the loue of Christ Iesu, as to euerie one of them is possible, yet hath he still in him self loue suffitie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for infinite moe, &amp; this his loue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is not in any point diminished nor lessened, though it be deuided vnto many be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of them neuer so great.

doubtlesse is a merueylous booke, as wée shall shewe héereafter. In the which if wée doe exercise our admiration, wée shall come to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull knowledge. Meruayling was the cause, why that the Philosophers came to so greate knowledge, as they had. They behelde and sawe many wonderfull thynges, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes in thys worlde, as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous earthquakes, Thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, light<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nings, Snow, Rayne, &amp; Frostes, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinng Starres, the Eclipses of the Sunne and of the Moone, and suche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effectes. And those marueylous wonders moued them to search for the causes of the same. And so by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent searche and inquisition, they came to great knowledge and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which cunnyng men call Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie naturall. But there is an other higher Philosophie which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue nature, which is also gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with marueyling. And this is the verye Philosophie of Christian people. And doubtlesse amongest all other things concerning a christian man, it is a thyng muche marueylous, and most

wonderfull, that the sonne of God, for the loue that he had vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule of man, woulde suffer hym selfe to bée crucified, and so to take vpon him that most vyllanous death vpon the Crosse.<note place="margin">

            <p>Is it not a wonderfull thyng, that hée that is the Lorde of heauen and earth, and all other creatures,

Thys thought alway dyd run from hym selfe to Christ: And agayne, from Christ vnto hym selfe. And so euer he meruayled of the most exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent noblenesse of Christ, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it with hys owne naughty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, alwayes meruaylynge that Christ being of so incomparable wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynesse, woulde suffer that moste paynefull death for so vnworthye sinners, which lesson is so playne, and so common, that euerie man (be he neuer so simple,) may somewhat profite in it. And agayne, it is so hygh, that fewe can attayne to reach to the specyall fruite of it. This ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Sainct Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces so profited in this lesson, that it caused in hys hearte such a feruent loue, such a deuotion, suche an affection to Christ, that the capitall woundes which he behelde in the handes and féete, and syde of Christ, ware by myracle imprinted in hys owne handes and féete. This thing the B. of R. Innocent and hys Cardinalles dyd sée, and had verye proofe thereof.</p>
            <p>The meditation and imagination
<pb facs="tcp:10251:38"/>
of this booke was so earnest, and so continuall, that the token of the fiue woundes of Christ, were imprinted and ingraued in thys holy Saynctes bodye. But to this hygh fruite (as I sayde) fewe or none besides him doth attayne. It is a singular gyfte of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and not common to bée looked for of other persons. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, who that will exercise this les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, though he come not to this hygh poynte of perfection, he shall neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse greatly profite in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, and come to a great knowledge both of Christ &amp; of him selfe. A man may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say &amp; thinke with him selfe (behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his hart the Image of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe, who arte thou, and who am I. Thus euerie person both ryche and poore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may thinke, not onely in the church here, but in euery other place, and in hys businesse where about hée goeth. Thus the poore laborer maye thinke, when he is at plough earyng hys grounde, and when hée goeth to hys pastures to sée hys Cattayle, or when hée is sittyng at home by hys fire side, or els when he lyeth in hys

            <p>O Christen soule often beholde this booke, and saye with this holy man,
<pb facs="tcp:10251:40"/>
               <hi>Quis es tu et quis sum ego.</hi> Marueyle that his inestimable goodnesse would thus dye for so myserable a vanitie. And so maruelinge, thou shalt profyt in a gracious knowledge of Christ, and thy heart shall taste maruelous swéetenesse, and be replenished with a deuoute sauour of his most excelent goodnesse. But you maruell perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture why I call y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crucifix a booke? I will now tell you the consideracion why? A booke hath boardes, leaues, lynes, wrytinges, letters booth small and great. Fyrst I saye that a booke hath two boardes: the two boardes of this booke is the two partes of the crosse, for when the booke is opened &amp; spread, the leaues be cowched vpon the boardes. And so the blessed body of Christ was spred vpon the crosse. The leaues of this booke be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armes, the handes, legges, and féete, with the other members of his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and blessed body.</p>
            <p>Neuer anye Parchement skynne was more strayghtlye stratched by strength vpon the tentors then was
<pb facs="tcp:10251:41"/>
this blessed body vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse. These lorells that crucifyed him, drewe by vyolence his moste precious armes, with ropes vnto either braunche of the crosse, that the sinowes burst in sonder, and so nayled his handes fast with spykinge nayles of yron, vnto the crosse. After they stretched his féete lykewyse vnto an other hole be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neath in the crosse, and there nayled them with the third nayle thorough bothe his féete. And so they reared vp this body a loft against the sunne, euen as a parchment skinne is sette foorth before the heat of the Sun for to drye. It was set vp a loft to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that all the worlde might looke vpon this booke.</p>
            <p>This booke was written with in and without. Fyrst within was wrytten but one worde: neuerthelesse this one word compryseth in it, as sayth saint Paule, the whole treasure of al cunning and wisdome partayning vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to God, <hi>In quo sunt omnes thesauri sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae dei,</hi>

               <hi>In principio erat verbum,</hi> the word was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begynning before all creatures, thys worde is the second person in the godhead, the sonne of God which by the holie Ghost was written in the inward syde of thys parchment.

The holy Ghost was the penne of almyghtie God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, He set hys most mightie word vnto the body of Christ, within the wombe of the Uyrgine Marye, and so this booke was written within.

Furthermore when a booke is spread, you sée that in the leaues

are many lynes drawen.

And for bycause no parte of thys booke shoulde bée vnwritten, hys head also was pearsed with sharpe thornes.

            <p>Now you shall heare what wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings be contayned in thys booke, in the booke which Ezechiel did sée, was written thrée maner of things. <hi>Lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationes, Carmen, et vae,</hi> which is to say, Lamentations, songes, and woe.
<pb facs="tcp:10251:43"/>
And the same thrée things, in lyke maner be wrytten in thys booke of the Crucifixe. Fyrst is lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this verie conuenientlye is written in thys booke of the Crucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe. For whosoeuer will ioye wyth Christ, must fyrst sorow with him. And by sorowe and lamentation hée may come vnto ioye: But hée that will not sorrowe and lament wyth Christ héere in thys lyfe, hée shall come fynallye to the place where is euerlastyng woe, I saye woe that shall neuer haue ende. Héere ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is written all these thrée, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, songe, and woe.</p>
            <p>Fyrste then wée will speake of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
            <p>Lamentation aryseth of foure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, eyther of a great feare, or dreade, or of a great shame, or of some sorrowe, or els of some hatred. When Holophernes with a mightie power was entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey of Iurie, &amp; terribly threatned to distroy all before hym, the people were in a greate feare and dreade to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and so fell downe before
<pb facs="tcp:10251:44"/>
almyghtie God, and with great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, dyd call for hys helpe, <hi>omnius populus cetidit in facie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>

            <p>The cause of this lamentation, was the great dreade whych they were in. Héere first then let vs learne to dread, and doubtlesse thou Christian soule, thou mayest héere learne grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matter of dread, then the Iewes then were in. For the Iewes then were onelye in perill of temporall death, thou arte in perill of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng death.</p>
            <p>Consider man how gréeuouslie thou hast sinned: And also behold how grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously sinne was reuenged, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in the blessed bodye of Christ. And thou shalt anon fynde here great cause and matter of dread. The sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes telleth of Cambises the King of Persia, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where one of hys Iudges had giuen a false and a wrong iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he depriued him of hys offyce, and made an other in his place their

Furthermore bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of hys falsehoode he caused him to be slayne, and his skinne to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp before the place of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men iudgement, to the entent that this newe Iudge beholdyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous punishment of his predecessor, might beware of falshood, and alway dread to giue any wrong iudgement. In like maner y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Image of the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix is hunge vp in euery Church, to the entent that we may sée how grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie sinne was punyshed in that moste blessed bodye of our Sauyour Christ Iesu, not for him self, nor for hys owne sinne, but for ours was he thus cruellye intreated, wée were the cause, wée committed the sinne. But yet neuerthelesse he bare the paynes, and burthens of our sinnes vpon his backe.</p>
            <p>As wryteth Sainct Peter, <hi>Peccata no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra ipse pertulit in corpore suo super ligium crucis.</hi>

If sinne were so displeasant to almighty God the father, that rather then hée would suffer it, he would giue his owne sonne vnto death for the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it. How much rather now doth it displease him, when his sonne hath suffered death therfore, and yet sinne rayneth neuerthelesse, and more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally then euer it dyd before. Furthermore, if sinne was so gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously punished in him that neuer did sinne, how bytterly shall it be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in thée O sinfull creature, the which haste done so many great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious sinnes.

If a sinner call to remembrance his great vnkyndnesse, &amp; repute the same vnkyndenes any maner of vice, I trow that he wylbe much ashamed of his moste vnkynde and vngentle dealing against so louing a Lorde.

            <p>O thou Christian man is not here great cause to reioyce.</p>

If the sinner clearely considered al these thinges, (as they be matter in very déed) he would be doubtlesse greatly ashamed of him selfe, and in a great discomforte.

So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> here also (as I said) is great matter &amp; cause of very comfort, &amp; of solace incomparable. Wherefore to conclude my tale as touching this second writing, if eyther loue, or hope, or ioy, or comfort

wil make vs sing. Here in thys booke of the Crucifixe is great occasion of song. If thou first truly lament with Christ, thou shalt after ioyfully sing with him, and eche of these shal induce other, hatred of sinne shall bring into thy harte the loue of Christ, dreade shall bring in hope, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row shal bring in ioy.

            <p>The vi. our sauiour wept on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sinnes of other, as s. Paul saith, <hi>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> clamore et lachimis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</note> with crying &amp; teres
<pb facs="tcp:10251:68"/>
but the damned sinners that would not here wepe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ, such teares as might washe theyr sinnes, shall wepe in hell for theyr owne sinnes, such teares as shall skalde theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and yet they shalbe neuer the better. <hi>Ibi erit flectus et stridor dentium,</hi> Ther shal be wéeping &amp; gnashing of teeth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 22.</note> the smoke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fyer shal make them for to wéepe, &amp; the coldenesse of the snow shal make their téeth for to gnashe, &amp; chytter in theyr heades. Yea and that is more merueilous, neither the colde shall attemper the heate, nor contrarywyse, the heate shall attemper the colde, but eyther of them shall encrease the violence of the other. Euen as in the forge of a Smith, the colde water when it is cast into the Fyer, causeth the Fyer to be much more fearse and violent. The seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, our sauiour on the crosse had extrem drighnes, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained &amp; said, <hi>Scitio,</hi> I am dry, And no maruell though he wer dry, after so much payne and trauayle, after so much bléeding &amp; sweting, wherby no moisture almost was left in his bodi.
<pb facs="tcp:10251:69"/>
But howe vnmeasurable drighnesse shall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dampned soules endure in the fyre of hell? The rich glutton y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was buried in hel teacheth vs what drigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse is there, for he would haue gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen all this worlde to haue had one drop of water or lycour to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed his tongue, that was made so drye with the flame of that fyre.</p>
            <p>The eight, our sauiour on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse had much sorrow and heauinesse. If he for the onely remembrance of the paine for to come was in so great an agony that he sweat water &amp; bloud, who can expresse or think what sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and heauinesse he suffred when all the paynes were present, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently did oppresse hym. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse euery dampned person, by the reason of their continuall and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting paynes shall haue muche more sorrow and heauinesse, for the which it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the booke of Sapience, <hi>penitentiam Agentes et pretristitia spiritus gementes,</hi> they verely lamentably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them selues, and for extreame heauinesse of spirite mourne and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, thinking, for howe briefe and
<pb facs="tcp:10251:69"/>
transitory pleasures, they loste the ioyes euerlasting, and gate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paynes that euer shall endure.</p>
            <p>The ninth, our sauiour on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse did suffer muche infamy and shame. And specially to deliuer (as I said all sinners that would ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, and forsake their sinne,) from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting shame. But such as will not, shall suffer theyr owne shame, as they haue deserued. The true peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent soule shall bée sacyate with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall glory, But he that will not repent him selfe shall haue perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all shame and infamy.</p>
            <p>Almightie God sayeth, to suche by his Prophet Naum, <hi>Reuelabo puden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da tua in facie tua.</hi> I wil make open all thy shamefulnesse and euill dealyng in thine owne face. And the Prophet Hieremy sayeth, <hi>saturabitur opprobrijs</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he shall bée sacyate with opprobry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shame.</p>
            <p>The tenth, aboue all other paynes that our sauyour dyd suffer on the Crosse, was to be desolate of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, yea of his father, and to bée as a person forsaken of almightie God,
<pb facs="tcp:10251:70"/>
and destitute of all help and succour, for the which hée sore complayneth on his Crosse, crying vnto his father <hi>Deus meus Deus meus, vt quid dereliquisti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me,</hi> O my God, O my God, why hast thou forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. But this forsaking was but for a season, for within a short time after, he was raised again to immortall glory. But the damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sinners which shall be punished for their owne sinnes in hell, shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be forsaken, and fully be depry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, not onely from all ioye &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, but from that moste glorious sighte of the face of almighty God, wherein standeth all blessednesse and consummation of all comforte. And this shall more pinche the dampned soules, then all the other tormentes of hell besides. For the which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome sayth. <hi>Ego autem multo grauio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res cruciatus duco, quam gehenuam, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueri et ab duci ab illa gloria.</hi> I think (saith he) that to be remoued and cast out from that euerlastyng glory, is more gréeuous torments then all the other paynes of hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10251:70"/>Fynally, our sauiour on the crosse, suffered the paynes of death for our sinnes, whereby wée had deserued death. And therfore he suffered death to deliuer vs from the death of sinne. Neuerthelesse he remayned no long tyme in the bondes of death. But the dampned sinner that must paye his owne debtes in hell, shal suffer euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting death, not so that the sinners shal haue no lyfe nor féeling in them, but bycause that they shall be euer as though they were in the extreme paynes of death, and yet they shall haue no perfecte sense of the paynes, and neuer dye. The paynes shall be to them so vyolent, that they shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish a thousand tymes, and desire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for to dye, but death shal flie away from them, <hi>desiderabunt mori et mors fugie ab eis,</hi> they shal desire death, and death shall fly from them. O Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su in what myserie shall they be in, that euer shall couet death, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer may fully dye.</p>
            <p>The Prophet Dauid speaking of their payne sayeth. <hi>Mors depascet eos,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:10251:71"/>
which words may haue thrée senses, one is that death shall bée their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour and heardman, hée shall order them, and leade them to theyr pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures. In hell is two pastures, the one is all full of snow, the other full of fyre, for the whiche Iobe sayeth, <hi>Ad calorem nimium transient ab aquis ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uium,</hi> they shal walke from the snow vnto the fyre. And agayne from the fyre vnto the snow, this may be one sense, an other may be this, they shal be the continuall meate of death, as ye sée in the pastures, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shéepe féede. They croppe the grasse euer as it ryseth and kéepeth it lowe, and so the grasse is euer in eatyng, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer full eaten.</p>
            <p>In lyke maner death shall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally croppe the dampned persons in hell. And he shall euer be gnawyng and eating vpon them, and yet they shall neuer be fully consumed. The third sense may be this, death shall be theyr continuall meate, for they shall euer long and desire for to dye, they shal euer aboue all other things couet to haue death, and their desire
<pb facs="tcp:10251:71"/>
shall alway be a lyke freshe and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. An other comforte and refres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing besides this, they shall haue none, but whatsoeuer the sense of these wordes be, thou mayest well perceyue by them. O thou christian soule) that if thou shalt come to that place to pay thy debtes of thine own sinnes, it shall bée to gréeuous and to importable for thée to sustayne, for as I sayde, looke any maner of paine that our sauiour Christ suffered on the crosse for all our sinnes. If wée be not before our death by such affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as I before did rehearse) made perteyners of his sufferyng, we shall suffer all the same paynes in hel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is a troth, we may read in the booke of the Crucifix great matter of woe, whiche is the thyrde wryting that we had to speake off. Now thou sinful creature, haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before thyne eyes thys wonderfull booke which as I sayde is wrytten within and with out. In the which also thou mayest reade thrée maner of wrytings, that is to say, lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:10251:72"/>
song, and wo. If thou wilt begin to lament with Iesu, thou shalt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by come to sing with him. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou shalt be made so fully partei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his passion, that the debtes of thy sinnes shall be throughly payde, and that thou shalt escape euerlasting woe. But if thou doe refuse this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and follow the desires of thys world, and of the fleshe, be thou well assured that then thou shalt pay thine owne debtes amongest the diuils in hell, with euerlasting woe. From the which he defend vs, that for our loue as this day suffered on the Crosse, his most paynfull and sorrowfull death, our sauiour Christ Iesus. Amen.</p>
