            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Wee the KNIGHTS, GENTLEMEN, MINISTERS, and FREE-HOLDERS
Of the COUNTY of
WARWICK,</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EING</hi> deeply affected with, and ſadly ſenſible of the preſent Miſeries,
which both our Selves and the <hi>whole Nation</hi> groan under, We can no
longer forbear to expreſs our Griefs, and declare our Deſires and Thoughts
of the moſt probable means (by Gods aſſiſtance) to give ſome remedy to our
preſent ſufferings, and prevent thoſe yet greater Calamities which threaten
our ſpeedy and utter Ruine.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of our preſent Calamities, (we conceive) proceeds from the
many Revolutions, through Male-Adminiſtration of Government, and want
of the right Conſtitution of Parliaments: And that after all our great and
intolerable Sufferings, the vaſt expence of Blood and Treaſure, for our
Rights and Liberties, and Priviledges of Parliament (which we take to
be the good <hi>Old Cauſe</hi>) we, with moſt of the Counties of this Nation,
have not our <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> in a <hi>Free Parliament:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We therefore do declare, That we ſhall not conſent to pay any Tax or Impoſition, but by our Repreſentatives freely
elected, according to the Fundamental Laws of this Nation; It being the Indubitate and Indiſputable Right of all the
Free born People of <hi>England,</hi> that no Tax or Impoſition whatſoever, be put upon, or exacted from them, but by their
conſents had by their Repreſentatives in Parliament.</p>
            <p>And we further declare, That we heartily deſire the burying of all Animoſities and Differences, by a full and General Act
of <hi>Oblivion</hi> and <hi>Indempnity:</hi> And conſideration to be had of Purchaſers claiming by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And, That no Officer or Souldier who hath ventured his life for the freedome of his Countrey, and ſhall continue faithful
to thoſe Principles, ſhould be hereby diſcouraged; We alſo declare, That we ſhall freely and willingly conſent that all ſuch
ſhall receive their Arrears, and be continued ſo long as the Parliament ſhall think fit, in order to the ſafety and preſervation
of the Nation. And that ſuch Liberty be allowed to Tender Conſciences as is agreeable to the Revealed Will of God in the
Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>We alſo declare, That we ſhall not be wanting to our Vtmoſt powers, by all lawful wayes and means, to endevour the
effecting of theſe our Iuſt Deſires; And ſhall think nothing too dear to hazard for the Redemption of our undoubted Rights.
And hoping that our moſt Gracious God hath yet a Mercy for this bleeding Nation, We truſt that he will more eſpecially
move the hearts of thoſe into whoſe hands he hath put the moſt power. And that his Excellency General <hi>MONCK,</hi>
with the Honorable City of <hi>LONDON,</hi> together with all the good people of the Three Nations, will concurre with us
in theſe ſo juſt and reaſonable things, whoſe Peace, Proſperity and Safety is equally concerned with ours.</p>
