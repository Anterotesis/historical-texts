            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE LOYAL Protestant Readers.</head>
            <p>HAving made so long an Apology in the first pages for the Necessity as well as Justice of my appearing now in Print, I intended not to have troubled my self or you with any particular Address, till finding new Scandals dayly sprung upon me, the Refuting whereof, Rendred these Papers more tedious, then at first designed, I must therefore begg pardon for their Bulk; But, why all this stir and so many Sheets? What is it to us, you'l say, whether <hi>Prance</hi> be a Cheat, or the <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator</hi> a Lyar! Not much perhaps to you, but of great Importance to me, I'le assure you Gentlemen; since I perceive my Dayly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is beset with Spies, and no man (though never so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and Loyal) That comes into my Company, but is presently in danger of being exposed as a Phanatick, and markt out (right or wrong) to the fury of the Rabble, and destruction of his Fortune and Family: And Considering that this usage may be any other mans Case to morrow, as well as mine to day; whenever the <hi>Observator</hi> for his own Glory, or on any secret design, shall think fit to proclaim War against him; I thought it high time to give all the World satisfaction of the Truth of the Case between Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> and my self; That all persons of this Age, and such as shall write Histories in the next (which I find our <hi>Observator</hi> much values his Numerous Sheets upon, as the just Standard for them to take measures from) may have the Cognizance as well of the Defence as of the Charge; For he that has a Tongue to Condemn, before he imploys both his Ears to hear either Party, deserves to be Appeal'd from, as an incompetent Judge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Observator</hi> makes large Professions, that his Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is for the Government, and the Establisht Church; But I humbly Conceive, 'tis no Honour or Service to either, That he Intermixes so much his own Personal Piques and Animosities,
<pb facs="tcp:45023:3"/>
&amp; takes Liberty meerly on the Tales of his Busy Emissaries, to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any Honest Loyal Subject, that gives not up all the Faculties of his Soul, to a Blind Admiration of, and Acquiescence in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which are in many Particulars (For I Speak only as to what I am Concern'd in) as False and Malicious, as Triffling and Illogical.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman has Liberally bestow'd on me the Titles of Cheat, Rogue, Rascal, Blasphemer, almost always Drunk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I thought it below the Gravity of a Citizen, or any Moral Man, much more of a Christian, to Reply in the Scurrilous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of an Oyster Boat; and therefore as far as the matter would possibly bear, I have Abstained from any Vndecent Terms; how much soever deserv'd. Nor dare vye with so great a Master in the Mysteries of Buffoonery and Fooling: Soft Words and hard Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as little Droll, and as much Reason as may be afforded, is the best method for all Controversies. Yet to divert the Reader; I have now and then descended to answer the Gentleman a little in his own way, to shew that what some men so highly Admire, is no such Transcendent Quality, but it might be Imitated.</p>
            <q>
               <l>A Little Wit, joyn'd with a Vast Ill Nature,</l>
               <l>And qualify'd for Lyes, as well as Satyr;</l>
               <l>May easily Commence an Observator.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But not to enlarge the Porch to a building which is already too bigg—The whole matter, Loyal Readers, is before you, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first considered impartially, you are at Liberty to pass your Judgments as you find Cause. If any object the following Leaves are not all of my own Composing, It shall readily he granted; Nor can I find any body will swear, that all the <hi>Observators</hi> are wholly of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange's</hi> own handy work; Let it therefore suffice, That there is nothing here said on my behalf, which I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and know to be true. And therefore am Ready to justify every Tittle; Witness my Hand,</p>

            <head>A POSTSCRIPT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Noise Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has laboriously (and even to many of his own Admirers, <hi>nauseously</hi>) made about <hi>Brass-Screws,</hi> &amp;c. was in it self so <hi>improbable</hi> as well as <hi>false</hi>; and his naked Suggestions (unconfirm'd with the least <hi>proof,</hi> or his being able to vouch any <hi>Authors</hi> or Witnesses for so heinous a Charge) having been already refuted by the positive <hi>Affidavit</hi> of an uninteressed Person, and a <hi>Romanist</hi> too, disproving the same; That, as I doubt not, but most sober considerate Persons, are long since satisfied of the <hi>Injustice</hi> of <hi>that Accusation,</hi> so I had the Charity to hope the <hi>Observator himself,</hi> however at first Misinform'd, might e're this be asham'd on't.</p>
            <p>But finding that Gentleman, in his <hi>Observators, Numb.</hi> 470, and 471, Challenging all the World to Instance wherein he has <hi>misreported,</hi> or <hi>partially represented any one matter of Fact,</hi> and particularly reviving this <hi>Thred-bare Story,</hi> as one of the <hi>Trophies</hi> of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, and consigning the same over, as a matter <hi>undeniable</hi> to the Belief of <hi>Posterity</hi>: I should be wanting to <hi>Truth</hi> and my own <hi>Innocency,</hi> if I should not publickly Check, and yet further Detect those <hi>Scandals,</hi> which tend not only to the blasting of my Reputation, spoiling of my <hi>Trade,</hi> and <hi>Ruin of my Family,</hi> (which I can prove, Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> with his own Mouth, most <hi>unchristianly</hi> own'd to be his Design) but also (which I conceive the first Forgers of this Scandal principally intend) the Discrediting <hi>that Evidence,</hi> I have faithfully given touching the manner of Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey's Murther</hi>: That <hi>indelible stain,</hi> which all the Popes <hi>Holy-Water</hi> shall never be able to wash off.</p>
            <p>I foresee under what Disadvantages I appear, and am sorry I cannot avoid a Contest, with a Gentleman of <hi>known Abilities,</hi> and <hi>reputed Loyalty,</hi> so high in Popular Esteem, of so large an Invention, and <hi>taking Expressions,</hi> and one who will be sure to have the <hi>Last Word</hi>; nor do I forget his Character, as now qualified, <hi>a Magistrate</hi>; but Truth is Truth, even in the Courser Language of a <hi>Silver-Smith</hi>: And Falshoods and Calumnies are no better than <hi>Lies</hi> and Devices of the Devil to be abhorr'd by all <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>honest Men,</hi> though dressed up in never so rich Embroideries of <hi>Craft</hi> and <hi>Oratory.</hi> And though God and Nature have not endued me with equal <hi>parts,</hi> nor Fortune with so liberal an <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> (which the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of my Father to his King, was the chief occasion that disabled him to afford me) so that I may not be so <hi>useful</hi>; yet I am bound to be, and by Gods Grace, will never fail to approve my self as <hi>Honest a Man,</hi> as Faithful and Obedient <hi>a Subject,</hi> and as Hearty and Dutiful a <hi>Son of the Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by Law Establisht, as the <hi>Wittiest Observator</hi> in <hi>Christendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Veneration I have for His <hi>Sacred Majesty,</hi> my Soveraign, guides my willing Duty to pay all JustRespects to every Person (though never so much my particular Enemy) that is vested with any <hi>subordinate</hi> Authority under him. 'Tis not with Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> the <hi>Justice,</hi> but <hi>L'Estrange</hi> the <hi>Observator</hi> my Dispute lies; if he send out <hi>a Legal Warrant,</hi> I will readily obey; but if he publish things <hi>false</hi> and <hi>scandalous</hi> of me, I see not, why I may not <hi>Answer</hi> it, without being Taxt as guilty of any Disrespect to the <hi>Government.</hi> His Gracious Majesty imploying any in the <hi>Commission of the Peace,</hi> does not, I am sure, thereby intend to <hi>priviledge</hi> Him, to injure the meanest of His Subjects.</p>
            <p>What I attempt is no more than all Laws <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> allow, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>liberty of an unblamable Defence</hi>; to wipe off <hi>Dirt</hi> (or rather <hi>Venom</hi>) causelesly thrown upon me: In doing which, if any of it shall, by the Beams of Truth, be reflected back on the <hi>first</hi> Author, who can help it?</p>
            <p>For whatever Service Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has done the <hi>Government</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> against the <hi>Factious,</hi> or the Enemies to either, I Cordially <hi>applaud</hi> and <hi>thank</hi> him. Nor do I Repine at his (reported) <hi>Presents</hi> and <hi>New-years-Gifts</hi> of a 1000 (nay, were they ten

sand) <hi>Guineys,</hi> since for ought I know, he has deserved them; for in this Close-fisted Age, People are not apt to part with their Money, but on good Considerations. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I am pleased to hear that <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Gratitude</hi> (call it which you will) is so great and General amongst Protestants, and hope we shall hereby silence the <hi>Papists,</hi> upbraiding us for neglect of <hi>Good Works</hi>: I like a <hi>Chedder-Cheese</hi> (to borrow the Metaphor from a well known Author) never the worse for being made <hi>Great</hi> by the Milk of the whole Parish; nor shall I ever envy any Mans growing <hi>Fat</hi> on the <hi>Alms-Basket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, I have as good an Esteem for the Active and Ingenious <hi>Squire L'Estrange,</hi> as I ought to have. And if (as the Author of <hi>The Pacquet of Advice from</hi> Geneva, <note n="*" rend="inter">A Pamphlet lately suppressed, by the Order (as I am informed) of the Right Honourable and Reverend, my Lord <hi>the Bishop of</hi> London, as Scandalizing the whole Reformation, under pretence of exposing <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> The Author of which was one Mr. <hi>Pratt</hi> (that calls himself <hi>Doctor</hi>) one that heretofore was always not only a professed, but viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Papist,</hi> and I never heard of his <hi>Conversion.</hi>

<q>That I being imploy'd to make an <hi>Antependium</hi> to the Altar of Her Majesties Chappel, did fraudulently either make Brass-screws and reckon for them as Silver, or having made Silver, and being paid for them as such, did purloin the Silver ones, and put Brass ones, with only Silver Heads in their stead</q>—Here's no less than <hi>Cheat,</hi> and <hi>Felony,</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> all Charg'd in a Lump, but where's the <hi>Proof</hi>? As for that, you have only the bare Suggestion of the <hi>Observator</hi>: Now, though that Authors Opinion, when he talks of the <hi>Politicks,</hi> may (for ought I know) be <hi>indisputable</hi>; yet as to matter of Fact, if he shall tell us, it Rains <hi>Butter'd Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snips,</hi> and that the <hi>Thames</hi> is turned into a dish of <hi>Clouted Cream,</hi> when we see nothing but <hi>Snow</hi> falling, and <hi>Ice</hi> under-foot, he must excuse, such as wear Eyes about them, if they demur a little to the Belief of those Miracles.</p>
            <p>For the Readers satisfaction; who possibly may not be so well skill'd in <hi>Chappel-Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as an <hi>Observator,</hi> that owns, he has been <hi>forty times at Mass</hi>: I must here first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe what an <hi>Antependium</hi> is, <hi>viz. An Ornament set before the Front of the Altar,</hi> of which there are several sorts, some more <hi>Rich</hi> for <hi>Great Festivals,</hi> some more <hi>Mean,</hi> for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary times; some <hi>Mourning</hi> ones used, when Mass is said for <hi>Souls in Purgatory,</hi> which (if I do not mis-remember) is every <hi>Monday</hi>; and accordingly these Antependiums are frequently remov'd, as occasion requires.</p>
            <p>That which I was concerned about, was a very <hi>Rich</hi> one, to be used on High days; And <hi>Doctor Godden,</hi> Treasurer of Her Majesties Chappel, by the means of <hi>Father James,</hi> (who was then my Confessor) imployed me, it being proposed to me and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> (a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Goldsmith in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi>) and both of us made Draughts or <hi>Models,</hi> which, the Doctor told me, were presented to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and Her <hi>Majesty</hi> was Graciously pleased to approve of <hi>mine,</hi> and so I was pitcht upon to do it; the rather (as I believe,) for that the same Doctor told me, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ask'd a 4th part more <hi>per</hi> Ounce, for Work and Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than I offered to do it for.</p>
            <p>Being thus imployed, and having made a punctual Bargain at fixt Rates and Prizes, to make an <hi>Antependium,</hi> and steps to the Altar, and two large Flower-Pots; I was furnished with a quantity of old broken Silver belonging to the Chappel, which I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45023:4"/>
spent several days time and labour, in taking off from the Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was intended both to supply matter for the Work to be done, and with it's over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus to pay me for doing it, and was all exactly <hi>weighed</hi> when delivered to me; which was as near as I can remember, about the Moneth of <hi>September,</hi> 1674. And I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to smish against the Feast of our <hi>Saviours Nativity,</hi> so there was a necessity to imploy more hands, (in so large a piece of work) than my own and my Servants (yet the <hi>Observator</hi> objects as a Crime that I did not do it <hi>all my self,</hi> whereas had I design'd a <hi>Cheat,</hi> I should my self have endeavoured to do it <hi>all.</hi>) But I caused the old Silver to be melted down by others, (who might be able to attest it) which, tho' I confess I did not do out of any foresight, yet 'twas happy for me, since otherwise I might now have been liable to a far greater scandal of <hi>Embasing</hi> it, (a more tempting bait to nibble at, than this pedling business of a few <hi>Brass Screws.</hi>) Having thus caus'd it to be melted, and several <hi>Assays</hi> to be made thereof at our Hall, (whereby it appeared not to be worth above four Shillings an ounce) and shew'd them to Doctor <hi>Godden,</hi> (who I must tell Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> was a person so Faithful to Her Majesties Interests, and in himself so Curious, Exact, and Sagacious, as not easily to be imposed upon) He thereupon by a note under his hand, (which I have yet to shew) dated <hi>September</hi> 28, 1674. Allowed the overplus to me, towards my payment at four Shillings <hi>per Ounce,</hi> expressing the Reason in these words—<hi>The coursness of the Silver, and waste</hi> (which was not small) <hi>considered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The work going on, and <hi>Screws</hi> to fix the Silver to the Wood, which was to support it, being requisite, some few of those <hi>Screws</hi> were at first made of Silver, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Silver allow'd, was not like to hold out to be enough to finish the work and to pay me, as was designed, I acquainted the Doctor and Mr. <hi>Plum</hi> (his Man) and Mr. <hi>Coupledyke,</hi> one of Her Majesties Servants, therewith, withall advertising them; That I thought <hi>Screws</hi> of <hi>Brass</hi> would be altogether as serviceable, and so <hi>that Silver</hi> might be spared if they thought fit, only on the outside to affix to them thin Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Plates for heads to answer to the rest of the Work, which they readily consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, and so those few Screws made, were melted down and imploy'd in the Work, and all the Screws made of Brass, or if any one were left in by over-sight, 'tis more than I know.</p>
            <p>The Work being done, Mr. <hi>Plum</hi> saw it <hi>all weighed</hi> and set up, and some of the Screws being found to be too long, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> (a Workman employed by me, and who made at least several of these <hi>Brass Screws</hi>) did cut off the ends to shorten them, and soon after came Doctor <hi>Godden</hi> himself, and would have it weighed again, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>though he doubted not my word, and his Mans Relation, yet he could with more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance satisfie Her Majesty, when he had seen it weighed himself,</hi> and so it was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder again, and weighed in parts, (the Brazen Screws being apparent before him, but not weighed, only the Heads of Silver reckon'd for, which were weighed before they were put on, and being very inconsiderable, were not disputed) and so the Work was sent home to the Chappel; and tho', the surplusage of the Silver falling short as aforesaid, I was not fully paid according to the Bargain, yet considering how good a Mistress I had of Her Majesty, from whom I had almost work continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and not doubting but in time I should be satisfied, it rested all the years, 1675, 76, 77, and 78. Towards the latter end of which last year, I having given a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Justice <hi>Godfreys Murder,</hi> most of the Romans began to be very much my Enemies, and several Libels, As the <hi>Compendium,</hi> &amp;c. were th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But, (almost eight years after the work done,) <hi>viz.</hi> the first of <hi>April</hi> (the day <hi>Fools</hi> are wont to be sent on Errands) 1682. Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> the <hi>first of all mer</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living (as far as I can learn) broacht this story in <hi>Observator, Numb.</hi> 117. very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly (forsooth) at first by way of Quaere or Advertisement, but afterwards, as some <hi>Witty</hi> People, by heat of fancy, invent <hi>pretty Tales,</hi> and tell them so often, that at last they themselves begin to believe them, so he grew more positive in the business; and now, <hi>Observator</hi> 471, is pleased to <hi>scoff</hi> at all <hi>thoughts of Repentance</hi> for it, which yet I hope God will give him, e're he goes out of this World, or else his account is like to be very dreadful in the next, for if for every <hi>idle</hi> word we must answer, much more for forging and promoting <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Scandals,</hi> designed to Ruine our Neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all persisted in and boasted of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45023:5"/>
In the mean time, I shall first shew the <hi>unlikelyhood</hi> of the matter thus charg'd upon me; which against <hi>Nude</hi> Averments (tho' never so confident) is a sufficient defence. Secondly, I shall <hi>disprove</hi> his suggestions by Testimony upon Oath, and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonstrations?</p>
            <p>When a man is falsly and maliciously attacqued with Calumnies, that which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would be insufferable <hi>vanity,</hi> becomes <hi>necessity</hi>; and on <hi>that score,</hi> I must crave the Readers excuse for mentioning some <hi>Truths,</hi> which without such a <hi>forc'd putt,</hi> I would have been far enough from relating of my self: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That having now been a <hi>Trader</hi> towards twenty years, I dare appeal to all, that I have had Dealings with, (<hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants</hi>) if they can justly say, I ever wrong'd them, or can instance in any particulars, wherein they found me addicted or inclinable to little <hi>sharking Tricks, Injustice, Fraud,</hi> or <hi>Over-reaching</hi>? Nay, whether on the other side, it be not true, that amongst the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> (with whom my chief Dealings lay, untill I left them,) I were not generally call'd by the Name of <hi>Honest Prance</hi>? If any such ill Practices could have been proved, as Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has not been wanting by his frequent Proclamations to invite Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, so I want not Ill-willers, who would be glad of the opportunity, and you would e're this, have heard of some other Pranks besides the <hi>Brass Screws,</hi> yet no such thing has appeared. But on the contrary, even since I have renounced their Religion, Father <hi>Lewis</hi> the Jesuit, and Father <hi>Hanslipp</hi> the Monk (upon my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening into their Company, when brought up to <hi>Newgate,</hi>) did declare before se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Witnesses, that they always lookt upon me to be as Honest a man (speaking as to my dealing) as any in the World; and this was spoken on a long experience too, for with that Father <hi>Lewis</hi> (afterwards Executed upon a Conviction of Priesthood in <hi>Wales</hi>) I had very considerable dealings in the way of my Trade, now 'tis very strange, that I, that had managed matters so <hi>squarely</hi> with all the rest of my Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, should so basely <hi>begin my Cheats</hi> upon Her Majesty, who was the <hi>best Mistress</hi> I had, or could ever hope for, and whose Work (which was a considerable part of my Lively-hood) I must certainly expect to lose, as soon as the Cheat should be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, which (as I shall prove presently) 'twas impossible (had it been so) to conceal for a day.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Further, as to my Integrity, and Scorning to grow Rich by Unlawful and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest gain; I might give several Instances; but I shall trouble the Reader only with Two; <hi>viz.</hi> Several years ago (about the time, as I remember, that I made this <hi>Antipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>) my Lady <hi>Gage</hi> lost a <hi>Jewel,</hi> and long after, near half a year, when the <hi>Bills</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, on the first missing it, were forgot, and the Lady despaired of ever hearing of it, this Jewel was proffered me, and I knew it worth about 45 <hi>l.</hi> and might have had it for 10 <hi>l.</hi> but reflecting on the Parties readiness to part with it on such terms, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon calling to mind the Bill, I stopt it, and restored the Jewel to the Lady. Now here might have been a secure Prize of 30 <hi>l.</hi> for the Reward in the Bill was but 5 <hi>l.</hi> (to the best of my memory) and if I had bought it for 10 <hi>l.</hi> I might have made above 40 <hi>l.</hi> of it, and having taken out the Stones, there would have been little fear of its ever being discovered, but I detested any such lewd design. And of this, that <hi>Honourable Lady,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, and whom I suppose yet living, will, I doubt not, afford me the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of her Attestation to any that shall enquire.</p>
            <p>Since that, having an Accompt with one Mr. <hi>Ridge,</hi> upon our Reckoning I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had forgot to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>harge me with some Ounces of Gold, amounting to about 12 <hi>l.</hi> and was so far from calling the same to mind, that he allow'd himself a Debtor for about that Value; and so it must have pass'd, had I not <hi>voluntarily shew'd</hi> him his mistake from my Book. Now, that I, who used so much tenderness in these Cases, should thus impudently attempt to <hi>defraud</hi> Her Majesty, will I suppose need <hi>some proof</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be credited by Impartial men.</p>
            <p>Especially, if they consider me then a strict and zealous <hi>Catholick</hi>; for, that so I was, I appeal to all that know me, being as Bigotted therein as any, and meerly on that score, the Priests <hi>Kelly,</hi> &amp;c. had the confidence to trust me with their Wicked Intrigue against Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey.</hi> Now being thus Principled, tho' I had been so <hi>Immoral,</hi> as to have wronged Persons in other Cases, yet 'tis hard to think, I should do it here, where fraud must become <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> and no less impiety than <hi>Robbing that very Holy Altar,</hi> before which I so constanlty pay'd my Devotions, wherein the thoughts of the present instances of my <hi>Cousenage,</hi> must continually upbraid and torture me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45023:5"/>
All this severally and jointly considered, may amount at least to a <hi>Violent presumption,</hi> of the falsity of the Observators <hi>simple Allegation,</hi> to any man, whose prejudices or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest have not made him resolve to believe any Scandals, tho' never so unreasonable, of <hi>Prance,</hi> and blindly to swallow, without chewing, any thing he meets with in an <hi>Observator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For nothing can be more absurd, than to imagin, that I, thus circumstanc'd, should be guilty of the <hi>Grand Cheat</hi> he would now fix upon me, so contrary to the common bent of my Inclinations, as well as justice, and so highly against all <hi>Gratitude</hi> as well as the apprehensions of Religion, and attended with such apparent <hi>hazards</hi> and under a certainty of being discovered, and all this for so <hi>paltry a profit,</hi> as <hi>could be</hi> expected from such a business; and also when I had not the least Temptations of <hi>want</hi> to prompt to it; for 'tis well known, that, by her Majesties favour and the interest I had with the <hi>Roman Clergy,</hi> and Gentlemen of that perswasion, I had a very <hi>Competent Trade,</hi> and tho' I always liv'd <hi>freely</hi> for a Person of my condition, yet I may justly averr that when I fell into my troubles in 78. I was worth a 1000. <hi>l.</hi> And no less was attested (as I have been Credibly Informed) to his Majesty and Council by a worthy Gentleman, still in the Commission of the Peace, on his view of my <hi>Shop,</hi> and <hi>House,</hi> when I was first seized.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Observators</hi> suggestions are not only <hi>Improbable,</hi> but Notoriously false, which if I make appear by sufficient <hi>Testimony upon Oath,</hi> and reasons necessarily <hi>Conclusive</hi> (than which two, I know not amongst men any <hi>stronger</hi> proof) I hope I shall convince Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> or at least, the rest of the World, that I am grosly <hi>abused</hi> and <hi>stande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> by him in this Matter.</p>
            <p>First, therefore, be pleased to read the following Affidavit; and withall, Note, that the Person, that made it, is of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Communion.</p>

In which time, she this deponent, knows and does well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the said <hi>Miles Prance</hi> was imployed to make an <hi>Antependium</hi> for the <hi>Altar,</hi> with steps to the said <hi>Altar,</hi> at her Majesties Chappel (then) at <hi>Sommerset-house</hi>; and she, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent did diverse times see and observe the several parts of that work, and see <hi>the Screws</hi> made thereunto, which were of <hi>Brass,</hi> onely on the heads there were <hi>silver Plates</hi> sodered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

            <p>The <hi>Observator,</hi> Numb. 129. undertakes to comment after this manner, upon this <hi>Affidavit,</hi> and says, the Gentlewoman was <hi>imposed upon in the wording</hi> (which is a Civil way of telling her, she was <hi>perjur'd</hi>) for says he, <hi>she declares since, that by seeing the Screws made, she only meant after they were made</hi>—Now whether she did ever <hi>so declare, I</hi> know not, but however if she did, 'tis nothing to the purpose, the question in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not being whether she <hi>stood by,</hi> all the while every one of the <hi>Brass Screws</hi> were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45023:6"/>
               <hi>making,</hi> nor is it to be imagined she could, since they were made at several times, and perhaps by several hands. But whether I made, or caused them to be made clandestinly, and without the <hi>Privacy</hi> or <hi>Consent</hi> of <hi>Doctor Godden</hi> and his Man <hi>Plum,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coupledyke,</hi> who were the lookers after the Work; <hi>or chang'd</hi> them, after they were reckon'd for as <hi>Silver</hi>; now to this she swears positively, that they <hi>all saw</hi> them, and that she heard <hi>Plum</hi> and <hi>Coupledyke</hi> say, those <hi>Brass-Screws</hi> would <hi>do as well as Silver ones.</hi> But to take this off, Mr. <hi>L'Estrange Observator, Numb.</hi> 126, tells the World, That <hi>Plum and Coupledyke had drank many a pot of good Ale with me.</hi>—And what then Sir? The <hi>Excise</hi> was paid, and the good Wife that draw'd it, had <hi>a License</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Worship had nothing to do with it. Ale, especially <hi>good Ale,</hi> is the old <hi>Catholick drink</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> had we Carouz'd in other <hi>Puritanical</hi> Liquors, you might have been offended, and cryed out with little Doctor <hi>Edwards.</hi> —<hi>There's Heresy in</hi> Hopps, <hi>give</hi> Calvin <hi>Beer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But without fooling, who can think, but the <hi>Observator</hi> (who trades much in <hi>Hints</hi> and <hi>Innuendo's</hi>) intends by this Reflection to possess his Readers with an Opinion, that this <hi>Plum</hi> and <hi>Coupledyke</hi> were Confederates with me in this business of the Screws, so that to support the Scandal, here's two dead men must be exposed as <hi>Drunkards</hi> and <hi>Treacherous Cheats</hi> to their Mistress the Queen.</p>
            <p>But says he, they were no <hi>Orderers, as I assure you,</hi>—Now one would wonder, this Gentleman who vows and swears so bloodily, that he never was at <hi>Sommerset-Chappel,</hi> since His Majesties Restauration, should become so intimate with these two Men, as to know what <hi>Liquor they lov'd,</hi> and be able to aver <hi>so positively,</hi> that he can assure us, they were no <hi>Orderers</hi>—But against ten thousand of his Assurances, I tell him <hi>they were Orderers,</hi> as well as good <hi>Ale-drinkers</hi>; for they have several times given me <hi>Orders,</hi> and brought directions for <hi>Work,</hi> and particularly about this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tependium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> proceeds and says, <hi>That she knows nothing, who imployed</hi> Prance, <hi>or that Brass Screws were consented to by the Persons concern'd</hi>; all which is utterly <hi>false.</hi> She swears the just contrary, and names in particular Doctor <hi>Goddin, Plum,</hi> and <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pledyke,</hi> and tho' she says, that she then understood <hi>Plum</hi> and <hi>Coupledyke,</hi> were <hi>SOME</hi> of the Persons that imployed <hi>Prance,</hi> 'tis not the least <hi>blemish</hi> to her Oath; for so they were <hi>mediately</hi> under Her Majesty and Doctor <hi>Godden</hi>; and seeing them frequently coming to enquire after the Work, and give directions about, and weigh it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how could she then think otherwise? Yet she says only, that she understood them to be <hi>some</hi> of the Persons, and presently adds, that she also saw <hi>Doctor Godden</hi> view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Brass Screws.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Observator</hi> alledges further, that <hi>This Affidavit was drawn from her upon pretence, that she was to be a Witness in a suit at Law, against a Woman that had Scandaliz'd me.</hi> To which I answer, 1<hi>st.</hi> That this is another contrived <hi>falshood,</hi> there was no such pretence; 2<hi>ly.</hi> 'Tis absurd, for all the World knows, that <hi>Affidavits</hi> are not allowed in such Suits, where the Witness is <hi>living</hi> and at hand, able to testifie <hi>viva voce.</hi> And 3<hi>ly.</hi> 'Tis impertinent, for had it been so, it concerns not the <hi>Truth</hi> of what she deposes, <hi>whatever use</hi> I intend to put it to. And I cannot fathom the Gentlemans reach in this Objection, unless it be to signifie, that the Gentlewoman being a <hi>Romanist,</hi> might needs have such <hi>a kindness for him,</hi> that she would <hi>not have testified the Truth, if she' had known it would turn to his prejudice and confusion</hi>: But if he had any such thoughts, I must do her the <hi>Justice</hi> as to acquaint the World, he was grosly mistaken; for the Gentlewoman soon after, went to him, the said Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> and expostulated with him about the <hi>Abuses</hi> put upon her in subsequent <hi>Observators,</hi> and amongst the rest, his affirming that she had been <hi>my Servant</hi> (which had it been true, had nothing impaired her Evidence) but the same was altogether false, for her Father honestly paid 15 <hi>l.</hi> a year for her Board, whilst she lay at my House. In which discourse of hers with Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> another passage happened, that might give some indications of that Gentlemans Temper: For she rounding him up for broaching such <hi>false Stories</hi> against me, which tended to the Ruine of my <hi>Family</hi>: He answered (as she has declared) That he did it <hi>on purpose to Ruine me,</hi> and wondered that <hi>SHE</hi> [he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood her to be a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>] <hi>would appear in the behalf of such a Raskal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides this full proof on <hi>Oath,</hi> the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of these <hi>Brass-Screws,</hi> unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably evince the impossibility of any intended <hi>Fraud</hi>: For first, had I designed any such thing, I must have been a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> (which I suppose the <hi>Observator</hi> does not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45023:6"/>
take me for) before I could have effected the <hi>Cheat,</hi> and cast a <hi>Mist</hi> before Peoples Eyes; for besides that, 'tis not pretended these Celebrated Screws were <hi>Gilt</hi> or <hi>Silvered over,</hi> but plain, open, visible <hi>Brass,</hi> only Silver heads to them on the out-side; And besides, that they were made abroad by my Work-men; you are to note, that the use of them was (as aforesaid) to fix the <hi>Silver</hi> Work to the <hi>Wood</hi> that upheld it, through which they came; and were there made fast with <hi>Nuts,</hi> and the Antependium being a Moveable, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used on <hi>Solemn Festivals,</hi> and then set aside into the <hi>Sacrastry,</hi> for which purpose, there were on the back-side two large <hi>Iron Handles</hi> to bear it away by, as often as the same was so removed from the Altar; these <hi>Brass Screws</hi> were to be seen on that side, as plain as the Iron Handles, or the very Nose on the <hi>Observators</hi> Face: And I question, whether I owe it not to the Gentlemans forgetfulness, that (when his hand was in) he did not also Charge me with <hi>Transubstantiating</hi> these Handles into <hi>Iron,</hi> as well as the <hi>Screws</hi> into <hi>Brass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentlewoman, as you have heard, Swears, that the Screws being Brass, was <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,</hi> not only to my Servants and Work-men, but to the Gentlemen before Named, (<hi>viz.</hi> Doctor <hi>Godden, Plum,</hi> and <hi>Coupledyke</hi>) and several other of Her Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants—Now, though, in my Confinement in 78, and the Hurry and Confusion of my Family on that Account, I had the unhappiness to lose a Shop-Book, which would more fully have demonstrated it; yet by good Providence, I have one old Book still remaining in my Castody, which enough Corroborates her Testimony; there being entered a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial in these Words, <hi>viz. For a Brass Screw for the Holy Ghost,</hi> [A Figure in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tependium] 10—6, that is weighing a Halfpenny weight and six Grains, being the Hand-writing of <hi>Thomas Evely,</hi> then my Servant, and since <hi>Porter</hi> to his Grace, the late Deceased Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>; and though a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> yet I have that Charity to believe, he will not deny his <hi>own Hand,</hi> which is ready to be shewn for any Gentlemans satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Nor do I doubt to Appeal to Doctor <hi>Godden</hi> himself, who I hear is still living, tho' he cannot be presumed to have now any <hi>kindness</hi> for me; yet I so much confide in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity, Veracity, and Morality, as to believe, he would do me <hi>Right</hi> herein: Nor is it credible, though I know not where that Doctor is, but that the <hi>Observator,</hi> who could with a wet Finger, bring Certificates from <hi>Salamanca</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and has shewed his Correspondence at <hi>Roan,</hi> and with a Foreign Minister of State about <hi>Hubert</hi> (legally Executed for Firing <hi>London</hi> in 66) that he was <hi>not Guilty</hi> of that flagitious Crime, for which he Suffered, or was a <hi>Protestant,</hi> or <hi>Distracted,</hi> could not but as easily have found means to procure a Testimonial from Doctor <hi>Godden,</hi> had he not despaired of any relief from that <hi>Learned</hi> Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Let me add to this, That, when after the Antependium had been a considerable time in the Chappel, some of the <hi>Nuts</hi> were lost; Her Majesties Servants have brought the Brass-Screws to me, to make and fit new Nuts to them, which I think demonstrates the <hi>Brass-ness</hi> of the Screws could be no such new thing, as that Monsieur <hi>Coquus</hi> (the Man the <hi>Observator</hi> means) should with such surprize, like a second <hi>Archimedes,</hi> magnifie his Discovery, and cry out—<hi>Here's a damnable Cheat, Brass-Screws,</hi> &amp;c. As you will find Romanc'd, <hi>Observator</hi> 127.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemans talk about <hi>Sodering of Brass</hi> unto, or upon <hi>Silver,</hi> and noise of <hi>Felony,</hi> or a <hi>Pillory,</hi> is altogether Impertinent here. 'Tis true, to incorporate Brass, or any base Metal with Silver, or to Soder it to Silver, where 'tis not visible, as in the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a <hi>Tankard,</hi> or the like, is justly Criminal; but to adjoin or affix an Head of Silver open and visible on a Screw or Pin of Brass, or the like; as it carries nothing with it of a Cheat, so neither is it in any way punishable; but daily practis'd, as in Looking-Glass-Frames, the Hafts of Knives, and a thousand other things,—And so much for <hi>Brass-Screws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another matter the <hi>Observator</hi> would seem willing to have believed, is, That a <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard</hi> which I lost out of my Shop, being brought to me to have some Bruises beat out, was, after I had pretended the same was Stoln, found in my Wives Trunk. This is likewise absolutely <hi>false,</hi> and all the proof brought for it, is, The <hi>Observator,</hi> Numb. 120, says A <hi>Person being questioned by me for this Scandal, did upon his Oath declare, my Servant said—I thank God, the Tankard I was suspected for, was found in my Mistresses Trunk, amongst other Plate:</hi> Now what Evidence such an Hear-say from an idle Boy amounts to, is left to Consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45023:7"/>
The very same <hi>Observator</hi> acknowledges, that I did in the year 1678, give out <hi>Bills</hi> of Notice, That this Tankard, mark'd at bottom <hi>R. B.</hi> and of such value, was taken out of my Shop; with an offer of Reward to the Discoverer, which is <hi>true,</hi> and therein was also promised, That if any had bought it, I would reimburse the full value; and in getting these Bills Printed and Publish'd, and otherwise about it, I was out of Pocket above 20 <hi>s.</hi> Now to what intent I should do this, if indeed the Tankard were <hi>not Stoln,</hi> is a Riddle: For the Tankard was brought to my Wife at my Shop, by a Servant of the <hi>Horse-shoe</hi> Tavern in Drury Lane, and so the delivery easie proveable; consequently <hi>stoln</hi> or <hi>not stoln,</hi> lost or only concealed, I was compellable by Law to make <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for it; therefore so to hide it up in a Trunk, and yet to be at the Charge aforesaid in Bills, must be Madness as well as Dishonesty.</p>
            <p>But, so far were both I and my Wife from any thoughts of defrauding the People of their Tankard, that nothing was more upon her Mind and Endeavours in the highest Disorder of our Troubles, than to make satisfaction; for, she, having upon my Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, removed to one Madam <hi>Lees</hi> in the <hi>Pall-Mall,</hi> a Trunk wherein were Eleven Silver Tankards, and amongst them, Two bought of one Mr. <hi>Strickling,</hi> which were not paid for, and another second-hand one, which I had bought of a Gentlewoman living at a Dancing Masters in <hi>Duke-street,</hi> my Wife before Madam <hi>Lee</hi> took out the said second-hand Tankard, and two Tankards unpaid for, telling her, that a Tankard belonging to the aforementioned Tavern, was lately lost at our Shop, and she would not for the World, but it should be made good, and therefore she would allow them this second-hand Tankard for it, tho' it were <hi>of better value,</hi> and return Mr. <hi>Strickling</hi> his two Tankards again. But it being <hi>very late,</hi> Madam <hi>Lee</hi> perswaded her not to carry them <hi>that night,</hi> and so the business rested till after I had my liberty, and then I gave the Tavern <hi>another Tankard</hi> in lieu of theirs, which had been so stollen, and the beforementioned Tankard which had been in my Wifes Trunk, (and which <hi>must be</hi> the Tankard intended by the Boy, if he did ever talk at such a rate, for all the rest were <hi>new ones</hi>) I sold to one Mr. where the Owners of the other may easily satisfie themselves, whether it be the <hi>same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Observator,</hi> not content with buzzing this sensless Scandal, would insinuate further, as if I <hi>made away</hi> that Servant of mine; for thus he puts the question— <hi>But what became of this Prentice</hi>? And shapes an Answer thus—<hi>The report of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood is, That (tho' he was not out of his Apprenticeship) they never heard of him since.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Observator</hi> 126, says, <hi>this imports no more than that he had left the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and that by all</hi> the other Story, <hi>I was not accused of saying a Tankard was stoln, when it was not</hi>; But then I pray, to <hi>what purpose</hi> were these Stories told in Print? Is it not the usual Artifice of a Base and <hi>Cowardly Malice,</hi> to cast Scandals and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies on those they have a spight against, by <hi>sly Hints</hi> and Insinuations, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by seeming <hi>praise,</hi> sometimes by pretended <hi>good wishes,</hi> sometimes by dark <hi>Items,</hi> &amp;c. All which wound as <hi>deep,</hi> and both more certainly, and <hi>irremediably,</hi> than the most broad fac'd Aspersions: Thus the same <hi>Observator Numb</hi> 127, affirms, <hi>he has not charg'd me with changing the Screws.</hi> Here I appeal to all serious Readers, if this be not the <hi>grossest shuffling</hi> and prevarication, for what then is it he <hi>would be at</hi>? Or to what intent has he amused the World with all this Bustle and Clamour? But I think Mr. <hi>L'Estranges</hi> Design herein is <hi>not unknown:</hi> And I am sure I have in my Trade deeply <hi>felt</hi> (tho' most causelesly and unjustly) the <hi>Effects</hi> on't. And I know no Man that can promise himself security from having his Reputation <hi>fly-blown</hi> with the most <hi>damnable Scandals,</hi> if he happen to fall under the <hi>Observators</hi> displeasure, and such lewd Practises be suffered to pass with impunity.</p>
            <p>And now to the <hi>Old Dog-Story,</hi> which as the <hi>Observator</hi> tells it, runs thus, That I, <hi>June</hi> 16. 1682, sent to <hi>Sam</hi>'s Coffe-house for Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> to that Tavern (which he will have to be with a design of some <hi>horrid Plot</hi> against him) and soon after, he being a Man of foresight, not thinking fit to come, but sending some Friends, I with most <hi>Wicked Oaths and Imprecations denyed that I sent for him</hi>—This he undertakes to prove by the Testimony of three Boys of the <hi>Wonder-Tavern</hi>; how they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to give it, I will not enquire at present, but can prove <hi>some</hi> of them have since disowned it.</p>
            <p>But the Truth of the matter was thus, I and one <hi>Thomas Jennings</hi> a Cloth-drawer, a very Honest man, and Ingenious above most of his Quality, but <hi>frolicksome,</hi> and apt to <hi>Droll,</hi> went to the <hi>Old Dog</hi> Tavern, and having seated our selves in the <hi>Kitchin,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45023:7"/>
(no very fit Room for carrying on an Intrigue) <hi>Jennings</hi> having an occasion to speak with one, whom he thought might be at <hi>Sam's Coffee-house,</hi> ordered one <hi>Thomas Harris</hi> a little Boy in the House, (who has since own'd himself not to be above 12 years old, tho' <hi>Thompson</hi> advanced him to 20.) to go thither to <hi>Ask for him,</hi> and knowing, Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> frequented that Coffee-house, and what a kindness he had for me, merrily added—If he be not there, <hi>Inquire for</hi> Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> and tell him here <hi>are one or two would speak with him.</hi>—And tho' he spoke it with such an <hi>Air of Droll,</hi> that it might be easily known to be wholly <hi>Jest,</hi> nor was it imaginable a person of Mr. <hi>L'Estranges</hi> figure would on such a slight Invitation, without sending any Name, regard it, yet the Messenger being a <hi>raw Boy,</hi> not finding the Person he first ask't for there, very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally (it seems) dispatcht the latter part of his Message, and Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> being in the Coffee-house, and perhaps understanding from the Lad, I was in the Company, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, several Persons came to us from <hi>Sam</hi>'s, and began to quarrel with me for <hi>sending for</hi> Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi>; which I being wholly innocent of, as earnestly, as justly <hi>denyed,</hi> I having never had the least thought of any such matter; For as I had no Business with the Gentleman, so I had little reason to <hi>desire his Company</hi>; but that I used any such <hi>Oaths and Imprecations</hi> is false; And tho' of all mankind the <hi>Observator</hi> may be the unfittest to upbraid any body with <hi>swearing,</hi> I shall here subjoyn the Affidavit of the said <hi>Jennings,</hi> who sat close by me during all this time.</p>
            <p>Thomas Jennings, <hi>Citizen and Haberdasher of</hi> London, <hi>maketh Oath, that on Friday the</hi> 16<hi>th. of</hi> June <hi>Last about ten of the Clock in the Evening, this deponent went with Mr.</hi> Miles Prance <hi>to the Old-Dog Tavern within</hi> Ludgate, <hi>and sate down in the Kitching, with him, and this deponent sent one</hi> Thomas Harris <hi>(Servant to Mr.</hi> Allen, <hi>that keeps the said Tavern) to</hi> Sam's <hi>Coffee-house, to enquire for a friend of this Deponent, that he heard was there, and if he was not there, to enquire for one Mr.</hi> Roger L'Estrange, <hi>to tell him, there was one or two would speak with him, and some time after there came three or four persons from</hi> Sam's <hi>Coffee-house, into the aforesaid Kitching, where Mr.</hi> Miles Prance <hi>and this Deponent were, and began to quarrel with Mr.</hi> Prance, <hi>and using provoking words to him, to know his Reason, why he sent for</hi> Roger L'Estrange, <hi>which he denyed he did, but</hi> not with such Imprecations, as, by God's wounds, and by Gods Blood, and God dam' me, <hi>as this Deponent to the best of his knowledge heard, who was in the same Kitching with Mr.</hi> Miles Prance <hi>all the time; this deponent saith further, that he Enquired twice of the aforesaid</hi> Thomas Harris <hi>(that he sent) whether</hi> he ever heard <hi>Mr.</hi> Miles Prance swear such Oaths, <hi>who denied, he ever did, (as I, this deponent can prove by witnesses.)</hi>

            <p>Here's not one word of his being a Papist, for he might have come out of Curiosity to <hi>observe</hi> whether the Ceremonies here, were the same with those in other Mass-Houses beyond the Seas, where he acknowledges he has been at that Idolatry forty times, or, it maybe, being a Lover of Musick, he came only to hear the delicacy of the Voices; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever brought him in thither, there he was, let him protest never so much, and write a thousand <hi>Observators</hi> to the contrary: He says, indeed, I could not say, I saw him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; 'tis very right; and so I told His Majesty, and the Honourable Lords of the Council; for I saw no such thing, and therefore I Swore to no more than I saw; 'tis the fairer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that what I Swore was Truth.</p>
            <p>But as I never Swore, so neither did I ever Say, he was, or is a Papist; for I must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow, I do not know what Religion the Gentleman has been, is, or may be of, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he have any Religion at all. I Confess, I have seen him sometime since he was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned about being a Papist, at his Parish-Church, and once met him at the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; (to which he came, under such Circumstances as might justly make any sensible man tremble) but I have not met with any of the Parish that can say, That they ever saw him at Sacrament, or Church in times past; though he had liv'd, I believe, a dozen years before the Discovery of the Popish Plot, in that Parish.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, There is a Book with my Name to it, and wherein this Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit of mine is recited, and the Title, <hi>L'Estrange a Papist</hi>; The Matter of the Book I own; but that Title was added by the Book-Seller; for all the Title I intended was, <hi>Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Animadversions upon Roger L'Estrange, Esq</hi>; as evidently appears under my Hand, on the left-Hand Page of the Title, and in the first Page of the Book, and in several places of the Animadversions, and expresly, <hi>fol.</hi> 18. in these Words—<hi>Whether Mr.</hi> L'Estrange <hi>be a Papist or no, I will not determine.</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45023:8"/>
that he hath once since seen the said Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> at Mass in the Queens-Chappel, and saw him to be the same Man he formerly saw there.</p>
                  <p>This Affidavit was voluntarily made by Mr. <hi>Mowbray,</hi> and I knew nothing that be would or could swear it, till he had done it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Information of</hi> Richard Fletcher <hi>of St.</hi> Vedast <hi>alias</hi> Foster, London, <hi>Physician.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who saith, That about 3 years ago, he met <hi>Roger L'Estrange,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> at the Half-Moon Tavern in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> about Licensing a Book Intituled, <hi>The Works of</hi> Geber, <hi>an</hi> Arabian <hi>Prince, and Philosopher,</hi> and gave Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> a Guiney for his License; and a Discourse hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening about Religion; Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> asked, of what Religion this Informant was? Who answered, <hi>A Catholick L'Estrange</hi> Replyed; <hi>Are you a Roman Catholick</hi>? This Informant answered, <hi>That was Nonsence; Catholick being Vniversal, and not to be Circumscrib'd.</hi> Then <hi>L'Estrange</hi> bid this Informant explain himself. I answered, <hi>That Faith, that wrought the Fear of God and to do Righteously, doth declare those that are of the Catholick Church, which I take to be the Church of</hi> England. Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> then declared himself to be a Catholick of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to believe the Faith of that Church, and told this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, that his Definition was too large. This Informant then asked the said <hi>L'Estrange, Whether the Pope were the Head of that Church, of which he acknowledged himself a Member</hi>? Who answered, <hi>He was, and hoped e're long, many others would return to that Church,</hi> or to that effect, and further saith not.</p>
                  <p>This Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> was to me altogether a Stranger, nor can I imagine, why he should come in to Testifie such a thing, if it were not true; but for my own part 'tis plain, I swore no such matter, as that Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> was a Papist, nor will I trouble my self about it; at his own everlasting Peril be it.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another Scandal brought, <hi>Observator, Numb.</hi> 226, with this Title—<hi>Prance Cures the Kings-Evil</hi>; where he tells a Story, That I, offering a Woman a Pint of Wine, should tell her, she had <hi>the Evil, and Sware by G—I had Cured several Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies my self of that said Evil, by the great Faith I have in the King, that I could do any thing at Court, and that if she had ever a Neighbour she would oblige, I would see it done.</hi> And then should say to her, <hi>Come, prithee let me stroke thee a little, &amp;c.</hi> Now suppose it had been true, that I had play'd the Fool to talk at this rate, yet I conceive, it would not have been absolutely necessary to the preservation either of Church or State, that Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> should take the pains to Print it. But the whole Truth was thus, I and my Wife and some Neighbours being at the Horse-shoe, a Woman that was also a near Neighbour, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to come in, I askt her to drink, she began to complain to my Wife, how she was troubled with the Evil; I advised her to be touched by his sacred Majesty, which she said had been done, I replyed, then I doubted you have not Faith, but for my own part, I verily believe, that thousands by that means have received Cure, and thereupon told her, how once an acquaintance of mine, that was of a contrary O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and had argued against me, as if there were nothing in it, but conceit; it pleased God soon after to visit Him, his Wife, and Child, all with the same Disease; then he was willing to apply himself to His Majesties healing Hands, and I was an instrument to facilitate their access, and they were all three in a very short time after Cured, which Relation is a known Truth, and the Parties still living to justifie it. Therefore I told the Woman she should have Faith; this was all that pass'd (my Wife and several others being all the while there.) There was no swearing, no boasting, that I had Cured seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Families my self, or that I would do any thing at Court, nay, nor no Kissing, nor no stroking in the case; so that here are at least five notorious Lies all on a heap in one Column, and yet the Challenges the World to instance his mistakes in 470 Papers. But it may be, the Informer was to blame; for a dull Tool of a Razor-maker happening to be in Company, tho' he drank most of the White Wine call'd for by the Woman, yet refusing to pay his Club, was taxt for <hi>spunging,</hi> who, in revenge, 'tis like, ran to Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> with a Tale, and added as much as his sorry invention could furnish, and the Man of <hi>Observations</hi> the rest.</p>
                  <p>Now, who can but blush, to see a Gentleman of his Parts and Figure, a man of the Age of threescore and ten or thereabouts, if not upward, a Person that besides <hi>Quevedo</hi> and Politicks, has read <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Morals and Cardinal <hi>Bona,</hi> to see, I say, such an one spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the last minutes of his Life in blowing of Sope bubbles, in exercises more Childish, but only somewhat more mischievous than Taw and Span-farthing; and in making himself
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45023:9"/>
a Common Pack-Horse to bring to Town two or three times a Week in Form and Method the idle Tales of every malicious Cockscomb, and in Printing Stories that carry neither <hi>Truth</hi> nor <hi>Salt</hi> with them, but would be a Disgrace to the very Conversation of a Gossiping.</p>
                  <p>And now, I thought, as in <hi>pag.</hi> 35. I had done, and that the <hi>Screws,</hi> the <hi>Tankard,</hi> and the <hi>Old Dog-Story, &amp;c.</hi> had been competently accounted for, and the first <hi>Volume of the</hi> Observators enough explained, as far as I am materially concern'd; for, as my protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was before receiving of the Holy and Blessed Sacrament, (which I here again most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly avow to be in all points true) I think it not necessary to repeat any thing further, since all that the <hi>Observator</hi> has replyed thereunto, will appear to every considerate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, altogether <hi>sham</hi> and <hi>prevarication.</hi> And as I am not <hi>at leisure</hi> to play the fool with the <hi>Observator,</hi> meerly <hi>for Company,</hi> so I should <hi>lose</hi> by the Game, he getting Money (and perhaps Love and Credit with some people) for abusing of me; whereas I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my self wholly at my own Charge, and have no small difficulty to get a few <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Sheets</hi> printed, such is the dread of his Name, whilst <hi>he,</hi> besides the Elemosynary Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes in abundance, makes a Revenue <hi>weekly,</hi> by flurting out Papers fill'd (amongst other things, with which I meddle not) which most egregious <hi>Scandals</hi> upon me, designed for the Ruine of my self and my Family.</p>
                  <p>But still here's new Matter, an <hi>Observator</hi> of the Second Volume attacques me— I find I am to be made a continual Subject of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi>'s Wit and Malice, <hi>an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Incom</hi> to Madam <hi>Broom</hi> and her Author; And as a pleasant Lady defied her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant to frame a Letter; barring him only the use of half a score Modish-Words [As Flames, Divinity, Passion, Stars, Darts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] so I scarce know, whether it be possible for Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> in his present mood, to Compose an <hi>Observator</hi> without mention of, or some squint-Reflection upon <hi>Oats</hi> or <hi>Prance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us review the Paper, and I think the fairest way will be, to Transcribe it, and only add a few Notes.—.</p>

                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Observator,</hi> that feigns so many things as said there which were not, omits one matter which was the chief subject of our Debate; which was, whether Mr. <hi>L'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange did not hand the Paper, Intituled</hi> THE LORD <hi>PETRE</hi>'s LETTER, to the Press (which no doubt his Informers told him of, as well as the rest, and I believe 'twas that put him into such <hi>an heat,</hi> tho' he prudently declines to mention it) for I did tell the Gentlemen, that <hi>I heard,</hi> and doubted not to prove, that Mr. <hi>Braddil</hi> in <hi>Bartholomew Close,</hi> who Printed the Letter, had declared that Mr. <hi>L'Estrange brought or sent</hi> the same to him to be Printed, but withall gave him instructions <hi>not to Print his</hi> (the said Mr. <hi>Braddils) name to it:</hi> Now if this should happen to be true, that Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> was the occasion of publishing that Paper, <hi>wherein</hi> all our worthy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant-Writers, (and amongst them, the most Learned KING <hi>IAMES,</hi> and the Right Reverend the present Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>) who have charg'd the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with holding and teaching the Doctrine of <hi>Deposing</hi> and taking <hi>up Arms against,</hi> and <hi>Murdering</hi> of Heretical Kings, are traduc'd as <hi>false Accusers,</hi> and therein to have been <hi>Malicious</hi> and <hi>Ignorant</hi>; Nay, a Paper which on the same score flyes in the Face of the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> and directly gives her the Lye, who for many years in her Publick Establish't Liturgy, avow'd the <hi>Faith of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be Faction, and her Religion Rebellion.</hi> I would demand of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> or any of his <hi>Guinney-givers,</hi> whether the causing of such a Paper to be publish't, be to be numbered amongst the <hi>Good-services</hi> he has done for the <hi>Church of</hi> England.</p>

Accordingly I and another person present, gave Information thereof (<hi>viz.</hi> that such an one had to said and acknowledg'd) and thereupon <hi>Brooks</hi> was bound over, and I and the other person attended at Sessions to Evidence his Words, and a third Witness present, was ready to have <hi>deposed</hi> the Words, if it had proceeded to a Tryal. But when we desired an <hi>Indictment</hi> to be drawn, could not procure it. And so the matter was pass'd, tho' the party accused did not (as far as I could understand) <hi>deny the Words,</hi> but only pretended he was <hi>drunk</hi> when he spoke them. Upon which whole matter, whether I did any thing unbecoming a <hi>Loyal Subject,</hi> tender of the honour of the Royal Family, is left to Consideration.] Go on, <hi>Did, in</hi> February 1679, <hi>accuse Mr.</hi> Richard Fincham <hi>of being a Priest</hi> [he means Popish] <hi>which said Mr.</hi> Fincham <hi>was taken into the Custody of a Messenger upon that Information.</hi> [Here are several falsities; I did not <hi>accuse</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Fincham</hi> of being a Priest, nor secondly, was he <hi>taken</hi> on my Information; but as he was apprehended upon suspicion, so I was examined whether I knew him? and what account I could give of him?] <hi>brought before the Council to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Charge, and Mr.</hi> Miles Prance <hi>Silver-Smith there present to make good his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, The Council askt him how became to know Mr.</hi> Fincham <hi>to be a Priest, The Silver-Smith did there upon his Oath declare; That</hi> John Fincham <hi>the Brother of the said</hi> Richard <hi>told him so; upon this the Earl of</hi> Essex <hi>demanded of what Religion and what sort of man the said</hi> John Fincham <hi>was</hi>? Prance <hi>replyed, that he was a good Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-<hi>man, and a very honest Gentleman, and a Justice of Peace in the Isle of</hi> Ely, <hi>whereupon she said</hi> Richard Fincham <hi>was continued in Custody.</hi>

                  </sp>
                  <p>[This is a whole scheme of of untruths twisted up, and, to unravel it, I must rightly state the matter of Fact; The Question before the Council was, whether <hi>Richard Fincham</hi> was a Popish Priest? And I was examined to it, and tho' with a <hi>common-knowledge</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the most violent presumptions, I did not question but he was so, as having made him a <hi>Chalice</hi> and other Priestly Utensils, and knew he was generally reputed amongst Catholicks to be my Lady <hi>Savils Priest,</hi> tho' passing (as 'tis common) under the notion of her <hi>Steward,</hi> yet, not being able positively to swear him to be a Priest, because I had never been present, when he <hi>officiated the Mass,</hi> I was so justly tender in a Case, where a man's Life was concern'd, that I only deposed as to my belief grounded on hear-say, and that his <hi>Brother</hi> acknowledged it to me, which is most true, and if the Gentelman have a bad memory, I cannot help it.</p>
                  <p>And being hereupon interrogated by some of the Honourable Lords (that it was by the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> may be true, but do not remember it) touching the said Brother Mr. <hi>John Fincham,</hi> I answered, That he <hi>was a Justice of Peace</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Ely</hi>; and 'tis possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I might add, <hi>a very honest Gentleman, as far as I knew.</hi> But whereas the <hi>Observator</hi> averrs, that I then deposed he was <hi>a Good Church of</hi> England-man; (though for ought I know, or ever said, he may be so) yet that I <hi>then swore it,</hi> is false; for how should I assert such a thing, that never had an opportunity to see him in <hi>a Protestant Church</hi> in my life? And besides, it thwarts that Evidence which I then truly gave, (and which I should not, but upon this provocation recite) for my own Vindication (not to cast any Scandal on the Gentleman) according to the Copy, as it was taken and delivered to me soon after I was examined by one of the Sub-Clarks, belonging to the Honourable Board, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>That not long before the Plot was Discovered, I went to one Mrs. <hi>Halls</hi> in <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle-Court,</hi> about some business to Mr. <hi>Jeremy Jennings</hi> a Priest belonging to Mr. <hi>Ramsey,</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45023:11"/>
living near <hi>Norwich,</hi> where I met with Mr. <hi>Fincham,</hi> a Justice of the Peace for the life of <hi>Ely,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Poulton,</hi> a Jesuit, and some others, (whom I knew to be Priests though I knew not their Names) after Mr. <hi>Fincham</hi> was gone, I asked Mr. <hi>Jennings,</hi> what he came thither for, and how he durst trust himself with him, being a Justice of the Peace. <hi>Pough</hi> said he) <hi>he is acquainted with many Priests in that Country, as their Friend, and will do us no harm, but what good he can, being a Catholick in his Heart, and will shew himself so, if the times turn, but now cannot in respect of his Place; yet, says he, he does us all the kindness he can.</hi> Then speaking to Mrs. <hi>Hall,</hi> the Landlady of the House, thereof, she replyed, <hi>He comes often hither, when he is in Town.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whether Mr. <hi>John Fincham</hi> knew these Persons, that he then was there in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with, to be <hi>Popish Priests,</hi> or whether, what they said of him were true, I know not, they being Men of Intrigue, who often love to cast Scandals on the most Zealous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, to render them suspected; all the intent I recite for, is to shew how improbable it was, that, at the same time I swore this, I should also swear (as Mr. <hi>Observator</hi> says) the same Gentleman to be a <hi>good Church of</hi> England-<hi>man</hi>; though still, as aforesaid, for ought I know, or ever said, he may be <hi>such.</hi> My acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Richard Fincham</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intimate; for besides the work I had done for him, I have yet several <hi>Letters</hi> of his by me (though more or less) which I am ready to shew his Brother, or any Gentleman that desires it, Dated from <hi>Red-Hall</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> Subscribed—<hi>Your Friend, Servant, and Country-man, Richard Fincham,</hi> and the like obliging Terms, and particularly one Dated <hi>January</hi> 25, 77<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby having ordered me the Receipt of some Money, he has these words—<hi>I have by the bearer hereof (a Protestant Gentleman, and Neighbour of mine) sent you, &amp;c.</hi> Which Parenthesis, Protestant Gentleman, will, I think, to any unbyassed understanding, signifie no less than an <hi>Item</hi> given me, that I should not take notice to him, of the Writers being a a <hi>Priest,</hi> or to call him <hi>Father Fincham,</hi> as amongst Roman Catholicks is usual, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such Precaution I might have done: Now this Gentleman that paid me the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, was, as I understand, a Justice of Peace near <hi>Leeds,</hi> though I have forgot his Name; if he be still living, he cannot but remember it. In a word, whether Mr. <hi>Richard Fincham</hi> be a <hi>Popish Priest</hi> or no, if Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> (that seems so intimate with the Family) will be pleas'd to tell the World his Lodgings at present; 'tis odds, but somthing more may be said.</p>
                  <p>In the interim, here his Apologist, the <hi>Observator, Mr. Richard Fincham immediately upon this proceeding, gave his Brother</hi> John Fincham <hi>an account of what had passed, by the very next Post, Who applyed himself forthwith, upon the receipt of the Letter, to</hi> Francis Bell <hi>
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> (a Justice of the Peace in the said Isle) before whom, he swore this following Affidavit.</hi>

                     <q>
                        <hi>John Fincham</hi> of <hi>Outwell,</hi> within the Isle of <hi>Ely</hi> and County of <hi>Cambridge</hi> Esquire, did upon the 5th of <hi>March,</hi> 1678, make this following Affidavit before <hi>Francis Bell,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> one of his Majesties Justices of the Peace of the said Isle</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That whereas the said <hi>John Fincham,</hi> is informed that one Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> hath lately declared upon Oath, to the Lords of His Majesties most Honourable Privy-Council, that he the said <hi>Mr. Prance</hi> was told by the said <hi>John Fincham,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Richard Fincham,</hi> his Brother was a Priest. He this Deponent doth Swear and Aver, that the same is wholly false and untrue; and that he is, and hath been so far from ever saying so, that he doth depose, he doth not know any such thing, as his Brothers being a Priest; nor did he ever know the said <hi>Mr. Prance,</hi> or to his knowledge, ever see him in his whole life. This Affidavit being sent up to the Lord Chancellor, the King and Council there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ordered <hi>Mr. Fincham</hi>'s Discharge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to this Affidavit of Mr. <hi>Richard Fincham</hi>'s, as far as it contradicts mine, I avow mine still to be true, and if I am not misinform'd, by the Civil Law at least, a <hi>Domestick Witness,</hi> that is, one so near related, is scarce allowable, or at least lyes under suspicions —but leaving that, I shall only remark, That the Gentleman swears, he doth not <hi>KNOW</hi> any such thing as his <hi>Brother's being a Priest,</hi> which signifies no more than that he did not <hi>see him take Orders</hi>; now can it be imagined, (especially at such a juncture as that was) but the Gentleman, had he not <hi>believed his Brother to be a Priest,</hi> would have added—<hi>nor believes him so to be,</hi> or some such words?</p>
                  <p>Note also, that the <hi>Observator</hi> says, what I deposed was in <hi>February</hi> 79. And this Affidavit of Mr. <hi>John Fincham</hi>'s, he dates <hi>March</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> 1678, (almost a whole year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) which would intimate, that Mr. <hi>John Fincham</hi> swore <hi>prophetically,</hi> or by way of prevention. But the <hi>Observator</hi> Numb. 10. having recollected himself, pretends 'twas a mistake for want of a <hi>fraction</hi>; and if it were so, I believe it was the <hi>first Affidavit in</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:45023:11"/>
England, that e're was Dated with such a Fraction, as 1678/9, but since he is pleased to lay the blame on <hi>the Sot of a Compositor,</hi> as young Princes in Schools are whipt by <hi>Proxy,</hi> and perhaps old Authors have the like priviledge; let it pass.</p>
                  <p>But whereas Mr. <hi>John Fincham</hi> Swears he never <hi>knew Prance</hi> (to his knowledge, <hi>or saw him in his life.</hi> I must remembe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which this Deponent answered, He liveth very near me in the Country; and thereupon he, this Deponent; did tell him, it was reported, that he should say he was a Papist; to which Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> replyed, He was a Papist, and he would justify him to be a Papist; and he believed that he had a Priest at his House at that time; and that he knew him to have been in the Company of four or five Jesuits at a time: And the said Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> did also give other reproachful Speeches, which he, this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, did not take any particular notice of.</q>

And tho' possibly I might then have had some pretence to have concern'd my self in the Election of Parliament-men for that County, yet, I appeal to all the Inhabitants, whether ever I endeavoured to move any <hi>one</hi> of them (except only this worthy <hi>Squire,</hi> if he say true) to give their Votes for Mr. <hi>Partherich</hi> or <hi>any other</hi> person whatsoever? For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I living elsewhere, never thought it fit to concern my self with any such matters. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Mr. <hi>Squire</hi> says, I said, Mr. <hi>Justice hath a Priest now in his House,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Gent</hi> says. I said—<hi>I believed he had a Priest</hi> at his House at that time. Now he that <hi>forgot</hi> so much, and <hi>took no particular notice of our talk,</hi> as he says, might possibly <hi>misremember</hi> all the rest. 3<hi>ly.</hi> Mr. <hi>Gent</hi> says, I askt him, where <hi>one Mr.</hi> Fincham was? To which the Deponent answered, <hi>he liveth very near in the Country</hi>; a likely business! as if I, that was born within five miles of Mr. Justice <hi>Fincham,</hi> and have been so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Country, I, that was so well acquainted with <hi>Richard Fincham,</hi> so intimate with his Brother the Goldsmith, and with another Brother of theirs the Sea-man, I that have visited their near Relation, <hi>Fincham</hi> in <hi>Wisbitch-Goal,</hi> besides my familiarity with the Justice in <hi>London,</hi> at his House at <hi>Well,</hi> &amp;c. should yet be such an <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus</hi> to ask the advice of this <hi>small Lawyer,</hi> where (forsooth) one Mr. <hi>Fincham</hi> was, and receive for answer, as News—<hi>That he liv'd near in the Country</hi>—Let all Mankind judge of the probability of such an Information.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Mr. <hi>Squires</hi> own words (as here Printed, for if either of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are wrong'd, they must seek satisfaction from their Over-officious friend the <hi>Observator</hi>) I say by his own words it appears, there was a <hi>fewd</hi> and something of <hi>Malice</hi> in the Case; for at the same time, he charges me (tho' falsly) with saying, That I <hi>wondered the Justices of Peace should be so much Fools, or had so little Wit, as to make him Chief Constable.</hi> And I might add, that Mr. <hi>Gent,</hi> the other Informer (as they are here styled) was not likely to be Guilty of any good will to me; retaining so this day a Bond of mine, about the surrender of some Land, the Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is satisfied, and the whole Story of which I am not willing to tire the Reader with, unless further provok'd.</p>
            <p>These Remarks being premised, I shall next subjoin the Truth of the matter of Fact, not in my own words, but attested by the Person that was then with me, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pask,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> one well known to be far from any suspicion of Disloyalty, who immediately after this bustle happened at <hi>March,</hi> did with his own hand, write down and deliver to me this following Attestation, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <hi>Memorandum,</hi> On the 8<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>August</hi> 1679. Mr. <hi>Miles Prance</hi> and my self were at the <hi>White-Heart</hi> Inn in <hi>March,</hi> asking for Mr. <hi>Gent,</hi> The Landlord answered, he was in the House, Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> went to the Company's Room, desired leave, if not bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, where he was received seemingly in kindness, and also desired me to walk in: Where presently Mr. <hi>Squire</hi> and Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> asked him, if he was come to choose <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
                  <hi>Partherich</hi> Parliament-Man, intimating he was a dissaffected Person, and not fit to be chose. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> made answer to Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> he was an Ass, for to tell him such a thing, and he was not to acquaint him, what he came about. Mr. <hi>Squire</hi> and Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> made answer, that <hi>Prance</hi> was a Rogue, and <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
                  <hi>Patherich</hi> a Phanatick Rogue, so was all that stood for him. They abused Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> with the Language of Rogue, a fellow not to be trusted, a murthering Rogue, and what he had said was all false, bid him make haste home, and give the King Confession.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But further, most true it is, that this Mr. <hi>Squire,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Harrison,</hi> did not only use ill Language to me, but pursued me to one Mrs. <hi>Walsomes</hi> House, threatned to knock me o'th' head, and throw me into the River, and afterwards offered to Assault me in my Lodging, so that Mr. <hi>Pask</hi> was forc'd to draw his Sword to keep them down. For which I did, as justly I might, tell them I would call them to an account, which it seems, he is pleased to express by the Phrase; <hi>That I would have most of the Gentlemen in the Country up.</hi> But whether this Titular <hi>Squire</hi> and Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> the <hi>Tape-seller</hi> be <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> or <hi>most
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45023:12"/>
of the Gentlemen</hi> of the Country, I leave to the Heralds. This is certain, I had sought Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from the Rioters for the abuse, had not <hi>Squire Williamson</hi> interceded, alledging they were <hi>in Drink,</hi> and so I civilly pass'd it by, and never heard more of that matter, till now I found the Gentlemens Information in Print—Lets go on, the <hi>Observator</hi> next brings to light two other Papers, in these words.</p>
            <q>You shall now have Two Certificates of <hi>August</hi> the 12th, <hi>1679,</hi> in Justification of M. <hi>John Fincham.</hi>

            <p>I question not the <hi>Truth</hi> of these Certificates; for neither do I know, nor ever said (with the leave of the <hi>Observator,</hi> and his Informers, be it spoken) that Justice <hi>Fincham</hi> was a <hi>Papist</hi> (and yet had I no value for an Oath (as the <hi>Observator</hi> pretends) I might as readily have Sworn that, and that I saw him at <hi>Mass</hi>; for Mass was frequently said in Mrs. <hi>Hall</hi>'s House; but I did never see him so concerned, and therefore only deposed what I knew, and what I saw and heard) therefore I again Repeat it, that I never knew, or said the Gentleman was a Papist or <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, or that 4 or 5, or any <hi>Romish</hi> Priests were in his House. But this I will say, That I conceive these Certificates might have been <hi>better worded</hi> in favour of the Gentleman, than only by these Terms of his, <hi>Complyance with,</hi> and <hi>Regard to</hi> the Commands of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> since it would have done well (especially at such a Juncture as that was) to have likewise expressed his Zeal in and for the Doctrines of our Church, and to have Certified his Active diligence in Discountenancing and Suppressing Papists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Within a Trifle, <hi>Trimmer, July 13. 1681,</hi> It happened. That <hi>Prance</hi> and another with him, came into the House of one <hi>Greenwood</hi> in the Isle, where <hi>John Fincham, Henry Oxburgh,</hi> and <hi>Edm. Williamson,</hi> Esquires, were in Company: Mr. <hi>Williamson</hi> having told Mr. <hi>Fincham,</hi> which of the two was <hi>Prance</hi>; Mr. <hi>Fincham</hi> upon this, fell to talk with <hi>Prance</hi> at a distance, of his being in the Country, about two years before, which he owned. And he told him of a Neighbour of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one Mr. <hi>Fincham,</hi> that complained of very ill Language he had given him. But <hi>Prance</hi> denied it, and desired much to know how the Story went: So Mr. <hi>Fincham</hi> up and told <hi>France</hi> the whole Business, according to the Informations; who Swore heartily, 'twas no such matter, and that he never spake an ill word of Mr. <hi>Fineham,</hi> but knew him to be a Protestant and a worthy man. This passed in a great deal of Company: But <hi>Prances</hi> Eyes are as bad by Day-light, as <hi>Oats</hi> are by Candle-light; and he knew Mr. <hi>Fincham</hi> no more than the Man in the Moon, till at last Mr. <hi>Fincham</hi> himself brought the Silver-Smith to a better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>I am apt to think Mr. <hi>Fincham</hi> will Con the <hi>Observator</hi> no thanks for this Paragraph, for sure the whole Town of <hi>March,</hi> who were almost all Alarm'd with this Accident, have not quite forgot it. However for their sakes, and the Justices, and my own, I must set the Story right.</p>
            <p>'Tis most true, that about the time mentioned, I and another or two happened to come to <hi>Greenwoods</hi> House, being an Inn, where several Gentlemen, and amongst them, Mr. Justice <hi>Fincham,</hi> were (as I afterwards understood) about taking <hi>Horse</hi> to Ride away, but Mr. <hi>Fincham</hi> having, as I believe, some design to expose me, after they saw me come in, they staid, and Squire <hi>Williamson,</hi> who was one of the Gentlemen, came out, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me into their Room; I excused my self at first, as being weary with my Journey,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45023:13"/>
but at last consented, when I and my Company came in, there were several Gentlemen in the Room, and some that I did <hi>not know.</hi> Presently some of them began to ask me <hi>what News</hi>? I told them, I seldome much minded any News, but my own business, and besides had been several days out of <hi>London,</hi> and so could tell them nothing, but what I believed they had already heard, then one of them askt me, <hi>if I knew Justice</hi> Fincham? To which I answered, yes, I do, and presently looking amongst the Company (for I was but newly come into the Room) I saw the Justice leaning on a Bench or Couch, with his <hi>Mounteer-Cap</hi> placed in an odd unusual fashion, <hi>viz.</hi> the corners not forwards and backwards, but <hi>cross</hi> his Head, sideways, looking in that posture somewhat like a Country Morrice-dancer, with a <hi>Cushion</hi> on his Head; but for all that I knew his Worship well enough, and addressing my self to him with the respect becoming me, said — Mr. <hi>Fincham, your humble Servant.</hi> At which all the Company fell a laughing, (and his Worships being deceived in thinking I should not know him in that posture, became soon after a frequent talk in the Town.) And then, and not <hi>till then,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fincham</hi> did speak, (for before I was come into the Room he had not utter'd a word, much less askt such questions, and had such discourse with me as the <hi>Observator</hi> pretends) but then indeed he did say, that he <hi>never saw mebefore in his life,</hi> that he knew of, <hi>nor never told me that his Brother was a Priest.</hi> But as I then to his face justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the latter, so as to the first, I gave him some tokens to refresh his memory, as my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his House to see his Brothers Son, and his particular Entertainment of me there. But he spake not a word <hi>about my calling him Papist,</hi> nor was there any the least mention of these <hi>Informations,</hi> nor any <hi>swearing</hi> heartily or unheartily, as the <hi>Observator</hi> suggests. And I believe Squire <hi>Williamson</hi> will do me the right to justifie this to be in substance the truth of all that then past between us; and there were also present two other Persons, who will be ready to attest it. Novv since Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has the Conscience so grossly to pervert and <hi>falsifie</hi> a matter thus <hi>Notorious,</hi> vvhat esteem his Writings in other Cases (as relateing to me I mean, for I meddle no further) may deserve, let the World judge.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Observator</hi> Numb. 10. of the 2<hi>d.</hi> Volumn he has some touches at me, and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons up several Affidavits of mine, and says, <hi>they took no effect,</hi> yes <hi>Sir,</hi> they took all the effect I desired, which was only to acquaint the Magistrates with the Truth of what they examined me about, as far as I knew and no further; and the tenderness I used, strongly argues the candor and sincerity of my Evidence, no way casts any disparagement upon it; if the Law in some Cases require <hi>two</hi> Witnesses, and for want thereof, some, I justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, were released, or if perhaps others were not prosecuted, what is that to me. The Author of the late Paper, pretending to be a Reply to the <hi>Observations</hi> on the Lord <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre's Letter,</hi> argues the veracity of the late Evidence, because so many that they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are <hi>at liberty</hi>; Mr. <hi>L'Estrange for the very same reason,</hi> would render mine unworthy of belief. These two Authors should best consult together and reconcile themselves.</p>
            <p>But I fear I have <hi>wearied</hi> the Reader as well as my self, in taking so much notice of, and detecting the malice, the falsities, the shams and idle Tales, which the <hi>Observator</hi> has invented, or pickt up and spread about me; which of themselves sufficiently appear to every judicious Eye to be mere <hi>Calumnies</hi> and the effects of a <hi>cankered spleen.</hi> However to undeceive all the World, if they are not resolv'd to believe his Fictions, in defiance both of Truth and Reason, I have <hi>once for all,</hi> taken this pains, resolving never to trouble my self further with the noise he shall make about them; henceforth he may talk his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I shall take no more notice on't, than to hear a Serpent <hi>Hiss,</hi> or an Ass <hi>Bray.</hi> Only I desire all Persons to bind up this my Answer and Defence with their <hi>Observators,</hi> and that as oft as Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> shall repeat the same Stories (for he has much of the <hi>Cuckow</hi> in him, and sings an hundred times over the same Note) they would be so just, as to turn as ofen to these Papers, where I doubt not, but every impartial peruser, will find a sufficient Answer thereunto.</p>
            <p>And so I take leave of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> who being an Antient Gentleman, and by the Course of Nature on the brink of the Grave; I wish, he would better regulate his Conduct, and not spend his precious time, and abuse those Great Parts, God has given him, in such trifling, false, mischievous and scandalous Stories against a Neighbour, a Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and a Member of the same Protestant Church (if he be really what he professes:) who, as I never wrong'd him; so I am ready, on his acknowledgment, heartily to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him all these injuries: And pray God to give him the Grace to Repent, before he be called to that dreadful Tribunal, before which we must both shortly appear.</p>
