            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>ifteene yeares (most reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) are now fully expired, since I first began to write against the professed aduersaries of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Christian, Catholike, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique, and old <hi>Romane</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; I meane the late Byshops of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Romish</hi> Cardinals, the Iesuites, Iesuited Papistes, and Gunpowder-popish-vassals: In which space of time, I haue published so many Bookes in defence of the Catholique Fayth, as are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber correspondent to the yeares. A very long time it was, (the argument in hand considered,) before I could any way extort any Answere to any of my Bookes. Howbeit, when the Iesuites after mature deliberation, had seriously pondered with them-selues, that through their long si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, many Papistes did vtterly renounce Poperie, and ioyfully embrace the Catholique Fayth, this day sinceerely
<pb facs="tcp:14089:3"/>
professed in our Church: then they became so ashamed of their silence in that behalfe, that in the yeare 1605. they published a litle Pamphlet, tearming it, <hi>The forerunner of</hi> Bels <hi>downefall</hi>: <note place="margin">Fiue Bookes were printed, but hid vnder a Pipkin, least they should be seene, or burnt with the Sunne.</note>wherein they auouched with brasen faces, that they had written fiue Bookes fiue yeares afore that time, against my <hi>Motiues</hi> and my <hi>Suruey of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie.</hi> And least it should be obiected against them, that it cannot be so, seeing we can neither see them, nor heare of them; the <hi>Fore-runner</hi> telleth vs very grauely, (but to their endlesse shame,) that the Answere is suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and vpon iust occasion stayed from the publication. Alasse, alasse, how are silly Papistes bewitched, with the iugling and deceitfull dealing of these seducers? They haue been buzzing about the answering of my two first Bookes,<note place="margin">My Booke of Motyues, and Booke of Suruey.</note> (as they them selues tell vs,) almost the space of sixe whole yeares: and when after their great paines and labours of so many yeares, they had framed the answere in the best manner they could deuise; then they suppressed the same vpon iust occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as their <hi>Forerunner</hi> in their name telleth vs.<note place="margin">Forerunner, pag 15.</note> What, haue they bestowed fiue yeares in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fiue Bookes against two of my Bookes, and dare not to this day publish any one of them?<note place="margin">To what end were they written, but to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed?</note> Out vpon lying lippes; Out vpon trayterous Iesuites, and Iesuiticall deceyuers of the world; The trueth is, that there is no trueth in these men: And it is an euident testimonie, that they are not indeed able to answere; for otherwise, they would not for very shame haue protested so much in print, and haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed nothing lesse. I am verily perswaded, that they will neuer during my life, (which they wish to be short, and therefore haue they prouided my Winding sheete, and other indirect meanes, to take away my life,) frame any
<pb facs="tcp:14089:3"/>
full and direct Answere to the said Bookes; because in trueth, all the Iesuites in the Christian world, are not able to performe it, the trueth being so cleare &amp; forcible against them. After the <hi>Fore-runner,</hi> a pretensed Answere, was published in the yeare 1606. against the <hi>Downe fall of Poperie.</hi> For refutation of which silly Pamphlet, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed my Booke, intituled, <hi>The Iesuites Antepast</hi>; (which seemeth to their daintie mouthes so vntouthsome, that I deeme, it will serue also for their <hi>Post-past,</hi>) as I had formerly published an other Reply, (intituled, <hi>The Popes Funerall,</hi>) to the <hi>Fore-runner of the Downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall.</hi> Now lately in the end of the yeare 1608. an other pretensed Answere (a silly thing God wote,) was published against my Booke, intituled, <hi>The Tryall of the new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> This Pamphlet came to my handes in Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber last; at which time, I was very ill in body, and also distant aboue one hundred Myles from mine owne Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the want whereof, at that time, was farre more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to me, then were all my painefull infirmities of body; In the midst of which, whiles I am writing for the trueth, I find no litle comfort: The case so standing, albeit your Grace was then aboue fourtie Myles from me; yet did I presume to bemone my selfe vnto your Grace for the supply of my present want of Bookes; with whom my suite found such intertainement, as I neither did, nor euer could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Bookes indeed I expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that your Grace should also send them to me vpon your owne charges, most freely and Christianly offering to send me your whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie, (which is indeed, a Librarie most excellent,) if I shouldst and in need thereof, it seemed to mee such an honorable sauour, as that I could not now in duetie, omit
<pb facs="tcp:14089:4"/>
to make this publique acknowledgement thereof. The Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites and Iesuited Gunpowder Papistes, not able to endure the sound of my Tryall, wherein Poperie was tearmed and prooued the New Religion; haue suborned (as it seemeth) <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> that lewd companion and trayterous <hi>Fryer,</hi> to publish that supposed Refutation, the summe and substaunce whereof, they had (no doubt) collected and framed to his handes. His name he dareth not disclose, least the great disgrace, (which can not but insue vpon that silly Answere,) should eternally cleaue vnto him, as being one, who not able to defend <hi>Poperie,</hi> by honest and Christian-like proceeding, bestirreth himselfe to effect the same, by continuall forgerie, by lying, by coozenage, and deceitfull dealing; as in this Booke I shall make apparant: Wherein, what my selfe haue effected, or rather God in mee, let the iuditious and honest Reader iudge; and for that which he findeth well done, giue God the glorie. Such as it is, I dedicate vnto your Grace; as vnto him, who hath deserued my vttermost service. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty blesse your Grace, with many happy yeares in this life; and with eternall glory, in the life to come. Amen. Iunij 3. 1609.</p>

It is one thing to call the Byshop of <hi>Rome,</hi> Father of Fathers; an other thing, to call him vniuersall Byshop, or vniuersall Father.

betweene a peculiar, and an vsuall name. A peculiar name perteineth solely and onely vnto one: but that an vsuall name may agree to many at once, it cannot be denyed.

But our <hi>Fryer</hi> in thus disputing, doth prooue him selfe a very Daw. For he must learne to know, that the newnesse of a thing may be considered two wayes; absolutely, and respectiuely.

But the famous Councelles of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> made no reckoning of such falsifications and proud attempts.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14089:56"/>
the King hath a sacred soueraigntie ouer all the people within his dominions, as ouer his naturall Subiectes and loyall Seruantes.<note place="margin">Marke well, the precedent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, and aphorismes, &amp; this is very cleere.</note> But the Pope hath no soueraigntie ouer transmarine and forraigne Christians; as I haue already prooued. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the King, though negatiuely he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Lawes to be enacted; yet doth he not make any new Lawes affirmatiuely to tie all his Subiectes, without the consent of his Lordes spirituall, Lordes temporall, and the Commons of his Kingdomes.

               <p>I answere: first, that seeing the Pope (as is alreadie prooued) taketh vpon him to change the nature of thinges, by applying the substantiall partes of one thing to an other; to make some thing of nothing, the proper action of God in creation; to depose Kinges, to translate Empires, and to bestow the same at his good pleasure; to make it Sacriledge to dispute of his power; to terrifie men so with Fire and Faggot, and with thunderboltes of cursing Excomunications, that though hee carry thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes to Hell, yet may no man say; Why doest thou so?

handes; at such time as he receiued the Crowne, and was annoynted King. Lastly, (and this striketh dead) that Kings as Kings serue God; when they doe those things, which none but Kinges can doe. If this golden Periode were soundly vnderstood,<note place="margin">Marke well for Christs sake.</note> and perfectly kept in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; it alone, would be enough to trample Pope and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie vnder foote. For, I pray you (sir <hi>Frier</hi>) did not <hi>Constantinus</hi> surnamed the great, <hi>Theodesius</hi> the elder, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius</hi> the younger, and <hi>Martianus,</hi> gather the foure first generall Councels (of <hi>Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>) which Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> did reuerence as the foure Ghospels? did they not call the same Synodes, as they were Emperours, Kinges, and Monarches? I wote they did: it is already prooued; it can not be denyed. What? Did not <hi>Reccaredus</hi> as King, commaunde all the Byshops of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Gallicia</hi> to assemble themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at <hi>Toledo,</hi> there to decide and determine causes ecclesiasticall? did he not tell them the cause, why he sent for them? did he not sit downe among them? did he not define with them? did he not subscribe before all the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops? did he not confirme the Decrees and Canons of the Councell, with his royall edict? we haue already seene it; wee haue viewed the very wordes; it is prooued most manifestly. Now, let vs duely ponder, and throughly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; what of necessitie must be inferred heereupon. <hi>S.

The reason is <hi>S. Austens,</hi> when he resolutely auoucheth; that while Kinges serue God as Kinges, they doe that which none but Kinges can doe: for, if Kinges as Kinges, call and confirme Councels; none doubtlesse which are no Kinges, can doe the same. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14089:65"/>
no Byshop, (no not the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>) hath authoritie to gather Councels, or to confirme the same. Two thinges onely, the Pope may in shew of wordes seeme to obiect for himselfe. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>To the former Obiection, this is my answere. <label type="milestone">

To the latter I answere in this maner. First, that how and in what sort the Pope is King, it is plenteously prooued in the tenth Conclusion of this present Chapter: To which place, I referre the Reader, for his full satisfaction in this behalfe. Secondly, that by the Popes owne Law, whosoeuer is <hi>Possessor malae fidei</hi> in the beginning, can haue no iust title by prescription in the ending. Thirdly, that if we suppose and graunt him to be the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King of <hi>Jtaly</hi>; yet can no more be rightly inferred therevpon, saue onely that hee can call and confirme Councels within <hi>Jtaly,</hi> and make Lawes to his subiectes of the same Kingdome.

               <p>I answere: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, that the Superroyall counterfeite Power which I deride in your Pope; is, the deposing of Kinges, the translating of Empires, the making of some thing, of nothing; the applying of the substantiall partes of one thing to an other, the aduauncing of himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue euery thing that hath beeing, and such like: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue spoken and intreated very plentifully, in the Conclusions of this present Chapter. Secondly, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in the preaching of the Word and administration
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14089:68"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the Sacramentes, the chosen Minister hath onely the charge and authoritie to execute them; yet hath Gods annoynted Prince, the supreame charge and soueraigne authoritie, to commaunde the execution thereof; as also to correct and to punish the Minister, for the neglect of his duetie in that behalfe: For though the execution per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne to the Ministers, yet the prouision, direction, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment, care, &amp; ouersight, (which is the Supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement indeed) perteyneth onely, solely, &amp; wholly to the Prince. For which cause King <hi>Ezechias</hi> highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in holy Writ, though he were but very,<note place="margin">2. Par. 29. v. 5.11.15.</note> young in yeares, did for all that, in regard of his prerogatiue Royall &amp; Supreame authoritie in causes Ecclesiasticall, call the Priestes &amp; Leuites, his Sonnes; charging them to heare him, and to follow his Commaundement; for so are the wordes of the Text. Yea, <hi>Josias</hi> that famous King, did sundry times commaund the Hie Priest. But of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, I haue intreated so copiously in other Bookes,<note place="margin">4. Reg. 23. v. 1.2.3.4.</note> as it is heere a thing needlesse, to stand longer vpon the same. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that I graunt freely &amp; willingly, that Ministers in the action of their Ecclesiasticall function &amp; Church-ministerie, are aboue all Christians, aboue Queenes, Kinges, and Monarches, representing the person of God, teaching, admonishing, &amp; rebuking them, as others; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the godly example therein of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the Baptist. Yea, I further graunt, that if the vices of Princes, Kinges, and Monarches, be notorious &amp; scandalous to the whole Church, then the Byshops may denounce such Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, to be enemies to the trueth, aduersaries to God, and no true members of the Church; but to be holden for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne people, and as Ethnickes &amp; Publicanes,<note place="margin">How wicked Kings, ought to be dealt withall.</note> vntill they giue true signes of vnfeyned repentance. But withall, this must euer be remembred and most loyalty obserued, of all Byshoppes in Christes Church; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Prince (though full of manifest vices, &amp; most notorious crimes in the world) may neuer be shunned, neither of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14089:69"/>
people, nor yet of the Byshoppes. The reason is at hand; Because God hath appoynted him to be their Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Much lesse may the people forsake their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to his sacred prerogatiue Royall and supereminent Power: And least of all (for it is most execrable, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and plaine diabolicall) may either the people alone, or the Byshoppes alone, or both ioyntly togeather, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their vndoubted Soueraigne; though a Tyrant, Heretique, or Apostatate: for euen in that case, all loyall obedience and faythfull seruice in all ciuill affayres, and whatsoeuer else is lawfull, must of duetie be yeeled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Hee may be admonished by Gods true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in the pulpit &amp; court of Conscience, if his vices be publike &amp; scandalous to the Church: but he may neuer be iudged in the court of their Consistorie, touching his power Royall and Princely prerogatiue. Their power is onely to admonish and rebuke him, and to pray to God to amende what is amisse. Hee hath no Iudge that can punish him, but the great Iudge of all; euen the God of Heauen. The popish Cardinall <hi>Hugo</hi> deliuereth this most Christian doctrine, though to the vtter confusion of the Pope.<note place="margin">Hugo Card. in Psa. 50.</note>

not erre when he defineth iudicially; yet this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> teacheth and telleth vs plainely, that in his dayes,<note place="margin">Euseb.

And for all that, <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> was euer reputed an Holy Byshoppe in his life time, and a glorious Martir, being dead. But if the Byshoppe of <hi>Rome</hi> had been Christes Vicar, and so priuiledged as our Papistes beare the world in hand hee is; then doubtlesse, <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> must needes haue been an Heretike, and so reputed and esteemed in the Church of God. Yea, if any Christian shall this day doe or affirme, as <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> did; or publikely deny the Popes falsely pretended Primacie, in any place, countrey, territories, or dominions, where Poperie beareth the sway, then without all peraduenture, hee must be burnt at a Stake with Fire and Faggot for his paines. Of which Subiect, the Reader may find a larger Discourse, in my <hi>Christian Dialogue.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that while <hi>S. Austen</hi> sayth, that <hi>S.

For, if <hi>S.

Fourthly, that if counterfeite Bookes, Histories, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, were wholly, layde away; Poperie (beleeue mee,) would soone fall of it selfe: For, in this supposed rescript of Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> directed to the Byshoppes of the East; there is such aboundance of matter for the Popes Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lordly Soueraigntie, as would certainly serue his turne, if it could so be admitted.

               <p>I answere: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, that if a Penall Law were made to hang vpon the Gallowes, all falsaries and lying wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; then ought this impudent &amp; shamelesse <hi>Iesuite</hi> to be hanged many times, where once would serue the turne: For, if we shall search fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the East to the West, &amp; from the North to the South; yet shall we neuer be able to find out a more shamelesse lyar, or a more notorious falsary, then is this <hi>Iesuite.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that if Popery were not the New Religion in verie deed; such forgerie, such lying, and such deceitfull dealing, would not be vsed in defence
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14089:73"/>
thereof. Out vpon lying <hi>Jesuites</hi>; fie vpon rotten Popery; away with all such beggerly trumperie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that the Doctrine by me deliuered, both in the next Chapter, and in my <hi>Suruay,</hi> is so farre from being as the lying <hi>Jesuite</hi> impudently auoucheth, (who seemeth to be composed intrinsecally of lying) that it is flatte against the same, and able to torment the <hi>Jesuites</hi> conscience (if he haue any left) while breath is in his body. God for his mercy-sake, either soundly conuert such lying wretches, or else confound them euerlastingly. The <hi>Iesuite</hi> durst not deale with mee, as I do with him, and others: that is, set downe my expresse wordes: and that done, make application of the same. Hee began with lying, euen in the highest degree: hee continueth still in lying; and hee hath no other meanes in the world,<note place="margin">Marke well for Christs sake.</note> but either to end with lying, or else to confesse Poperie to be the new Religion. This is such an vndoubted trueth, as I am not afrayde to die in the same. My words in the next Chapter concerning this poynt, are in one place these: <hi>viz.</hi> For this respect did holy <hi>Paphuntius</hi> stand vp in the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> (at such time as the Fathers then &amp; there assembled, thought to haue seuered married Priestes and Byshops from their Wiues,) and told them according to Gods word, that to forbid marriage to Priestes, was too seuere a Law. In an other place of the selfe same Chapter, my wordes to the same effect are these. Thirdly, seeing Priestes marriage was holden for lawfull in the famous Councell of <hi>Nice</hi>; and that the holy Byshoppe <hi>Paphuntius</hi> did pronounce openly in the same, that the coniugall actes of married Priestes was true chastitie: whose sentence was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the whole Councell;<note place="margin">Suruey, Part. 3. cap. 3. Pag. 232.</note> and therevpon the matter was left as indifferent for euery Priest either to marry, or not to marry, at his owne free choyce. In my <hi>Suruay</hi> likewise, two places doe manifestly conuince our impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent lying <hi>Jesuite</hi>: In the former place, these are my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse wordes. Thirdly, that although <hi>Socrates</hi> &amp; <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:14089:73"/>

                     </gap>orus</hi> make any mention thereof, in his Tripartite Collection. And howsoeuer <hi>Paphuntius</hi> alleadged Tradition, to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the seuere Lawes intended by the Councell; yet is it very certaine, that such Tradition was neither generall nor diuine. In the latter place, these are my very wordes.<note place="margin">Vbi Super, Pag. 235.</note> I say fourthly, that the Tradition which <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomenus</hi> speake of, was by example, &amp; not by doctrine; as both <hi>Gratianus</hi> &amp; the Glosse expounde them. These are my very wordes, in foure seuerall places; which doe so condemne the <hi>Iesuite</hi> in his owne conscience, that hee durst not for his Lugges, once name them, or truely set them downe: For, I was so farre from saying, That the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers made any Canon in this behalfe; that my wordes now truely recounted, do plainely conuince the flat contrary. But marke well the third place in my said <hi>Suruay,</hi> where I haue these expresse wordes:<note place="margin">Vbi super, Pag. 233.</note> The Law which the Fathers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought to haue made, was a new Law neuer heard of before.

True <hi>Bell</hi> saith; that the spirit of God speaking in <hi>Paphuntius,</hi> did vtterly diswade the Fathers from that vngodly purpose. <hi>Bell</hi> saith; the Fathers intended to haue made a Law, but made none indeed.

               <p>I answere: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, that if Pope <hi>Sozimus</hi> had vnderstood and meant the Canons of <hi>Sardica,</hi> when he named the Canons of <hi>Nice,</hi> about which there was so much adoe; as we haue already seene: then doubtlesse, it had been his part to haue named them; though for no other end, but onely for vnitie, peace, and charitie-sake. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that I willingly agree to our <hi>Jesuite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marke that Appeales to Rome are no matters of faith.</note> when he auoucheth no new thing touching Fayth, to haue been enacted in the supposed Synode of <hi>Sardica.</hi> And my reason is this; for that Appeales to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are no matters of Fayth indeed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thirdly, that it is a matter of Fayth with the Papistes, to beleeue that the Fathers of <hi>Nice</hi> could not erre, either in defining matters of Fayth or Manners. And consequently, seeing the Synode of <hi>Sardica</hi> in the fourth and seuenth Canons,<note place="margin">In the third Aphorisme.</note> hath decreed flat contrary to the Synode of <hi>Nice</hi> in the fourth, fift, sixt, and seuenth Canons; it can not be deemed a legittimate and lawfull Synode, but a bastard and plaine counterfeite; as I haue already prooued, in the third Aphorisme of this present Chapter: To which place I referre the Reader, as where he may find whatsoeuer his heart can desire. This onely will I heere say for the present; that not onely the other first three generall Councels after <hi>Nice,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>) being all three after it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed contrary to it; but (which is more to be admired,) 217.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14089:75"/>
and else where sayd of the Centuristes and <hi>M.

This my Doctrine is confirmed by a double argument: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> the second of that name (who was Byshop 200. yeares after <hi>Siricius,</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First therefore, seeing all Ministers which are not subiect to the lawes of Poperie, may lawfully Marrie, euen by the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; as is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the first Proposition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, seeing Marriage was euer lawfull for all Priestes, and other Ministers of the Church, during all the time of the old Testament; as is prooued in the second Proposition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, seeing Marriage is lawfull for Priestes, and other Ministers of the Church, euen now in the time of the new Testament; as is prooued in the third Proposition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, seeing the Marriage of Priestes is onely prohibited by the law of Man, and not by any positiue constitution either of Christ of his Apostles; as is prooued in the fourth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, seeing it was euer lawfull for the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes, Priestes, and Deacons of the East Church, to take Wiues, and to beget Children in the time of their Priesthood; as is prooued in the fift Proposition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, seeing the Marriage of Priestes was euer lawfull also in the West Church, vntill the cursed and vntimely inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prohibition of Pope <hi>Siricius,</hi> almost 400. yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ; as is prooued in the sixt Proposition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seuenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeing <hi>Siricius</hi> his Prohibition notwithstanding, Priestes were still Married in many places a long time; and in <hi>Germanie</hi> aboue a thousand yeares after Christ, without restraint, euen vntill the dayes of the vngratious Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi>; as is prooued in the 7. Proposition.<note place="margin">A.D. 1074.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, seeing all secular Priestes are so free from the Vow, which is annexed to Ecclesiasticall orders by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the supposed dissoluing impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof notwithstanding, their Marriages are true, perfect, and of force. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, seeing that by Popish Fayth and Doctrine, the single Vow of Chastitie neither doth nor can dissolue Matrimonie; as is prooued in the ninth Proposition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Tenthly, seeing the Vow single is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14089:88"/>
of one and the same nature with the Vow solemne, not distinguished by any essentiall, but meere accidentall difference; as is prooued in the tenth Proposition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Eleuenthly, seeing Matrimonie of Monkes, Fryers, and Nonnes, euen after their solemne Vow of Religion, is with the Pope, his Iesuites, and Iesuited Popelinges, very lawfull and of force, so it be done by, and with the Popes Dispensation; as is prooued in the eleuenth Proposition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Twelfthly, seeing the forced and coacted Chastitie of popish Priestes hath been such and so intollerable, (euen by the best learned Papistes their free confessions,) as nothing in the whole world hath brought more shame to Priesthood, more harme to Religion, more griefe to godly men, as is prooued in the 12. Proposition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenthly, seeing the Fathers of the famous Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> thought it not agreeable to Gods word, to make any Law against the Marriage of Priestes; as is prooued in the 13. Proposition. I can not, I may not, but must of necessitie conclude, with this ineuitable and irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble illation: <hi>ergo,</hi> the Prohibition of Priestes Marriage, is but a rotten ragge of the new Religion.</p>

                     <p>I answere; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, that the Marriage of Priestes, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibited by the Law of man, and not by any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Constitution either of Christ or his Apostles. <note place="margin">4. Propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </note>This I haue prooued in the 4. Proposition, by the flat testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of many famous Popish Writers: yea, out of the Popes owne Decrees: Read the Proposition to the end, and marke it seriously. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that it was euer law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Priestes in the East Church to be Married, and to beget children in time of their Priesthood. <note place="margin">5. Propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </note>This trueth is cleared in the fift Proposition, euen out of the Popes

owne Decrees. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that it was lawfull in the West Church for Priestes to be Married, for the space of one thousand yeares after Christ: <note place="margin">6. Proposition</note>This is made euident, in the sixt and seuenth Propositions. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priestes are not Votaries; and that therefore their Marriage is lawfull: <note place="margin">8. &amp; 9. Propos.</note>This trueth is soundly prooued in the 8. and 9. Propositions: Let them be well marked. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, that the Marriage of Priestes is their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per right; and that therefore restitution must be made for taking the same away: <note place="margin">12. Propos.</note>This trueth is prooued in the 12. Proposition, and it striketh dead. Now, seeing first, that no positiue Constitution against Priestes Marriage, can truely be deriued either from Christ or his Apostles: seeing secondly, that it was euer lawfull for Priestes in the East Church, to be Married: seeing thirdly, that it was lawfull for Priestes euen in the West Church, to Marrie euery where, for the space almost of 400. yeares; and in <hi>Germanie</hi> aboue a thousand yeares after Christ: seeing fourthly, that Secular Priestes are no Votaries: seeing fiftly, that the Pope is bound to Restitution for taking away of Priestes Marriage; I must perforce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude against our <hi>Iesuite,</hi> that the Tradition which <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> and <hi>Sozomenus</hi> speake of, was neither Generall, nor Diuine; howsoeuer <hi>Paphuntius</hi> alleadged it, so to mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the rigorous and seuere Lawes intended by the Councell. I prooue it by a double argument: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if there had been any such Tradition generall or diuine; the <hi>Greekes</hi> could not be excused, who neuer yeelded therevnto. Secondly, because so many Learned Papistes doe constantly affirme and teach; that neither Christ nor his Apostles, made any Law against Priestes Marriage. To which I must needes adde, that if there had been any such Tradition receiued either from Christ or his Apostles, neither would holy <hi>Paphuntius</hi> haue pleaded against it, neither yet the famous Councell haue yeelded to him in that behalfe. But the Councell of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:14089:89"/>
(will some say,) maketh mention of Apostolicall tradition to the same effect. I answere with the Popes owne deare Glosse vpon his Decrees, in these expresse wordes.<note place="margin">Gloss. dist. 84. Cap. in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terito.</note>

S. <hi>Paul,</hi> albeit he were some time a marryed-man (as S. <hi>Clement</hi> very probably deduceth out of the holy Scriptures;) yet did he after that, liue a single life; and withall, exhorted others (that had the gift) to liue as he did.<note place="margin">1.

And doubtlesse,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. v. 25.</note> if S. <hi>Paul</hi> had no warrant to inioyne Single life; much lesse had the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> such a warrant: and least of all, had the late Byshoppes of <hi>Rome</hi> (men of dissolute life, and scandalous behauiour,) such power and authoritie.</p>

                     <p>I answere: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> speaketh not of any Law, that was made in his time, against Priestes Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; but of a voluntarie vsage of some few in some few places. Which mine answere, is virtually implyed in these wordes, (for the most part.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that I haue prooued in the fift Proposition very plentifully,<note place="margin">See the 5.

                     <p>I answere: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, that this Testimonie being the same in substaunce with the former, may with all congruitie receiue the same answere: For, it doth not relate any Law, Decree, or Constitution, made against Priestes Marriage; but barely and onely insinuateth that zeale and feruour, which was wonderfull in the primatiue and auncient Church. Howbeit, therevpon will it neuer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in true forme of argument; that because some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the gift of Continencie, absteyned from Marriage, (so to auoyde the incumbrances of which th'Apostle speaketh) therefore all others must be compelled,<note place="margin">1.

                        <hi>Lege lata</hi> to doe the same.

               <p>I answere: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, that though this Chapter be short in wordes, yet is it so full of waightie and vnanswerable matter, that where it conteyneth fourtie lynes saue one, our Fryer <hi>Iesuite</hi> for feare of burning, durst scarcely touch three of the same. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that in his shortnesse, hee hath heaped lye vpon lye. <note place="margin">The first Lie.</note>His first lye is this: <hi>viz. That I haue told this tale of the Popes Pardon</hi> (that it is a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Ragge of the New Religion) <hi>diuers times before.</hi> For I told not this tale at all, saue onely in this present Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: let the Reader peruse all three Chapters aforegoing, and if he doe not finde this tale once told (as in trueth he can not,) then in charitie let him bestow the Whetstone vpon our Fryer, as vpon the man who hath the best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued it.

That my saying is a rotten lye.</hi> For I haue prooued it to be the meere trueth euen in this Chapter, as it will better appeare (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) by this my present Answere. His third lye is this: <hi>viz. That I am the Rag-maister of</hi> Rascall. For, albeit both in the very Title of his Booke, and in sundry other places,<note place="margin">The Iesuite is at a non plus.</note> he tearmes mee in that scornefull manner; yet is it so farre from the trueth, that the name of the Towne where I was borne, is not <hi>Rascall</hi> (as hee would haue it) but <hi>Raskell,</hi> with k and e, not with c and a, as his lying lippes affirme it. But what if the name were, as the <hi>Jesuite</hi> scornefully affirmeth; must I be a Rascall, because I was borne in a Towne so called?

Doth not

euery child see &amp; perceiue, that our <hi>Frier</hi> wanteth matter; and that he is at a <hi>non plus</hi>? If he were able to defend Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, with Trueth, Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, or good Argumentes; hee would neuer vse such miserable shiftes, and silly euasions. His third lye is this: <hi>viz. That he hath prooued mine assertion to be a Lie.</hi> For, I haue with inuincible reasons and authorities, prooued the contrarie to be the knowne Trueth. Hee nameth an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Booke, (<hi>The dolefull Knell,</hi>) where hee would seeme to haue prooued the matter: Yet such a Booke I neuer saw to this day, neither can I learne that any other hath seene the same: But more hereof to speake, fitter occasion will be offered hereafter:<note place="margin">In the ninth Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</note> And if I liue to see such a Booke extant, it shall not (God willing) be long vnanswered. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that I prooued it in the <hi>Tryall,</hi> (euen in this very Chapter) to be a very rotten Ragge of the New religion:<note place="margin">Reade the Tryall, and marke well the 4. Chapter.</note> And this I did performe in that place, many wayes: First, by the expresse wordes of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uester Pryeras,</hi> (a man so profound and learned, that hee was by the Papistes surnamed, <hi>Absolutus Theologus,</hi>) who constantly affirmeth, that the Popes Pardons were neuer knowne to vs, neither by the Scriptures, nor yet by the auncient Fathers; but onely by the late Writers.

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> they must needes be Ragges of a New Religion. How can the <hi>Fryer</hi> denie this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outblushing? His owne conscience accuseth him.

Hee perceiueth right well, that hee is not able with all the helpe of his best friendes, to defend the Pope from vtter shame. Secondly, by the flat testimonie of the Popish canonized Saint <hi>Antoninus,</hi> sometime Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byshop of the famous Citie of <hi>Florence</hi>; who deliuereth the selfe same Doctrine, that <hi>Syluester</hi> did.

This Byshop was a Learned man, a great Papist, and said for Poperie, what possibly he could; yet doth he graunt many thinges, (of such force is the trueth) which quite ouerthrow Poperie, and turne it vpside-downe.

So long as there was no care of Purgatorie, no man sought for Pardons: for of it dependeth all the estimation, that wee haue of Pardons. If thou take away
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14089:98"/>
Purgatorie, to what end shall wee need Pardons? For, if there be no Purgatorie, wee shall neede no Pardons, Considering therefore how long Purgatorie was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne; then, that it was beleeued of some by litle and litle, partly by Reuelations and partly by Scriptures, and so at the last, beleeued generally of the whole Church; wee doe easily vnderstand the cause of Pardons. Since therefore Purgatorie was so lately knowne and receiued of the Vniuersall Church, Who can now admire Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, that there was no vse of them in the primatiue Church? Pardons therefore began, after the people stood in some feare of Purgatorie. These are the wordes of <hi>M.

I desire the Reader right heartily, euen in the bowels of our Lord Iesus, to marke attentiuely, and then to iudge and giue his censure Christianly,<note place="margin">I wonder, how any can reade such Popish Doctrine, and be a Papist still.</note> betweene the <hi>Jesuite</hi> and my selfe.

Which more bold then wise affirmance, I returne vnto our <hi>Fryer,</hi> for a most certaine and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Lye, for a most notorious Slaunder, and for an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Blasphemie against the blessed Apostles of our Lord Iesus. I prooue it sundry wayes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> was one of the chiefest and best Learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church;<note place="margin">Perhaps S. Chrysostome and the other holy Greeke Fathers feeling Purgatorie-fire, beleeued it when they were dead.</note> who, (as my Lord of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> hath told vs very plainely and resolutely,) neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued there was any Popish Purgatorie, while they were lyuing heere on earth; and consequently, that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie can neuer be truely fathered, vpon that great learned &amp; holy man. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because those Homilies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence our <hi>Fryer</hi> would gladly fetch Purgatorie-fire, are counterfeite &amp; not <hi>S. Chrysostomes</hi> indeed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this is an argument insoluble, that the <hi>Greeke</hi> Fathers did neuer beleeue Purgatorie. For, if <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> had taught Purgatorie in his Bookes, Byshoppe <hi>Fisher</hi> that glorious so supposed Popish Martyr, could not truely haue written, and constantly auouched to the whole world, as he did, that the <hi>Greekes</hi> neuer beleeued Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that if the Apostles had taught Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then could not so many, so Learned, so holy Fathers of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, haue been so long time, euen till their death, ignoraunt thereof. Nay, if the <hi>Latine</hi> Church in their dayes, had receiued Purgatorie, as a tradition
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14089:101"/>
Apostolicall, they would neuer haue withstood it; but most reuerently haue admitted, and most Christianly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued the same. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that if we suppose and graunt our <hi>Fryer</hi> thus much, to cheare vp his spirits a while: <hi>viz.</hi> that they are <hi>S. Chrysostomes</hi> wordes, which he citeth in his name; yet will it not serue his turne, to build Popish Purgatorie therevpon: For, the words do onely prooue this, and no more; to weete, that th'Apostles taught Commemoration of the dead. Which my selfe am so farre from disliking, that I haue many yeares agoe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued it in my <hi>Suruay of Poperie.</hi> Yea,<note place="margin">Part. 3. Chap. 6.

To this I adde; that Prayer for the dead (which is more then Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) may in a godly sort be vsed: as I haue shewed at large, first in my <hi>Motiues,</hi> and afterward in my <hi>Suruay.</hi> More then which, the <hi>Iesuite</hi> can not inferre out of his Author, as his Marginall note doth declare.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14089:109"/>
denyed the Fayth in time of Persecution. And that some were so zelous, and so highly esteemed the sacred Ministerie, that although they did not denie the Fayth publikely, yet for that they had some doubtes therein, and were troubled in their mindes, they voluntarily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed their secret griefes to Gods Ministers, humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired their Godly aduise,<note place="margin">Nicephor. lib. 12. cap. 28. f.</note> &amp; submitted themselues to doe what was thought expedient by those Ministers, whom the Church had placed to inioyne Penance for publike sinnes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Th'other, that notwithstanding the whoredome of the Deacon and other vices, neither would that holy Byshop <hi>Nectarius</hi> euer haue attempted to abolish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession (if it had been Gods ordinance,) neither would so many famous Byshops haue imitated his fact.

But then wee must consider (sayth <hi>Scotus</hi>) whether it be found explicitely in the Ghospell immediately from Christ,<note place="margin">Scotus can not tell what to say of their Popish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> because it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest (quoth hee) that it is not in the old Law; or whether it be from him expressely in some of the Apostles doctrine: or if neither so nor so; whether then it was giuen of Christ by word only, &amp; published to the Church by the Apostles? And hauing made this triple Diuision, how Confession might come by the Precept of God: that is, either first commaunded by him in the Ghospell; or else secondly, to be found in some of the Apostles writinges; or lastly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted of Christ by word of mouth onely. And hauing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of the first two members, with dislike of the second, he concludeth, that we must either hold the first member; to weete, that it commeth from the Law of God published by the Ghospell: or if that be not sufficient, we must say the third, that it is of the positiue Law of God, published by Christ to the Apostles; but published by the Apostles to the Church, without all Scripture.</p>

Thus are wee taught, by the Popes owne sweete deare Decrees, published in print, to the view of the whole world. Out of which Decree, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue these memorable documentes for the helpe of the Reader. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church neuer confessed their sinnes vnto Priests, but vnto God alone: Of which Church for all that, the Presidentes &amp; Gouernours were most holy &amp; learned Fathers; <hi>viz.</hi> S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> S. <hi>Basill</hi> surnamed the great, S. <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene,</hi> S. <hi>Damascene,</hi> and many other most excellent and holy Byshoppes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that others hold the contrarie,

For, if it had been necessarie vnto mans saluation, all the holy and learned Fathers of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, should haue perished euerlastingly. But some will here demaund, how that can be prooued? To whom I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere; that the same is plainely and expressely prooued, in the Popes owne Decrees: Which is such a testimonie against the Pope and his Popelings, as none greater can be had.

Let the wordes of the Decree be well marked, because it sheweth all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, to confound the Pope, and all his <hi>Jesuited</hi> Popelings.

To which horrible and blaspheamous Assertion of our presumptuous <hi>Jesuite,</hi> I answere to his euerlasting confusion (vnlesse he repentin time,<note place="margin">Marke well my wordes.</note>) in this manner. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that Mans doinges can not fitly be compared with Gods most Holy, most Wise, and most Pure Decrees. For which respect, God telleth vs by the mouth of his Prophet, that his wayes are not as ours.<note place="margin">Esa. 55. v. 8. Rom. 9. v. 20.21.22. Rom. 11. v. 33.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>4.55.</note> For, <hi>My thoughtes</hi> (sayth <hi>Esay,</hi>) <hi>are not your thoughtes; neither are your wayes, my wayes, saith the Lord.</hi> Gods Will, is the Rule, by which all mans thoughtes, wordes, and workes, must be measured: But Mans Will, is no Rule or Law to measure Gods actions, or to direct his most Iust, most Holy, and most Pure Purposes, Ordinaunces, and Decrees. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Man can but punish the body temporally; but God can punish both body and soule, eternally. Man can but punish the outward actions of man;<note place="margin">Mat. 10. v. 28.</note> but God can punish both the outward actes, and the inward thoughtes. Man can but punish the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall iniurie done to man; but God can punish both that, and the eternall iniurie done to his most sacred Maiestie, surpassing Omnipotencie, and ineffable Deitie. Offence done to Man, is finite and limitted; but offence done to God, is infinite and illimited. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Sinnes which are but small in respect of man, are exceeding great in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God. For example sake; a reprochfull word spoken against a Meane priuate person, is respectiuely a small offence; the same word spoken against a Great personage, of high place in Church or Common-weale, is a farre greater Offence: the same spoken against our Soueraigne Lord the King, is the greatest of all three.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14089:119"/>
And consequently, when we offende God, whose person is of infinite Worthinesse, of infinite Maiestie, of infinite Power; our offence obiectiuely must needes be infinite, howsoeuer our <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Jesuited</hi> Papistes flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their Venials. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the thinges which are trifles, in our <hi>Iesuites</hi> iudgement, are great and heynous Sinnes, in the tribunall of our Lord Iesus.<note place="margin">Genes. 3. v. 6.

sense, my selfe do willingly admit Veniall sinnes; as also, sinnes Veniall by the mercie of God: But withall, I wish the Reader euer to remember, what <hi>Gersonus, Almaynus, Baius, Durandus,</hi> and <hi>Roffensis</hi> teach vs: <hi>viz.</hi> that euery least Sinne is Mortall of it owne nature; which is the flat Doctrine I heere defend. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that the difference amongst the Learned Popish Doctors concerning Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall sinnes, is a matter of small importance; which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the Christian reader in the bowels of our sweete Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, neuer to forget: For it doth plainely conuince, (if nothing else could be sayd in that behalfe,) that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie is the New religion. What? is Popish fayth a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Small moment? Is it not necessarie to saluation?

R.</hi> his expresse wordes; <note place="margin">S. R. Pag. 281.</note>
                  <hi>True it is, that Byshoppe <hi>Fisher</hi> and <hi>Gerson</hi> were in that errour; but that was both before it was condemned in the Church, as it was since by <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirteenth.</hi> In which wordes, the <hi>Jesuite S.

So it onely remaineth, duely to examine what the supposed Errour was. The <hi>Iesuite B. C.</hi> heere telleth vs plainely, if wee may beleeue him; that the Popes (<hi>Pius</hi> and <hi>Gregorius</hi>) condemned that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion onely, which holdeth Venial sinnes to be onely such by the mercie of God. I admit the Assertion;<note place="margin">Sinnes onely Veniall by mercie, are mortall of their owne nature.</note> I like the Narration: I onely reiect the Popes friuolous, vnchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and plaine hereticall condemnation. For I pray you sir <hi>Fryer,</hi> are not those sinnes Mortall of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are onely Veniall by mercie and fauour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doth not Veniall onely by Mercie, exclude Veniall by all other wayes and meanes; For doubtles, whatsoeuer is Veniall of it owne nature, can not be Veniall onely by Mercie. Onely our fond Iesuiticall <hi>Fryer,</hi> not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Poperie from being the New religion, is forced for want of matter, to say it.<note place="margin">Nature and Mercie are farre differens.</note> The nature of euerie thing is intrinsecall and essentiall to the thing, and can not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14089:123"/>
away from the thing, without the vtter destruction of the same. But euerie meane Logitian, euerie young Gramarian, euerie wittie Ploughman, and euerie Boy of discretion, is able to teach and tell our <hi>Jesuite</hi>; that Mercie is extrinsecall and meere accidentall to the thing, and may be added or taken away from the thing, without the destruction of the same.<note place="margin">This <hi>Ergo,</hi> girdeth the Pope.</note> 
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> whatsoeuer is Veniall not any other way but by the Mercie of God onely, is vndoubtedly Mortall of it owne nature. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, seeing all Sinnes were Mortall of their owne nature, vntill the dayes of <hi>Pius</hi> and <hi>Gregorius,</hi> as our <hi>Jesuites</hi> freely graunt; it followeth by a necessarie and ineuitable illation, that Veniall sinnes of their owne nature, were neuer knowne to the Church of God, vntill the irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and plaine hereticall Decrees of <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the thirteenth:<note place="margin">Vixit Pius, A.D. 1565. Vixit Gregor. A.D. 1572.</note> that is to say, for the space of one thousand, fiue hundred, threescore, and fiue yeares after Christ. For, the supposed errour of <hi>Roffensis, Gersonus, Almaynus, Baius,</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> (who all were verie lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Papistes; and for all that, taught and defended euery Sinne to be Mortall of it owne nature,) was not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, (as we see and heare it freely confessed by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,) vntill the time of <hi>Pius</hi> the fift of that name. The trueth therefore is this; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Church for the space of 1565. yeares after Christ, beleeued euerie Sinne to be Mortall of it owne nature. For, (as we haue seene alreadie in the first Conclusion of this Chapter,<note place="margin">Concl. 1. huius cap. ex Gersono, et alijs.</note>) God may most iustly condemne euerie least Sinne to eternall Death and Hell fire. Yea, as M. <hi>Gerson</hi> learnedly wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: he that holdeth the contrarie, must perforce hold withall, that in some case Sinne may be done lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and be no Sinne at all. And it is but a very childish and friuolous cauill, to say at our <hi>Fryer</hi> heere doth: <hi>viz.</hi> that it was an Article of Popish Faith long before <hi>Pius</hi> the Pope,<note place="margin">The Romish Church belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, it can not tell what.</note> to beleeue Veniall sinnes. For, such Venialles were of necessitie such, either of their owne nature, or
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14089:123"/>
else of mercie onely. If our <hi>Jesuite</hi> graunt the latter, I haue my desire: it is the trueth which I defende. If the former, a double refutation is at hand. First. because the opinion of <hi>Almaynus, Roffensis, Baius, Durandus,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonus,</hi> was verie currant in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, vntill the dayes of <hi>Pius</hi> and <hi>Gregorius,</hi> as our <hi>Iesuite S.

Againe,<note place="margin">Veniall by Mercie, can not be Veniall of it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> because to be Veniall both by Mercie &amp; by Nature, implieth contradiction. The reason is euident; both for that sinnes Veniall of their owne Nature, stand not in need of any Mercie: and also for that Mercie mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigateth that punishment, which by the Nature of the subiect might iustly be inflicted. O miserable Poperie! What sillie shiftes and childish cauils are inuented, to defend thee from being the New Religion. If any shall hencefoorth call or thinke thee the Old Religion, (that shall heare thine age truely discouered,) I shall thinke him so wise, as not to know when to come out of the raine. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Tertiò Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaliter.</note> that our <hi>Iesuite</hi> sheweth himselfe more impudent, then Impudencie it selfe; while he beareth his Readers in hand, that I haue cut away these wordes of mine Author, the <hi>Iesuite</hi> his Learned brother, (<hi>By the Mercie of God.</hi>) For, I referre my selfe to the expresse wordes of the <hi>Iesuite,</hi>

This is cleare, to euery iudicious Reader. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that our <hi>Fryer</hi> sayth truely; <hi>That by the iudgement of many learned <hi>Papistes,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> may erre without a generall Councell.</hi> To this Doctrine I willingly subscribe, as which is the very trueth that I defend. For, mine vsuall manner euer is in all my Bookes, to confound Poperie with the best Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Popish Writers. I hold and defende no point of doctrine, but such onely, as great learned Papistes hold and defend with me.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first is this; <hi>viz,</hi> that the Pope staying at home himselfe, sendeth his <hi>Legates</hi> to the Councels to supply his place; to whom, for all that, (<hi>O monstrum horrendum,</hi>) he can not commit his Authoritie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second is this; <hi>viz.</hi> that no Byshoppe in these our dayes, can haue voyces in Councels,<note place="margin">See the oath, Infra, Cap. 27.</note> but such as will sweare obedience to the Pope before their admittaunce, and promise to defend his Canon Law. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is this; <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not in Popish Councels, as in humaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres and assemblies, where moe voyces euer doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. But all the force, power, strength, and authoritie
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14089:128"/>
of Councels, doe and must depend vpon the Popes will and pleasure: For, after the Fathers there haue fasted long, prayed much, consulted grauely, deliberated maturely, decreed constantly,<note place="margin">All must be as the Pope will.</note> commaunded strictly, and accursed seuerely; neither can others, nor yet them selues tell, what shall be of force therein: For, all must be, as shall best content the Popes humour, sitting right stately in his pontificall Chaire at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Oath which Bishops make to the Pope, infra Cap. 27.</note> To which I adde, that the Pope abuseth the World shamefully, when he taketh vpon him to call togeather all Byshoppes in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, to decide and determine controuersies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and for all that, will approue nothing that they decree; vnlesse the same be agreeable to that, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe decreeth alone in his pontificall Chaire at home.

Church. These are his expresse wordes:<note place="margin">S. R. pag. 281. marke this well.</note> 
                  <hi>True it is, that <hi>B. Fisher</hi> and <hi>Gerson,</hi> were in that errour: but that was both before it was condemned in the Church, as it was since by <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, and <hi>Gregorius</hi> the thirteenth.</hi> Loe, our <hi>Jesuite</hi> in the name of all Papistes, (for all Papistes must so beleeue,) blusheth not to publish to the World in print, <hi>in perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> that Pope <hi>Pius</hi> was the Church in his time; Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> in his time: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, euery Pope in his time. For, what he affirmeth of those two, in this kind of subiect;<note place="margin">When Papists speake of the Church, they euer meane the pope.</note> the same perforce he must approue, in all other Popes successiuely.

Out of these Golden words, of the famous and great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Fryer <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> I obserue many very worthy les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for the great good of the thankfull Reader. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> erred. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that he erred not as a priuate man; but euen as Pope and publique person. Marke (gentle Reader) for Christes sake I desire thee, and for the saluation of thine owne soule: For doubtlesse, if thou ponder seriously this onely Testimonie of this great learned Papist, all affection and partialitie set aside, thou canst not but perforce abhorre and detest Poperie, as a New Religion by litle &amp; litle crept into the Church. The <hi>Jesuites</hi> like <hi>Gypsies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Iesuites are Gypsies.</note> haue inuented a tricke of fast and loose, assigning to their Pope a double person; Priuate, and Publique. As a Priuate man, they graunt he may both be deceiued himselfe, and also deceiue others: But that he can erre as a publique person, or as Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>; they vtterly deny. For if they should once graunt this poynt, (which is a manifest and knowne truth,) Poperie would soone be turned vp-side downe. Howbeit, (my saluation I gage for the tryall,) Fryer <hi>Alphonsus</hi> decideth the controuersie so plainely, as all the <hi>Jesuites</hi> and <hi>Jesuited</hi> Papistes in the world, are not in trueth able to withstand or gainesay the same. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> sayth constantly and plainely, without all Ands and Ifs;<note place="margin">Loe, the Pope is wounded at the heart, hee can no longer liue.</note> that Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not as a Priuate man; but euen as Pope and publique person.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14089:134"/>
the same; as is alreadie prooued, to their euerlasting shame. But, when their Pope is conuinced to haue erred so grossely, that they know not possibly how to defende him; then they are not ashamed to say, that hee erred but as a Priuate man. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that the Pope erred in a poynt of great consequence; euen in a matter of Popish Fayth: <hi>viz.</hi> that Matrimonie was so dissolued by reason of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, that the faythfull man or woman might marrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Hereticall partie lyuing. Which thing (sayth <hi>Alphonsus,</hi>) was manifest to euery one, to be an Heresie: and their late Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> hath defined it to be so. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that this Decree and Definition of Pope <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> was in those dayes enrolled in the Popes Decretals. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, that <hi>Alphonsus</hi> saw and read the same. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, that the sayd Decree can not this day be found, amongst the Popes Decretall Epistles. <note place="margin">A note wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</note>Where I note by the way, and heartily wish the Reader to obserue the same; that the decrees of our holy Fathers the Popes, haue bin such, &amp; so much against lately hatched Poperie; as they are this day ashamed, to bring the same to light. But, let this be our comfort herein; that God hath at all times stirred vp some learned Papistes, otherwise deuoted to the Pope, who haue boldly vsed their Pennes and Wittes (such is the force of trueth,) to discouer and lay open to the view of the world, the deceit, coozenage, liegerdemayne, and cunnicatching tricks of wicked Popes, <hi>Jesuites,</hi> &amp; all <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited</hi> Papistes; so farre foorth I euer meane, as is necessarie for the common good of his Church.

                  <hi>Iob</hi> is enrolled among the Godly and those that feared God, euen by the testimony of God himselfe. <hi>Abel</hi> was slaine of his brother <hi>Cain,</hi>

The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sayth, that <hi>Noe</hi> was a iust man and perfect: who therefore with his Familie, found fauour in Gods sight, in time of the generall Deluge. The Angell of God salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the blessed virgin <hi>Marie,</hi>

And for the latter part, the Scripture is likewise plentifull.

                  <hi>Moses</hi> is said to haue had respect vnto reward. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs; that the passions of this life, are not worthy of the glory to come. In briefe, the Popish Fryer <hi>Iohn de Combis,</hi>

Rom. 8. v. 17. in anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae.</note> while they affirme Christ not to haue so fully satisfied for our sinnes, but that wee are still bound to satisfie, each man in particular for his owne sinnes. For most true it is, (as I haue prooued in sundry places of this Discourse,) that Christ hath so suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently satisfied for all his Elect, and so answered the iustice of God for punishment of their sinnes, as they are freely discharged thereof: Yet must they willingly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, to be made conformable to Christ in Suffering, as they looke to be like him in Glorie. Their sufferings are indeed a condition required to their Glorification; but neither a Cause thereof, nor any Satisfaction for their sinnes. The case is cleare, the Scriptures doe euery where insinuate the same. They are onely, <hi>Conditio sine qua non,</hi> of our Glorification, and the necessarie and infallible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes of our Predestination; which they euer follow, as Fruites doe the Tree: for the afflictions of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though they be a cause working eternall Glorie (in the sense afore touched,) as they be the way by which God hath appoynted them to passe to Glorie; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they, neither any way can they, be worthy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne, or truly Meritorious of eternall Glorie.

the inheritaunce which his father hath freely giuen him, may be sayd to worke and procure the actuall possession of the Inheritaunce, not condignely or worthily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the same; euen so may our sufferinges be sayd to worke and procure our Glorification, as a condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at our handes, or the way by which we must passe to it; but neuer to be condigne, worthy, or meritorious of the same.

Thus discourse these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and great learned Popish Writers: to whose Doctrine I subscribe with all my heart. For (as I haue often sayd else where,) I highly reuerence the Old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> religion; and to the vttermost of my small talent &amp; skill, I both haue done, doe, and will defende the same.<note place="margin">I defend the old Romane religion.</note> Yea, and iustifie the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be the Old <hi>Romane,</hi> Catholike, and Apostolike religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which S <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> deliuered to the auncient and first Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Out of the Doctrine heere deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by these famous Papistes (<hi>Lyranus, Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Bellarminus,</hi>) I gather many excellent Notes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that the Grace, Fayth, and Good workes, which we haue in this world; and the Glory, which we expect in the world to come, doe all wholly proceed from Gods Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen without all desertes of Man. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly that as God prepared the Kingdome of heauen for his Elect,<note place="margin">God in his eternall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, prepared both eternall glory for his elect, and the way, or meanes to attaine the same.</note> euen before they were borne, or had done any Good workes; so did he also prepare the way and meanes, by which he would bring them to the same. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that no Workes done, or fore-seene to be done, did mooue God to predestinate any man to the ioyes of Heauen. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly that Good workes are not the Cause, but the Effect of Predestination. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, that Good workes are the way and meanes, which God ordayned for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Predestination and for the accomplishment of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:14089:139"/>
Glorification. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, that not onely Predestination, but also Iustification, proceedes of Gods meere fauour, grace, and good pleasure, without all desertes of Man. Seuenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our Vocation, our Iustification, and our Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are the effectes of Predestination. I therefore conclude; that Good workes are not the cause, why Gods children possesse Heauen as their inheritaunce, seeing it is the effect of Predestination: yet that they are the ordinarie way and meanes, by which God decreed in his eternall purpose, to bring his Elect to Heauen. For, as he ordayned the end; that is to say, the Kingdome of Heauen or Eternall life; so also ordayned he the way and meanes to attaine the same; that is to say, Vocation, Iustification, Fayth, and Good workes.

                  <hi>Tale Meritum de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digno inuenitur inter homines, sed non est hominis ad Deum. Quod patet, quia, quod redditur potius ex libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitate dantis, quam ex debito operis, non cadit sub me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito de condigno strictè et propriè accepto. Sequitur, quod si quis dicat, quod quamuis Deus non constituatur nobis debitor ex aliquo nostro opere, constituitur tamen debitor ex sua promissione, quam exprimit scriptura; non valet propter duo: Primum est, quod promissio diuina in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis sanctis, non sonat in aliquam obligationem, sed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuat meram dispositionem liberalitatis diuinae. Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est, quod quod redditur, non redditur ex debito operis, sed ex promissione praecedente; non quod redditur ex me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito operis de condigno, sed solum vel principaliter ex promissu. Et ita non est illud debitum, de quo loqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur: Et sic patet, quod meritum de condigno strictè et propriè sumptum, viz. pro actione voluntaria, propter quam operanti debetur merces ex iustitia, sic quod si non reddatur, ille ad quem pertinet reddere, iniustè facit, et est simpliciter et proprièiniustus, non est hominis ad Deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Et ideo propter tale meritum, cum sit homini simpliciter impossibile, non est necesse in nobis ponere gratiam, vel charitatem habitualem:</hi> Such condigne Merite is found among men, but is not betweene God and man. Which hereby is cleare, because that which is rendered rather of the liberalitie of the giuer, then of debt due to the worke, falleth not vnder condigne Merite properly so called. If any say; that though God become not our debter by
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14089:141"/>
reason of our Worke, yet is he made our debtour by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Promise, whereof the Scripture maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that answere is of no force, for two respectes. First, because Gods Promise in the holy Scriptures doth not sound to any Bond, but insinuateth the meere disposition of Gods liberalitie. Secondly, because that which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is not giuen for the debt arysing of the Worke, but of promise that went before; not that it is rendred for the condigne Merite of the worke, but onely or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for his Promise sake: And so there is not that debt, of which we speake. And so it is cleare, that condigne Merite properly so called, <hi>viz.</hi> for a voluntary action, for which reward is due of iustice to the worker, so that if it be not rendred, hee to whom it apperteyneth to giue it, doth vniustly, and is simply and properly vniust, is not betweene God and man. And therefore for such a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, seeing it is simply impossible to man, there is no need to put in vs grace or charitie habituall. Thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth M. <hi>Durand</hi>: out of whose golden periods, I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many memorable Obseruations. First, that condigne Merite can not be betweene God and man. Secondly, that eternall life is the free gift of Gods liberalitie, not proceeding of any debt or duetie due to the best Workes which we doe. Thirdly, that God rewardeth vs prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for his Promise sake, and not for any thing wee either haue done, or possibly can doe. <note place="margin">Condigne merite is so farre aboue mans capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as no man possiblely can haue it.</note>Fourthly, that condigne Merite is so farre aboue mans capacitie and reach, that no man can by any possibilitie haue it. And consequently, that late Popish condigne Merite of Workes is ridiculous, absurd, and impossible. <hi>Gregorius Ariminensis, Thomas Waldensis, Paulus Burgensis, Marsilius,</hi> and <hi>Etkins,</hi> fiue most zealous Papistes, doe all with one assent affirme very constantly; that mans Workes are not meritorious of eternall life, how holy soeuer the man be.

for Authenticall,) telleth both the Pope and vs very constantly; that God is not simply and truely sayd to be debtour to vs, but to him selfe and his owne Promise, which he freely without all our desertes, made vnto vs. These are his expresse wordes: <hi>Manifestum est autem, quod inter Deum et hominem est maxima inaequalitas, (in infinitum.

Wherefore mans iustice receiued of God, can not be according to perfect and absolute equalitie, but after a certaine proportion; to weet, in as much as either worketh according to his condition. Now, man hath the measure and condition of his Vertue from God; <note place="margin">Loe, man can not merite any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignely, or properly.</note>and therefore mans Merite can not be with God, saue onely according to the supposall of Gods holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce: so to weet, that man may attaine that at Gods hand by his working, as reward; to which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted his power of working. Thus disputeth the graund Papist <hi>Aquinas</hi>; whose Discourse doth vtterly ouerthrow all Popish Merite, as the late Popish Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> hath defined the same. For first (marke well my wordes,) <hi>Aquinas</hi> teacheth vs the trueth: <hi>viz.</hi> that where there is no perfect equalitie, there can be no Merite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. Secondly, he graunteth, that there is infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:14089:143"/>
betweene God and man.<note place="margin">There is no proper merite in man.</note> Thirdly, he confesseth freely, that mans iustice is not absolute, but imperfect. Fourthly, he acknowledgeth as truely as constantly, that man doth merite nothing in Gods sight, saue onely by way of his free acceptation.<note place="margin">Marke &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this poynt aright.</note> Marke well, and forget not these wordes; (<hi>Nisi secundum praesupposuionem diuinae ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis:</hi> Saue onely according to the supposall of Gods ordinaunce.) Fiftly, he plainely auoucheth, that eternall life is not hyre properly, but as it were hyre. Marke the wordes (<hi>Quasi mercedem,</hi> as hyre;) for they are empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, and wholly opposite to condigne Merite of mans Workes. These argumentes doe plainely conuince; and yet to gratifie our <hi>Iesuite,</hi> (whose fauour I greatly desire in Christ,) I will adde for a supplement, a double testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of two very learned <hi>Fryers</hi>; th'one is <hi>Josephus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Angles, in 2. sent. pag. 103.</note> a Popish Byshop and <hi>Franciscan</hi> Fryer: th'other is <hi>Robertus Bellarminus,</hi> a <hi>Jesuiticall</hi> Fryer and Romish Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. <hi>Angles</hi> hath these expresse wordes: <hi>Eodem etiam modo considerantes omnes alij doctores sancti, naturalem solu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modo bonorum operum valorem, et illum, a valore et iusta vitae aeternae astimatione longissime distare perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes; prudenter dixerunt, opera nostra non esse merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, aut digna vitae aeternae. Ex lege tamen siue conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, siue promissione facta nobiscum, opera bona hominis cum adiutorio gratiae Dei fiunt aeternae vitae digna, et illi aequalia; quae, seclusa illa Dei promissione (quae pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim in sacris literis reperitur,) fuissent tanto premio pror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus indigna:</hi> All other holy Doctors also, considering after the same manner the naturall value onely of Good workes, and perceiuing that it is exceeding farre distant from the value and iust estimation of eternall life, sayd wisely; that our workes are not Meritorious, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternall life: Yet for the Couenant and Promise made to vs, the Good workes of man with the helpe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:14089:143"/>
of Gods grace, are worthy of eternall life, and equall to it: which for all that, the Promise of God (which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the holy Scripture) set apart, were altogeather vnworthy of so great reward. Thus discourseth our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Byshop, our holy <hi>Fryer,</hi> euen to the Pope himselfe, after the humble kissing of his holy feete, to vse his owne wordes: Who though he bestirre himselfe more then a little, to establish the condigne Merite of mans workes; yet doth he in his owne kind of dispute, vtterly confute and confound himselfe. For first, he freely graunteth, that S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and all the rest of the holy Doctors with him, affirme constantly, and vniformely with one voyce and assent, (a testimonie almost incredible, to proceede from the mouth of a Papist, so neare and so deare to the Pope,) that Good workes neither are meritorious, nor worthy of eternall life. Secondly, hee graunteth freely, that the best Workes, considered in their owne nature and kind, are vnworthy of eternall life. Thirdly, hee graunteth willingly, and telleth the Pope roundly, (but after the kissing of his holy feete,) that Good workes, euen as they proceed of grace and assistaunce of the holy Ghost, are altogeather vnworthy of eternall life, if Gods Promise and free acceptation be set apart. <note place="margin">Loe, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes graunt as much as we desire.</note>Which three poyntes doubtlesse, are all that we desire to be graunted, concerning the Doctrine of Good workes. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, though the Papistes neuer cease to impeach, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, slaunder, and condemne vs in this behalfe; yet doe wee indeed defend nothing herein, (as is euident to the indifferent Reader,) but that very doctrine, which their best Doctors in their printed Bookes haue taught vs; yea, in those selfe-same Bookes, which are dedicated to the Pope himselfe. The conceites which the <hi>Fryer</hi> By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe alleadgeth, to make good the late decreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne Merite of Works, are very childish, too too grosse, and friuolous. For first, where he affirmeth the Fathers and Doctors, to speake of Good workes only in respect
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:14089:144"/>
of their naturall value, as he tearmeth it: I answere, that that sillie Glosse &amp; Exposition, is onely inuented by him and his fellowes;<note place="margin">Philip. 3.9. Rom. 10.4. Tit. 3.5. 1.

For, not only the holy Scripture euery where contradicteth it, but the Doctors also teach the flat contrary. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, <hi>Durandus</hi> saith plainely, that <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de condigno,</hi> is properly of the worthy, to which that is simply due, which is equall by vertue of the worke. Yea, he addeth; that God giueth not eternall life, of iustice; but of meere liberalitie, in that he freely accepteth our workes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Aquinas</hi> affirmeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly, that man can not possibly haue any Merite with God, saue onely according to the supposall of his holy Ordinaunce. He saith further; that Eternall life is not properly a Reward, but as it were a Reward. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Abbot <hi>Bernard</hi> auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Christianly;<note place="margin">All this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proued.</note> that God may iustly deny eternall life to the best Workes of all, and yet doe no iniurie to any man; no not to the holyest liuer vpon earth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Fryer <hi>Bellarmine</hi> lately made Cardinall for his stout and learned defence of Poperie, doth not onely quite ouerthrow the friuolous distinction of Fryer <hi>Angles,</hi> but also vnawares, turneth Poperie vpside downe: For, he approoueth the sentence and opinion of <hi>Durand,</hi> and teacheth plainely; That the best liuers, can not absolutely and condignely require any thing at Gods hand, seeing all goodnesse proceedeth onely from God; saue onely in respect of his Promise freely made to man, without all desertes of man. These are the expresse wordes of the Cardinal:<note place="margin">Marke the Cardinals wordes wel, &amp; vnderstand them soundly.</note>

Thus disputeth Frier Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi>: and consequently,<note place="margin">Marke well for Christes sake for Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bleedeth vnto death.</note> this is all that all Papistes say, or possibly can say, for the life of their Pope and Popish doctrine. And yet it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to euery iudicious Reader, that the Cardinall hath vnawares quite ouerthrowne Poperie, and turned it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side downe: For, out of his Doctrine, these poyntes are deduced most manifestly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that <hi>Durandus</hi> his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath put him to his best Trumpe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that <hi>Durandus</hi> his opinion (as is already prooued,) is this: <hi>viz.</hi> That the Merite of Workes in the best liuer on earth, can not truly and properly be called, <hi>Meritum ex condigno,</hi> Condigne Merite; but onely in way of Gods free accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14089:145"/>
and in respect of his Promise freely made to man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without all desertes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that the Cardinall plainely ouercome with the force of <hi>Durands</hi> reasons, (for the trueth will in time euer preuaile,) graunteth his opinion in this sense afore touched. For hee sayth plainely; If <hi>Durand</hi> admit Merite in respect of Gods Promise, his opinion can not be reprooued. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that our <hi>Iesuite</hi> Fryer Cardinall maketh good that Doctrine, which my selfe doe heere defend; as which is the selfe same, that <hi>Durand</hi> holdes. And consequently, if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his fellowes, with their Popish followers, would stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to their owne Doctrine, which they publish in printed Bookes; wee and they should soone agree, and these great Controuersies would haue an end. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, that man can not exact any thing absolutely at Gods hands, because all things are Gods owne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, that in respect of Gods good pleasure and couenaunt freely made to man, man may truly require reward at Gods hands. Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my selfe graunt, that we may not onely truly, but also iustly require reward at Gods handes, in regard of his Promise freely made vnto vs. But withall I euer denie, that any reward is due to our best Workes, for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne Merite or Desert of or in our Workes, Gods free Acceptation, Mercie, and Promise set apart. For as S. <hi>Austen</hi> sayth grauely;<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 9. Confess. cap. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ae etiam laudabils vitae hominum, si remota misericordia discutias eam:</hi> Woe euen to the best liue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> vpon earth; if thou examine his life, thy Mercie set apart: Now heere I would admonish the gentle Reader by the way, to distinguish these two wordes aright with mee; <hi>viz.</hi> Iustly, and Condignely. For although the children of God may in respect of his mercifull Promise, require euen of Iustice,<note place="margin">Marke this well.</note> reward for their Good workes; yet can they not any way, Condignely require the same. The disparitie consisteth in this; <hi>viz.</hi> that albeit Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise be enough to make the reward Iustly giuen, yet it is not sufficient to make our Workes Condignely worthy
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14089:145"/>
of the same. The reason is euident: because Iustice heere spoken of, is not absolute, but respectiue, connotating the free Promise of God: but Condignitie is absolute, connotating intrinsecally the perfection and worthines of the worke.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secundò prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaliter.</note> after Fryer <hi>Angles</hi> had disputed this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>pro et contra,</hi> both affirmatiuely and negatiuely; in the end he plainely confesseth (though vnawares) the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Doctrine, which I now contend to prooue.<note place="margin">Angles in 2. sent. pag. 107.</note> He tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs forsooth, that the price of euery thing may be equall to the value and worth of the same thing, two wayes: First (sayth he) of the Nature of the thing: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of the Pact, Couenant and Promise of him, that doth promise the same thing. For (sayth our Fryer By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe,) if one Penny be the full value answearable to the worke; yet if a greater reward be promised, which far exceedeth the worth &amp; value of the worke wrought; then, that reward is also due by couenaunt. and hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this great learned <hi>Fry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r</hi> Byshoppe concludeth roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (I had almost sayd, learnedly;<note place="margin">The Byshoppe confuteth him selfe, he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie.</note>) that though our Good workes come farre short of eternall life, if we respect the worthynesse thereof; yet doe they condignely merite the ioyes of Heauen, if we respect the free Promise of Christ Iesus. And this condignitie of Workes, our <hi>Fryer</hi> calleth aequalitie of Promise onely. But heere our By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe <hi>Fryeo,</hi> (by his fauour I speake it,<note place="margin">A very fond distinction, inuented without rime or reason.</note>) sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a very noddie: For doubtlesse, Promise, albeit it doth truely inferre Iustice, in respect of him that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth; yet can it neuer inferre Equalitie, betweene the worke and the reward. For example sake; If our <hi>Fryer</hi> should wish me to lend him my Cloake to defend him from a showre of raine, and withall should promise,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. v. 2. Heb. 6.10. 2. Tim. 4.8. Iac. 1.12. Iac. 2.5. Psal. 130.3 Psal. 143.2.</note> to giue me an hundred poundes for the loane; then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse were it true to say, that after such loane, an hundred poundes were of Iustice due vnto me; yet withall it would be most true also, that such loane of my Cloake
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14089:146"/>
were not the condigne Merite of that hundred poundes? I willingly graunt; that eternall life is due to the workes of Gods elect, and that it is as well the crowne of Iustice, as of Mercie: But withall I constantly auouch, that God bestoweth it on his Elect freely for his owne names sake, &amp; not for any merite, worthinesse, or condignitie of their Workes.<note place="margin">S. R. pag. 257.</note> And the <hi>Fryers</hi> answere is childish and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; when he denieth the loane of the Cloake, to haue such virtuall and proportionate equalitie to an Hundred poundes, as mans Merites haue to Glory. For first, the Promise is equall, and holdeth in both alike. Secondly, the Promise doth not adde any Worthines to the worke: and consequently, there is still as great inequalitie after the Promise, as was before the same. Thirdly, there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite distance betweene God and Man; the Worke, and the Reward: as their Angelicall Doctor hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. But the distance and inequalitie betweene the Loane of the Cloake, and the Hundred poundes, is finite and limited in them both.

               <head>The 8. Conclusion.</head>
               <p>The doctrine of the Popish Schoole-doctors, in which they affirme Charitie to be the forme of Fayth, is friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ridiculous, false, erroneous, and absurd. I prooue it, first; because in thinges distinguished intrinsecally, one can not be the forme of another. If our <hi>Fryer</hi> deny this, he will prooue him selfe an Asse; <hi>Si non actu, at saltem in potentia:</hi> For an Asse by this graunt, may be his forme, and so giue him the denomination of that worthy Beast. Now, that Fayth and Charitie are distinct Theologicall virtues;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. v. 13.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth it so plainely, as no deniall can

be made thereof. Secondly, because of thinges in perfect essence and nature, the latter can not possiblely be the forme of the former; and consequently, seeing Fayth goeth before Charitie, Charitie cannot possiblely be the forme thereof. The antecedent is euident; because what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer commeth to a thing after the essentiall constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, is meerely extrinsecall &amp; accidentall to the same. The consequent is likewise euident; because we can neither please God, nor yet come to God,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. v. 6.</note> but by Fayth in him. It is the flat and constant Doctrine, of the chosen vessell of our Lord Iesus. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, because Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is the effect and worke of Fayth S. <hi>Augustine</hi> proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it, in these golden wordes:<note place="margin">Aug. in Epist.

and odible to God and all good men. Two kindes of notorious workes, I will onely touch for the present; the Stewes, &amp; the Hospitall <hi>De sancto spiritu.</hi> The <hi>Romanes</hi> forsooth, are so mortified and so holy; partly by the Pope for the time being, who (if he be truely named) is not onely Holy, but Holynesse it selfe in the abstract;<note place="margin">The Pope is now called, Holinesse.</note> partly, by the preachinges and other instructions of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> and <hi>Iesuited</hi> Popelinges, that the Pope forsooth, must perforce permit them to haue common Brothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses or Stewes, so to satisfie their beastly &amp; inordinate carnall lustes. I meane not heere to dispute, whether sinne in some cases may be tolerated, or noe;<note place="margin">In the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</note> I haue written of that subiect, else where at large. But this I meane for the good of the Reader, and edification-sake; to make it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the world, that the <hi>Romish</hi> Papistes, (who glorie in their meritorious workes,) are the worst liuers vpon earth. The Stewes are not sufficient, to bridle the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the inordinate carnall lust of the Saints at <hi>Rome</hi>: but they must further haue a second Toleration or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, for an Hospitall of Charitie forsooth;<note place="margin">The Hospitall of the Holy Ghost.</note> called for the surpassing vertue thereof, by the name of the holy Ghost. The end of this Hospitall is this, to keepe Whores and Whore-maisters, from villanous and most cruell Murders. Euery night, one of that holy Hospitall what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth diligently; and turning about a Wheele made for the purpose, receiueth new borne Bastardes into their c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stodie. The Wheele is so artificially contriued, that they can not know or see who bringeth the said Infant-bastardes. The Children are curteously receiued, &amp; haue vsage and education as if they were legitimate. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitall is very rich, and well able to maintaine all that are brought thither: It findeth moe, and more able friendes, then any other Hospitall: More Landes and Goods are giuen to it, then to any other. And no maruell; seeing all that the <hi>Romish</hi> Saintes doe giue to it, is giuen for the maintenaunce and education of their beloued Bastardes.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:14089:149"/>
When these Bastards come to yeares of discretion, either sooner or latter, as it seemeth good to the Fathers; then they come to visite the sayd Hospitall, and to see their owne Bastardes; and for a worke of Charitie, they make choyse of those whom they loue and like the best. Will not such Holy workes of mercie, merite Heauen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignely? by Popish Fayth and Diuinitie, it is approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with great solemnitie. But how (will some say) doe the Fathers know their owne Bastardes? I answere, that it is a thing very easie to be done: For, the Fathers and Mothers, (or some by their procurement,) doe hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the neckes of their Bastardes, speciall Tokens or Iewels, by which they may know them an other day: Which Tokens, the Gouernours of the Hospitall by the Lawes thereof, (which they are sworne to obey, obserue, and performe,) must carefully from time to time keepe, and see that they neuer be taken from their Neckes, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their aboade in the sayd Hospitall. This Storie, I haue for this end heere inserted, that the world may know the meritorious workes of the Pope, <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and other <hi>Romish</hi> Papistes. The censure whereof, I leaue to the iudicious and honest Reader.</p>

               <p>As it is true, by the constant Doctrine of best Learned Popish Writers; that the best Workers are not condigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meritorious of Eternall life, without the Promise of God made to reward them.

prooue, by many meanes and inuincible reasons. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because a Promise, (although it make the thing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to be iustly a kind of debt, and so of iustice both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and expected,) neither doth nor can change the nature of the Worke, or attribute any condignitie or worthinesse to the same. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because the Promise is freely made, and farre exceedeth the worthinesse of the Worke. So sayth the popish Fryer <hi>John de Combis,</hi>

How therefore can he boast of his Merites, which is deliuered; who, if he were dealt withall according to his Merites, should of necessitie be damned? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, because our best so supposed Merites, are the free Giftes of God, of his meere Mercie bestowed on vs. So sayth th'Apostle; What hast thou,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. v. 7.</note> which thou hast not receiued? and if thou haue receiued it, why boastest thou of it, as if thou haddest not receiued it?

righteousnesse. But to him that worketh, wages is not imputed according to Grace, but according to debt.

course; but to denie the councel to haue decreed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>digne merite, to be an Article of Popish faith. For (saith hee,<note place="margin">True merit and condigne merit, is all one.</note>) the Councell hath no word of condigne merit, but onely of true merit. And after he hath cited the words of the Councell, he addeth these of his owne. <hi>Here are good works defined to be true merite of Glory, without determining whether they be condigne merite thereof, or no.</hi> Thus saith our Iesuite; shewing himselfe to be either too too malicious, or else a very noddie. For to merite truely and condignely, is all one. Otherwise, our Iesuite must tell vs, (which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be done;) how one can merite a thing truely, and for all that not worthily and condignely deserue the same. Well, we haue it freely granted, because it can not be denied; that the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> defined true merite, but not condigne merite of workes, to bee an Article of popish faith. And consequently, the Iesuite must <hi>volens nolens</hi> confesse; that the Councell defined condigne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, vnder the name of true merite.

This Text may bee vnderstood, either of Election to the Apostleship, or of eternall Election to Saluation. For in both there is grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but no merit; and both are wrought by Christ: for, in him and through him did God chose vs, euen before the world was made. I (saith he) who am God, and therefore stand in need of nothing, I who can punish and condemne, haue not simply taken you; but reiecting many others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue chosen you out of the masse of corruption. Christ therefore doth by these words teach vs, that hee is the authour of our saluation. Then, that whatsoeuer we haue, the same is grace; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be those iustifying gifts, faith, hope, charity, the holy Spirit, &amp; the like; or other externall gifts which by another name are called graces freely giuen That which our Sauiour sayth of <hi>Marie Magdalene,</hi> that many sinnes were forgiuen her,<note place="margin">Luke 7.47.</note> because shee loued much; doth serue well to illustrate that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is here obiected of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. For Christes Argument is not drawne from the cause but from the effect; as if Christ had sayd, we may know by her great loue, that great gifts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on her, that many sinnes are forgiuen her: for, that not remission of her sinnes proceeded from her loue, but her loue from the forgiuenesse of her sinnes; the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the debtors doth plainly insinuate the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.<note place="margin">Luke 7 41.</note> Christ told <hi>Peter</hi> of two debters, whereof the one owed fiue hundred pence, the other fiftie; and that when they had not wherewith to pay, the creditour forgaue them both: he therefore demaunded of <hi>Peter,</hi> whether of

                  </note> that seeing <hi>Marie Magdalene</hi> loued more, he might know that shee had more forgiuen her Because saith Christ, to whom little is forgiuen, the same loueth little: neither is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to draw any other meaning out of Christs wordes; The reason is euident, because Christ saith plainely; that the debts were freely forgiuen the debters, who were not able to pay the debts. For otherwise, <hi>Maries</hi> forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse could haue no coherence, with the similitude of the debters. Out of this discourse, these points are euidently deduced. First, that wee are the sonnes of God,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. v. 4.</note> not by nature, (for so wee are his enemies, and the children of wrath but by grace and adoption in Iesus Christ. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that God chose vs to be his children, before wee were borne. Thirdly, that he chose vs, not because wee were holy but that we might bee holy and immaculate in his sight. Fourthly, that he predestinated vs to be his children by adoption; not for any good workes which we either had done, or could doe, but for his owne good pleasure to the glorie of his grace: for, as to doe any workes at all before we be borne,<note place="margin">Psal. 51 v. 7. Ephes. 2. v. 4.</note> is altogether impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; so to doe good workes when we are borne, (seeing we are conceiued in sinne, borne in sinne, and by nature the children of warth,) is impossible in like manner. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all our good Workes, are the effects and fruites of our predestination. For if it be true, as it is most true, (els the Apostle were a lyer,) that we were elected to be holy and to doe good Workes; it is also true,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. v. 3. 5. Esa. 50.2. Psal. 51.5.</note> (it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be denyed,) that holy life and good Workes, are the effects of our Election and Predestination in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.

nec a Patre luminum, a quo descendit omne datum optimum, boni aliquid accipere quisquam meretur, nisi accipiendo quod non meretur.</hi> They that expect rewards, as due to their merites; doe not ascribe their merites to the grace of God, but to the strength of their owne will. We (saith the Apostle) haue not receiued the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know what God hath giuen vs; and so, that the merite of man is the Free gift of God: neither can any man receiue any good from the Father of Light, (from whom descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth euery good gift,) by way of merit; vnlesse hee first receiue that, which he doth not merite. Thus discourseth S. <hi>Augustine</hi>:<note place="margin">Vide super Concl. 6. et nota valde.</note> out of whose Wordes, I obserue these me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Doctrines. First, that whosoeuer expecteth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as due to his merites, doe greatly derogate from the grace of God. Secondly, that mans merite (vnproperly so called,) is the Free gift of God. Thirdly, that no man can merite any reward at all; vnlesse hee first receiue that freely of meere mercie, which he can no way merit.

This is soundly and clearely prooued, in the seuenth Conclusion of this present Chapter. I prooue the same in like manner, out of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> expresse Words afore going. For first hee calleth it arrogant pride, to challenge Eternall life as due to the merites of any man. Secondly, he flatly denyeth the best Liuer on earth to haue that iustice, to which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life is due. Thirdly, hee plainely auoucheth, that they derogate more then a little from Gods grace, who
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:14089:162"/>
do but expect reward as due vnto their merits. Fourthly, that all the merite of man, is Gods meere and Free gift. Fiftly, that when God rewardeth mans merits, then doth he onely reward his owne free gifts; and consequently, that when S. <hi>Austen</hi> speaketh of mans merite, he euer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth merite vnproperly so called, as also Abbot <hi>Bernard,</hi> and other Fathers doe: <note place="margin">Conclusiones praecedentes praesertim sept. hoc planò demonstrant.</note>yea, <hi>Gregorius Ariminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, Thomas Waldensis, Paulus Burgensis, Eckius Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Before, he came vpon the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> for accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all such as did denie or not beleeue the Condigne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of mans workes, and inueighed against that doctrine, as a Monster lately borne at <hi>Rome</hi>: and yet now, the same doctrine is against the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Iesuite S.

Secondly, that I can not reprooue the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>; vnlesse I also condemne the Pope the chiefe Author of the same; as is already prooued. Thirdly, that whatsoeuer maketh against the Councell, must perforce make also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> and all others that approoue the same. Fourthly, that the doctrine which afore was false &amp; mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous, is still as false, bad, &amp; monstruous, as euer it was; if not rather more. Fiftly, that the change which the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi> speaketh of, is in him selfe, but not in <hi>Bell</hi>: For, <hi>Bell</hi> doth not affirme that Doctrine to be found &amp; heauenly, which afore hee tearmed false and monstruous; but hee only &amp; plainely sheweth, that the <hi>Jesuite</hi> striuing against the trueth, doth by the force of trueth, vnawares confesse the trueth against himselfe. And consequently, that hee vnwittingly &amp; vnwillingly graunteth the trueth against himselfe: which is as much as I desire. I prooue it briefly and soundly; because the <hi>Iesuite</hi> hauing in his second Conclusion, affirmed Good workes done in Gods grace, to be condignely Meritorious of eternall life: by and by addeth in the third Conclusion, this restriction; <hi>viz.</hi> that the condigne Merite he speaketh of, is not absolute, but supposeth the condition of Gods Promise made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it. Which doubtlesse, is the flat Doctrine that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: For if Gods Promise must be supposed, there is no condigne Merite without the same. Let the indifferent Reader be an indifferent Iudge, betweene the <hi>Iesuite</hi> and mee. I willingly admit his third Conclusion; and so make an end of this Chapter. For, all that is heere sayd, or possibly can be sayd, in defence of Condigne merite of Workes; is clearly and foundly refuted in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of this present Chapter, if due application be made thereof.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL that the <hi>Iesuite</hi> sayth in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is pithyly refuted both in the <hi>Downefall of Poperie,</hi> and in the <hi>Jesuites Antepast</hi>: And consequently, I haue no need to stand here, vpon the same. The <hi>Fryer</hi> freely graunteth; that Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation touching the name, was not hatched till their <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, which was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den 1215. yeares after Christ. But he sayth withall; that the poynt of Doctrine it selfe, that is,<note place="margin">A.D. 1215.</note> the changing of the substaunce of Bread, into the Body of Christ, by the words of Consecration; was taught by the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and came from Christ himselfe, &amp; his blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. My answere is this: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that I haue very sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and copiously refuted, in my <hi>Suruey of Poperie,</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer can possibly be alleadged or produced out of the holy Fathers, concerning this Subiect now in hand.<note place="margin">See the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey, part. 3. cap. 10. § 1.2.3.4.5.</note> To this Booke, in the third part and tenth Chapter, I referre the Reader for his full satisfaction in this behalfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that aswell the thing it selfe, as the name, was first hatched in the Councell of <hi>Lateran.</hi> For, no Text in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> no Sentence in the Prophets, no Word in the Psalmes, no Affirmation out of the Ghospell, no Testimonie out of the Epistles of the Apostles, no Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict out of the holy Fathers, no specialtie out of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councels, can now, or euer be found extant; which once maketh mention either of Transubstantiation, or of accidentes without subiectes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that this Popish fondly imagined Transubstantiation, is farre different from that Reall presence; with which the Pope and his Romish Synode most cruelly assayled <hi>Berengarius.</hi> That
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:14089:167"/>
Reall presence (though most absurd, as I haue prooued demonstratiuely in the Iesuites <hi>Antepast,</hi>) may well stand with Consubstantiation,<note place="margin">Marke well gentle reader, and thou shalt see the Fryers backe at the wall.</note> and nothing at all change the substaunce of Bread: For it is a Popish foundation, (though foolish and ridiculous, as is prooued in my <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey,</hi>) that two Bodyes may be in one place at once. This Transubstantiation sendeth the substance of Bread, neither my selfe, nor yet the Papistes can tell whither. That Reall presence altereth not Christes Body; but this Transubstantiation changeth the substaunce of Bread, into Christes Body. That Reall presence causeth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes without subiectes; but this Transubstantiation inferreth Miracles vpon Miracles, aboue ten thousand times a day. Popish Reall presence is one thing; of which I dispute not in my <hi>Tryall</hi>: Popish Transubstantiation is an other thing; which is the subiect now in hand. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that the Papistes them-selues doe not know, what to thinke or say of their lately inuented Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation. <hi>Durand</hi> (as I haue prooued in the <hi>Downefall of Poperie,</hi>) affirmeth constantly; that onely the forme of Bread is changed, and that the matter of Bread remaineth still in the Eucharist. <hi>Rupertus</hi> the Popish Abbot holdeth; that the Bread is vnited Hypostatically to the Sonne of God. Cardinall <hi>Caietanus, Henricus,</hi> and <hi>Capreolus,</hi> are of an other different opinion. <hi>Iohannes Parisionsis</hi> held also, that the Bread was assumpted;<note place="margin">See and note well, the Tryall.</note> but in a different manner from the opinion of <hi>Rupertus.</hi> An other opinion yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, which affirmeth the Annihilation of the Bread. Yet Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> holdeth with the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> (for hee that at <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth otherwise, must be burnt;) that the Bread is transubstantiated into the Body of Christ. What Childe in the fyre, would not come foorth to heare this harmonie? Will yee heare what the learned Fryer <hi>S.R.</hi> sayth to this discordant melodie? these are his expresse wordes, in his pretensed Answere to the <hi>Downefall of Poperie</hi>:<note place="margin">S.R. pag. 140.</note> 
               <hi>The first Contradiction, which

this contradictions fellow findeth in the Masse, is, that <hi>Durand,</hi>
                  <hi> Caietan,</hi> and foure Catholiques more, before the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> did otherwise explicate the manner of Christes Reall presence in the Eucharist, then was trueth, and since the Church hath defined and explicated in the sayd Councell.</hi> Thus answereth <hi>S.R.</hi> that Learned man, as <hi>B.C.</hi> his brother calleth him. By whose learned As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, we are giuen to vnderstand; that Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was not an Article of Popish sayth vndoubtedly, vntill the late Popish Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>: <note place="margin">A.D. 1547.</note>that is, 1547. yeares after Christ.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, because S. <hi>Austen</hi> affirmeth constantly, that the best liuer vpon earth, shall perish euerlastingly, if he find not Mercie farre aboue his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertes.

               <p>I answere; first, that the more our sillie <hi>Iesuite</hi> striueth against the trueth, the more he still woundeth rotten Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie. Fiue examples he heere produceth, and neuer one to the purpose; as by &amp; by (God willing) shall appeare.<note place="margin">Poperie lyeth a bleeding vnto death.</note> Secondly, that if Poperie were not the New religion in very deed, such paultry and beggerly shiftes would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be vsed in defence thereof. Thirdly, that the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not of those actes, which Gods Saintes doe alone and of them-selues; but of those effectes, in producing whereof, Gods Saintes are sayd to concurre, and to be ioyned with Christ our Sauiour. And therefore of the fiue Examples, three are altogeather impertinent; <hi>viz.</hi> the first, the third, &amp; the fourth. For, in the first place, the Angel doth not connotate a Creature, but God himselfe: which I prooue, by a double argument. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because the Text speaketh of that <hi>Angel, which deliuered Israel</hi> or <hi>Jacob from all euill</hi>; which effect can not possibly be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to any Creature, but, <hi>To God alone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 15.5. Iac. 1.17. 1. Cor 3.8. 2. Cor. 3.4.</note> the fountaine of all Grace, and giuer of euery good guift. And it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; because the same God, which in the 15 verse is said, <hi>To haue fed Israel all his life long</hi>; is likewise sayd in the verse following, <hi>To haue deliuered him from all euill.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because two other places of Scripture, doe interpret
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14089:171"/>
the Angel to be God himselfe;<note place="margin">Gen. 31. v. 13. Gen. 18. v. 15.19.14.</note> 
                  <hi>The God of Bethel, &amp; the God that did keepe Jsrael whither soeuer he went.</hi> In the third place, as also in the fourth, the actes are onely ascribed to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and to S. <hi>Paul</hi>: but neither the Apostle nor the <hi>Jsraelites,</hi> are sayd to concurre with Christ in producing the same effect. Let the wordes be well marked and the case is cleare. The second, and fift or last Examples doe prooue indeed, that Gods Saints are ioyned with Christ in producing the same effectes; but for all that, are as far from concluding the <hi>Iesuites</hi> purpose, as <hi>Rome</hi> is distant from <hi>Roan,</hi> or the East from the West. For, albeit I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly graunt, that Gods Saintes may concurre and be conioyned with Christ, in producing al those effectes to which they are deputed of God, as instrumentes, meanes, and inferiour causes vnder him hauing to that end recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him actiue power in some measure; yet doe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly denie,<note place="margin">Marke well this my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> and vtterly defie, that most vnchristian, blasphemous, and hereticall Popish assertion; which brutishly and more then cruelly auoucheth, that <hi>Beckets</hi> Blood and Christes most pretious Blood, concurre in working mans Saluation. For, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> truely sayd, that the Sword of God and <hi>Gideon</hi> destroyed their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;<note place="margin">Iudg. 7. v. 20.</note> so may it truely be sayd in like manner; that God and the Phisition cure inward sores:<note place="margin">When God appoynteth his creatures to be causes inferiour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, then may they be ioyned with him, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</note> God and the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, externall woundes: that God and Masons builde Churches: God and Taylors make Garmentes: God and Meate nourish men, and so foorth. But we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer truly say, that Christes Blood and <hi>Beckets</hi> Blood, doe worke mans Saluation. The Sword of <hi>Gideon,</hi> Masons, Surgions, Phisitions, Meate, and Taylors, haue a certaine actiue power inherent in them to produce such effectes: but mans Saluation is such a diuine, supernaturall, &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent effect,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.6.

               <p>I answere; first, that in my <hi>Suruey</hi> I haue disputed at large, how Inuocation of Saints increased by degrees. For the better cleering of which difficultie, I there put downe many Canons and Conclusions.

In an other Canon, I prooued soundly; that the first seed of Popish inuocation of Saintes began not to besowen, <note place="margin">A D. 233.</note>till about the yeare 233. after Christ. In an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Canon, <note place="margin">A.D. 250.</note>that about the yeare 250. after Christ, some of the Fathers held constantly, that the Saintes in heauen did pray for the lyuing vpon earth.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:14089:172"/>
of Saintes, I disputed in that Booke at large. To which Booke, though published about thirteene yeares agoe; neither this <hi>Jesuite,</hi> nor any other, euer had any cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to this day, to frame any answere at all. In my <hi>Tryall of the new Religion,</hi> (which this <hi>Jesuite</hi> hath taken in hand to confute,) I constantly affirme, that to Pray to be saued by the Blood of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> is flat blasphemy against the Sonne of God. And as I affirmed afore in my <hi>Suruey,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Suruey, part. 3. cap. 7.</note> that Poperie sprang vp by degrees in such and such yeares; so now I constantly auouch, that to be saued by the Blood of <hi>Becket</hi> was vnknowen to the Church for the space of a thousand yeares and odde. <note place="margin">The fault es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped in the printing, is all the comfort our sillie Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite can find.</note>In the Margent, the Printer hath negligently set downe 1407 for 1047. yeares after Christ.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14089:173"/>
                  <hi>Fryer</hi> would enforce vpon mee: And I prooue the same by two reasons, which plainely conuince and confound the <hi>Fryer.</hi> First, for that I was so farre from intending any such thing, either by word or writing; that I was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereat, so soone as I read the same: Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my vsuall custome euer hath been, (as al my Bookes will declare and prooue,) to say, These are the expresse wordes, when soeuer I cite any Author. His third Lie is this; <hi>viz.</hi> that I haue offered violence to Gods word. I prooue it two wayes: First, because S. <hi>Pauls</hi> true meaning is, as I affirme; whereof none can stand in doubt, that shall duely peruse my <hi>Suruey</hi>: Againe, because the <hi>Jesuite</hi> graunteth as much; as by and by will appeare.</p>

This is the trueth, concerning <hi>Gregorie</hi> and <hi>Serenus. Serenus</hi> thought it time, to breake the Images, when the people began to adore them. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> thought, they might still remaine in the Church; so the people were instructed how to vse them; and prohibited to Worshippe them. And of his opinion, are some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in this age, who still retaine Images in their Temples. I neither dare condemne those, who still keepe them in their Churches or Temples; nor yet those, who haue abolished the same. But this I boldly auouch; that <hi>Serenus</hi> had for his example, both the fact of the good King <hi>Ezechias,</hi>

                  <hi>The most that can be gathered out of S. <hi>Paules</hi> wordes is this; That in his time, the Eucharist was ministred to Lay-people vnder both kinds; which we deny not: but they prooue not, that it neither was, nor might be giuen vnder one kind.</hi> Thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth our <hi>Iesuite,</hi> affirming resolutely, that the tradition receiued from Christ, and deliuered by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered &amp; changed; &amp; consequently, that it is free, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and not commaunded by any Law.

of Flesh liuing on the land, aswell foure footed Beastes, as Birdes, may not be eaten in time of our Lent-fast.

often in a most dangerous and damnable state: for they perswaded them-selues, that they were aswell bound to keepe the Popes Lawes therein, as if they had been the flat Lawes of God; and consequently, so often as they brake them, (which was no rare thing,) so often did they commit damnable sinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. v. 23.

This Discourse (if my <hi>Tryall</hi> be annexed to it,) is enough concerning this Subiect.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:14089:201"/>
free, voluntarie, and not commaunded by any Law. To S. <hi>Austen,</hi> I answere first, that the Sermon which our <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi> citeth, is not his, but a counterfeit. My reason is at hand; because S. <hi>Austen</hi> (as is already prooued,<note place="margin">Aug. ad Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan. epist. 86.</note>) affirmeth constantly; that the Apostles made no Law for Fasting: This is already prooued. Secondly, that in things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, (such as I haue prooued Lent to be,) euery one is bound to obey the Law of that Church,<note place="margin">The Church may appoynt Fastes, for spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall causes, which Aerius denyed.</note> in which he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: And so, he that keepeth not Lent-fast, may truely be said to sinne. Thirdly, that S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and S. <hi>Austen</hi> did not reprooue <hi>Aerius,</hi> for denying popish Lent-fast, which was at that time vnhatched; but for denying the Churches Authoritie, in appoynting Fasting-dayes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what cause soeuer.

Thirdly, he graunteth freely, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes Fast, to satisfie God for their sinnes.

This is found and very Catholike doctrine, though proceeding from the Penne of a great Papist. Which Doctrine, as the Councell of <hi>Constience</hi> first, and after it the Councell of <hi>Basill,</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue by their flat decrees; so doe I reuerently embrace the same with all my heart, humbly thanking God, that by the mighty power of his trueth, our aduersaries are compelled to confesse the trueth against them-selues. This Doctrine is confirmed more at large, both in my <hi>Anatomie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See my Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, pag. 137.</note> and in my <hi>Golden Ballance</hi>; to say nothing of my <hi>Christian Dialogue,</hi> which woundeth the Pope at the very heart.

This forsooth; that all Papistes this day liuing,<note place="margin">All Papistes are Heretikes.</note> are flat Heretiques. Is it so, in deede? Is that possible to be prooued? It is so possible, that I haue euen now prooued the same most euidently. And thus the most simple Reader in the world, shall easily perceiue the same. The generall Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> decreed plainely, that the Popes Iudgement is fallible; &amp; that the Pope is subiect to a generall Synode, and by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie thereof may be depriued of the Popedome: as also that the contrary opinion is flatte Heresie. This is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die prooued. Now, so it is, that all Papistes this day li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vpon earth, doe hold the Popes Iudgement to be infallible, and himselfe to be aboue a generall Councell: So say the <hi>Rhemistes</hi>;<note place="margin">Rhem. in 16.

True it is likewise, that Pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> had confirmed the same Decree, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be obserued.

In which wordes, S. <hi>Austen</hi> giueth the Reader to vnderstand, that though S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did contemne both the definitiue Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Pope, and the Decree of his prouinciall Councell, because neither of their Iudgements was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; yet would he haue yeelded to the Decree of a plenarie Councell, as which he acknowledged to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and to haue the assistannce of the holy Ghost. Let vs adde further, that the two hundred &amp; seauenteene Fathers in the <hi>Aphrican</hi> Councell, (whereof S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was one,) were so farre from acknowledging the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Christes Vicar generall vpon earth, to be aboue a plenarie Councell, and his Iudgement to be infallible; that they all with one assent refused vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to graunt any such Prerogatiue or Priuiledge vnto him; constantly affirming, that he was bound as well as they, to obey the Decrees of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell.

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:14089:221"/>
is mangled, maimed, and bereaued of a chiefe part of the integritie thereof. For, as hee that clippeth the Kinges Coyne, is thereby a Traytor to an earthly King: euen so hee that clippeth or curtalleth Gods sacred Word, is thereby a Traytor to God the King of Heauen. And consequently, seeing the Pope in his idolatrous Masse, hath curtalled the <hi>Pater noster,</hi>

Cor. 14. v. 27.</note> contrary to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall doctrine. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, because the <hi>Pater noster</hi> in the popish Masse, (marke well my wordes,) is made as it were a slaue to Satan, and to serue Idolatrie; euen against the euerliuing God, to waite and attend vpon the popish Bread-God: And so the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> which afore was pure and Euangelicall; is now by popish Superstition, become impure and Diabolicall. But some will here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, how the <hi>Pater noster</hi> doth serue Idolatrie? To whom I answere, that euery thing in popish Masse, is meere accidentall, (as the <hi>Jesuite</hi> hath freely graunted,) the popish Reall presence onely excepted; to weet, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish so supposed <hi>Dagon</hi> or Bread-god.<note place="margin">1.

Neither ought this to seeme strange to the Reader: for, as holy Wordes in Coniurations, Theftes, Robberies, Treasons, and the like, are by the abuse prophaned, and morally become vnholy: euen so the holy wordes of the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> are in the popish Masse prophaned and become vnholy.

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere thus; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receiued the true Catholique &amp; Apostolique Faith, in the dayes of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi>; which S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe testified,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.8.</note> while he affirmed their Fayth to he renowmed in the whole world. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> receiued the same Catholique and Apostolique Fayth, from the good Byshoppes of <hi>Rome,</hi> at their first conuersion vnto the Fayth of Christ Iesus. <hi>Explico. Brutani,</hi> now called <hi>England,</hi> first receiued the Christian Fayth, by <hi>Faganus</hi> and <hi>Deruvianus</hi> sent from <hi>Elutherius</hi> the good Byshoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> at the earnest request of <hi>Lucius</hi> then King of <hi>Brutani</hi>; which was in the yeare 179. after Christ.<note place="margin">A.D. 179.</note> After that, <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the first Christian King of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> was conuerted to the Fayth of Christ, by <hi>Augustine,</hi>

            <head>A Caueat to the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>THE masked <hi>Jesuite</hi> in his Preface to the Reader,<note place="margin">Preface, pag. 15.</note> laboureth with might and maine to perswade his Readers, that I dare not performe that challenge, which I made to the <hi>Fore-runner</hi>: his wordes are these. <hi>I the meanest of many millions, doe accept of his Challenge, and doe vndertake to defend, not onely these two poynes of <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> Doctrine, and Pope <hi>Martins</hi> Dispensation, which he hath singled out as matters important; but also all the rest, so it may be with that equitie and fauour, which was graunted to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes</hi> in <hi>France</hi>
               </hi>:<note place="margin">Chalenges doe occupie no place: they are adiectiues, which can not stand without subiectes.</note> 
               <hi>And vpon the same conditions doe prouoke him with a counter-challenge, to the defence of his Bookes.</hi> And a litle after, he telleth his Reader, <hi>That hee sendes me as many Challenges, as will stand betweene <hi>Charing-crosse</hi> &amp; <hi>Chester</hi>; and as many Dares, as will reach from <hi>Darby</hi> to <hi>Darington.</hi>
               </hi> To which I answere in this manner. First, that the <hi>Jesuites</hi> are accused and charged by their deare Breathren the popish Secular Priestes, with Pride, Ambition, Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, Coozenage, Theft, Crueltie, Murther, Treason, and all wickednesse that can be named: Yea, of Fryer <hi>Parsons</hi> that trayterous <hi>Iesuite,</hi> they giue this testimonie in particular; <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Parsons</hi> platformes, Secular Priestes must depend vpon <hi>Blackwell,</hi> and <hi>Blackwell</hi> vpon <hi>Garnet,</hi> and <hi>Garnet</hi> vpon <hi>Parsons,</hi> and <hi>Parsons</hi> the Priestes Bastard vpon the Deuill. Peruse my <hi>Anatomy of popish Tyrannie,</hi> and there thou shalt finde this trueth, with great varietie of like matter. Secondly, that in all my Challenges, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but one onely Condition; which the <hi>Iesuite</hi> passeth ouer in silence, because he meaneth not to performe the same: The Condition is this; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Iesuite</hi> which
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:14089:226"/>
shall accept the Challenge,<note place="margin">The Author still so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth that he will performe his promise.</note> must put downe his name with his addition in print, and send it to me. Which if it be once performed during my life, I promised vpon my saluation, to doe what in me lyeth, to procure a false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, for the safe comming, safe abyding, and safe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of him (whosoeuer he be) that shall accept and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the true performance of the Challenge in maner aforesayd. Thirdly, that the <hi>Jesuite</hi> not daring indeed to accept the Challenge, and to encounter me, seeketh by fond cauils and shamelesse euasions, to instill into the eares and heartes of their silly deuoted Vassals, that I will not, because I dare not, performe my promise. And for the better effecting of their purpose, they require of me, that which I neuer promised; yea, that whereof my selfe am altogeather ignoraunt, and no way able to performe. For,<note place="margin">The Iesuite dareth not dispute, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth new conditions.</note> how can I performe that, which I doe not know? I must forsooth procure him a safe conduct, to dispute with that equitie and fauour, which was graunted to the <hi>Protestantes</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Marke for Christes sake, how feard our <hi>Iesuite</hi> is, to accept the Challenge. First, hee dareth not put downe in print, his name and addition: A tricke of Iesuiticall or rather Diabolicall pollicie. I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a safe conduct for <hi>B. C.</hi> Some bloody cut-throate I thinke hee be. Yet I must not know whether hee be a Man or a Monster; whether <hi>Pope Iohn</hi> the Woman, or some Deuill incarnate of a Popish <hi>Nunne.</hi> Besides this; I must accept of such slye conditions, as he addeth to my Challenge; so as he may be at libertie, to slippe the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when, and as he list: Whereby, who seeth not, that by all meanes he auoydeth to dispute or bicker with mee. Fourthly, that the <hi>Iesuite</hi> and his <hi>Jesuited</hi> complices, haue a long time intended, and still labour by vngodly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct meanes, to take away my life from me; and so to stoppe me from further writing against their rotten Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie.<note place="margin">Preface, pag. 18.</note> Yea, in his Preface he protesteth lustily, that hee hath prouided a Winding-sheete for the shrowding of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:14089:226"/>
my Carcase; and that he will with all speed, make ready my blacke Funerall. And it seemeth so in very deed: For vpon the 13. of Iune instant 1609. euen immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had finished this <hi>Catholique Triumph</hi>; there came a friendly Letter (but without name) vnto my handes, and a Packet with Siluer in it, which the man namelesse, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he had borrowed of me, &amp;c. The circumstaunces were such, (<hi>quae nunc non est narrandi locus,</hi>) that neither my selfe, nor others, durst open the Packet; as hauing appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant inducementes to suspect Poyson, Pestilence, or other like infection Diabolicall.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought good in briefe to insinuate to the Readers; that they may thereby see and perceiue, how vnable the Papistes are, to defende their late vpstart Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie: as who know no better meanes, but by seeking most cruelly to murder all such as stand in their way. God make me firme and constant in the trueth; and God defend me, and all professors of his holy trueth, from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish sauage crueltie: and in the end, bring vs to endlesse felicitie, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
