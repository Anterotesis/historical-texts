            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And we have reaſon to ſuppoſe that <hi>the Chief</hi> of the Jews there who had the greateſt Advantages of Education and Correſpondence, were the moſt intelligent: It might alſo be juſtly expected that upon the firſt notices of the Goſpel, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have been of all People moſt ready to acquaint themſelves with a Religion which was ſo much the Honour and Perfection of <hi>their own:</hi> And yet it ſeems, the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>chief</hi> of the Jews at <hi>Rome</hi> knew no more of Chriſtianity but this, that it was <hi>a Sect every where ſpoken againſt.

               <note place="margin">John 1.46.</note> They conclude that no <hi>good thing</hi> can <hi>come out of</hi> Nazareth, and will not be perſwaded to <hi>come and

               <p>And by the way, we may infer from hence, That thoſe who would be like their Heavenly Father, muſt <hi>bear Reproach</hi> and Contradiction patiently.

               <p>There are two common <hi>Pretences,</hi> and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly plauſible ones, under which thoſe that <hi>ſpeak againſt</hi> Religion ſhelter themſelves, but they are neither of them juſtifiable.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

And are the great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61261:21"/>
Principles of Religion become ſuch <hi>Moot-points,</hi> ſuch Matters of <hi>doubtful Diſputation,</hi> that it is indifferent which ſide of the Queſtion a Man takes, and upon which he may argue, <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> at his pleaſure?<note place="margin">Cic. de Nat.

But out of the abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaks, and whence can ſuch evil things come but from an evil Treaſure there?</p>
               <p n="2">2. They pretend that it is not <hi>Religion</hi> that they ridicule and expoſe to Contempt, but ſome particular <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Modes</hi> of religious Worſhip which they do not like. And this is one ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the unhappy Diviſions among Chriſtians, that while one ſide hath labour'd to make the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contemptible; Religion in general hath ſuffer'd on <hi>all ſides.</hi> To <hi>reprove</hi> what we think amiſs, with Prudence and Meekneſs is well, but to <hi>reproach</hi> and make a <hi>Jeſt</hi> of that which our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Chriſtians look upon as <hi>Sacred,</hi> and make a part of their Religion, cannot be to any good purpoſe at all. To ſcoff at the Miſtakes and Weakneſſes of our Brethren, is the way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and harden them, but not to convince and reform them. They who think to juſtify this way of <hi>ridiculing</hi> thoſe that differ from them, by the Inſtance of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s jeering the Prieſts of

               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Let us that profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, be very cautious that we do not give occaſion to any to ſpeak againſt it.</hi> If there are thoſe in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are induſtrious to caſt reproach upon Religion, then we have need to <hi>walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and to look well to our goings, that thoſe who <hi>watch for</hi> our <hi>halting</hi> may have no occaſion given them to Blaſpheme. It is certain that tho' in Religion there is nothing which may be juſtly ſpoken againſt, yet among <hi>thoſe</hi> that profeſs it there is too often found that which deſerves to be tax'd, and which cannot paſs without juſt and ſevere Reflections— <hi>Pudet haec opprobria no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> — Are there not thoſe within the Pale of the Church,<note place="margin">Ro. 2.24. 2 Pet. 2 2.</note> 
                  <hi>through whom,</hi> the <hi>Name of God</hi> and his <hi>Doctrine</hi> are <hi>blaſphemed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jude 12. The fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians took riſe from the vile pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi> and <hi>other Pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Of which Vid. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb.</hi> Eccl.

Now though it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very unjuſt and unfair to impute the faults of Profeſſors to the Religion they profeſs, and to reproach Chriſtianity, becauſe there are thoſe that are call'd Chriſtians who expoſe themſelves to Reproach; yet it is, without queſtion, the Sin of thoſe who <hi>give</hi> Men <hi>occaſion</hi> to do ſo. This was <hi>the Condemnation</hi> in <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd the Sword upon his Houſe, though the Sin was pardon'd, that by it he had <hi>given great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the Enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme,</hi>

2 Sam. 12.14. Let us therefore double our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and care, to give no offence either to Jew or Gentile, that Religion which hath ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been <hi>wounded in the Houſe of her Friends,</hi> may never be wounded through our ſides.</p>
               <p>If we enquire (as we are commanded to do) what it is that gives occaſion of Reflection upon Religion, we ſhall find that the <hi>Imprudences</hi> of thoſe that profeſs it, give ſome occaſion, but their <hi>Immoralities</hi> much more.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Imprudences</hi> of Chriſtians often turn to the Reproach of Chriſtianity. There may be ſuch over-doing even in Well-doing, as may prove Undoing. When more ſtreſs is laid than ought to be upon ſome inſtances of Religion, to the juſtling out of others, and the Exerciſes of Devotion are either miſ-timed, or miſ-placed, or miſ-proportion'd, Religion is hereby miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, or look'd upon to diſadvantage. Raſh and indiſcreet Zeal may give occaſion to thoſe who ſeek occaſion to ſpeak againſt all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Zeal.<note place="margin">Col. 4.5.</note> Therefore <hi>walk in Wiſdom towards them that are without.</hi> Religion is a moſt ſweet and pleaſant and amiable thing: Let not us by our Indiſcretion make it a <hi>Task</hi> to our ſelves, and a <hi>Terror</hi> to others. The more the Children of God are <hi>Children of Wiſdom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 7.35.</note> the more they <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi> it, and its ways. Chriſtian <hi>Prudence</hi> is very much the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Piety.</hi> Though it will ſecure the welfare of our own Souls if we walk in our Integrity, yet it is neceſſary for the preſerving of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of our Profeſſion, that we walk <hi>in Wiſdom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 14.8.</note> that <hi>Wiſdom of the Prudent</hi> which is to <hi>underſtand his way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ec. 10.10.</note> that <hi>Wiſdom</hi> which is <hi>profitable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</hi> And <hi>if any Man lack</hi> this <hi>Wiſdom, let him
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61261:23"/>
ask it of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1.5.</note> who <hi>gives liberally,</hi> and <hi>upbraids us not</hi> with our Folly. Pray with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 27.11. <hi>Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain Path becauſe of mine Enemies.</hi> (Hebr. becauſe of <hi>mine Obſervers.</hi>) Our Enemies are our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and will be ready to reproach our <hi>Way,</hi> for the ſake of the <hi>falſe ſteps</hi> we take in it, and therefore we have need to <hi>ponder the Path of our Feet,</hi> and let Diſcretion guide and govern our Zeal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Immoralites</hi> of thoſe who profeſs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity turn much more to the reproach of that Holy Religion; when thoſe that are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are griping and covetous, and greedy of the World, when they are falſe and deceitful, and unjuſt in their Dealings, ſowre and moroſe, and unnatural to their Relations, turbulent and unquiet in Societies, when they are froward and paſſionate, proud and haughty, hard-hearted and oppreſſive, looſe and intemperate. When they are found guilty of Lying and Cheating, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs or Uncleanneſs. When it appears that they keep up ſome ſecret <hi>Haunts</hi> of Sin, under the cloke and covert of a ſpecious Profeſſion, when they that profeſs the Chriſtian Faith lick up the vomit of Heathen, and allow themſelves in thoſe things that are contrary to the Light and Law even of Natural Religion. This is that which opens the mouths of the Adverſaries to ſpeak reproachfully of that Religion, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of which is made to conſiſt with ſuch vile Practiſes, which cannot poſſibly conſiſt with the <hi>Power</hi> of it. This makes People ready to ſay as that <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prince did, when the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had broke their League with him, <hi>O Jeſus, are theſe thy Chriſtians?</hi> Or as the complaint was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

another occaſion, <hi>Aut hoc non Evangelium, aut hi non Evangelici,</hi> Either this is not Goſpel, or theſe are not to be call'd Profeſſors of the Goſpel. If Miniſters <hi>give offence in any thing,</hi> not they only, but their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> will <hi>be blamed.</hi> Nay,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.3</note> if <hi>Servants,</hi> Chriſtians of the loweſt rank and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, if they be unfaithful, and diſobedient to the Government they are under,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.1.</note> the <hi>Name of God, and his Doctrine,</hi> is likely to be <hi>blaſphemed.</hi> Let us therefore who profeſs Relation to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal God, and Dependance upon the Bleſſed Jeſus, and a Regard to the Holy Scriptures, as we tender the Reputation of our Religion,<note place="margin">Col. 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing.</hi> Let us Order our Converſation ſo in every thing, as that we may <hi>adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 5.12.</note> Let us not do any thing that is unjuſt, or unbecoming us, nor allow our ſelves in that which we know the Goſpel we profeſs doth by no means allow of, leſt <hi>we</hi> be to anſwer another day, for all the <hi>Reproach</hi> of Religion which we have <hi>occaſion'd:</hi> How light ſoever we may make of this now, we ſhall find that it will greatly enflame the Reckoning ſhortly, when God will affect the Honour of his own Name, and will be <hi>glorified upon</hi> thoſe <hi>by</hi> whom he was not <hi>glorified.</hi> In conſideration of this, let us ſee to it that we <hi>have our Converſation honeſt</hi> among the Adverſaries of our Religion, that they who <hi>ſpeak againſt us as</hi> Evil-<hi>doers,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61261:24"/>
may,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.12.</note>

               <p>Sixthly, <hi>If there be thoſe every where that ſpeak againſt Religion and Godlineſs, let us then as we have opportunity be ready to ſpeak for it.</hi> Every Chriſtian ſhould be both a <hi>Witneſs</hi> and an <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> for his Religion, and the rather becauſe it is ſo much oppos'd and contradicted. Next to our <hi>Care</hi> not to be a <hi>Shame</hi> to the Goſpel, ſhould be our <hi>Reſolution</hi> not to be <hi>aſham'd</hi> of the Goſpel.

Should we hear a near Relation or a dear Friend (in whoſe Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it is natural to us to reckon our ſelves ſharers) ſpoken againſt and ſlander'd, we would readily appear in his Vindication; and have we no reſentments of the Contempt and Contumely caſt upon Religion? Can we ſit by <hi>contentedly</hi> to hear God and Chriſt, and the Scripture and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Godlineſs reflected upon, and have we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay in their behalf?

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Let none of us ever think the worſe of the way of Religion and Godlineſs for its being every where ſpoken againſt, nor be frighten'd hereby from walking in that way.</hi> The Contempt caſt upon the Practiſe of Piety is with many, an invincible Objection againſt it; their good Impreſſions, good purpoſes and good overtures are hereby cruſh'd and brought to nothing: They have that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 'em</hi> which tells 'em that the way of Sobriety and ſerious Godlineſs is a very good way, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61261:25"/>
they ſometimes hear that <hi>Word behind them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This is the walk ye in it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 30.21.</note> But they have thoſe <hi>about 'em</hi> that tell them otherwiſe, and thus the convictions of Conſcience are over-rul'd and baffled by the Cenſures and Reproaches of Men, whoſe Praiſe they covet <hi>more than the Praiſe of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to take off the force of this Objection, let us conſider theſe four Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider <hi>who they are</hi> that ſpeak againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Godlineſs, not only that they are <hi>Mortal</hi> Men,<note place="margin">Iſa. 51.7.8, 12.</note> whom the <hi>Moth ſhall eat up like a Garment, Men that ſhall die,</hi> and the <hi>Sons of Men which ſhall be made as Graſs,</hi> all whoſe thoughts will ſhortly periſh with them, and therefore why ſhould we <hi>fear their Reproach, or be afraid of their revilings?</hi> Nor only they that are <hi>fallible</hi> Men who may be miſtaken, and whoſe Judgment is by no means <hi>deciſive,</hi> nor ſuch as will bear us out: Shall we put what Men ſay in the Scale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what God ſaith? <hi>Let God be true and every Man a Liar.</hi> We muſt not be <hi>judg'd</hi> hereafter, and therefore ſhould not be <hi>rul'd</hi> now by the Sentiments and Opinions of Men: But thoſe that ſpeak againſt Religion are alſo for the moſt part <hi>ill</hi> Men; Men of unſettled Heads, debauch'd Conſciences, and profligate Lives. 'Tis <hi>the Fool</hi> and none but he, that <hi>ſaith in his heart, there is no God.</hi> The <hi>Scoffers</hi> of the laſt daies are Men that <hi>walk after their own Luſts,</hi> whoſe carnal, fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſt retains them on that ſide. <hi>David</hi> was abus'd by the <hi>abjects,</hi> Pſal. 35.15. and the Chriſtians at <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> by <hi>certain lewd Fellows of the baſer ſort,</hi> Acts 17.5. Such as thoſe are the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61261:26"/>
Men that make a mock at Religion, and ſhall we be ſway'd and influenced in the greateſt Concerns of our immortal Souls by ſuch Men as theſe? Shall thoſe have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>us</hi> that have ſo little Government of <hi>themſelves?</hi> Shall the Cavils and vain Scoffs of thoſe, who know not what it is to be <hi>ſerious,</hi> carry the day againſt the deliberate Sentiments of all Wiſe and Good Men, who have with one conſent ſubſcrib'd to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Goodneſs of Religion's Ways? If we chuſe ſuch as theſe for our Leaders, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Blind lead the Blind,</hi> and we know the conſequence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider how <hi>trifling</hi> and <hi>frivolous</hi> that is which is commonly ſaid againſt Religion and Godlineſs. The Devil made his firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal aſſault upon Mankind by <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> ſuggeſting hard thoughts of God, and promiſing Impunity in Sin; and by the ſame <hi>wretched</hi> methods he ſtill ſupports and carries on his Intereſt in the World. They that ſpeak againſt Religion, <hi>make Lies their Refuge,</hi> and under <hi>falſhood they hide themſelves.</hi> All thoſe bold and daring things which are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt Religion, are either groundleſs and unproved Calumnies, or very unjuſt and unfair Repreſentations.<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.2.</note> Hence the Enemies of Religion are ſaid to be <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Men.</hi> Men that while they cry up the Oracles of Reaſon, rebel againſt all the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of it. Put all that together which is ſpoken againſt Godlineſs, and weigh it in the Balances of right Reaſon, and you will write <hi>Tekel</hi> upon it, <hi>weigh'd in the Ballances and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61261:26"/>
found wanting.</hi> And, as if an over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had forced the Scoffers of theſe laſt days to confeſs their own Infatuation. Some of thoſe that have been moſt ſharp in their Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Religion, have been no leſs free in their <hi>Satyrs againſt Reaſon</hi> it ſelf, as if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to anſwer the Character of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Fool, whoſe <hi>Wiſdom fails him</hi> ſo far,<note place="margin">Eccl. 10.3.</note> that <hi>he ſaith to every one that he is a Fool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider how <hi>much</hi> is to be ſaid <hi>for Religion</hi> notwithſtanding it is <hi>every where ſpoken against.</hi> Religion hath Reaſon on its ſide, its Cauſe is a Good Cauſe; and it is the right way whoever <hi>ſpeaks</hi> againſt it.<note place="margin">Arch Bp. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Serm. on 2 Pet. 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>It is no diſparagement</hi> (as that excellent Pen expreſſeth it) <hi>to be laughed at, but to deſerve to be ſo;</hi> you have heard Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, but did you ever find that it <hi>deſerv'd</hi> to be ſo? Nay; on the contrary, have you not found that it very well deſerves your beſt Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Services? Enquire of thoſe that have made trial of it, conſult the Experiences of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: <hi>Call now, if there be any that will anſwer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turn?</hi>

                  <hi>that is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> They will tell thee, That Religion's Ways are <hi>Ways of Pleaſantneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 3.17</note> and all her <hi>Paths are Peace,</hi> and that all the Wealth and Pleaſure in this World is not worth one Hours Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in Jeſus Chriſt. They will tell thee, That there is no Truths ſo certain and weighty as Divine <hi>Truths,</hi> and that no Statutes and Judgments are ſo righteous as the Divine <hi>Law,</hi> which is <hi>Holy, Just,</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> They will tell thee, That real Holineſs and Sanctification
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61261:27"/>
is the Perfection of the <hi>Human</hi> Nature, as well as the Participation of a <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, That a firm Belief of the <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion is the greateſt improvement of our intellectual Powers, a ſtrict Adherence to its <hi>Rules</hi> our ſureſt Guide in all our Ways, and a chearful Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its <hi>Promiſes,</hi> the Fountain of better <hi>Joys,</hi> and the Foundation of better <hi>Hopes</hi> than any we can be furniſh'd with in the things of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi> They will tell thee that a Life of <hi>ſerious Godlineſs</hi> is incomparably the moſt Sublime and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the moſt Sweet and Comfortable Life a Man can live in this World; and that nothing doth more anſwer the end of our Creation, better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend Societies, nor conduce more to our true intereſt in both Worlds than that Holy Religion which is <hi>every where ſpoken against.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider that the cauſe of Religion and Godlineſs, however it be ſpoken againſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, will infallibly be the prevailing Cauſe at laſt. We are ſenſible of a mighty ſtruggle in the World betwixt the <hi>ſeed of the Woman and the ſeed of the Serpent; Michael</hi> and his <hi>Angels</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his <hi>Angels</hi> on the other. Many there are that <hi>ſpeak against</hi> Religion, and are very vigorous in oppoſing it, and ſome, tho' but a few, that are ſpeaking <hi>for</hi> it, contending for the Faith, and ſtriving againſt Sin, now it is deſirable to know which of theſe conteſting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts will be <hi>victorious;</hi> and we may be aſſur'd that the cauſe of God and Religion will certainly <hi>carry the day.</hi> Contradicted Truths will be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually clear'd and vindicated; Deſpiſed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs will be honour'd; Miſtakes rectify'd; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches roll'd away; and every thing ſet in a true Light.<note place="margin">Mal. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Then you ſhall return and diſcern</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
