            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

two thinges are to be wayde<note place="margin">The childe.</note> and considered, the body and the minde of the woman, and that her body be not to farre out of fashion.

For we do see, that suche short and defor med women bring forth most beautifull and goodlye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. We shoulde rather take bede, that she be not infected

These are more diligently to be eschued then those whiche are not so horrible and filthye. And yf thou thy self be infected with anye suche infirmitie. I wold thou shouldest dispose thy self to liue chaste withoute sinne, for as it is a thing most swete and delectable to haue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, so it is verye sharpe and a discomfortable thyng to see them oppressed wyth gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouse infyrmityes and disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the which (yf it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) we would rather desire

If we vse suche loue &amp; chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye vnto oure frendes, that they in no wyse, nor maner be not infected wyth oure infirmytyes, howe muche more shoulde we be studious towardes our owne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

So my preceptes shall haue an eye, and regarde those whiche are not wycked nor perfectly pitifull, for there is not one that is perfectlye pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull.

And yet they that amende &amp; returne from their enyll life, oughte not to be numbred among the euel, in asmuche as they haue tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theyr euyl lyfe into a bet ter. She is not muche vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke a shameles woman, that beynge naturallye inclyned to euyll doeth not geue her diligence to erect it, but folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge her naturall pleasure and desyre, doeth by an vse and custome kepe it vnder, and by softe and gentle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatynge,

And so it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that daye by daye, she ta keth more pleasure &amp; more in it, when that it were farre more conuenient to represse it, and by good motions and exercises to wynde &amp; tourne it to better.

no necessitie to doe euyl) but by some appearaunce or spice of necessitie, withoute the whiche manye myghte lyue more honestlye. Nor no man can lyue pleasauntlye with her that is euyll spoken of, nor haue amitie or anye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde with her, that is not naturally and stedfastly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And what thynge is more intollerable or more greuous to a wyse man, then to supporte or to suffer a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshe companion? And in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as to lyue together, doeth not onelye consiste in confabulation and wordes, but in all other thynges that pertayne to the lyfe of man. Therfore it is to be con sidered and wayed, who it is that wyll be maryed, and

For why a dull wyfe is nothynge meete nor conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for a dull husbande, nor an vnwyse woman for a wise man. Who shal rule the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye? Who shoulde nouryshe and brynge vp the children? Yea, what chyldren shoulde these two brynge forth?</p>
               <p>Verye asheades, or yf they be proper and goodlye, they shall for lacke of good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion become dull and astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And yet ther shalbe a bet ter agrement amonge these, then betwene a wyse man, and a dull or a foolyshe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

She put on, and toke of hys<note place="margin">Note'y e women.</note> clothes, and hys shoes, and made them cleane, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge a great familie, wolde suffer none other but her selfe to doe anye thyuge that belonged vnto her husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des bodye, she mended hys garmentes, washed theym, pleted them, layed them vp, and dyd all other thinges moste promptlye, the whiche her maydens now and then woulde haue bene greued to haue done.

               <p>If thou marye her that is fayre, thou shalte haue her common: yf she be foule, and euyl fauoured, she shalbe molestious and greuous, but
<pb facs="tcp:1930:66"/>
yet she shalbe thyne owne.</p>
               <p>If she be fayre, thou shalte haue a pleasure in her. And this. It is a greuous thyng to suffer her that is foule, and a harde thynge to kepe her that is fayre. And therfore they counseyled men to take those, which were neyther to fayre nor yet to foule: And to choose those that were of the meane sorte. For doubtlesse, they that are excellent faire, waxe insolente and proude, for when they see &amp; perceyue that menne beholde and gase vpou them, and that they be as it were in admiration to al men, they beleue that ther is som rare thyng in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al other, not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> standing that with their owne eyes

they do see as in a glasse how good a thynge that beautye is, and doe soone forget it.</p>
               <p>But consider with the eye of the mynde and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge, makyng a coniecture of them selues by other, how vnstable a thyng that be auty is.

The foule &amp; euyl fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red are ofte chaste, although there lacke no wyll, but the aduouterer onelye. But yet in thys thynge, after as the qualitie of the man is: there are certayne commodities that the luxurious &amp; fastidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man may haue to satiate and fulfyl hys wyl with all, &amp; he that is suspitious and in gelosye maye be in suretye.</p>
               <p>All these thinges are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and yet it is wont to chaunce thus. All thynges be in manne, as the mynde of

Hys wyfe that with his handes doeth<note place="margin">The labo rers wife</note> labour for hys lyuing, ought to be robuste and stronge, so that she maye helpe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure with hym, as in plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge and harrowynge of hys lande.

Nor y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> soule of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of the bodye doeth not die, so that we may beleue that thei whiche be departed doe loue all suche, as in thys worlde were deare vnto theym: and that they whyche lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Soules of those whyche bee departed and

deliuered from the bodye, do loue them not as deade, but as they loue their frendes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which are absent &amp; farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. And therfore we do see many women that kepe their fayth &amp; loue vnto their firste husbandes, as did <hi>Demotions</hi> the <hi>Ariopagites</hi> doughter, of the which S.

                  <hi>Pompeus</hi> last wife, taking and esteminge her selfe but as an harlot as touchinge <hi>Iulia</hi> hys first wife, as though the knot and band of matrimonye and loue did yet indure bet wixte the liuing and deade. And na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally euery man desireth to be loued and doth searche for the fauour of other men, and studieth to kepe &amp; to encrease those thinges, that cause hym to be in fauour. If thy wife do perceaue, that thou art raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and taken with her beau tie, and would that thou shul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest loue her, she wil do al her diligence to encrease &amp; aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente it, yf with her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. she will neuer cease pratling, yf with her vertue, she wil dayly labor howe in all

honest &amp; vertuous dedes she maye be better. <hi>By as</hi> one of the seuen wise &amp; sage men of Grece, gaue this one precept<note place="margin">
                     <hi>By as</hi> precepte.</note> &amp; rule of loue. Loue so sayth <hi>By as,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou mayste hate, and hate y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou mayst loue. I can not saye, whether this wyse man doth more folowe the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of wordes, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> truth of the sentence, inasmuche as he dothe teache, that no man shuld be to other, nother faith full frende nor enemye. And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> doeth saye full truelye, that all amitye and frendshyppe shoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caye, yf a manne shoulde loue so, that he maye hate. What shoulde he truste then? what shuld he beleue, or to whome shoulde he open hys mynde?
<pb facs="tcp:1930:95"/>
or how shuld he loue him tru ly and with al his heart, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he may coniectute and thynk that in time to come he wil be or may by his enemy? surelye he will drawe backe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide agaynst such thinges, as may fortune &amp; chaunce. And therefore this sentence maye thus more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenientlye both for the vse of nature &amp; of this life be turned. Loue neuer to hate, but hate to loue when time shal be. Euery man shuld loue his frend simply, but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye his wyfe. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as loue &amp; other affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are named of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers <hi>Habitus,</hi> the whiche are conserued and kept in vs through time, operation, and labour, we muste euen at the

Therfore<note place="margin">The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall loue.</note> that newe loue &amp; coniunction of the mind, must be nourished with benigne, swete &amp; gentle conuersation, vntil it be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased &amp; fastened, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no great storme be able to dissolue or breake it.

Nor it is not thus only in man, but in al kindes &amp; sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of beastes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the female is vnder the power &amp; dominion of the male, and therefore the male is more stronger bothe in mind &amp; bodye, then the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.

               <p>It is sufficient, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the husband loue his wife with a sightiye loue, but the wife is bounde vnto her husband in two thin ges, that is to loue him, &amp; to

They which are learned do think, that this thing doth not happen by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce medle, but by the secrete artifice of the world. The Philosopher <hi>Plato</hi> doth say, that the whole worlde is so compacte and bounde together by God the artificer, as it were with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne knottes, for yf thou drawe or take one of them, the other by a certayne se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete coniunction, as it were the lynckes of a cheyne do fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, but yet he sayeth, that

those thinges, which are like &amp; most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable one to the other, are most speciallye ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, &amp; that beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence doth grow of the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude &amp; likenes of nature and custome, and that they which loue, are loued agayne. And this loue must be pure and sin cere, or elles it shall haue no strength nor none effect. Fire paynted vpon a wal doth not burne, nor a false adamante draweth no yron. Many men do maruayl, why they are not loued, seinge they do shewe so many toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; signes of loue. The signes &amp; tokens of loue are not loue, &amp; therefore they cause not the effecte of loue, but prouoke &amp; cause hatred, when it is perceaued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
<pb facs="tcp:1930:99"/>
loued not, but fained so many tokens and diuerse signes of loue. Loue also doth growe of the opinion of honestie, for as <hi>Cicero</hi> dothe saye, there is nothinge more amiable, nor y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> draweth the minde of manne more to loue then vertue.
