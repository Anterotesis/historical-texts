            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Every new diſeaſe, notable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, mirable of nature, rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of art, nay and ſtrange work or juſt judgment of God; is by them accounted for no other, but an act or effect of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. And for this the Witch muſt bee ſuſpected; and this ſuſpition, though it bee but late, of a few, and thoſe the under ſort, yet is it enough to ſend for the Witch-ſearchers,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114682:8"/>
or witch-ſeekers (a trade ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taken up in England till this) whoſe lucratory ſkil and Experience is not much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved above the outward ſenſes. For if you will not admit a big, or a boyl; a wart, or a wen; a puſh, or a pile; a ſcar, or a ſcabbe; an iſſue, or an ulcer; for a palpable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches marke: yet then ſhall it certainly be determined to be in ſuch a place, as for ſhame, and in very truth, is not to be named. Put to ſave the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Charges of the witch-finder, they will undertake to try the Witch of themſelves, yet by no other rules then thoſe traditionall, and of their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114682:8"/>
own ſuperſtition. Nay and (I tromble to record it) they will have the witch preſently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the iſſue thereof ſhall prove no leſſe then capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; and yet by no Law, but that of their own Law leſſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now of theſe two ſorts, I hold the laſt not only the more numerous, but the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous of the two. Not that I thinke there is charity in the one opinion, as I am ſure there is iniquity in the other. But for as much as the ſuperſtition of the one, is one maine cauſe of the others Infidelity. For I have known the ſimpler mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therefore backeward to beleeve any are thus guilty;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114682:9"/>
while they have obſerved the ruder conditioned ſo overfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to pronounce upon the innocent: yea and ſome wiſe men too, have put it to a great diſpute, becauſe they have read (as appears in ſtory) that men of the moſt eminent wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and holineſſe of their times have (by ſuch people as theſe) been ſlandered for Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. I could give inſtance in <hi>Abraham, Ioſeph, Moſes, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Athanaſius, Wicklef, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> And it is the more eaſie to be believed, in that our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe, not only eſcaped not ſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Calumny, Matt. 9. 34. and 12. 24. (I abhor to ſpeake
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114682:9"/>
what like Imputation of ſome in after Ages) but alſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that his chiefeſt ſervants ſhould bee ſlaundered in like manner, Mat. 10. 25. But what? did Chriſt therefore deny that there were any Witches? nay hee rather confeſſes it for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſake, Matt. 12. 27, 28. And verily no abuſe of men (either on one ſide or other) muſt debarre from concluding of Truth. I therfore (in a plain and full way) determine here, as doe the orthodox, viz.</p>
               <p>That as there have been; ſo ther are, &amp; wil be witches unto the worlds end. When Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es firſt were in the world, is uncertain, before <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114682:10"/>
we read <hi>Ioſeph</hi> talking (like an Aegyptian) of divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Gen. 44. 5. 15. (which he ſpake certainly not to bewray his Profeſſion, but conceal his Perſon.) Old Authors relate that <hi>Cham</hi> was the firſt Witch (who among the Gentiles was called <hi>Zoroaſter)</hi> and that hee taught this divelliſh Art to his ſon <hi>Mizraim,</hi> and he to the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians his People; and they that their learning to the world. Some ſay, the Divell was the firſt Witch when hee plaid the Impoſtor with our firſt Parents, poſſeſſing the Serpent (as his Impe) to their deluſion, Gen. 3. and it is whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered that our Grandame Eve
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114682:10"/>
was a little guilty of ſuch a kind of Society, inaſmuch as ſuch an Enmity was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately denounced upon it. But no matter whether Witches &amp; Witcherafts began with the world or no; we are too ſure they are not like to end, but with the world, 1 Tim. 4. 1. And ſpeaking of the world &amp; Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I take roome enough to determine their Exiſtence. For haply in ſome Places, and at ſome purer Times of the Church, a Witch may not then and there be found, Deut. 18. 10. Micah 5. 12. Zach. 13. 2. at leaſt wiſe comparatively, not in thoſe Multitudes, or Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities. And thus explained
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114682:11"/>
my determination ſtands firm to any mans beliefe for theſe Reaſons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeake of Witch-craft as of a ſpecifique ſin, 1 Sam. 15. 23. Gal. 5. 20. Now no accident can ſubſiſt without a Poſition or Conceſſion of its proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in whom it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity inhere. 2. The word of God diſcovers and deſcribes them by their ſeverall names, Deut. 18. 10. Now names are not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to things that are not: nay the variety of names ſerve to note their Multitude in the Concrete, as well as their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity in the Abſtract. 3. God Almighty has Enacted Lawes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114682:11"/>
and Penalties againſt them, Exo. 22. 18. Lev. 20. 27. which were not inſtituted for, nor can be executed upon ſhadowes &amp; meer nothing. 4. It is carefully forbidden to ſeeke after ſuch, Levit. 19. 31. which how vaine were it if none ſuch were to be found? Becauſe though indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall acts may periſh with the Authors, yet never any ſpecifique ſin (once here) quite vaniſhed hence; but (through the common roote of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) was propagated to all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. 6. Becauſe the Devill (through his depraved know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) hath deviſed perpetuall Rules of Witch-crafts; ſuch as he not only ſuggeſts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114682:12"/>
and occaſionally; but hath delivered them to impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wretches, to be traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally taught and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from one Generation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. 7. Becauſe the Divell labours continually to uphold the viſibility and eminency of his kingdome, which he doth in and by, none more then ſuch as theſe. 8. Even Heathen by the light of Nature, have aſſerted ſuch to be: nay and by the Law of Nature, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to be ſuch. 9. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and judgement of ſo many learned men in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. (Philoſophers, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Lawyers, Phyſitians, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, Schoolmen, Summiſts,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114682:12"/>
Caſuiſts, Kings and Princes) that have ſhown ſo much Art and induſtry, in their demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and diſcovery. 10. The obſervation, Tradition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, practiſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereof (in all Ages, and among all Nations) is more then manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The Generall thus confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, let me alſo adde a touch upon theſe particulars. 1. That Witches have been more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in ſome Ages of the World, then others, namely, the more blind, diſſolute, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſh, Idolatrous, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. 2. That Witches have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abounded in ſome coaſts of the World, more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114682:13"/>
as namely, where the Goſpell is not; where it is not ſo plain, pure, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and where Witch-craft is made either their Religion, or their Trade. 3. That Witches are to be found in ſome Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, more then others, that is to ſay, not only wher witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft it ſelfe is counted a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but where Religion it ſelfe is ſuperſtitious, and ſo diſpoſing to Witch-craft. 4. That there has been, are, and are likely ſtill to bee, more Witches under the Popiſh; then in the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For not only their Popes, Prieſts, Fryers, Nuns, (many of them) have been notorious
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114682:13"/>
Witches: but their praeſtigious miracles, &amp; ſuperſtitious rites little better then kindes of Witch-crafts.</p>
               <p>Now though I find it eaſier to determine of Witches, that they are; then to diſcover what they are, yet I may give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to apprehend ſomething to that purpoſe, from this one maine concluſion, viz. That Witch-craft, or the ſin of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is the moſt great &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, the moſt deadly &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſin, that a mortall man may be guilty of. I conceive it ſecond to none that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly here be committed, and my Reaſons are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is called an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114682:14"/>
unto the Lord, Deut. 18. 12. which is never ſaid but of thoſe Impieties that are of all other moſt Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe all other ſins and diſobediences, are but compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this for hainouſneſſe, 1 Sam. 15. 23. Now the thing compared is alwaies inferiour to that to which it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe Witch-craft in Hebrew, Greek, and Latine is commonly called by the name of Evill-doing: ſignifying (as ſay the Antients) that it is the greateſt evill that can be done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and immediate aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114682:14"/>
from the greateſt Good; and the moſt malicious and immediate converſion to the greateſt Evill. For here is God Renounced and defied; and the Divell embraced and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe no ſin upon earth ſo tempts God, as Witch-craft doth. Next to the Divells im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent tempting of Chriſt: was <hi>Balaams</hi> importunate tempting of God. It even tempts the Divell to tempt God. For little or nothing can the Divell doe for the Witch by a Leaguer Commiſſion; but as hee is faine to tempt Gods Permiſſion at every turn. Elſe Satan had not craved a ſecond
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114682:15"/>
power againſt <hi>Iob;</hi> after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the firſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Becauſe it is the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of all thoſe ſins, which we cal the ſins againſt Nature. Not onely in regard of that horrid illuſion of an Incubus: but alſo in reſpect of common ſociety; for as it is moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for man to be ſociable, ſo it is moſt unnaturall to him to aſſociate himſelfe contrary to his kinde. And ſo much the more in this, in that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt not only a naturally ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but a divinely impoſed Antipathy, Gen. 3. 15. 1 Cor. 10. 20.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Becauſe a Witch is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, oppoſite to Chriſt not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114682:15"/>
only in his Works, but in his Perſon; for as Chriſt is a God incarnate: ſo is a Witch (as it were) a Divell incarnate. I do not ſay, a Witch is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; but I am ſure, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt muſt needs be a Witch, 2 Theſ. 2. 8. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Becauſe the blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt, is grounded upon an imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Witch-craft, Matth. 12. 24, 31. And the ſin it ſelfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares (by direct literall dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) to be a malicious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill to God; and of the works of God to the Devill: which who are ſo guilty of as are Witches, that make God their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114682:16"/>
Divell, and the Divell their God? as is evident to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in their ſolemn and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite pact or League. Neither do I know any one particular ſin, to which the expreſſion of the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt in Scriptures, with the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that Divines make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may be more aptly &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely applyed, then to this ſin of Witch-craft.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="question">
               <head>
                  <hi>2. Caſe. </hi>How many kindes of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es may there be conceived?</head>
               <p>A Right beliefe of Witches cannot bee without ſome diſtinct conception of their kinds, holy Scripture (to ſet forth their ſeverall kinds) reckons up 8. ſeverall names
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114682:16"/>
of them at once. Deut. 8. 10. 11. Some ſay nine; making the firſt paraphraſticall deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (that of cauſing the ſonne or the daughter to paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the fire) to bee a certaine ſpecies of Witch-craft: which I conceive rather to be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Act or Rite, of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or devoting themſelves &amp; theirs to the Divells ſervice; anſwerable to that which wee commonly call the Witches Covenant, Compact, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foederation with the Divell. Becauſe it is ſtill ſet before thoſe other particular Acts, as if it were but ſome kind of preparation or diſpoſition to them, Lev. 20. 5, 6. 2 King. 21. 6.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114682:17"/>
All the reſt of the Words, or Names (were it not that ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Enumerations cannot be without diſtinctions) are ſo promiſcuouſly uſed, variouſly tranſlated, and indifferently interpreted, that it is hard to obſerve any ſpecifique diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them. Give me leave to gheſſe at them as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly as I may. 1. Wee thus tranſlate the firſt, One that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth divination. But the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew ſpeakes ſomewhat more Emphatically, One divining divinations. To ſhew, that ſuch his divinations were of his own divining, or deviſing; who preſumed, or undertook to teach or tell of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114682:17"/>
and fortuitous, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther future, or abſent; and what hereafter might happen to ſuch a perſon, ſuch a State; And ſuch a one I may not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe call the Gipſie, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-telling Witch. 2. An Obſerver of Times. The Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall derivation of this Word or Name is thought ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that I know not well how to determine here, what kinde of Witch. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from an Hebrew root that ſignifies to anſwer, being interrogated in dubious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and ſo I may ſay it is the Oracle Witch. Some from caſting a miſt before the eyes, and then is it the jugling or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114682:18"/>
praeſtigious Witch. Some from a word of the Clouds; then is it the Aſtrologian, Starre-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, Planetary, Prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Witch. Some from a word that notes a Time, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate or determinate to ſuch a purpoſe, as lucky, or unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky; then is it the ſuperſtitious ſeaſon-ſearching, or (if you will) the Time-ſerving Witch. 3. An Enchanter, or a chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Witch, uſing to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe certaine Odes, Songs, Verſes, Tones, Numbers, and may ſignifie either the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or Calculating Witch. But there is a word of fuller and nearer ſound to the originall, that ſignifies the Serpent: ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114682:18"/>
may it bee the Serpentine, the veneſick or Poyſonous Witch. 4. Or a Witch. The Originall Word is uſed ſo promiſcuouſly, for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Witches, that makes our Tranſlators to render it in the common Engliſh word onely. Yet doth it more narrowly import, ſuch a kind of Witch that works partly after a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous, partly in a praeſtigious way. 5. A Charmer, and that is an Exorciſt or conjuring Witch. But the Hebrew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it thus, one joyning So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, viz. either with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, or with other Witches: and ſo it is the aſſembling or the aſſociating Witch. 6. A
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114682:19"/>
Conſulter with Familiar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. The Hebrew intimates, one that carried the Spirit in a Bottle, a Bag, a Pitcher, and ſo kept it as a familiar; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whoſe Belly heaved, and ſwelled, and ſounded like a Bottle, whence the Devill ſpake or replyed: and thus is it the Gaſtromanticke, the Ventriloquiſt, or if you will, the Bottle-bellyed Witch. 7. A Wizzard, or Scioliſt, that is the Magicall, Speculative, Scientiall, or Arted Witch. 8. A Negromancer; that is one that ſought to the Dead, and conſulted them, to know what ſhould become of the Living. Or, that haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114682:19"/>
Graves and Sepulchers, as well praedigiouſly to raiſe the dead, as to be praeſtigiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by them. You may call ſuch an one, the Mortal or the deadly Witeh.</p>
               <p>To all theſe Names, more then ten times might be added from other Languages, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the ſeverall ſorts of Witches and Witcherafts; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from their Nature, Art, power, practice, matter, form, end, author, meanes, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or effect. But (becauſe I labour all I may to bring the whole buſineſs to a Previate) I ſhall onely treat of ſuch kindes or ſorts of them, wherein they are more univerſally both
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114682:20"/>
comprized and diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. According to the vulgar conceit, diſtinction is uſually made betwixt the White and the Blacke Witch: the Good, and the Bad Witch. The Bad Witch, they are wont to call him or her, that works Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or Miſchiefe to the Bodies of Men or Beaſts: The good Witch they count him or her, that helps to reveale, prevent, or remove the ſame. But ſuch conſider not, that devils (with as certaine a Science and as ſafe a Conſcience) may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into Good, and Bad, as Witches. Rather, that the accounted Good Witch, is indeed the worſe and more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114682:20"/>
wicked of the two. For as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, being a Fiend of darknes, is then worſt when hee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes himſelfe into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light: ſo likewiſe are his Miniſters. Now both theſe working by the Devill, whereas the worſt hurt that the one does, proves but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch the Body, or outward man: the beſt helpe that the other can doe, tends and turns to bewitch the inner man or Soule. In as much as it begets in the party to be thus holpen; either a Petition, or at leaſt an inquiſition: either a perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or at leaſt an expectation; which is a faith or aſſent of the ſame nature that the Witch
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114682:21"/>
now workes by. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this it is objected, that the Good Witch does good, &amp; oppoſes the Bad Witch, and the Devill, and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly can be none of his, nor have any dealings with him. For if Satan caſt out Satan, he is divided againſt himſelfe, how ſhall then his Kingdome ſtand? Matth. 12. 26. Are not theſe now the Patrons of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches themſelves that can make Scripture plead for them? To whoſe miſ-applying it is thus replyed: That if Satan ſhould caſt out Satan ſpiritually, or out of the ſoule, here were a diviſion indeed, and now his Kingdome could in no wiſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114682:21"/>
ſtand: But for Satan to caſt out Satan corporally, or out of the Body onely; this may be done by a combination, and ſo his Kingdome may grow the more. For thus he agrees, and willingly yeelds to his owne Children and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be (even by them) ejected out of the Body: that ſo by the faith (both of the doer and receiver) he may the more eaſily be admitted into the Soule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Witches may univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be thus diſtinguiſhed into either the Arted or the Pacted Witch. The Arted Witch, or one onely ſpeculative upon the abſtruſe Mirables of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114682:22"/>
who by ſearching into her occult Qualities, her hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den powers, and ſecret ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, her Sympathies and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathies; and by applying fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Actives unto Paſſives; now urges nature ſo Artificially, that he makes her conclude &amp; aſſent to work wonders: (And happily thus far may proceed both with true Scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; good conſcience.) But what through vanity of Science, error of Conſcience, lability of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; what through curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Credulity, vain Glory, &amp;c. is at length taken in the ſnare of praeſtigious and Diabolicall deluſion. And now applies the Creature to thoſe ends and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114682:22"/>
uſes; to which, either by its owne propenſity, or by Gods Inſtitution, it was never incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The pacted Witch is one only Operative, about ſome prodigious or Praeſtigious things, and that only by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a ſuperſtitious Compact or Contract made with the Divell, without, or againſt all Rules and orders of Nature, Art, or Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A generall diſtinction (as touching kinds) may be of the Active, and the Paſſive Witch. The Active Witch I conceive to Act together with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell; but the Paſſive Witch to be Acted rather by him. One by way of Confoederation; the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114682:23"/>
other by reaſon of ſome obſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, One as it were tempting the Divell; the other rather tempted by him. One as it were the Author, and the Divel the Inſtrument; the other but the bare Inſtrument, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell the ſole Author. One ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly rejoycing and glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prodigious prankes and Exploits; the other ſomewhat irking and aſhamed. One not infeſting onely, but infecting alſo, by ſeeking to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Witches; the other wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or wiſhing rather to bee unmade it ſelfe. Of the one kinde I reckon the Witch of Endor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I Sam. 28. of the other, the Damſell in the Acts, Acts
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114682:23"/>
16. Yet ought even the Paſſive Witches to bee diſtinguiſhed into the meerly, and the mixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paſſive. The meerly Paſſive be ſimply daemoniacks, but not Energumeniſts. That is mainly ſuffering, rather then Acting by the Divell: more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciated and afflicted, then occupied or exerciſed by him. The mixtly Paſſive be not the Obſeſſed only, but the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive likewiſe.

                  <hi>3. Caſe. </hi>Whether there be not ſundry degrees of Witches and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts to be conſidered?</head>
               <p>ORiginall ſin indeed (being one &amp; alike in all) admits of no variety of degrees in any. But witchcraft is an actuall, &amp; therefore none are borne, all are made Witches. Talk they what they can of an Incubus, the Divell and the Witch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce not to witch-craft by Generation but ſeducement. Moreover, when by witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft one growes ſo high as the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, ther's now no further meaſure
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114682:24"/>
(ſave in numericall Acts) for one Witch to exceed another. Otherwiſe there's no ſinne (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken indefinitely) but may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſeverall Meaſures, and ſo (to every mans conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) highten or leſſen the guilt or poenalty to that ſubject in which it inheres.</p>
               <p>It is worthy to be conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably waighed; that in witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft there is an Inchoation, as well as a Conſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation. 1. The Inchoation or diſpoſition to witch-craft is in ſuperſtition. The Fathers, and Schoolmen therefore are not much amiſſe in defining witch-craft by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: Making this to be the Genus, and gathering the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114682:25"/>
other in all the ſpecies under it, ſo that no kind of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft may be named, which is not found upon ſuperſtition, and works not by it. Becauſe in this main Act, ſuperſtition and Witch-craft both agree; to apply the Creature as means unto thoſe ends and uſes; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it is neither apt by its own nature, nor thereunto or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by divine Inſtitution. Only theſe two differ in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; for ſuperſtition is witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft begun, and witch-craft is ſuperſtition finiſhed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, ſince Superſtitions are the ſeedes of witch-crafts; and we all have in us the ſeeds of ſuperſtitions; how ought we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114682:25"/>
then to take heede of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperſtitions; and thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that bend &amp; diſpoſe to witch-craft? which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed too much to be obſerved in the Obſervations, Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Opinions, Affections, Profeſſions, Proverbs, Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Occupations, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the Vulgar. Lord! how many are the ſorcerous ſuperſtitions of the Many? As they are too too notorious; in obſerving of ſeaſons for lucky or unlucky; in foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Fortunes and deſtinies; in marking of Contingences and Caſualties; in caſting of Lots; in regarding of dreams; in making of meales, in uſing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114682:26"/>
of ſports, in ſecuring of feares, in promoting of hopes, in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of diſeaſes, in making of Marriages, in taking of Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; and the like: All which (in truth) are grand ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or petty kinds of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts. Yet are not to bee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected neither: for without Gods good Grace, and great mercie, they eaſily grow to a higher meaſure or degree of that kind of malignity. 2. The Conſummation and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of witch-craft, is in the Witches abſolute Pact, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Fact, whereby it is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted &amp; conſented to work, not by God, not by nature; not by Art, not by reaſon; but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114682:26"/>
by diabolicall deluſions alone.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe of reall and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Witches, there are ſeveral degrees to bee conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſeverall kindes of them. As the good Witch is to bee judged and eſteemed worſe then the bad; the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly pacted, worſe then the Cunningly Arted, the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly operative, worſe then the fondly ſpeculative: the miſchievouſly Active, worſe then the abuſed Paſſive. For if among very Divels one may be found worſe then another, Lu. 11. 26. how much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Witches? nay even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Witches of the ſame kind, there are alſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114682:27"/>
degrees or aggravations to guide a Conſcience, either as touching private Eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or publike Cenſure, viz. 1. From the Time, as the inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Witch is to bee thought worſe then the Novice. 2. Place, As a Witch at Court, is worſe then a Witch in the Countrey, and a Witch in the Church worſe then a Witch in her own Cell. 3. Sexe, As the Male witch is worſe then the Female. For though ſhe may be more envious and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; yet he has abuſed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and Nobler Sexe. 4. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or Quality, as Jezabel was worſe then the Witch of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. 5. Profeſſion, As the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114682:27"/>
Witch is worſe then the Pagan. 6. Office, As the Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call is worſe then the Layicke Witch. 7. Object, As to practiſe witch-craft on Men is worſe then if on Beaſts only. 8. Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious intent, As to have made one Witch, is worſe then to have bewitched many.</p>

               <p>IT is ſafe to believe that there are Witches; and that thoſe alſo are of ſeverall kindes and degrees. But very unſafe to pronounce peremptorily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch and ſuch for Witches; and that upon falſe grounds, as vulgar report, bare ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114682:28"/>
ſuſpected Anceſtors, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit age, froward affection, an ill tongue, or any caſual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or Event. Right effects are only cenſured with a ſafe Conſcience, by thoſe that are able to diſcerne them in their proper Cauſes; Now therfore 4. Cauſes are to be obſerved, al concurring to the making up of an abſolute Witch, viz. God utterly deſerting, the Devill deluſively invading, ſpeciall ſins hereunto diſpoſing, and the Compact throughly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God the deficient Cauſe. His deſertion was enough to make an Angell become a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: how much more then for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114682:28"/>
a man to become a Witch? Yet all this is no adding to the Creatures malice, but onely to give it up to its owne power, that it may be knowne how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill it is, if his goodneſſe bee once ſubſtracted. Nay, God is here not only a permiſſive, but a directive cauſe. For what forbids that God ſhould not as juſtly and wiſely concur in this Act, as in all other evills of ſinne? Yea great Reaſons are to bee given both for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and direction herein. As, 1. for the manifeſtation of his owne Glory. As hee did the firſt Witches we read of, Exod. 7. 12. and 8. 18, 19. 2. For the tryall of the faith &amp;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114682:29"/>
patience of his Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Deu. 13. 1, 2, 3. 3. For the hardning of the wicked in their wilfull deluſions, Exod. 7. 22. 2. Theſ. 2. 9. 11. 4. For to make the Witches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves examples of his juſtice both here and hereafter, Exo. 9. 12. Iſa. 19. 3, 4. &amp; 44. 25. Act. 13. 11. Revel. 21. 8. 5. For the more confuſion of the Devill himſelfe both in his fruſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ejection. Iſa. 44. 25. Mic. 3. 6, 7. Matth. 12. 28, 29. 1 Ioh. 3. 8. Acts 16. 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The principall Efficient of a Witch is the Devill, who indeed is the father of all ſuch; and they his chiefely begotten Children. I meane it not by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114682:29"/>
way of Incubus; which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe to be other then the height of all phantaſticall Deluſions, though the Patrons of it never ſo earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in thoſe hairy ones, or ſhaggy ones, (for ſo the word ſounds being either way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced) Lev. 17. 7. Iſa. 13. 21. By which are to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not devills Brats, but Devills themſelves that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Witches in ſuch ſhapes when they worſhipped them: Or in the Fawnes, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Sylvaries or Syrens, that the Poets ſing of: Or in the Legendary Stories of our Merlin or their Magdalen: Or in the Plebeian-traditions of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114682:30"/>
Fairies, Elfes, and Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: Or in the old or latter Stories of ſuch like Indian ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. All theſe are not enough to move my beliefe; and ſo much the leſſe, becauſe they have impudently blaſphemed Divum Lutherum, to be one of this brood. But when, I ſay, the Devill is the Father of Witches, I meane it after no other manner then as hee is of all the wicked, John 8. 44. by the ſeduction of ſinne, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny production of nature. Yet I grant them his Children by a more ſpeciall and mutuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and of all others moſt bearing his Image and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. And thus he goes about
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114682:30"/>
his worke in their forming &amp; framing. All Witcherafts for their Originall, Invention, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and uſe, being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marlly in the Devill (as the Iſſues of his depraved know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) onely he perceives that hee wants fit inſtruments for their execution. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding a faithleſſe heart, a froward nature, a feeble Sex, an impotent age, an illiterate Education, a melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and a diſcontented condition: hee now workes further (and for his ſpeciall purpoſe) to blinde the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding more and more, to deprave the will, to inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the affections, to perturb
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114682:31"/>
the paſſions, to poſſeſſe the interiour, and delude the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſenſes: and ſo infuſing execrable ſuggeſtions, of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Revenge againſt Man; he thus though not abſolutely inforces them, yet efficaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclines them to become Witches. And it is further to be obſerved, that the fitteſt ſubject or matter for him here to worke upon, are women commonly: And therefore (in Hebrew) a Witch is for the moſt part rendred in the Foeminine gender; and there are many proverbs like that of the Rabines, More women, more Witches. The reaſon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114682:31"/>
hereof is rendred variouſly, from the Sexes Infirmity, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Impotence of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Affections melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſolitarineſſe, timorouſneſſe, credulity, inconſtancy, &amp;c. But let not the Male bee boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, or ſecure of their Sexes Exemption or leſſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For wee read of Pharaohs Magitians, Nebuchadnezzar's Aſtrologers, Manaſſehs Wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, of Balaam, Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Elymas the Sorcerer, &amp;c.

               <p n="3">3. The moving or provoking
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114682:32"/>
Cauſes, are divers ſins, that more eminently diſpoſe to witchcraft: ſuch as are, 1. Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; therefore are theſe two (Idolatry &amp; witchcraft) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined ſo frequently, Lev. 20. 5, 6. 2 King. 21. 5, 6. and 23, 24. Gal. 5. 20. 2. Superſtition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is ſaid before. 3. Swearing, and blaſpheming, Mal. 3. 5. 2 Theſ. 4. 9. 4. Imprecation or curſing, and therefore to curſe, is as much as to bewitch, Num. 22. 6. 5. Inordinate vagrant luſts, 2 Kings 9. 22. Nahum 3. 4. 6. Curioſity, this makes the Magicall Witch, Acts 19. 19. 7. Envy, hatred, malice, deſire of revenge, Gal. 5. 20. 8. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and indulged Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114682:32"/>
which notably diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the matter to the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of ſuch a forme, Iſa. 13. 21. &amp; 34. 13, 14. 9. Covetouſneſs, poverty, &amp;c. Mic. 3. 11. Nah. 3. 4. That all theſe are provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to Witchcraft, wee have it abundantly in ſtory, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from Witches owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. And this uſe are wee to make of it, that as we would not bee given over to Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft: ſo ſhould wee not give our ſelves over to thoſe ſinnes that ſo proximately diſpoſe &amp; incline us thereunto.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The formall cauſe of a Witch, is the Covenant, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, Contract, Confoederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, League, ſocietie, familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114682:33"/>
with the Devill. Which hidden myſtery of iniquitie is more generally conſented to, that it is; then exactly diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed what it is. All are ready to take the Witches Compact for granted, yet few (for ought I ſee) can well tell us what it is. Nay the Learnedſt, are readyer to diſtinguiſh it, then to define it. So that hereupon it hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſſented; and that moreover in regard of Satans preſtigious deluſion herein, Iudibrious convention, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious profeſſion, impious ſtipulation, perfidious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ridiculous obſignation, &amp;c. And (in very truth) but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114682:33"/>
to Diſcuſſe this ſaid ſolemn Pact or League (according to probabilitie or poſſibilitie) as it is meerely related touching the formality or ſolemnity of it: were enough to ſettle a judicious mans faith upon the vanity of it: if not upon the nullity altogether. For thus Fryarly Authors, together with the Tradition of the vulgar, make it up like a Tale or Legend, viz. How that the Convention for ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Initiation being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed (by ſome Herald Imp) to ſome others of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; on the Lords day or ſome great Holy day, or chief Feſtivall, they meete in ſome
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114682:34"/>
Church neer the Font, or high Altar, &amp; that either very Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before the Conſecrated bel hath tolld, or the leaſt ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of holy water; or elſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry late after all ſervices are paſt and over. Where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſome Veſture for that purpoſe, is preſented, by ſome Confederate or familiar, to the Prince of Devills; ſitting now in a Throne of Infernall Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, appearing in the form of a Man (only labouring to hide his cloven foote) To whom (after often bowing, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage done in kiſſing his backe parts) a petition is preſented to be received unto his Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and protection; And firſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114682:34"/>
(if the Witch bee outwardly Chriſtian) Baptiſme muſt bee renounced; and the Party muſt be Re-baptized in the Devills name, and a new name is alſo impoſed by him: and here muſt be God-fathers too, for the Devill takes them not to be ſo adult, as to promiſe and vow for themſelves. But above all, he is very buſie with his long nayles, in ſcraping and ſcrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thoſe places of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, where the figne of the Croſſe was made, or where the Chriſme was laid. In ſtead of both which, he himſelfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes or inures the marke of the Beaſt, the Devills Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand upon one or other part
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114682:35"/>
of the Body: and teaches them to make an oyle or oyntment, of live Infants ſtoln out of the Cradle (before they be ſigned with the ſign of the Croſſe) or dead ones ſtolne out of their Graves, the which they are to boyle to a Jelly; and then drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one part, and beſmearing themſelves with another, they forthwith feel themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and endowed with the faculties of this myſticall Art. Further the Witch (for his or her part) vowes, (either by word of mouth, or peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by writing, and that in their own blood) to give both body and ſoule to the Devill. To deny &amp; defie God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114682:35"/>
the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt. But eſpecially the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, convitiating her with one infamous nick-name or other. To abhor the Word and Sacraments, but eſpecially to ſpit at the ſaying of Maſſe. To ſpurne at the Croſſe, and tread Saints Images under feet. And as much as poſſibly they may to profane all Saints Reliques, holy water, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated ſalt, waxe, &amp;c. To bee ſure to faſt on Sundayes, and eate Fleſh on Fridays, not to confeſſe their ſinnes however they do; eſpecially to a Prieſt. To ſeparate from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, and deſpiſe his Vicars primacy. To attend his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114682:36"/>
nocturnall Conventicles, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, Sacrifices. To take him for their God, worſhip, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, obey him, &amp;c. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote their Children to him, &amp; to labour all they may to bring others into the ſame Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy. Then the Devill for his part promiſes to be always preſent with them, to ſerve them at their beck. That they ſhall have their wills upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Body, that they ſhall have what riches, honours, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they can imagine. And if any be ſo wary as to thinke of their future Being, he tells them they ſhall be Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ruling in the Aire; or ſhall but bee turned into Impes at
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114682:36"/>
worſt. Then hee preaches to them to be mindefull of their Covenant, and not to faile to revenge themſelves upon their Enemies. Then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to them (for theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes) an Impe, or Familiar, in the ſhape of a Dogge, Cat, mouſe, rat, Weafle, &amp;c. After this they ſhake hands, embrace in armes, dance, feaſt &amp; ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, according as the Devill hath provided in Imitation of the Supper. Nay, oft times he marries them ere they part, either to himſelfe, or their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, or to one another, and that by the Book of Common prayer (as a pretender to witchfinding lately told me in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114682:37"/>
me in the Audience of many.) After this they part, till the next great conventicle or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of theirs, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is to meet thrice in a year, conveyed as ſwift as the winds from remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt places of the Earth, where the moſt notorious of them meet to redintegrate their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, &amp; give accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their Improvement. Where they that have done the moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable miſchiefe, and can brag of it, make moſt merry with the Devill, and they that have been indiligent, &amp; have done but petty ſervices in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are jeered and derided by the Devill and all the reſt of the company. And ſuch as are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114682:37"/>
abſent, and have no care to be aſſoygned, are amerced to this paenalty, ſo to be beaten on the palms of their feete, to be whipt with iron rods, to be pincht and ſuckt by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars till their heart blood come, till they repent them of their ſloath, and promiſe more attendance and diligence for the future. Thus you ſee what we are likely to attain to, by ſearching too preciſely into Diabolicall ſolemnities; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome probabilities to manifold Impoſſibilities, &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, among ſome truths, to manifold ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>But laying aſide all curioſity (as indeed not neceſſary) in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114682:38"/>
ſeeking to informe or reſolve our ſelves of the form or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this Diabolicall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact: wee may with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion content our ſelves, that ſome reality is to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, amongſt many praeſtigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deluſions. A ſubſtantiall Covenant, notwithſtanding all the fallacious Ceremonies. Though nothing but Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in the principall Agent, yet reall Depravation in the rationall Inſtrument. For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it this myſticall Leviathan will make no faithfull Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Iob. 41. 4. nor can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the irreconcileable omnity, Gen. 3. 15. neither will indeed bee bound to be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Servant,

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114682:39"/>
may be made with death, and an Agreement with Hell, Eſa. 28. 15. and that fellowſhip may be had with Devills themſelves, 1 Cor. 10. 20. wee know well that the Tempter is ready to propoſe both the Condition and the Reward of a Compact, Matt. 4. 9. And wee heard before that one name of Witches is to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ioyners or Conſociators, ſcil. not onely among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but with the Devill alſo. Beſides the Devil is Gods Ape, and one that faines to imitte him though in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wayes. And therefore as God makes a Covenant of Grace with his: ſo doth the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114682:39"/>
Devill with his a Covenant of Death. Neither indeed is the univerſall Confeſſion of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches themſelves (touching ſuch a compact) to be diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. For who knowes the guilt of their owne Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces better then they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? and though they tell us of never ſo much Deluſion, yet can wee conceive the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in it. Nor yet is the conſent and experience of all Ages to bee rejected: that tells us of ſuch Facts of Witchcraft, as muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be concluded to follow the ſame. For where any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary or wonderous thing is done; and that neither by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114682:40"/>
the power of God, nor of the good Angels; nor by the power of Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor of Art; it muſt needs be done by the power of the Devill. And in the Inſtrument that doth it either the force of a poſſeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the vertue of ſome Part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is neceſſarily to bee ſuppoſed which is briefely thus to bee diſcerned. The Devill may worke the firſt way upon a man againſt his will to puniſh and torment him: But he workes not with him, at his will, or to ſerve him; but the ſecond way alone.</p>
               <p>Such a Covenant or compact is unanimouſly delivered by the Learned, to bee two fold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Explicite, and Implicite. 1. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114682:40"/>
or Expreſſe, by word or writing; wherein it is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſtipulated; the witch to doe the Devills will; and the Devill to doe the witches will and all this more viſibly, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and ceremonially Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ey, yeilding and aſſenting to receive and uſe, Rules, ſignes, and meanes from other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, without any immediate vow or Conference as yet. 3. By uſing ſuperſtitious Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Imprecations, witha
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114682:41"/>
perſwaſion or Expectation of their Iſſue. 4. By employing meanes to thoſe purpoſes, to which God never appointed them, nor their owne nature enclined them; and yet confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of their Effect. 5. By ſeeking too, and conſulting with Witches for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, helpe, &amp;c. For there is the ſame faith and aſſent now both of the Conſulter and the Practiſer. 6. By aſſenting to uſe ſuch meanes and ſignes as witches alſo uſe: (viz. Charms, Spells, Characters, Figures, Circles, Ligatures, words, phraſes, Ceremonies, geſtures, &amp;c.) not well conſidering the ſuperſtitious inſtitutions, but
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114682:41"/>
peradventure perſwaded of ſome real vertue in them. For even Witches themſelves make certain Confections (as Broths, oyles, unguents, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp;c.) the vertue whereof they impute not ſolely to the Devil, but partly to the things themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now let Witches be Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon theſe two maine Grounds of their making: and where one is ſo become after an explicite manner of Covenanting; more then ten of them are guilty after the Implicite and Inviſible way onely. And there is this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (which would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) between them. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114682:42"/>
Covenanter is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and audacious; the Implicite but a Novice and a Baſtard in compariſon. The Explicite hath alwayes ſome viſible or ſenſible familiarity; ſo hath not the implicite as yet. The Explicite is become a perpetuall witch; the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite may onely be but ſo for that preſent Act, or time being: onely this is to be feared; the Implicite being hardned a while, may grow to be Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite at length.</p>

Ignorance, humor, ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſuch are, 1 The old paganiſh ſign, the Witches long eyes. 2 The Tradition of the witches not weeping. 3 The Witches making il favored faces &amp; mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

talk of it. Having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſuſpected Witch, ſhee is placed in the middle of a room upon a ſtool, or Table, croſſe legg'd, or in ſome other uneaſie poſture, to which if ſhe ſubmits not, ſhe is then bound with cords, there is ſhe watcht &amp; kept without meat or ſleep for the ſpace of 24. hours. For (they ſay) within that time they ſhall ſee her Impe come and ſuck; a little hole is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made in the door for the Impe to come in at: and leſt it might come in ſome leſſe diſcernible ſhape, they that watch are taught to be ever &amp; anon ſweeping the room, and if they ſee any ſpiders or flyes,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114682:44"/>
to kill them. And if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not kill them, then they may be ſure they are her Impes. If this be true, how ſhould it trouble us, that an invention or practiſe of ſo much folly &amp; ſuperſtition ſhould ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſo cleare a light of the Goſpell? But as to the killing of the Imp, let mee further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, that if the Imp be of a wafted &amp; condenſed ayr, it cannot be killd, becauſe it never had life: But if it bee a very Cat or Dogge, &amp;c. only poſſeſſed with the Devill, it may be kild: And I have heard a Committed Witch confeſſe, that ſhe kild one time her dog, another time her Cat (both her

               <p n="2">2. Some ſigns probable, yet not ſo certaine as to ſerve for the Witches Conviction. Such are, 1. Strong and long ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. Suſpected Anceſtors. 3.

Anſwers; upon judiciall and deliberate examination. 2. When by a true examination (of Faith and Mannrs) there are found all or moſt of the cauſes fore-ſpoken of. viz.

               <p>Now to guide the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in diſcerning and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; where the ſignes &amp; notes

(one with another) of the laſt ſort are found; there (as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Witch) it may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be pronounced and proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Where thoſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond only are; there may bee ſome ſuſpition or eſtimation, and that irreprehenſible. But wher no note of Tryal is to be found, ſave only thoſe of the firſt ſort, there it is egregious Calumny, and inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>y irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. We therefore approve of the laſt, admit of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, but altogether condemn the firſt. Yet (as touching the ſecond) there is need of ſome Caution, becauſe it is much upon ſuſpition. (And all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition whatſoever, cannot be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114682:47"/>
but unſafe to Conſcience, if it want the due Caveats) What Conſcience then can here bee in common people that are carryed away not onely with ſuſpition but ſuperſtition? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very poore and peeviſh olde Creature (ſuch is their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Uncharitableneſſe) cannot but fall under their ſuſpition, nay their infamous exprobation; every Accident, (more then ordinary) every diſeaſe whereof they neither underſtand the Cauſe, nor are acquainted with the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes) muſt bee ſuſpected for witch-craft. His Cow or his Hog, cannot be ſtrangely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but ſtraight it muſt bee
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114682:48"/>
reckoned and rumored for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht. And now their ill will to the next neighbouring ſilly Creature, muſt peremptorily taxe her ill will (in the worſt ſenſe) for the only cauſe of all. A bare Caſualty, or accidental effect (eſpecially if any thing touches them in their owne particular) ſhall now bee to them a more ſure and certaine Token of the Witch, then all the marks that Learning and Experience ſpeakes of beſides. And there's no ſtaving them off their owne conceited way of Tryall, though it bee never ſo unwarrantable, never ſo unlawfull. And but to adviſe them to prudence and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114682:48"/>
in ſuch a caſe; is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and reported, a Patron, a Pleader, a Favourer and a Fleſher of Witches. But men that are either conſcientious or judicious, will not eaſily harbour a ſuſpition (either in this or any other thing) unleſs it bee from ſome very ſhrewd ſignes, probable reaſon, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Experience: nor will they lightly admit of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port (bee it never ſo old, ſo common) unleſſe it bee alſo from the well reported.</p>

Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing here betwixt the Authority, the Art, and the office of Witch-finding, and thereupon thus determining.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Authority (of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114682:49"/>
Governors in Church and State) is (to ſuch a purpoſe as Witch-ſearching or Witch-finding) not onely Lawfull, but laudable: not onely war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, but commendable withall. In Deut. 18. 10. There ſhall not be found among you ſcil. Gods People, &amp;c. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports an Authority from God to ſeek out ſuch; Elſe how ſhould it be knowne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch were to bee found amongſt them yea or no; In 1 Sam. 28. 7.

was Joſiahs ſpying out of ſuch, 2. King. 23. 24. as intirely both proceeding from obedience, and tending to Reformation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Art of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finding is very Difficult. 1. Becauſe Satan is ſubtile, and has even here a 1000 deluding Arts, and wayes. 2. Moſt men are ignorant of his Stratagems, enterprizes, devices, 3. Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft it ſelfe is a darke myſtery of iniquitie. 4.

               <p n="3">3. That the office of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finding is exceeding doubtful, Becauſe he that offers to take upon him ſuch an office, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (I am afraid to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to theſe doubts, and the like. 1. Though peradventure hee may have procured ſome Authoritie from men: yet whether he be hereunto called and inabled by God; 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is able to execute it with a good conſcience voyd of offence both towards God, and towards men; 3. Whether he have any certaine and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Rules of Diſcerning to

proceed by; 4. Whether (in this undertaking) he aim not more at a privat Advantage, then at the publick Good? 5. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he often times uſes not unlawfull and indirect meanes of Diſcoverie; or incourages not the Common People to uſe the ſame? 6 Whether hee may not give occaſion to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame Ten that are Innocent; before he deſcover one that is guilty? 7. Whether his Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in this buſineſs, may not be a great occaſion to augment the vulgar Peoples ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (and very dangerouſly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious) opinions, ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, traditions, perſwaſions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, admirations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations?

(I propoſe this to be well conſidered, becauſe the Country People talke already, and that more frequently, more affectedly, of the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wonderfull power of the Witchfinders; then they doe of God, or Chriſt, or the Goſpell preached). 8.

               <p>Beſides all this; I require

ful ſatisfaction in theſe Doubts alſo: For I am not ſatisfied: that ſuch an office ought to be taken upon them by any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat perſons, as a Calling, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, occupation or Trade of Life. Becauſe, if any Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe be in ſuch a kind of Calling; it muſt either be as ordinary, or as extraordinary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I conceive, not as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary calling, 1. Becauſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Callings have ordinary Principles, Grounds, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Rules, Documents, Preſcriptions, Directions, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, Preſidents, Exerciſes, Practiſes, &amp;c. 2. Ordinary Callings have Ordinary Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, Propagatious, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114682:52"/>
&amp;c. 3. Wee worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confute the Papiſts, for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the office or Calling of an Exorciſt, as Ordinary and conſtant in the Church. Of whoſe Office are two maine Acts; one to diſcerne, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and deſcry the Devill and the Witch: the other to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure, charme, expell, remove &amp;c. The former of which Acts is here confeſt; and if any Formes of adjuration bee uſed in the Examination or Diſcovery, the other is not to be denied. And how wary muſt hee bee here in Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that would take heed of Adjuring? 4. As touching the ſecond Act of ſuch an
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114682:53"/>
Office, the Scripture plainly denyes an ordinary or ſettled Calling, ſaying They are Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, that they tooke it upon them, and for this cauſe it is demanded, Who are ye? that is, where's your calling or power thus to do? Acts 19. 13, 14, 15. And therefore may the firſt Act very well be doubted of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not as Extraordinary. For 1. The Extraordinarily Called, are raiſed and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, immediately, eminently, miraculouſly: 2. And that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extraordinary occaſions; as when the Church of God is thereby extreamely infeſted, infected, obſcured, indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114682:53"/>
3. Such are evermore by God prepared, gifted, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, maintained, perfected.</p>
               <p>All that can bee objected to me is; How then would you have Witches found out? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, by the power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy and Miniſtery; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing and employing (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on evident and urgent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as when not only common Reports, but prodigious Facts cry out) fit perſons to ſuch a purpoſe. I ſay fit; both for number and Quality. 1. For number, Competent. Not one or two obſcure perſons, A man with a woman, &amp;c. But even a ſufficient number, the better to Examine, Reaſon, Debate,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114682:54"/>
Diſcern, Determine; in caſe of particular Reſpects, Ends, fancies, opinions, humours, Paſſions, Affections, &amp;c. 2. For Quality, meet Perſons for that purpoſe, which ought not to be, 1.

can ſolidly conceive and aver that ſuch a thing can have no naturall cauſe from the Body, nor can be of any Iſſue or uſe to the Body; then it argues and Demonſtrates ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.

               <p n="1">1. To beleve, that all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114682:62"/>
ſtupendous Actions in this kind, are praeſtigious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions.

               <p n="2">2. To believe nothing of all theſe, that (in the leaſt) do u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp or trench upon the divine Attributes; omniſcience, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, &amp;c. For though Devills be intelligential crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of admirable Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſagacity in compariſon to reaſonable Souls; yet while
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114682:63"/>
(their Intellect was unobſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their Fall) all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicacity never reached to a ſhadow of Omniſcience: much leſſe can all their long Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Obſervation, or Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now attain to it. And therfore if they foreſee of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or foretel ſome kind of Futures; it is but as they are contain'd in their natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or diſpoſitions: And if they gheſs at ſome ſecret intentions or affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the heart, it is no more then from certaine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions. So that wee may well conclude, they are ignorant, and erre in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things; whereof the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of their propoſitions
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114682:63"/>
and predictions, are a ſufficient Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, though Devils be called Principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp; that no power on earth may be compared to them; yet was all their power (ere debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by their fall) of no force to that power that belongeth unto God; Wonders they may worke, but thoſe lying ones, Deut. 3. 2. Mat. 24. 24. 2 Theſ. 2. 9. And yet not thoſe, but as permitted by God, not Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by Angels, and having the matter hereunto ſomwhat praediſpoſed. And even then it is (for the moſt part) praeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious too. Illuding humane ſenſes, abuſing their Fancies,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:114682:64"/>
and (which is worſe) decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their hearts. Their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is but to produce phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſmaticall or falſe ſpecies of things; and if any thing bee now verily done, it is but by applying Actives to Paſſives: which if wee were as cunning in as they; we might alſo doe without them, and need never be beholding to them. But as for Miracles (of a true name and thing) they are as ſtrange and as admirable to them, as they are to us. And indeede neither for them, nor us, nor for Angells to do, but for God alone, Pſal. 72. 18. He only can work miracles, to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a Miracle. And it were
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114682:64"/>
eaſie (were it not too long) to diſtinguiſh betwixt divine Miracles, and Diabolical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies; both from the dignity and vertue of the doere; the Quality, Excellency of the thing done, with the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and advantagious manner and end of doing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To believe nothing of theſe, that (being granted) muſt of neceſſity work the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall diſorder and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature. For though the Devill may haply bee able to perturbe ſome particular courſe of Nature: yet (Devils themſelves, being part of the Univerſe) have no power to worke to the Confuſion and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114682:65"/>
deſtruction of the whole.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To beleeve nothing of them, that utterly impugn the dictates of right Reaſon. For that would directly imply contradictions; and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities are neceſſarily to be concluded.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Not to beleeve any thing of theſe, contrary to the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Rules of Gods word. For what Faith can bee of thoſe things, that croſſe the grounds of Faith? Againſt which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Rules of truth (whether of precept, promiſe, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe) Devills and men, in all their Operations or Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies muſt needes bee found Lyars.</p>

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:114682:65"/>
6. Nothing muſt be believed of all theſe, as tending to truth or to God. For the Devill is falſe, and can ſpeak no trueth, but to deceive; and the Devil is naught, and will do nothing like to Good, but to hurt and endamage ſo much the more.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Whence have Witches all their power? And I ſay, firſ, Not of God. For this is it chiefely that makes the Act to be forcerous and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the wounder is wrought, but not by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God. Yet I dare not ſay, this power of theirs (what
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114682:66"/>
ever it is) is not from God. For the evil Spirit was from the Lord, that troubled &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saul. 2 Sam. 16. 14. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did Satanltouch, Iob, (bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or goods) but as God gave him, once and againe into his hands. Iob. 1. and 2. Nor had all the Devills power to enter into or infeſt the ſwine, but as Chriſt was pleaſed to permitt. Mar. 5. 12. whence I conclude that God hath even. here alſo a working power: viz. of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Limitation, Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea &amp; of Cooperation; and yet all this without the leaſt approbation of the power abuſed by the Devill or the Witch. 2. Not from good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114682:67"/>
For good Angells and Witches never worke one with another: Becauſe Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es work by vertue of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, to adore the Power that they work by: and that the Good Angells can in no wiſe indure. Revel. 19. 10. Neither (though they may be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) can they be aſſiſtant to the malice and iniquity of the Creature. Neither yet will the Excellency and Ingenuity of good Angels, ſuffer them to condeſcend (upon any tearms between them) or diſſemble a being bound at a vile wretches beck. How much deceived then (through Satans trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114682:67"/>
of himſelf) are thoſe Witches that have imagined their Familiars to be no other then good Angels? 3. Not from Nature. For they take her un-apteſt means; and apply them to the wrongeſt ends. 4. Not from Art, or Science. Becauſe they are indeed ignorant of all ſuch grounds and principles; rules &amp; reaſons. 5. Al their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer therefore muſt needes bee from the devil only; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys unto them, what power is permitted him in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; by vertue of a curſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or confederation. In the execution wherof, he himſelfe nevertheleſs is the ſole agent; and they but the wretched In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Inſtruments.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114682:68"/>
For (as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew hath it of the Witch of Endor, 1 Sam. 28. 7. and is plainly rendred, Nahum 3. 4.) though they ſeeme Ladies and Miſtreſſes of their Arts &amp; acts; yet are they indeed but Satans meer ſlaves and Vaſſals. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding openly that power, as if they were ſuperiour to him: and yet ſecretly invoking it, as inferior. And ſo the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſeemes as if hee were now compelled to obey; when hee cunningly diſſembles it, for his own ends. Only he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have this power both to be challenged by them, and imputed to them: that ſo hee may transfer upon them, the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114682:68"/>

               <p n="2">2. After what manner doe they uſe to exerciſe their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of bewitching?

Some worke their bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings only by way of Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Imprecation. They wiſh it, or will it; and ſo it falls out. 2.

12. Some have a more ſpeciall way of working by ſeverall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements; Earth, water, ayre, or fire. But who can tell all the manner of wayes of a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches working; that works not only darkly and cloſely, but variouſly &amp; verſatilly, as God will permit, the Devil can ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, or the malicious Hag de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to put in practiſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Upon whom do Witches execute their power? If wee can credite what is reported of the old Pagan Witches; how they threaten the Gods, the Heavens, Sphears, Planets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, &amp;c. To pull downe the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and preſerve their Influences in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114682:70"/>
Boxes, to mingle all, and make a new Chaos, to dry up the Seas, and remove Mountains, &amp;c. Nay and ſome of our later Witches are wont to brag of a power they have over the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill himſelfe, how they can compell him, chain him, whip him, torment him. And theſe are they the Papiſts call Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſts, which we call Conjurers. Who are ſaid to differ from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of Witches in this, that they can imperiouſly command the Devill, &amp;c. Whereas others are glad to do all by Invocation or Intreaty. Indeed Chriſt gave his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples an extraordinary power againſt him, Mar. 3. 15. and 16
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114682:71"/>
17. and for anything that hee can do againſt us, hath left us the ordinary means, 1 Pet. 5. 8, 9. But I would theſe kinde of people could as eaſily extricate themſelves out of the Devills power: as wee (for Trueths ſake) muſt vindicate him from theirs. And that 1. Becauſe a Creature that is inferiour by Nature, cannot (without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power) compell one that is ſuperiour to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A pretence to or uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Divine power againſt him, prevayles not to ſubject him, but inrage him rather, as Act. 19. 13, 14, 15, 16. 3. It is not likely the Devill would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or deliver any ſuch Art,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114682:71"/>
whereby himſelf might verily bee coarcted or conſtrained: who is of ſuch a pride as can indure to be brought into no ſubjection or obedience; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God, or Men.</p>
               <p>But thus much is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived even by knowing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. That witches may have a power from the Devill to perturbe all things ſublunary. And therefore they, and the Devill are not amiſſe ſayd to move winds, Storms, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, ſhowrs, Lightnings, (and ſome ſay Thunders) hayle, ſnow, Froſts, miſts, Foggs, ſmokes, Blaſtings, Skathfires, Earthquakes, Seawracks, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Diſeaſes &amp;c. (I ſpare to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114682:72"/>
ſpeak of their more notorious power over things inanimate, vegetables and all brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) But as touching Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (for there's all the ſpite of the Devill, and the Witch) that abuſe not the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but in his prejudice. Concerning ſuch, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, that witches have power over Infants, more then the Aged; over Women, more then over men; and over wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, more then over others. And for the proof wee are put to ſtory, Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Experience. But the Queſtion (beſt worth deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the whole Caſe) is this. Whether Witches have any
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114682:72"/>
power againſt faithful &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men: as well as againſt the Wicked and profane. Some people are perſwaded, that a Witch can have no power at all againſt a faithfull man. And think themſelves armed ſufficiently to their opinion, from a great Witches owne Confeſſion. Numbers, 23. 23. Surely there is no enchantme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt Iacob, nor is there any Divination againſt Iſrael. But it would be conſidered, that the Hebrew word ſignifies (Notice) rather then (not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt:) yea but ſay, not againſt Iacob, not againſt Iſrael; Iacob and Iſrael there intimate a Congregation, not a perſon.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114682:73"/>
Thus therefore it may truly be diſtinguiſhed, &amp; determined; That Witches and Sorcerers can have no power againſt the whole Church of God, the whole body of Chriſt, but may doubtles over this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon; though never ſo pious, never ſo beleeving. Becauſe ſuch a ſubjection, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes Gods permiſſion. And being but a temporall evill, no faith or piety hath here an abſolute promiſe of Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Satan had his obſeſſing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer even over Iob, a Godly man; as well as over Saul, a wicked man. Chriſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges one for a daughter of Abraham, and withall that ſhe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114682:73"/>
was troubled with a ſpirit of Infirmity, Luk. 13. That is, an Infirmity wrought by the meanes of an evill Spirit. How eaſy were it (but that I reſolve againſt all ſuch prolixity) to inſtance from the Fathers, and other Authors, of more then Hundreds of good and Godly men (in all Ages) not onely immediatly obſeſſed by the Devill; but by his evill Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, moſt ſtrangely and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly bewitcht? Beſides Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and experience, there is reaſon alſo to eſtabliſh this for a Truth, 1. Becauſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bewitching is (as I ſaid) but an outward ſuffering; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which not the beſt Saint
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:114682:74"/>
hath any Ground to plead an abſolute priviledg. 2. One of the maine Reaſons of Gods permiſſion of Witches were thus eluded. viz. For the Try-all of the Faith and patience of the Saints, which, how could it poſſible be, if they were here Exempted? 3. The Devills hatred is greateſt a gainſt Godly men, whom he labors moſt (by himſelfe and his Inſtruments) to diſturbe and Diſtract. Yet in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of ſufferance, is there ſome difference to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. As the Godly are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched in their Body onely: the Wicked both in body and ſoule. The Godly for the Try-all
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:114682:74"/>
of their Graces: the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the puniſhment of their Sins. The wicked Curſe God to his face: the Godly bleſſe him ſo much the more. To the Godly, this is all their Hell: to the Wicked, but as their Hells beginning.</p>

                  <hi>9. Caſe. </hi>How the power and malice of Witches may be prevented and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt with a good Conſcience?</head>
               <p>THe Popiſh Schoolemen not a little leave our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences perplexed, in this Queſtion of theirs. Whether it be lawfull to remove the ſignes of Witchcraft; to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Effect thereof may ceaſe? In that they who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, are ſo divided upon
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114682:75"/>
it. Some of them make it an Act meritorious, ſo to doe: Some againe, an Act Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious. But their Reſolution on either ſide ſatisfies not. For it cannot be an Act meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in any (to diſpell or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſigns, means &amp; works of the Devill) but in him alone that came into the world for that very intent. 1 Iohn. 3. 8. Nor is it to be counted for an Act ſuperſtitious, to remove or diſſolve any thing, that the Witch hath left or put in any place, for a Signe, Spell, Charme to bewitch by; and that ſuch a thing removed, diſſolved, the Witchcraft is diſappointed and muſt ceaſe.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114682:75"/>
So be, it be certain that they are the ſignes or meanes of witchcraft, and placed there for that very End. And that there bee not a more diligent ſearch to find out the Witches ſigne or ſpell, then to betake to prayers and like duties. And that the Effect of ſuch ceaſing bee not hoped or expected meerly from the Removall of the thing; nor as the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent or Condition of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolicall Compact. But that it is done through Confidence in God; and a contempt of all ſuch Sorceries. For if a man were certaine that ſuch a thing were a Witches ſigne or ſpell to bewitch by; it would argue
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114682:76"/>
more aſſent to the Devils wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to ſuffer it, and let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; then to remove or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it. Neither is there any doubt to bee made, but that Witchcraft (with all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices) may be reſiſted and removed by any unlawful meanes. Which cannot but be ſuch, if there be no conſulting with, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting to, or expecting from the Devill: but a Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to, confidence in, and dependance upon God alone.</p>
               <p>Indeed people are here but too ſuperſtitious, as touching the Fortifying or relieving themſelves. I paſſe over what ſuperſtitious Remedies are here taught in that other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:114682:76"/>
as the tolling of a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized bell; ſigning with the ſigne of the Croſſe, ſprinkling with holy water, bleſſing of Oyle, Waxe, Candles, Salt, Bread, Cheeſe, Garments, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, &amp;c. carrying about ſaints Reliques, with a thouſand ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious fopperies of their exorciſing Trade. I only ſpeak of ſuch ſuperſtitious practiſes, as are uſed by men of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. 1. In ſeeking to a witch, to be holpen againſt a Witch. 2. In uſing a certain or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Charme; againſt an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or ſuſpected witchcraft. 3. In ſearching anxiouſly for the Witches ſigne or Token left behinde her in the houſe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114682:77"/>
under the Threſhold, in the Bedſtraw: and to be ſure to light upon it, burning every odd ragge or bone, or feather that is to be found. 4. In ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, rayling, threatning, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and banning the Witch: as if this were a right way, to bewitch the Witch from Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching. 5. In Banging and baſting, ſcratching &amp; clawing, to draw blood of the witch: an Act not onely ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but ſo injurious; that it's rather a provocation to the malice of the witch, then any Fortification againſt it. 6. In daring and defying the Witch out of a Carnall ſecurity, and preſumptuous temerity: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114682:77"/>
well (ſaythey) have a good heart and feare not, and the Witch can have no power over, &amp;c. A good Beliefe will now arme well indeed: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs! that's quite another thing, to this confident Audacity. One is in God, the other in themſelves. One is the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a pure heart, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the ſecurity of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane: One keepes within its own Calling, the other wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders out of it: And ſo not only tempts God, but the Devill too. It is worth the obſerving, how the Devill once ſerved them upon ſuch a preſuming as this, Acts 19. 13. and 16. But what ſay they for all this?
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114682:78"/>
Bold Bayard once daſlrt out the Witches braines. Never tell them; they have alwayes obſerved that Witches leaſt hurt them, that worſt uſe them; and they that are leaſt affraid of them, ſtill fare beſt by them. Oh! how the Devil diſſembles a feare of thoſe men whoſe Caſes are moſt to bee feared? how hee ſpares them Temporally, that he may not ſpare them ſpiritually and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally? what cares he for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching their Bodies, when hee has thus bewitched their better parts, their ſoules?</p>
               <p>Thus having removed all falſe means; Though we here approve of no kind of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:114682:78"/>
much leſſe admit it as an ordinary calling in the Church of Chriſt; yet we freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that God hath not here left his church deſtitute of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and lawfull Remedies, whether Preſervative or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative. And theſe be; 1. A Conſcionable care againſt ſin, the old Witch of all. That did Effaſcinate our firſt Parents, and us in their loyns; but ſince hath directly bewitched us, both in our profeſſions, Gal. 3. 1. as alſo in our Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 1 Sam. 15. 23. That hath made us make a Covenant with Death, and an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Hell, Iſa. 28. 15. That hath brought us to an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:114682:79"/>
Abnegation of the ſacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and to a corruption and profanation, both of Word and Sacraments. That makes us beleeve wee are Lords and Ladies of our own Wils; when wee are the only ſervile wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, led Captive by Satan at his Will.</p>
               <p>That rewards onely with meer deluſions of momentary pleaſures, to the hazard of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall paines. More eſpecially it behoves us to take heed of all ſuch ſinnes as (beſides the Devill) more particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to the Witch. And they are, 1. Moroſe Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; For they tempt God to give us over to viſible tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:114682:79"/>
2. Dire Imprecations; for they want only Gods ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Amen unto them. 3. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous and oppreſſive Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for they cauſe the Lord to depart from us, and an evill ſpirit from the Lord to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us. 4. Hypocriticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; For if the uncleane ſpirit finde his houſe empty of all true graces, and ſwept only by an outward Reſtraint, of ſome more ſcandalous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious vices: and Garniſhed with ſimulated vertues, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous obſervations, affected garbes, and formall ſervices: then hee taketh with himſelfe ſeven other ſpirits, &amp;c. Matth. 12. 44, 45. And it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114682:80"/>
how the Devill has always delighted to haunt &amp; frequent Monaſteries, Nunneries, and old Abbeys, places of ſo much hypocriſie. 5. Superſtitious and profane communications, eſpecially of Devills, Witches, and Witch-finders. We have ſome ſtories of ſuch as by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe their Table-talke, have made themſelves the more obnoxious to their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations. It is ſtrange to tell what ſuperſtitious opinions, affections, relations, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallyriſen amongſt us, ſince the Witch-finders came into the Countrey. And I pray God that theſe things doe not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe &amp; expoſe us to Witches,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114682:80"/>
rather then help to ridde us of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next to a care againſt ſins; is an endeavour after gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And thoſe 1. Faith, for that makes every way ſtrong to reſiſt the Devill, 1 Pet. 5. 8, 9. 2. Purity of heart, for the unclean ſpirit findes no reſt in dry places, Mat. 12. 43. And to let him find no reſt in us, is the way not to be moleſted by him in any kind. 3. Prayer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, for theſe are prevalent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the worſt kind of them, Matth. 17. 21. 4. Confidence in Chriſts name and power, word and promiſes, Mark. 16. 17. 5. Frequent reading and meditating upon the holy
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:114682:81"/>
Scriptures, for ther's the ſword of the Spirit, to pierce the head of the huge Leviathan: There's the voyce of the wiſe Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to make the deafe Adder, and the olde Serpent burſt in pieces. Search we there, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply we the ſpeciall promiſes &amp; conſolations for our particular Caſe, Gen. 3. 15. Pſ. 91. 11, 12, 13. Joh. 16. 33. 1 Joh. 3. 8. Mar. 16. 17. Rom. 16. 20. 1 Cor. 10. 13. Jam. 4. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 9.

Or of ſetting apart certaine incompetent, and in-concerning verſes for

Whether out of Curioſitie, or for Exploration ſake, as wel as out of ſuperſtition. 1. If out of Curioſity onely to ſee and here, and tel what a witch or wizzard can ſay or doe.

a tempting of God. 2. If for Exploration ſake, ſo as to Examine and diſcover the Witch. Herein (though the Authority may be granted. for ſafe and good) yet ſpeciall heed is to be had, either of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring, or yet of alluring the Divell or the Witch. Forto adjurea Witch, if it be done by way of humane obteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Intreaty, then is it pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable conſulting: or if it be done by way of divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation (charging and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging in the name of God) what elſe is it then, but that we call Exorcizing? And likewiſe to Allure the Witch to do any Act of Witchcraft,

(through diſguiſe, diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fayre words, promiſes, or any other pretext) yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be with intent to deſcry or make diſcovery, yet even this is to do evill that good may come thereof. And therefore the Witch of Endor juſtly exclaimes againſt the injuſtice and Treachery of ſuch an Inticement, although it might have beene to ſuch an intent, 1 Sam. 28. 9. 12. Now then this it is, to enquire here over familiarly may bee to allure: To charge over highly is to adjure: but only to interrogate Rationally and Legally, this is ſafely and ſufficiently to explore.</p>

Wizzard, but a Jugling Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor. But thou wenteſt as to a Witch indeed. The deluſive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, excuſes not the deluſion of thy intention.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I went to none but a good Witch. Who ever cald a Witch good, but bad men? and if the Devil were called good, wouldſt thou therefore goe to him?</p>
               <p n="5">5. I meant nobody hurt in it. A good meaning will not warrant the uſe of ill meanes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It was not I that went, but my wife, childe, ſervant. Nomore was it Ahaziah, but his wife, 2 Kings 1. Aske but thy conſcience, if thy heart went not along with them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Thy faith or perſwaſion to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd and reſolv'd in the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thou went'ſt about, was enough to mingle thee with the Witch in her confederacy. Nay, thou waſt the very cauſe of that Act of Witchery that was now practiſed for thy ſake, and upon thy occaſion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I ſaw nothing, I found nothing but good. All good is to bee ſuſpected that comes from the Devill, who never did any thing like to good, but for the greater ill.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I was told nothing but
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:114682:87"/>
Truth. The Devill is a Lyar of himſelfe, and never told Truth, but to deceive. Some light Truth peradventure, and that either forcibly, or againſt his Will; or fortuitouſly and without his knowledge; or falſely to deceive thee in a greater Truth, and others with greater Lyes. Hee that looks to heare Truth from the Devill, may ſoon hear it to his ſorrow, as did Sanl, 1 Sam. 28. 19.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I went but to ſee if I might bee inform'd or finde what I had loſt. What was all that loſſe, to the loſſe of thy Credit and Conſcience? Nay, not onely loſſe of peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114682:87"/>
thy ſelfe, and of Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with wiſe men: But of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with good men, &amp; of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God. What if thou had'ſt not found? then was thy labour and hopes loſt to all the reſt. Say thou didd'ſt finde, it comming by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills meanes, comes with Gods Curſe. Thus is it loſt though found. Nay, and (in thy ſenſe) ſhall be loſt againe. For (beſides that God blowes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it) the Devill (ſince thou art ſo ready to ſeek after him) will be ready the ſecond time to bereave thee either of that, or as much as that comes to, that ſo he may make thee ſeek to him againe. Thus ſhalt thou
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114682:88"/>
be continually the loſer, and the Devill the Gainer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hadd'ſt thou either deſpiſed thy loſſe, or deſpiſed this way of finding it, thy loſſe had not onely reſted there; but thou hadſt beene a great Gainer by Gods grace and bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="11">11. What would you have me doe? I could not endure to ſee the poore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thing ſo ſtrangely handled, but ſeek out ſome remedy for it; and no body could tell what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe it was, all Phyſick would doe it no good, &amp;c. Becauſe ordinary meanes failed, was God therefore to bee deſerted, and his greateſt enemy addreſt unto? But that I am reſolv'd to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:114682:88"/>
ſpeak Engliſh only in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome: I could further reply, out of an Ancient Fathers owne words to one that had procured a Charme to cure his Child, and objecting, What, would you have it periſh? Yea, let it periſh; better it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh then thou; it temporally, then thou eternally. What ſhould I tell of Chriſtians that have refuſed to touch, take up, or once remove a Witches Charm, Spell, Signe; no not for their owne preſent Cure? Nay, and of very Heathens that have derided and rejected all ſuch remedies?</p>
               <p n="12">12. I did it onely in an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, becauſe I had a mind, or
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114682:89"/>
Fancy to know mine owne Fate or Fortune, &amp;c. Becauſe this is indeed the Fancy and Humour of too many: Let them hear what I ſay now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, in ſundry conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. So did Saul, and heard his deſtiny to his utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, 1 Sam. 28. 19, 20. 2. All future things are reſerved in Gods owne knowledge and power; and therefore ſolely to be referred to him. 3. Who (of men or Angels) have been his Counſellors to be ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily acquainted with any ſuch myſteries?</p>
               <p n="4">4. For a man to bee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; though it were expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114682:89"/>
yet is it not lawfull: And though it were lawfull, yet is it not expedient. For if good things be preſaged to him, and they falſe; that makes him mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in a fruſtrated hope: If bad things, and yet falſe, that makes him miſerable in a needleſſe feare: If bad things and true, they make a man mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in his owne apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, before he is ſo in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. If good things and true, yet the long Expectation both crucifies and takes off the edge of Delight in their Fruition. 5. When did ever any Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Predictions want their Ambiguities or Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For ſo fallaciouſly doth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114682:90"/>
the Devill uſe to frame his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as that they may ſtand good with either event; to the end we may be either way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and yet he neither way thought to deceive. 6. Is there any certainty of their fore tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling things future, that are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what is paſt or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? or how can they tell what ſhall betide another, that are not aware of what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall themſelves? 7. Have not the ſager Heathens derided all Aſtronomicall, Genethliacall, Phyſiognomicall Preſages and Predictions; and are they things to be believ'd by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?</p>
               <p>8. He that will eaſily believe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114682:90"/>
the Devill upon his Word, can hardly have any right faith of God in his Promiſes: For cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity to Satan, is to God-ward infidelity. 9. One that is here over anxiouſly, or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inquiſitive, as he hath much of the Infidelity of an Atheiſt: ſo not a little of the Carnality of an Epicure. For 'tis a manifeſt Token he both loves, and likewiſe feares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe too much as touching the Body and preſent Being.</p>

(a reall ranke Witch) is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all poenalty that can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be inflicted or imagineth More then Temporal, Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and Eternall puniſhment cannot be deviſed; and al theſe are here deſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Spirituall puniſhment, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the heavyeſt Anathema, or greateſt Excommunication, Deut. 18. 10. Ezek. 12. 24. Mic. 5. 12. John 12. 31. 1 Cor. 10, 20. 2 Cor. 6. 14, 15, 16. And great reaſon that Witches ſhould firſt be ſpiritually or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically puniſhed, 1. Becauſe the ſin of a Witch is (formally conſidered) a meere ſpirituall ſin. 2. Witches primely abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and abjure the Churches
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114682:92"/>
Faith and fellowſhip: And therefore ſhould firſt of all bee caſt out of their Communion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is juſt Talion to deliver ſuch up to Satan that have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given themſelves unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Temporall puniſhment, Exod. 22. 18. Levit. 20. 27. And the reaſons are, 1. Becauſe the Fact and Effects of witch-craft are Externall, and diſturbing the Civill peace. 2. Witches in joyning Confoederacy with the Devill become profeſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to all true humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and therefore deſerve to be cut off from it. 3. Their to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration is pernicious both to Church and State, not only
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114682:92"/>
in regard of their Maleficia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting miſchiefes, but alſo of Gods judgments, Iſa. 47. 9. 12. Nahum 3. 4. 2 Kings 23. 26. Conferr'd with 2 King. 21. 6. 4. Becauſe the longer Witches are ſuffered to live, the worſe they are, not onely do more miſchiefe to others, but grow more wicked within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Humane mercy will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver amend them; nor the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil never forſake them til they fall under the Magiſtrates hand, and if ever they repent it is then, or not at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Eternal puniſhment, Rev. 21. 8. and 22. 15. And there's Reaſon for that too. 1. It is juſt that they who utterly deny

God ſhould be utterly denyed of him. 2. That they who give themſelves to the Devill, and worſhip him; ſhould goe to him, and receive their reward.</p>
               <p>But the maine of the Caſe is touching Civill poenalty. And if you ask what particular pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is to bee inflicted? The Scripture ſaith ſtoning, Levit. 20. 27. Authors in their Stories likewiſe ſtore us with Lawes and Preſidents of their hanging, heading, burning, drowning, fleaing off their ſkinnes, breaking upon the wheel, caſting down headlong from ſteepe hills and Rockes, cutting theirh troats, preſſing, racking, beating with ſtripes,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:114682:93"/>
braining with clubbs, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, degradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, privation of office, forfeitur of eſtate, &amp;c. Thus thought they no puniſhment enough for Witches. All which Infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Witches (abſolute wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) may be well worthy of. But God forbid they ſhould be thus puniſhed for Witches; that indeed are no Witches. For ſo Innocent blood may be brought upon a Land. Yet I ſpeak not this, as if ſome who are Impoſtors only, or but cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Witches (as Juglers, Gyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, fortune-tellers, Figure-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Wizzards, Conjurers, Calculaters of Nativities, with falſe prophets and Prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators,

that preſume to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage what Changes ſhall be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or State, ſhould be unpuniſhed. But that true and reall Witches ſhould bee truly and really puniſhed, to true and real intents. And that Magiſtrates and men in place, may wiſely and juſtly preſerve and diſcharge a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and do no otherwiſe (in this Caſe) then as Joſiah did, 2 King. 23. 24. Where note, 1. His wiſedome in diſcerning; They were ſpyed out in the Land: A word noting perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and circumſpection; and that both of the mind and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Shewing how both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and externall powers
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114682:94"/>
of diſcerning ſhould bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and weighing both the Abſtruſe Myſterie; and more palpable materiall Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof. 2. His Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſincerity. That he might perform the words of the law, &amp;c. Looking at nothing more then the honour of God, the juſtice of the Law, the Trueth of the Church, and the peace of the Common-wealth. But to take heed of doing (in ſuch a Caſe) as <hi>Saul</hi> did, 1 Sam. 28. 3. who may well be deemed now to have done al ſmiſterly. 1. Becauſe if the Intention of his heart had been right to cut them off; then doubtleſſe had it not been ſo ſoon diſpoſed to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114682:95"/>
conſult with them. 2. It is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized hee lookt onely at his owne private ſufferance by ſuch, 1 Sam. 16. 14. and not at the Law of GOD or publique good. 3. The Jewiſh Rabbines ſay that hee did it enviouſly. Becauſe the Diviners alſo foretold of his Ejection from the Kingdome, and of <hi>Davids</hi> Election therunto. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is obſervable to ſuch a purpoſe, in that <hi>Samuels</hi> death, and the Witches execution are mentioned both rogether. Noting hee forbare to execute his malice upon them while <hi>Samuel</hi> liv'd. Becauſe <hi>Samuel</hi> (a Prophet of the Lord) had alſo foretold the ſame. 4. Some
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:114682:95"/>
learned Proteſtants are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that under pretext of Witches <hi>Saul</hi> now ſlew the Gibeonites, for which the judgment followed, 2 Sam. 21. 1. Neither indeed want we the ſtoryed Examples of GODS Judgements upon thoſe that defamed, proſecuted, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted them for Witches, that indeed were none.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I make bold to propoſe here theſe Cautionary Quaeries to bee conſidered, 1. Whether all kinds of Witches are to bee puniſhed with one kind of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I anſwer vulgarly at firſt hearing, God forbid. And doe confeſſe further, that I have
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:114682:96"/>
read divers Laws cited for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers degrees of Mulcts &amp; poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties. Whereto I may adde alſo our owne Statute Law in that behalf wherein (in my poor judgment) ſeverall kindes and meaſures of poenalties are well Enacted againſt ſeveral kinds and degrees of Witches. And I could wiſh with all my heart, that in the execution it were but ſo ſctrictly obſerved, as in the Law it ſelfe is wiſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether a Witch is to be puniſhed capitally for the Pact or for the Fact of witchcraft? I know ſome (both Papiſts and Proteſtants) that are eager for denouncing upon the Pact a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:114682:96"/>
without any Fact done. And would have Witches cut off (as men kill Serpents) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have once ſtung or poyſon'd any. But (under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of better judgments) I am bold alſo to pronounce my opinion. That although the meere Pact bee mortall before God: yet neither the Pact without the Fact; nor the Fact without the Pact, is to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall before men. 1. Not the Pact without the Fact. For ſo it is not onely a meer ſpirituall ſinne, a meer ſinne of thought; but may be a meer Dreame or Deluſion. Neither do I beleive there was ever in any a reall pact, without a reall Fact. For
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:114682:97"/>
the Devill does not now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate for nothing; nor will hee ſuffer his Aſſociate to be idle. Neither is the Covenant, but for the Arts ſake; nor the Art, but for the Practiſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet can a Pact be well ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, or prooved but by ſome kind of Fact. The Witch of Endor, 1 Sam. 28. was ſo Notoriouſly known to bee a Pacted Witch. that Sauls Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantscould tell him of her, at firſt aſking, and of the Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Spirit ſhee had, verſ. 7. yet does ſhee onely plead againſt Saul, for alluring her to the Fact, and ſo ſubjecting her to the penalty of the Law, ver. 9. which plainly declares that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:114682:97"/>
the Actor pleaded and the Guilty apprehended their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiouſnes to the penalty of that Law from the FACT, and not from the Pact alone. 2. Not for the Fact, without the Pact. For then it is to bee conceived and Cenſured as the Effect of ſome other ſinne or Crime, and not formally of Witchcraft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. A parent (like as Witches uſe) curſes his Child, and God ſayes A men to it. Hereupon the Child is obſeſſed, or ſtrangely handled (peradventur periſhes, a thing of two common Example) But what? muſt the Parent hang for the Malefice? no; and why? Becauſe here is onely
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114682:98"/>
the Factor Effect without the Pact.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether the Implicite Compact be lyable to the like poenalty as the Explicite? An Implicite Covenant is ſolely in the Faith and aſſent, now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Effects may follow without any other Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And whether Familiarity ſo far forth as inviſible Faith &amp; Aſſent, be Felony, it is not in me to determine. Only I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſatiſfyed what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is between this, and the Faith and Aſſent in every deeply malitious ſinne? For that likewiſe Implicitly makes a malignant Covenant with the Devill. Eſa. 28. 15. Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

thinkes there ſhould bee ſome Differences made betweene them; and that very Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively. I have labored to Excogitate them, but finde it Difficult to ſet them ſo really Diſparate and diſtinct as I would, in Affection, Intention Operation. For to me there appears in all ſomething of the ſame Corruption. And this very difficulty tells my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience what a wary diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhould here be for Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Poenalty. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I do not judg thoſe, that ſhall proceed to judge them, upon a clearer diſtinguiſhing and diſcerning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether one addicted to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:114682:99"/>
the ſpeculative way onely ought to incurre the ſame poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty with the operative Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? I am not of thoſe that contend for the lawfulneſſe of Magical ſcience. Becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach (in my judgement) to conceive, how it can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (by ſuch as wade too far into it) in the pure Naturalls: but muſt needs (what through Ignorance or Arroganee) bee polluted and deprav'd with ſome kind of deluſions diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall. Notwithſtanding doe I not reprove the knowledge of theſe things altogether. Leſt I might reprove Moſes and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Acts 7. 22. Daniel, 17. 20. Who knew them not to

uſe or practiſe them; But to detect, and refute them: or knew them to the perfection of the underſtanding, not to the depravation of the Will. Yet doe I thinke thoſe worthy to bee reprehended that ſhall affect, commend or promote this ſtudie, (A ſtudie as the moſt difficult, ſo the moſt uſeleſſe) yea and to be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red too. But nevertheleſſe not like the Operative that have hereby wrought miſchiefe or offence to the diſturbance of peace and truth, in the Church and State.

But it matters not much, though ſhee talke of never ſo many monſtrous or ridiculous Deluſions or abſurdities, (for the Devills Actions are now to be admitted for no leſſe) if ſo be ſome Reality of depraved Affections, Intentions, or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects may be obſerved therein.</p>

For the Law is not to be Executed before the Sentence bee pronounced; nor ought that to be before Conviction. Neither is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that ſo palpable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Conviction ſhould here come in, as in other more ſenſible matters. It is enough if there be but ſo much Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall proofe or evidence; as the Subſtance, matter, and Nature of ſuch an Abſtruſe myſtery of Iniquitie will well admit. But withall I could wiſh that theſe Twelve good men and True, were not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannelled

Others would have it done and it be but for their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Converſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſay they) Witches will never thinke of Repenting till they come to the Gallowes. Were it ſo, it were then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for the Wretches; But ſay it were ſo, Gods mercy excuſes not mans Injuſtice, but aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates it. In my mind therefore this is ſafeſt, and ſatiſfactory; where God hath denyed man full evidence, it is not for mans Iuſtice to fall to Execution of vengeance: Nor is that to be called Tolleration where Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is wanting. This is plain in more ſenſible Caſes (as of Murther, Theft &amp;c.) where
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:114682:103"/>
the Law proceeds not (though upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> never ſo ſtrong Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) for want of Plenary and particular Evidence; and why not here ſith it is a Matter more occult? And if it remaynes ſo occult, as not to come within a Legal conviction; it is a ſigne God hath reſerved ſuch for his owne Iuſtice and Vengeance which all their devilliſh Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall not be able to elude, Malac. 3. 5.

                  <hi>12 Caſe. </hi>Whether a Witch may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and ſo be ſaved?</head>
               <p>I know the Churches of old have been ſo Charitable, as to ſuppoſe their Converſion: and to that purpoſe, have (in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Caſes) propoſed their penance. And I read in Story of the Notable Repentance of certaine Pope Witches; with the miraculous ſignes of their ſalvation. And have heard the Tradition, how the Devill has been forc't to caſt up and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſome ſuch pacting Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though written with the Partyes owne Blood. I will conceive withall, that Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have as great Cauſe as may be to recant them of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:114682:104"/>
and Labour to returne. Becauſe they have made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with one, that (on his part) never intended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the leaſt Tittle promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, otherwiſe then praeſtigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. They ſerve a hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that hates them according to an irreconcileable Enmity, Gen. 3. 15. notwithſtanding all the pretended Familiarity: and not onely ſo, but renders them hatefull both to God, &amp; Men. That infeſts their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation night, &amp; day; torments them ſleeping and waking; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies them with gaſtly ſights, &amp; hideous ſounds; makes them familiar to the moſt loathſome Creatures, wherein are leaſt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:114682:105"/>
footeſteps of the Creator to be perceived. Haunts them continually, to be ſtill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Imps about one Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe or another: and will not ſuffer (would a Witch be ſo good) to remove the evill done to any one, but by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it upon ſome other; or elſe threatens to inflict it upon themſelves. Keeps them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes poore, leane, naked, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, diſcontented; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes them utterly in their moſt Imaginary pleaſures and Contentments. If they chance to ſteale any thing after a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious manner, he ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes as praeſtigiouſly conveys it from them againe; or ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects

it that it is nothing uſefull to them. And after once whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his ſeekes to betray them to Temporall Iuſtice, that ſo he may the ſooner get them into his infernall Poſſeſſion; and this he is the more eager upon, leſt peradventure having wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed themſelves in this way of wickednes it might come into their minds to repent them at length. And thus we have the Devill alſo fearing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and by that it ſhould ſeeme there is ſome hopes of them. There would be more hope if wee could heare God promiſing and promoving it. But God hath univerſally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelfe for their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:114682:106"/>
Malac. 3. 5. Revel. 21. 8. and 22. 15. And it is ſafeſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to judge after his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Wherefore though wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may have ſome ſlender thoughts and wiſhes for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as had Balaam, Numb. 24. 10. Yet I cannot but thinke it a rare thing ſtill for Magitians to come and worſhip Chriſt. Mat. 2. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>As to the Caſe therefore; to ſay that of Witches, Some may Convert and be ſaved; ſome cannot Convert, but ſhall bee Damned. This were to leave the Caſe as Indefinite, as I found it. For leſſe then ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be determined concerning the leaſt of ſins. Give me leave
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114682:106"/>
therefore to declare the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Conſcience both ſomewhat more determinately and diſtinctly. viz. That the Arted Paſſive and ſimply De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Witch may repent and be ſaved: But the ſolemnly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, malitiouſly Active, and utterly Apoſtate Witch nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can, nor will, nor ſhall. The Arted Witches, Act. 19. 13 Converted and ſo were ſaved. For the word of God prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that Purpoſe. verſ. 20. Yea they beleved and ſhewed their Deeds. verſ. 18. But Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus though heeuſed the meanes of Salvation (hee beleeved, wondred and was Baptized, Act. 8. 13.) Yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:114682:107"/>
had hee part nor lot in the matter of Sanctification or Salvation, ver. 21. yea, though the Apoſtle puts a peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon his Repentance, Prayer, Remiſſion; yet is hee peremptory upon his Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, verſ. 22. 23. And all is becauſe of the Diabolicall and Indiſſoluble Pact the Bond of Iniquity. So the Damſell, Act. 16. 16. 17. 18. A meerly paſſive Witch (whoſe Divination or Soothſaying was forced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Daemoniacal Poſſeſſion) was ſaved no doubt. Of which her opportune Occurſion, her Confeſſion, her Application of it, her perſeverance, with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Ejection out of her, are
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114682:107"/>
ſufficient Teſtimonies. But I cannot ſay ſo much of Iezabel and the witch of Endor, who were malicious active witches. Manaſſeh likewiſe (though ſome think hee was no Witch himſelfe, but only a Conſulter, a Favourer and a promoter of them) yet (led by the many notable Expreſſions, 2 Chr. 39. 6.) I rather conceive he was a very Witch. Nevertheleſſe it is ſaid he ſought the Lord, and prayed, and the Lord was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of him, verſ. 12. 13. But he was no Apoſtate Witch. For it is not ſpoken of him til after his Converſion. He then knew that the Lord he was God, v. 13. But Simon Magus and Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:114682:108"/>
the Sorcerer (two Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate witches) who would have hired the power of the holy Spirit for money, who malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſought to pervert the faith &amp; truth of Chriſt. Theſe therefore the Apoſtles (Peter and Paul) denounce expreſly for damned Reprobates, Act. 8. 23. and 13. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>To conclude, when I ſhal be inſtructed, of any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſpecifique ſin, ſo neare to the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt as this of Witchcraft: Or that there is any other blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy more imputing the works of the Devill to God, or the workes of God to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: or ſuch an Anti-chriſtian
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114682:108"/>
Miſterie of Iniquity with lying wonders, and ſtrong deluſions, 2 Theſſ. 2. Or ſuch a giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits and doctrines of Devills, 1 Tim. 4.

Or in very deed ſuch a ſin unto death, 1 John 5. I ſay, when I ſhall be inſtructed that the ſin of Witchcraft is not all this: Or if there bee any other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifique particular ſinne ſo like to all this, as is the ſinne of Witch-craft: Or to which both the Scripture phraſes and properties that Divines

make of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, may bee more aptly and fully apply'd, then ſhall I bee convicted in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to bee more remiſſe in my Judgement againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted-Active-Apoſtate Witch.</p>
