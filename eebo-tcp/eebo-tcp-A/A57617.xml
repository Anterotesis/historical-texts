            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the night before he was beheaded.</head>

            <opener>
               <salute>
                  <hi>Dear</hi> WIFE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu shall receive my last words in
these my last lines; my love I
send you that you may keepe it
when I am dead, and my counsel
that you may remember it when I
am no more. I would not with
my will present you sorrows (dear <hi>Besse</hi>) let them
go to the grave with me, and be buried in the dust.
And seeing it is not the will of God that ever I shall
see you any more in this life, beare my destruction
gently, and with a heart like your selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:124862:3"/>
First, I send you all the thanks which my heart
can conceive, or my words expresse, for your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
troubles and cares taken for me, which though
they have not taken effect as you wished, yet my
debt to you is not lesse, but I shall never recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
it in this world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I beseech you even for the love you
bare me living, that you doe not hide your selfe
many dayes, but by your travell seek to helpe your
miserable fortune, and the right of your poore
childe: Your mourning cannot availe me that am
but dust.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you shall understand that my Lands
were conveied (<hi>bona fide</hi>) to my childe, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
were drawne at Mid summer was twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month,
as divers can witnesse, and I trust that my
blood will quench their malice that desire my
slaughter, and that they will not seek also to kill
you and yours with extream poverty.</p>
            <p>To what friend to direct you I know not, for all
mine have left me in the true time of tryall; most
sorry I am (as God knoweth) that being thus sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
with death I can leave you no better estate;
I meant you all my Office of wines or that I should
purchase by selling it, halfe my stuffe and my jewels,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124862:3"/>
(but some few for the boy) but God hath preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all my determinations; The great God that
worketh all in all.</p>
            <p>But if you can live free from want, dare for no
more, for the rest is but vanity.</p>
            <p>Love God, and begin betime to repose your selfe
on him, therein shall you finde true and everlasting
riches and endlesse comfort: for the rest when you
have travelled and wearied your thoughts over all
sorts of worldly congitations, you shall sit downe by
sorrow in the end.</p>
            <p>Teach your son also to serve and fear God whilst
he is young, that the feare of God may grow up
with him, then will God be a husband unto you,
and a father unto him, a husband and a father that
can never be taken from you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bayly</hi> oweth me 1000 l. <hi>Arion</hi> 600 l. In <hi>Iersie</hi>
also I have much owing me; the arrerages of the
wines will pay your debts.</p>
            <p>And howsoever (I beseech you for my soules
sake) pay all poore men when I am gone: no
doubt you shall bee sought unto, for the world
thinks I was very rich.</p>
            <p>But take heed of the pretence of men and of their
affections, for they last but in honest and worthy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124862:4"/>
men: and no greater misery can befall you in this
life, then to become a prey, and after to bee despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
I speake it (God knoweth) not to disswade you
from marriage, for that will be best for you, both in
respect of God and the world.</p>
            <p>As for me I am no more yours, not you mine,
death hath cut us asunder, and God hath divided
me from the world, and you from me: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
your poore childe for his fathers sake that
comforted you, and loved you in his happiest
times.</p>
            <p>I sued for my life (but God knowes) it was for
you and yours that I desired it: for know it (deare
wife) that your sonne is the childe of a true man,
and who in his owne heart despiseth death, and all
his mishapen and ugly forms.</p>
            <p>I cannot write much: God knoweth how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I stole this time when all were asleep, and it
is now time to separate my thoughts from the
world. Beg my dead body which living was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
you, and either lay it in <hi>Sherborne</hi> or in <hi>Exeter</hi>
Church by my father and mother. I can say no
more, time and death call me away. The ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
God, infinite, powerfull, and inscrutable
God, That Almighty God which is goodnesse it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124862:4"/>
mercy it selfe, the true light and life, keep you
and yours, and have mercy upon me.</p>
            <p>Teach me to forgive my persecuters and false
accusers, and send me to meet him in his glorious
Kingdome.</p>
            <p>My true wife farewell, God blesse my poore boy,
pray for me, my true God hold you both in His
Armes.</p>
