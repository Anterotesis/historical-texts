            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Gentleman-Apothecary.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Ladies method of <hi>Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>Glysters,</hi> is rarely
good without dispute, both
for the <hi>Health</hi> and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;</hi>
but especially <hi>Glysters;</hi> which
<hi>Araminte</hi> made often use of; not that
they could make her fairer than they
only found her, but to preserve those
Beauties fresh, and charming, which
they could not either create or increase.</p>
            <p>Once upon a time having given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for this blessed Preservative, and
being told by her Woman, that all was
ready, she laid her self down upon the
Bed in posture to receive it, with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
patience expecting the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
office; with patience I say, for
<hi>fretting makes people look old;</hi> and <hi>all hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
women are under an Oath to be true to
their Faces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Mistress having disposed her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb facs="tcp:38190:3"/>
as I told you, (in no very good
condition to take notice of what past
in the Chamber) away runs the maid
(leaving the door open) for a nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin:
And, just in the Interim, while
she was hunting for a cloth, gently up
the stairs comes <hi>Timante,</hi> (a familiar
friend of the Ladies) and seeing the
passage free, into the Chamber he
goes, without discovery.</p>
            <p>The first spectacle he encountred, was
a pair of incomperable Hanches; which
put him, for a while, to a stand; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of reverence, and partly out of
surprize: But in a short time, coming
a little to himself, and looking round
about him, to see if any body were in
the Room, he casts his eye upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Instrument which the maid had
left on a Chair by the Bed side. The
Gentleman, very Innocently takes it
up, and finding it laden, and his Mark
fair, for want of an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> resolves
to do the work himself, and so he did;
and that so dexterously too, that the
best Master of his trade in <hi>Paris</hi> could
not have mended it.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:38190:3"/>
            <p>Immediately upon the discharge,
out slips <hi>Timante</hi> again, as privately
as he came in, and no mortal the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.
<hi>Araminte,</hi> in the mean while,
draws up her self within the Curtains,
covers all for fear of the worst, and so
disposes her self to her Repose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Timante</hi> was no sooner out of the
House, but down comes the Maid,
post hast, with twenty excuses in her
mouth all the way she came, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her Mistress wait so long. Well
Madam, says she, I am glad how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to see your Ladiship keep your
self warm; But now, when you please,
I am ready for you, and to say the
truth, the Glyster was somewhat with
the hottest before.</p>
            <p>What means this Wench! (cries
<hi>Araminte)</hi> wouldst thou have me take
two at a bout? <hi>Two,</hi> Madam? I beg
your Ladiships pardon (says the Maid)
you have had none at all yet. Prithee
no more fooling (cries the Mistress)
and let me get this <hi>out,</hi> before I take
another <hi>in;</hi> didst not thou thy self
give me one just now? Not I, Madam,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38190:4"/>
as I hope to be saved, (says the Wench)
I have been all this while above in
the Garret for a Napkin; but now I
perceive your Ladiship has been your
own Apothecary, for I see the Bag is
empty. Upon my soul not I, says <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raminte;</hi>
but most assuredly I have a
Glyster in my Guts, and whoever
put it there, was his Crafts-master.
The Maid, she swore over and over,
that, for her part, she knew nothing
on't.</p>
            <p>Upon this, they fell to gazing one
upon the other in the greatest confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
imaginable, and, without a word
speaking, betray'd in the disorder of
their Looks the distraction of their
thoughts. At last, recollecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
a strict search was made in the
Chamber for this invisible Operator,
but no creature to be found: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
they joyntly concluded that it
must needs be the Devil, and with one
voice cried out by consent that the
House was haunted.</p>
            <p>This Outcry brought all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
in a trice, into <hi>Aramintes</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:38190:4"/>
Chamber, to learn what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
The Maid told them, they had
been troubled with a spirit. <hi>Iesu Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
(cried the company, crossing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
but <hi>what has he done? What has
he done?</hi> To this, they could get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more out of them than that the
Devil was turn'd Apothecary.</p>
            <p>By this time, <hi>Aramintes</hi> Physick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to grow troublesome, and the
company more so: But she kept all her
Gripes and Grumblings to her self, till
Flesh and Blood could hold no longer,
and then in plain terms desired she
might be left a little to her privacy.
So soon as ever the Room was clear'd,
<hi>Araminte</hi> gave the Devil his Glyster
again, and found great ease upon't.</p>
            <p>This was a Terrible Bout, but yet
not so Terrible, as to fright a Lady
from minding her Beauty, and her
Pleasure; nor could the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hinder <hi>Araminte</hi> from dressing,
and going abroad that Evening, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her custom.</p>
            <p>While these things past, <hi>Timante</hi>
was upon a visit at the House of a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38190:5"/>
great Lady; whither he went directly
from <hi>Araminte.</hi> The fancy of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
would not out of his head; and
still as he thought upon it, he could
not for his blood but blurt out a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
till it distasted the company, as if
it had been at some of them: And
then, in his own defence, he was fain to
discover what it was that made him so
merry, that they might not any longer
take him for a Person either unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly,
or ridiculous.</p>
            <p>In the story of his Adventure he
gave them to understand, how that
Providence had made him <hi>Apothecary</hi>
to one of the finest women in <hi>France;</hi>
and so told them all the Particulars, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
only the name of his Patient. This
set the Company a laughing, to break
their hearts; and in fine, there never
was an Afternoon of pleasanter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
<hi>This must be such a one,</hi>
says one; <hi>or such a one, or such a one,</hi>
says another; and among the rest, <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minte</hi>
came in for her part; whom they
pitched upon the rather, both because
they knew her to be a great dealer in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38190:5"/>
that kind of Physick, and also that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante</hi>
came often to the house.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Araminte,</hi> you must know, was not
of a humour to converse with <hi>Goblins,</hi>
and being possessed that her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was haunted, she made all the
hast she could to get ready, and a
broad; And so out she goes, upon a
visit to <hi>Cephise</hi> (the Lady of the House
where <hi>Timante</hi> then was, and where
the Question, I told you of, was still
afoot.) Upon her coming into the
Chamber, <hi>Timante</hi> was observed to
smile, and change colour; which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
the Company in their conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
that <hi>Araminte</hi> was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
Party. <hi>Cephise</hi> received her
with great Complement, and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and being a Person that was Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by her Birth, and Quality, to talk
her Pleasure, (after several pretty
things spoken in favour of <hi>Araminte</hi>'s
Dress, and Person) I'le lay my Life,
Madam, (says <hi>Cephise,</hi> slily enough)
that you have taken Physick to day, for
methinks I read it your Complexion.
<hi>Araminte,</hi> with a blush, dissembled the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38190:6"/>
matter as well as she could: and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante</hi>
answered that blush with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a smile into the bargain,
which he could not forbear, though he
bit his Lips heartily to suppress it; so
that he was forc'd to turn off to the
Window, for fear <hi>Araminte</hi> should
take notice, and imagine the cause
of it. These circumstances, being laid
together; confirmed the Company
more and more; and when they had
chatted away the Evening till 'twas
time to break up, they went every one
their way, abundantly satisfied, that
they knew the <hi>Patient</hi> now, as well as
the <hi>Apothecary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after this, there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
all over the Town, that the Devil
had given <hi>Araminte</hi> a Glyster; and this
was long of her own Woman, that first
told it in confidence to a friend of hers,
and thence it past from hand to hand,
till it came to <hi>Araminte</hi> her self at last:
And it was so publick, that she could
not go abroad for being pointed at in
the streets. But this Rumour lasted
not long, before <hi>Timante</hi> supplied the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38190:6"/>
Devils place in the Story, as the more
probable, and credible Relation of the
two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Timante</hi> was now upon a ticklish
point; if he should give over visiting
as he was wont, it might be taken for
granted that the Report was true:
And on the other side, if he should go,
and be charg'd upon it, he had no way
to come off, but by a flat denial of the
Fact, in which case, evidence would
be given against him out of his own
mouth. Upon this deliberation he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
however to go; but upon the
very instant of setting his foot within
the door, he fell into so strange an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of her displeasure, such an
irresolution of mind, and so wonderful
a trembling of the heart, as made him
suspect himself to have a greater kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for her than he was aware of;
which troubled him the more, because
he knew she had a Servant already, one
<hi>Licandre,</hi> who was then in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>In this disorder, up he goes to
<hi>Araminte's</hi> Chamber, in whom he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38190:7"/>
found a thousand Graces and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which he had never taken the least
notice of before; (for let but a man
believe that he loves a Woman, or
or that he ought to love her, and it is
enough to make him hang himself in
his Garters for her.) This surprize
kept him for a while in silence, and at
gaze: and <hi>Araminte</hi> on the other side
stood stone-still, with her eyes fixt on
the ground, in the greater confusion
perchance of the two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Timante</hi> durst not look his <hi>Mistress</hi>
in the face, nor <hi>Araminte</hi> her <hi>Apothecary,</hi>
and for some half a quarter of an hour
there past not a word; no not so much
as a look between them, to signifie
what they would have been at, if they
could have spoken. In the conclusion,
<hi>Araminte</hi> brake the Ice, and with a side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look;
<hi>Timante,</hi> (says she) <hi>There is
something that I take very ill at your
hands. And</hi>—But there she stopt;
which <hi>Timante</hi> observing; Madam,
says he, I cannot imagine what you
should take ill from me, who (I so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
swear) never had any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38190:7"/>
than to serve you. But <hi>there are
Services,</hi> she replied, <hi>which I should
be loth to receive from</hi> Timante; <hi>and
I need not tell you neither of what
Quality they are.</hi> I would I had ever
been so happy, Madam, as to have
served you to your satisfaction, says
<hi>Timante,</hi> that I might distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the services you like, and those
that displease you. <hi>The services I like</hi>
(says <hi>Araminte) are not of the nature
of those you have render'd me.</hi> (These
words brought the blood into her
Cheeks, but <hi>Timante</hi> went on, as if
nothing had been:) Alas Madam!
says he, <hi>The services that I have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
you!</hi> It has been the design, I
must confess, of my whole life to serve
you, but I was never yet blest with any
opportunity of doing it. <hi>For that,</hi> says
<hi>Araminte, you'l make hard shift rather
than want an opportunity.</hi> He that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
found it, says <hi>Timante,</hi> must needs
want it; neither do I desire it, but in
order to your service: And—Here
<hi>Araminte</hi> interrupting him, <hi>'Tis possible,</hi>
says she, <hi>that opportunity may put it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38190:8"/>
into your power to do me a service that
I should hardly thank you for; and it
may be that has been the very case al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</hi>
If it has, Madam, (says <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante)</hi>
'tis however more than I know.
<hi>Come, come,</hi> (says <hi>Araminte,</hi> raising her
voice) <hi>let's have no more jugling; I
know well enough what you have done,
and that you have done enough to make
me abhor you.</hi> If I have served you,
Madam, as you suppose, why, says
<hi>Timante,</hi> should you abhor me, or
take it amiss that I have served you?
<hi>And yet,</hi> says <hi>Araminte, I do take it
ill, exceedingly ill.</hi> I cannot think
(says he) that this comes from your
heart; if I have done you a service,
methinks you should rather give me
a Reward than a Rebuke. <hi>Do not you
know,</hi> says <hi>Araminte,</hi> (after a little
pause, finding that she could not
make him speak home) <hi>that there are
some services which are never to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
without asking leave?</hi> For my
own part, says he, I reckon those to
be the Noblest services which are
performed without talking of them. To
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38190:8"/>
ask leave, favours too much of vanity,
and ostentation, in publishing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before-hand; and it proves many
times but a vain pretence to what we
are never able to compass. Nay, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
says he, It is still more generous
for a man to conceal himself, not only
in the doing of a service, but if it may
be, even for ever after the service is
done. <hi>That's no more,</hi> says <hi>Araminte,
than I looked for; and you shall do very
well to make your self one of the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
number: For the service here in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is of a quality that better deserves a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
than a Recompence.</hi> The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
Madam, which I have done you,
(says <hi>Timante)</hi> is doubtless a very
extravagant kind of service, if it be as
you render it; and that he who has
done it is a stranger to it himself. Be so
good, I beseech you, as to mind me
of it; give me but some hint that I may
understand it, and I do assure you,
when I come once to know it, I shall
not be so mealy-mouth'd as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
it. (This, he foresaw, would put
her to a puzzle: and finding her at a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38190:9"/>
loss.) But, Madam, says he, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
you reflect upon, is as little
known to your self, I perceive, as to
me; and you that received it, can give
no better account of it, than I that did
it, <hi>Go to, go to,</hi> says <hi>Araminte, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
one another: and since the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is so dishonourable, that you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
not to own it, I shall not give my
self the trouble to tell you it. Let it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
such a service it was, as will blast
your Character among all honest men, and
which I shall for ever remember as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.
But we were better talk of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else.</hi> As <hi>Timante</hi> was about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
she took the word out of his
mouth, and said:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Have you not heard lately of a certain
Cavalier that gave a Lady a Glyster?</hi> Yes,
says <hi>Timante,</hi> (not a little surprized at
the Question) I have heard as much,
but I can hardly believe it. <hi>That's not
the point,</hi> says <hi>Araminte, for true or
false, 'tis the same thing to me: but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me directly, If you had been in that
Cavaliers place, what would you have
done?</hi> Being I was not there, says <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:38190:9"/>
I cannot say precisely what I
would have done, if I had been there,
for I do not know in what humour I
might have been. <hi>Well,</hi> says <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
but in the humour you are in at
present, what would you do, if such an
accident should offer it self, this very
instant?</hi> Shew me the <hi>accident,</hi> Madam,
says he, and I'le shew you the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;</hi>
we have other thoughts upon the
<hi>view</hi> of Objects, than we have upon the
<hi>Fancies</hi> of them. <hi>If you cannot tell me
what you would have done your self, tell
me only,</hi> says <hi>Araminte, what another
ought to have done?</hi> That, says he, is
the greater difficulty of the two; for,
Madam, if I know not what I would
have done my <hi>self,</hi> how should I divine
what <hi>another</hi> would have done? <hi>I do not
ask you</hi> (says the lovely <hi>Araminte,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in heat) <hi>what you would have done, or
what another would have done in the Case,
but what you or another ought to have done?</hi>
I am of opinion, Madam, says he (to
speak freely) that the respect which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
us to the Face of a Woman,
would be an affront to her Back-side;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38190:10"/>
and to quit the palce for fear of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Bum out of countenance, would
appear a very ridiculous thing, and
imply a most unmanly want, both of
Courage, and Respect. It is not <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,</hi>
Madam, that we are to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Ceremonies, and I should look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him as a lost man to both Sexes,
that should shut his eyes upon so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
an occasion. Not but that I
could allow the Lady that should be so
surprized, to be a little peevish, and
out of humour; and if she could call
a man insolent and brutal for his pains,
I should not much hlame her for't. But
yet let me tell your Ladiship, she that
understands her self, and knows how
the World wags, would never make a
serious Bustle about such a Trifle; but
begin the Raillery her self, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
others. What are men made for,
but to serve women? And provided
they do their duties, no matter upon
what occasion. Alas! Madam, the <hi>Part</hi>
is nice and tender: who knows but one
minute more in the cold Air might
have cost her her life? and the Glyster
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38190:10"/>
would have been quite spoiled too, for
'twas with the coolest already. You
may observe too, that so soon as ever
he had done his work, he went his way
with all the gentleness imaginable.
Now where's the crime of all this I
beseech you? unless a man shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
for good Nature; or for the
discretion of improving the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of serving a fair Lady, when 'tis
offer'd him? This is my sense, Madam,
and what I should have done in the
place of this Gallant; and what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any other man ought to have
done, upon the like occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This discourse put</hi> Araminte <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times to the blush, which by twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
little shifts, of looking another way,
and the like, she kept from</hi> Timante
<hi>as much as possible. And when he had
done,</hi> Well, <hi>says she,</hi> If this be your
sense, I can assure you, 'tis none of hers
that's concern'd in the Story; she abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
the man, and knowing you to be
one of the dearest Friends he has in the
world, I am to charge you, in her name,
that you never look her in the face
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38190:11"/>
               <hi>again, nor come where she is to be seen.
This I have in commission to tell you,
and that it will be your best course to do
that of your self, which you will be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
forced to.</hi> This menace (says <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante)</hi>
signifies nothing to me, but for
your sake I submit; provided only that
you tell me who this charming Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may be. I have not the gift of
divination, Madam: How shall I be
able to avoid I know not whom? By
this order of yours, I am never again
to look upon any Woman that's hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
for fear it should prove that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Person whose sight I am forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
No, no, Madam, you have too
much goodness and justice (I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident)
to impose any thing so severe
and unreasonable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the renouncing of the whole Sex,
in exchange for the blessing of your
particular favour, and conversation,
may content you, I will frankly oblige
my self, never to see the face of any
Woman besides your self, and reckon
my self a gainer too by quitting all the
scatter'd Graces that are to be found
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38190:11"/>
in womankind, for the concurrence
of them all, in one and the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
You ask a thing not to be admitted
<hi>(says</hi> Araminte) for the injur'd Lady and
my self, have so much one Interest, and
one soul, that it is impossible to please
the one, with what displeases the other:
Wherefore I do absolutely require it of
you, that from this moment, you never
see me, nor speak to me again, to your
lives end. <hi>This is barbarous (cries</hi>
Timante, <hi>a little disturb'd) to punish a
man so bloodily, for a fault he never
committed, and for a persons sake too
that he never disobliged. Tell her she's
unjust. And</hi>—Enough, enough of this,
<hi>(says</hi> Araminte) and too much too, unless
'twere better. You have done more than
you'l confess, and the Lady you call un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
knows well enough who was the
doer of it. No matter for particulars;
you understand them better than we can
tell you. All I have more to say on my
Friends behalf, is to advise you to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
your Tongue, or there will be ways
found to govern it for you: Ways, which
my Friend hath hitherto forborn, for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38190:12"/>
reasons best known to her self. Never
think to put off the matter, and cry,
'Twas none of you. I tell you the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
You were seen when you went out of
the house: Or, say no body had seen you,
How could you imagine, that what you
your self had talked of so publickly,
should not come to the Ladies own ear at
last? Come, come, <hi>(says she with a sigh)</hi>
consider what you have done: Think on't,
and so fare you well to all eternity. <hi>With
these words in her mouth, out she
goes into the next room, and locks her
self up in her Closet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Timante</hi> was now at leisure to reflect
upon what had past, and concluding
within himself; either that all was
discovered already, or would be very
suddenly; he resolved to make the
best of a bad game, and rather to
put it off with Merriment, and good
Humour, than either to excuse or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it. When he had a little bethought
himself, and finding Ink and Paper up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Table, so pat to his purpose,
he drew over a Letter which he left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Table, against the Hangings, so
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38190:12"/>
much in sight, that there was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Room, without seeing it,
and so went his way, not doubting but
it would fall into the right hand; and
that so soon as ever he was gone, <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minte</hi>
would come out of her Closet
again into the Chamber. He was scarce
out of the door, but in comes <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phile,</hi>
a jolly Lass, and one of <hi>Timante</hi>'s
intimate acquaintance: the first thing
she cast her eye upon, was <hi>Timante's</hi>
Letter, which without any scruple she
presently took up, and read it from one
end to t'other; (for these frolick wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
you must know, are priviledged
to do any thing.) This Letter put
<hi>Neophile</hi> into so violent a fit of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the noise of it fetch'd <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minte</hi>
out of her Closet, to know the
business: and upon that, <hi>Neophile</hi>
read it over again, and laughed more
and more. <hi>Prithee, what's the meaning
of all this?</hi> (says <hi>Araminte)</hi> Only a
Paper that I found here upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(says <hi>Neophile)</hi> which I suppose
you are very able to give a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of, if you please. <hi>Not I, upon my
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38190:13"/>
life</hi> (says <hi>Araminte) I never so much as
saw it.</hi> Go to, go to, (says <hi>Neophile,</hi>
with a roguy smile) let's have none
of these disguises among Friends. 'Tis
true, here's none of <hi>Araminte</hi>'s name
to this Paper, but here's the History
of a certain Adventure of hers, deny
it if you can. Come, come, Prithee
do not pretend to make that a secret to
me, that the whole world is ready to
make an oath of. This made <hi>Araminte</hi>
change colour, and yet she could have
been as free with <hi>Neophile</hi> as with any
body: but still she protested over and
over, that she knew nothing at all of
the Paper; and she had neither read
it, nor seen it.—Why then says
<hi>Neophile,</hi> it is but reason you should
have the reading of it: There 'tis.
And <hi>Araminte</hi> read as follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <head>THE
APOTHECARY
TO HIS
Fair PATIENT.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>BY the manner of your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
about the Glyster, I
perceive you are not willing to
tell me all you know; and I
must be put to conjure for the
rest: which for your sake I am
content to do, and to spare you
the trouble of speaking, what
you are afraid to make me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.
But after this, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, Madam, let us hear
no more of Complaints, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38190:14"/>
as if I wanted either
Kindness, or respect. And yet
now I am coming to the point,
I am a little doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you would rather have me
entertain you, under the name of
a <hi>Third Person,</hi> as you did
<hi>Me,</hi> or address my self to a
<hi>Third Person,</hi> when I speak
to <hi>You.</hi> For my own part, I
am clearly for <hi>plain dealing
among Friends;</hi> and for
treating <hi>You</hi> (now the vizor is
off) as if I were <hi>He,</hi> that did
the good Office you wot of, and
<hi>your self</hi> she that received it.
Yes, yes, Madam; This is the
naked truth of the Case; and I
my self am the happy man who
had the honour to do that service
to the most delicious piece of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38190:14"/>
Flesh in Nature. A ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
that was both seasonable,
and expected: A service that
was both given, and taken,
with all the Civility imaginable:
A service, I say, presented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Knee, with Reverence,
and with Silence; and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with so generous a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that notwithstanding the
utmost force of Charms, and
Appetite, I gave my eye alone
the benefit of the Accident. You
are too just, Madam, and too
wise, to take a Service for an
Offence; and the first undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of the Sex, that ever quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel'd
any man for ministring an
advantage to her Beauty.</p>

            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:38190:15"/>
            <p>This Letter, though pleasant enough
to any body else, could not draw
so much as one smile from <hi>Araminte.</hi>
All she said upon't, was (coldly to
<hi>Neophile)</hi> that she believed the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
belonged to <hi>Neophile,</hi> and was
not found, as she pretended, upon
the Table (not but that she knew
well enough by the Contents, that it
came from <hi>Timante;</hi> only she was
loth to own what had befaln her.)
<hi>Neophile</hi> on the other side, kept her
ground, and shew'd <hi>Araminte</hi> that
the Ink was not yet dry; and that the
Letter was of the same Paper with
that on the Table; and followed her
so close, that at last <hi>Araminte</hi> had
nothing left to say, but that <hi>it was
all one to her, if it were written on
that very Table, and with her Ink and
Paper, so long as she never saw the
Letter, nor knew in the least, to whom
it was intended, or any Creature that
had been engaged in such an adventure.
Neophile,</hi> perceiving that <hi>Araminte</hi>
was a little gravell'd, and taking for
granted that the Story was true, in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38190:15"/>
pure pity to her Friend, chang'd her
Discourse; but yet so ordered the
matter, (as she was notably good at
Fishing) that she got all out of her
before they parted, and made her self
of her particular confidence. And
now was the time to reason her
Friend out of that insociable melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
that possest her, into a better
temper.</p>
            <p>Prithee <hi>Araminte</hi> (says <hi>Neophile)</hi>
leave tormenting of thy self, (for a
pittiful business of I know not what)
to make sport for other people: Dost
thou not think we should have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
world on't, if every Woman
that has had her Back-side turn'd up,
should be of this humour? I would
not advise thee neither, directly to
confess the thing; nor would I have
thee so positively to deny it; but
e'ne fairly pass it over, betwixt jest
and earnest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Araminte</hi> found this to be wholsom
Counsel, and within two days, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

TO THE
Cruel ARAMINTE.</head>
                  <p>I Do not know what you may
think of the Letter I left you
the other day upon the Table;
but you are much to blame, if
you do not take me to be a
very honest civil Fellow for my
pains: First, in going to the
Devil upon your Errand, to
learn that which you would have
me know, and yet durst not tell
me your self. And then, to plead
guilty, of my own accord, to a
Charge which you could never
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38190:16"/>
have proved: And all this for your
satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The last time I had the honour to
see you, you were extreamly angry
with me for my <hi>Curiosity;</hi> but let
me tell you now, for your Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
that you are abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
upon me, in my <hi>Love.</hi> To
tell you the plain troth, I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
better nor worse, than stark
mad, for a certain Woman, that
within these eight and forty hours,
bad me never look her in the face
again. If you be the person, it
is not my part to mind you of it, but
on the contrary, to try if I can
make you forget it. I am perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
beating my brains, which way
to make my peace with you, and my
passion acceptable to you: But then,
methinks, for a Lady of your qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38190:17"/>
to cast her eyes upon a wretched
Apothecary, were a most unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
thing; and yet you are to
consider, Madam, that I am an
Apothecary that chuses his Patients,
and ministers only to fair Ladies:
Witness the incomparable <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minte,</hi>
who knows this to be a
truth, past dispute, or contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And where's the Cavalier now,
that does not wish himself an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary
in my place? Tell me for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
sake, Madam, how I am with
you, and when I may see you, that
I may tell you again, when you your
self shall see, at your feet, the most
faithful, and passionate of all Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>

            <p>This way of fooling pleased <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minte</hi>
well enough, and set <hi>Timante,</hi>
by little and little, upon better terms
with his Mistress, (who, you must
know, was too much a Christian, to
carry malice in her heart against any
man that had Wit in him, and good
Humour.) But as to the answering,
either of this, or of any other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for the future, she was utterly
against it, till all should be gone and
past, for fear of reviving the story.</p>
            <p>But this would not serve <hi>Timante's</hi>
turn; for his business was to possess
<hi>Araminte</hi> with a sense of his passion,
and to shew her that it was above all
discouragements. So that let her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
or not, his resolution was to

                  <p>But this is all a man gets for his
good will. Well, well: go on if
you please, and make me turn Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
in good earnest. I shall
not want fair Customers, never
doubt it, when the world shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that my first Trial of
skill was upon your sweet Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Do not provoke me, but be
kind, and wise in time. For in my
whole practice, if ever I meet with
the fellow of the sight you shewed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38190:19"/>
me, I shall most certainly revolt.
Till then you are to expect the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of my Letters, and after
that day, not a syllable more, from
<hi>Timante,</hi> while your eyes are

               <hi>Araminte</hi> found this Raillery, not
amiss; but still she kept to her Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

                  <head>TIMANTE
TO THE
Fair ARAMINTE,
If she be above grouud.</head>
                  <p>THough you have plagu'd me
most damnably, yet I can have
the Charity to forgive you, if you
be <hi>dead;</hi> but look for no quarter
at my hands, if it shall be your
lot to be found among the <hi>living.</hi>
To make such a pudder about a
<hi>Glyster?</hi> As if it had been Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot.
I must see <hi>You</hi> no more, it
seems, because I saw <hi>That,</hi> which
neither saw me, nor knows me, nor
ever took any thing ill from me; not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38190:20"/>
indeed, any thing at all from me,
but as the lawful Deputy of the
Chamber-Maid. It is not well, to
trouble your self so much with what's
done <hi>below-stairs;</hi> and by your own
own fretting, and fuming, to make
that so hot in the mouth, that was
so cool and comfortable in the belly.
I could say somewhat more than
you are aware of, perchance, in a
business of which I was an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and revenge my self that
way upon you, If I would give my
mind to it. But <hi>Basto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you be really dead, I do not see
why any thing of this should trouble
you; but if you be <hi>alive,</hi> faith,
recal your commands, and let me
live too; for there is nothing surer,
than that your <hi>Kindness,</hi> or <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,</hi>
is the <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Death</hi> of</p>

            <p>This Letter wrought no more upon
<hi>Araminte</hi> than the rest; and <hi>Timante</hi>
quickly found that writing would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
do his business; so that some other
course was now to be thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the making of his Peace with
his Mistress: and no way better, than
by engaging <hi>Neophile;</hi> (which was
his next work) who he knew could
do any thing she pleased, with <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minte.</hi>
Upon the opening of his
heart to her, she promised him fair,
and you shall now see how she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
            <p>She got <hi>Timante</hi> to her house, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a certain time when <hi>Araminte</hi>
was to make her a Visit; and there
she placed him behind the Hanging,
within hearing. <hi>Araminte,</hi> says she,
<hi>I have a request to make you, and you
must promise me before-hand not to deny
me. Araminte</hi> past her word, that she
would not; and immediately upon
that, <hi>Neophile</hi> presents <hi>Timante</hi> to her,
for her pardon, and begs of her, that
for the time to come, she should allow
him the honour of waiting upon her,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38190:21"/>
as formerly he had done. <hi>No body
loves you, Madam, better than I do,</hi>
says <hi>Neophile, and you shall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
the entertainment of so chearful
and ingenious a Conversation. Timante</hi>
seconded this mediation of <hi>Neophile,</hi>
upon his knees, with all expressions
of Tenderness, Passion, and Humility
imaginable. It was a pretty while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Araminte</hi> could recover her self
from the Confusion this surprize had
given her, and just as she was about
to reply, she was struck dumb again;
for she could not look <hi>Timante</hi> in the
<hi>Face,</hi> without reflecting that he had
looked upon her, <hi>elsewhere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> upon
which thought, she stood, for a good
while, with her eyes fix'd upon the
ground, and without one syllable
speaking. But upon farther conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
she resolv'd to break through
all these fantastical scruples, and to
say something to <hi>Timante,</hi> who was
all this while upon his knees, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of her Answer.</p>
            <p>Timante, <hi>(says she)</hi> Neophile is my
friend, and for her sake I am content
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38190:21"/>
to pardon all that's past; for 'tis not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
I should hate any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
under her protection. Wherefore I
do once again assure you, that whatever
is past, shall be forgotten as if it had
never been. But I must now conjure
you on the other side, that you never
see me again; and this I am sure you
will not refuse me, at least if you love
me, as you say you do; or if you have
any respect for my Peace, and Credit;
for I perceive I shall never be able to
look upon you, but with shame, and
trouble. It is upon this condition, that
I pardon you the affront you have done
me; and I shall judge of your <hi>Affection,</hi>
by your <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah Madam, says <hi>Timante,</hi> would
you have me promise you an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?
To bid a man shew his <hi>Love</hi>
by his <hi>Indifference,</hi> is to bid him <hi>Love</hi>
and not <hi>Love</hi> at the same time.</p>
            <p>The very soul of Love is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the beloved Object: take
away That, and Love is rather a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,</hi>
than a <hi>Comfort. But how many are
there,</hi> says <hi>Araminte, that gratifie their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38190:22"/>
Passions, at all distances, with the very
contemplation, and desire of what they
love?</hi> By your fair leave, Madam,
says <hi>Timante,</hi> he that lives in <hi>Desire,</hi>
lives in <hi>Torment:</hi> But however, be it
as you please, whether my life shall
be happy, or miserable; I shall not
want strength, and obedience, to carry
this Passion with me to my Grave. <hi>Do
as you say then,</hi> said <hi>Araminte, and
you will oblige me, in suffering for me.</hi>
It shall be so, Madam, (says <hi>Timante)</hi>
with a passionate sadness in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
Bnt is it not possible, that
time—<hi>No more Questions,</hi> says <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raminte,
but let it suffice, that you
will please me, if you obey me: And let
me tell you, that he that comes once to
please his Mistress, is in a fair way to
gain her. Timante,</hi> finding that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
went better than he expected,
prest the business no further; but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his word for his obedience left
the rest to <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>good Nature.</hi> On
the other side, the lovely <hi>Araminte</hi>
was so well satisfied with <hi>Timante</hi>'s
manner of proceeding, both upon the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38190:22"/>
point of <hi>Affection,</hi> and <hi>Respect,</hi> that she
told him, <hi>so soon as the talk was over,
he might visit her again; and that for
her part, when the World should have
forgotten his Fault, she would not be the
last should remember it.</hi> Upon this they
parted; and <hi>Timante</hi> took his leave.
<hi>Araminte</hi> staid not long after; but not
a word this bout to <hi>Neophile,</hi> of any
disposition she found in her self to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the person, whom but just now,
she so violently hated.</p>
            <p>It seems by the discourse, that the
<hi>Apothecary</hi> and his <hi>Patient</hi> began now to
understand one another; which <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phile</hi>
took notice of too; and within
a few days, brought her friend to
confess as much. At which time, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candre,
(a profest Servant,</hi> though <hi>no
great Favourite</hi> of <hi>Araminte</hi>'s) came
out of the Country, where he had
been upon some earnest business. At
his Return, he was welcom'd with
the story of the Glyster; which, instead
of diverting him, put him (being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
jealous, and hot-headed) into
the most extravagant rage imaginable.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38190:23"/>
Nothing would serve him, but he must
be reveng'd upon <hi>Timante;</hi> and that
too, not without reproaching <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minte</hi>
(how innocent soever;) which
he did sufficiently, the first Visit he
made her.</p>
            <p>You are in good health, I hope,
Madam, says <hi>Licandre. In very good
health Sir, I thank you,</hi> replys <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minte.</hi>
Yes, Madam, says he, I make
no question of it; for I understand
you are in a course of Physick to
keep you so. <hi>Araminte,</hi> that knew
his humour perfectly well, and saw
what he would be at, made him this
careless answer, <hi>I do not know how
you come to be so well informed in my
Affairs; but this I assure you, Sir, that
whatever I do, it is not to please you.</hi>
And yet Madam, says the brutish <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candre,</hi>
though you have no design to
please <hi>Me,</hi> there are <hi>a thousand others</hi>
that you would be glad with all your
heart to please: you would never have
taken a Glyster of the first comer else.
<hi>You may be sure however for your part</hi>
(says she, with a modest indignation)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38190:23"/>
               <hi>that 'tis an office I'le never receive from
you.</hi> And truly Madam, says he, I
am not at all ambitious of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
my Rivals it may be, will be
glad on't; but for my self I was never
cut out for an Apothecary. <hi>At a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
says <hi>Araminte, I shall not put that
to the tryal.</hi> You'l do the better, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
says he, for I'm not half so good
at it as <hi>Timante. I cannot imagine,</hi> says
she, <hi>what it is you drive at.</hi> But 'tis
enough, says he, that I can. They
entertain'd one another at this rate a
good while; and <hi>Araminte</hi> was so
quick upon him at every turn, that
<hi>Licandre</hi> had little joy of that Visit,
and so away he went.</p>
            <p>This business ran in his head all that
night, and early in the morning, up he
gets, and away, towards <hi>Timante</hi>'s
Lodgings, to watch his going abroad,
and demand satisfaction, with his
Sword in his hand, which he resolved
to do, in such a manner however,
that it should appear rather a <hi>Casual
Encounter,</hi> than a <hi>Formal Duel.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a matter of an hours waiting, out
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38190:24"/>
comes <hi>Timante,</hi> and <hi>Licandre,</hi> at a
petty distance follows him, till they
came in a little, blind, unfrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Alley; and there <hi>Licandre</hi> draws,
and runs in upon him, bidding him
defend himself. One word was as
good as a thousand to <hi>Timante</hi> in such
a case, who so behaved himself, that
<hi>Licandre</hi> found he was like to have his
belly-ful before they parted. They
exchanged several Passes, upon equal
means; but at last, <hi>Timante</hi> drew blood
of his enemy; and it had gone worse
with him too, if company had not
come in, and parted them.</p>
            <p>There was no body took this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
for any other than a <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,</hi>
and yet the Combatants durst
not trust themselves to the severity of
the Law, but thought it their wisest
course to shift for themselves, and lye
close, till either their peace should be
made, or they might fight it out.</p>
            <p>You may imagine the different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
these two Gentlemen past up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fortune of that day; and that
while <hi>Timante</hi> on the one side was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38190:24"/>
transported with Joy, for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
he had gain'd upon his <hi>Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and <hi>Rival,</hi> (both in one.) <hi>Lican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre,</hi>
on the other side was ready to
hang himself for the contrary. But
the thing that most stuck in his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
was, the ridiculous occasion
of the Quarrel. If the Devil had
not possest me, (says he) I should
never have brought my <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
to the stake, for a <hi>Glyster-pipe,</hi>
with a great deal to this effect: And
while <hi>Licandre</hi> was in this chafe, and
stewing himself in his own grease, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante</hi>'s
employment was to write to
his Mistress, which he did the same
day in these terms.</p>

               <hi>Araminte</hi> did not well know what
to make of the medly of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for there was somewhat in it,
to <hi>laugh</hi> at, and somewhat again to
be <hi>angry</hi> at: for <hi>Timante</hi>'s Raillery
went too far, when it came to make
sport with her Reputation; and
that, she took great offence at. But
upon consideration of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and the general heedlesness
of those that give up themselves to
this drolling humour, she conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to pass it over, without any
more ado.</p>
            <p>By this, (as time and friends will
do any thing) the King was pacified
about the quarrel, upon assurance,
that there was nothing of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or premeditation in it: and
a place of meeting was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at the house of one that wished
well to both, for the reconciling of
the two Combatants; where they
were brought together; but with
the greatest difficulty in the world,
to get <hi>Licandre</hi> thither. When they
thought all was well, one of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38190:29"/>
Company was asking how they came
to fall out. <hi>Timante</hi> protested, he
knew nothing at all on't, and that
<hi>Licandre</hi> who assaulted him, was able
to give the best accompt. <hi>Licandre</hi>
on the other side, reply'd, that <hi>Timante</hi>
was not so ignorant as he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
which <hi>Timante</hi> deny'd again,
with so many Oaths, and Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that they all fell upon <hi>Licandre</hi>
to tell them what it was. He shifted
it off as well as he could, but it would
not pass upon the company, that he
should set upon <hi>Timante,</hi> and not know
a reason for't. It was a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could prevail; but at last,
after much earnestness, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>Licandre</hi> told them in plain terms,
that he was jealous of <hi>Timante,</hi> and
that he drew his Sword, in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Lady for whom he had a
great honour; which Lady <hi>Timante</hi>
had affronted, by giving her a Glyster,
upon a mistake. This set the whole
Company a laughing, and one of them
especially, so much louder than the
rest, that <hi>Licandre</hi> in a Rage, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38190:29"/>
to see himself made sport
of, gave him a box o'th' ear, that
made the Hall ring again, as well
with the blow, as with the lauhgter.
This accident divided the Company
presently into parties, some for the
<hi>Plaintiff,</hi> others for the <hi>Defendant;</hi> and
a great many Swords were drawn
upon't in a moment. There were some
wiser than others, that with much
ado parted them; but two or three
of the forwardest were wounded first;
of which <hi>Licandre</hi> was one (as a just
punishment of his rashness.) The hurt
he had received, was very dangerous,
and yet the least part of the trouble;
for nothing gall'd him so much as to
be brought upon the stage, for so filly
a business. Oh how he curst himself;
This comes of Caterwalling, with a
pox! (says he) the Devil takes her,
and all that belongs to her, and my
self too, when ever I so much as think
of her again. Two wounds have I
now received for one Glyster.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Araminte</hi> was told every syllable
that past, and too well acquainted
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38190:30"/>
with the Jealousie and Brutality of
<hi>Licandre,</hi> to doubt the truth of it.
Well, says she, since he's in a vein
of swearing, I'le make one Oath too;
which is, never to see the eyes of
him again, if I can avoid it.</p>
            <p>Just as <hi>Araminte</hi> had taken up
this Resolution, in comes <hi>Neophile,</hi> on
the behalf of <hi>Timante</hi> to treat of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
wherein she was not only free,
as to the disposing of her self, but by
obligations of Honour, Reason, and
Inclination, induc'd to a Complyance.
Beside, that <hi>Licandre</hi> was now lost
with her to all intents and purposes.</p>
            <p>This accident of the <hi>Glyster</hi> struck
a great stroke in the Match; for <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minte</hi>
look'd upon that familiarity
with a Womans Back-side, to be a
kind of Conjugal Prerogative; and
reckon'd upon it (effectually) as so
much in hand, in part of Matrimony:
which follow'd not long after; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regard to the unfortunate <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candre,</hi>
who lay bed-rid all this while;
and in torments both of Body and
Mind, not to be conceiv'd. It was a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38190:30"/>
wonderful thing, the operation of
this Glyster, for it wrought upon the
very <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Araminte,</hi> and brought
two persons together, that had before
seen one another, a thousand, and
a thousand times, the ordinary way,
without ever dreaming of any such
matter. This story of the <hi>Apothecary</hi>
and his <hi>Patient,</hi> serv'd for Raillery,
and Entertainment to the <hi>Wits,</hi> a
long time after; but without any
thing of Scandal, or Reproach; for
they were both of them very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Persons; and all that could be
made on't was this, that <hi>Timante had
done his work so well, he deserv'd his
wages.</hi>
