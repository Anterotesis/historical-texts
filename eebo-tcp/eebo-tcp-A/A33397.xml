            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OF THE
SABBATH.</head>
            <p>THAT we may be truly and clearly informed of the
Doctrine of the Sabbath, we muſt conſider and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
theſe following Truths.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>Adam</hi> ſo long as he continued in the
eſtate of Innocency in which he was created of God, nor was, nor
could be under the obligation of the ten Commandments, and ſo
not under the obedience of the fourth Commandment: for can
it rationally be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Adam</hi> being created perfectly holy,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26, 27, made after the Image of God, which was perfect
in <hi>Adam;</hi> his Underſtanding was as full of concreated light of
the knowledg of God and of his works, as was neceſſary to his
preſent happineſs; and he was ſuitably perfect in his will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
and therefore while he continued in this perfect holy
eſtate, what need had he of the Ten Commandments? or of
what uſe could they be unto him? He knew not what it was to
worſhip an Image, or to take Gods Name in vain; nor could he
know any of the ſins forbidden, nor any of the duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the ſecond Table of the Law; nor was of it any uſe
to him, who was perfectly holy; nor did he know that God
would ſet apart one day in ſeven to be more holy than the reſt; for
had he continued in the eſtate of Innocency more days than that
in which he was created, the eight day, and the ninth, and the tenth
day, and every had been alike holy to him, and as much a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
to him as the Seventh day; for he would have been ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
holy, and therefore not ſubject to bodily wearineſs, and ſo
needed not bodily reſt; nor would he then have needed any of
thoſe outward duties and ordinances of worſhip required of us
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103608:3"/>
in the ſecond or fourth Commandments, for our ſpiritual edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and comfort; for he needed not either ſpiritual information
or ſpiritual comfort, or ſpiritual growth, as we do ſince the fall;
a perfect eſtate of grace and holineſs hath no need of any of theſe
ſpiritual helps and means, no more than the holy Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
have now need or uſe of them. And hence two things muſt
neceſſarily be inferred.</p>
            <p>1. That man was fallen from his Innocency before he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to obſerve the ſeventh day as the time of the Sabbath or
holy Reſt, as it was afterwards expreſſed in the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and it is evident, that Gods great deſign in creating man,
was not his continuance in the eſtate of innocency for one day;,
and therefore as ſoon as man was created and put into Paradiſe
God made a Covenant with him for himſelf and all his poſterity,
That if he did eat firſt of the fruit of the tree of knowledg of
good and evil, he and all his poſterity ſhould preſently dye, that
is, a ſpiritual death, by being ſtript of that holy image of God in
which he was created; but if he did eat firſt of the tree of Life,
which ſtood next to the other, then he and all his poſterity ſhould
continue for ever in their preſent holy and happy eſtate. Now the
Devil hearing and knowing that God had made this Covenant
with him, and fearing leſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould eat firſt of the tree of
Life, and ſo he and all his poſterity ſhould live for ever; he being
full of envy, and malice, and ſubtilty, he preſently entred into the
Serpent, and in and by the Serpent perſwaded and prevailed with
<hi>Eve,</hi> and by <hi>Eve</hi> perſwades and prevailed with <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of
the fruit of the forbidden tree; and ſo they both, and all their
poſterity, were deprived of that innocent and holy eſtate in which
they were created; therefore Gods great deſign in creating man,
was, that by his fall he might take occaſion to glorifie both his
Mercy and Juſtice in ſending his Son into the world to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
and Saviour, which he did in promiſe immediately upon
mans fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15; and by actual exhibition, when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of time was come, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4: And therefore <hi>Adam</hi>'s conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
in the eſtate of innocency for ſo ſhort a time, was moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to Gods great deſign in man's creation.</p>
            <p>2. This alſo muſt neceſſarily be inferred, That <hi>Adam</hi> being
created perfectly innocent and holy, could not fall from that holy
and happy eſtate by any other way, but only by doing ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
act, in its own nature lawful, which God ſhould forbid him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103608:3"/>
to do; and God forbad him to eat of the fruit of the tree of
knowledg of good and evil, which was in it ſelf lawful, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
unlawful for him to eat of that fruit, by a poſitive nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
precept from God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. For God never made with
man but two Covenants eſſentially differing one from the other;
the firſt was made with man in the eſtate of innocency, before his
fall, expreſſed in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16, 17; and this, if you will, you may
call a Covenant of Works; and this Covenant he brake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6.
And the ſecond Covenant God made with man in his lapſed or
fallen eſtate, being devoid of all ſpiritual good, overſpread with
original ſin, and under the guilt of eternal death; and this was
a Covenant of Grace, touching the redemption and ſalvation of
man, a ſinner, by the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, both God
and Man; and this Covenant of Grace God did reveal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
to <hi>Adam</hi> immediately upon his fall, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and what
God hath revealed to be his will in reference to man a ſinner, ever
ſince he made that promiſe, hath been but an explication and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification
of that Covenant-promiſe made in Chriſt. Now this
Covenant of Grace (ſince that firſt promiſe made to man in his
lapſed eſtate) God hath revealed to man a ſinner, or rather to his
Church and people by ſuch degrees and means as he pleaſed; for
as for the firſt two thouſand years after that promiſe, God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his will and mind to his people, not by writing, but either by
viſions, or dreams, or by audible voice, and the like; but at the
end of two thouſand years, when God brought his people out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> they being grown to a great Nation, in their paſſage
through the Wilderneſs, God eſtabliſhed the Covenant of Grace
with them in a more publick way, and after a more ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
upon <hi>Mount Sinai;</hi> and then, and not before, he ſpake the
Ten Commandments to them with his own mouth; and alſo he
wrote them in two Tables of ſtone with his own hand, to be
unto them, and to all ſucceeding Churches, in covenant with
him, a rule to walk by, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 18. Now theſe Ten Words, or
Ten Commandments, are no where in the Scripture called the
Moral Law; but by Divine Writers they are ſo called <hi>a morando,</hi>
becauſe they were and are to continue a rule of righteouſneſs and
obedience to the Church and people of God to the end of the
world; and they are ſaid to be moral, not ſimply and abſolutely,
but ſynecdochically, or in ſome reſpect only; and therefore in the
Ten Commandments rightly to underſtand them, we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103608:4"/>
two things: Firſt, The ſubſtance of every Commandment:
And Secondly, The circumſtances of every Commandment. Now
the ſubſtance of every Commandment is moral, of perpetual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and knowable by the Light of Nature or Reaſon in man
fallen; but the circumſtances are poſitive, and depend upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
or Gods poſitive Commands expreſſed in the Scripture.
This is true of every one of the Ten Commandments; I ſhall
inſtance only in two of them, which will give light to all the reſt:
I ſhall inſtance in the Second and Fourth Commandments. Firſt,
The Second Commandment concerneth the outward Worſhip of
God; now the morality or ſubſtance of this Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is this, Thou ſhalt outwardly worſhip the Lord thy God
only by ſuch ways and duties as he ſhall command and appoint.
And this may be known to fallen man by the light of Reaſon; for
that doth dictate to him, that there is a God, and that God is to
be worſhipped, and that he is to be worſhipped only by ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ways and means, as he ſhall command and appoint: but for
the circumſtances of this Commandment, namely, the particular
duties and ordinances by which God will be outwardly worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
they depend wholly upon Revelation, and the poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God; for all the duties of worſhip commanded of God
both in the Old and New Teſtament, are to be referred to the
Second Commandment. So the ſubſtance or morality of the
Fourth Commandment, is contained in theſe words only, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Sabbath-day to keep it holy;</hi> that is, Thou ſhalt keep
holy that day of Reſt which I do appoint; and this alſo the light
of Reaſon may dictate, That it belongeth to God only to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
and appoint to his people a day of holy Reſt; and all the
other words expreſſed in this Commandment, are but circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
and depend upon Revelation; as the appointing the Seventh
day from the Creation to be the day of holy Reſt to the people of
God before Chriſt, was by poſitive command of God; for <hi>Adam</hi>
in the eſtate of innocency could not know by his concreated light,
that God would finiſh his work of Creation in ſix days; and yet
God doth make that the ground of his inſtituting the Seventh day
to be the day of holy Reſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. much leſs could it be known
by the light of Nature or Reaſon in man fallen: We read of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi>
that great Philoſpher, who did excel in the light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that he affirmed that the World had no beginning; and the
Scripture ſaith expreſly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3, <hi>By faith we underſtand that</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:103608:4"/>
               <hi>the worlds were framed by the word of God;</hi> and that which we
underſtand by faith, we know by revelation only, which is the
ground of faith; and the Seventh day being a created time as
well as the other ſix days, could not be a holy time to fallen man,
but by Gods ſpecial and poſitive Command and Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>2. A ſecond thing to be conſidered for the right underſtanding
of the Doctrine of the Sabbath, is this, That the Seventh day
from the Creation appointed of God to be the Sabbath or day of
holy Reſt to the people of God before Chriſts incarnation, being
but the poſitive part of the Fourth Commandment, did ceaſe and
end as a holy Sabbath at the time of Chriſts reſurrection from
the dead; the reaſon is, Becauſe though it was primarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of God to be ſo obſerved; yet afterwards a typical ſenſe
and uſe was by <hi>Moſes</hi> from God added to it; as Circumciſion
and the Paſsover, they were inſtituted to be the ordinary Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
belonging to the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> and were both ſeals
of the Covenant of Grace; the firſt of Initiation, the other of
confirmation and growth; yet being alſo uſed as typical during
the legal adminiſtration, they both ceaſed with the Ceremonial
Law; and in the room of them Chriſt ordained Baptiſm and the
Lords Supper to be the only Sacraments to all Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in time of the Goſpel. So the Seventh day from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it was primarily by a poſitive command of God ſet apart to be
the Jews weekly holy Sabbath; yet it came to be uſed alſo as ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical,
to ſignifie to the faithful their ſpiritual reſt in Chriſt in this
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ife, and their eternal reſt by and with Chriſt in Heaven, as <hi>Exod.</hi>
31. 13, <hi>Verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep; for it is a ſign betwixt me
and you throughout your generations;</hi> which is meant alſo of the
Seventh-day-Sabbath, as is evident in <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15, 16; and in
<hi>ver.</hi> 17, <hi>It is a ſign between me and the children of Iſrael for ever:</hi>
and it is reckoned up amongſt the other Jewiſh Feſtival Sabbaths
in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 2, and in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17, <hi>which are a ſhadow of things
to come, but the body is Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 9. <hi>There remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
therefore a Sabbatiſm to the people of God;</hi> and it is evident that
this Sabbatiſm was typified by the Seventh-day-Sabbath in <hi>ver.</hi> 4.
And from theſe Scriptures it muſt be granted, That God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Reſt of the Seventh-day not only as a ſanctified time of
his Worſhip publick and private, but alſo as a ſanctified ſign of
mans reſting on the Seed of the Woman, and of his eternal Reſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103608:5"/>
in Heaven; and therefore as ſoon as the Seed of the Woman had
finiſhed his Sacrifice, and was riſen from the dead, the holy Reſt
of the Seventh-day ceaſed, as did all the other types of <hi>Moſes</hi> his
Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11; and in the room of it was appointed by
Chriſt the Firſt day of the week. For to deny that God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
another day to be the day of holy Reſt to Chriſtians in
the time of the Goſpel, is to deny the Moral part of the Fourth
Commandment.</p>
            <p>3. A third thing therefore to be conſidered for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of the Doctrine of the Sabbath is this, That upon
the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, God did appoint the
Firſt day of the week to be the day of holy Reſt to the Churches
of Chriſt to the end of the world; which yet in his great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is ſo contrived, that the weekly return of it is but one day
in ſeven, that ſtill man may have ſix days for his labour, and God
may have the Seventh-day to be his holy Sabbath, and this by
virtue of the moral part of the Fourth Commandment, and that
expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath-day;</hi>
that is, the day that I ſhall appoint by poſi<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ive Command
to be my holy Sabbath-day: Now that God hath appointed the
Firſt day of the week, it being the Eight from the Creation, and
the Seventh day from the Reſurrection of Chriſt, to be the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Sabbath, hath been, and may be made evident to any one,
who can but ſo far deny himſelf, as to think that he may err and
be miſtaken in his opinion, and is reſolved to receive the truth
whenſoever and by whomſoever it ſhall be made manifeſt to him
from the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Now for the proof of this Third particular, conſider, that the
Seventh day from the Creation being appointed of God by poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
command the day of holy Reſt to the Jews; and that day
being alſo made typical, and ſo ceaſed, as hath been already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
it was neceſſary from the moral part of the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
that God ſhould appoint another day for his holy
Sabbath, inſtead of the Seventh day from the Creation; for God
only can ſo ſet apart and ſanctifie a Sabbath day as to bind the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as well as the outward man to be holily exerciſed all that
day, as it is expreſſed in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13, 14. Now that the Firſt day
of the week is appointed and ordained of God to be the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
holy Sabbath-day, is ſufficiently evidenced by theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:103608:5"/>
1. That the eight day from the Creation, being the day of
Chriſts reſurrection from the dead, is very eminent and famous in
the Old Teſtament before the time of Chriſt his incarnation; as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
1. No creature was allowed for ſacrifice until it was eight days
old, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 27, 30. 2. The Law of Circumciſion was ſtrictly
tied to the eight day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12, and in divers other places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
3. The perſons of the Prieſts were not perfectly conſecrated to
miniſter in their Office, until the eighth day, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 33, and 9. 1.
4. The leprous perſon was not perfectly cleanſed until the eight
day, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 10; nor the polluted <hi>Nazarite,</hi> Numb. 6. 10. 5. The
laſt and great day of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, was on the eight
day, which was a Sabbath-day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37: and all this to typifie
the eminency of the Reſurrection-day of Chriſt, even above the
Seventh from the Creation; and all this did clearly intimate and
imply, that God would at Chriſts reſurrection take off the Crown
of honour from the Seventh day, and ſet it upon the head of the
Eight day, the day of his Son's reſurrection from the dead, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
then finiſhed the great work of man's Redemption.</p>
            <p>2. It is evident by Scripture, that it hath been Gods frequent
practice to ſet a character or mark of remembrance and honour
upon his moſt conſiderable works and actions, by ſetting apart a
ſet and ſolemn time to be piouſly obſerved and kept upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
As for his other great works, he commanded only an
yearly ſolemnity, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 42, and chap. 13. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in <hi>Heſt.</hi>
9. 20. But the great work of the Creation God would have to be
remembred and honoured by a weekly ſolemnity, by ſetting apart
and ſanctifying the Seventh day from the Creation to be obſerved
in the weekly return of it, as his holy Sabbath, or day of Holy
Reſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. And can we reaſonably imagine, that Gods Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
Acquieſcence and Reſt, in raiſing his Son, his only begotten
Son, from the dead, having finiſhed the great work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a greater and a more glorious work than that of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of a more dear and precious reſentment to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that yet this wonderful and bleſſed work, the very admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Angels, ſhould not be honoured with a day of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
as frequent, as ſolemn, as ſacred, and by Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
as the other was, how can it but ſeem very ſtrange to
a conſiderate, believing, and redeemed Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>3. The Lord Jeſus himſelf began to celebrate and ſolemnize
the individual day of his Reſurrection, by an holy and heavenly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103608:6"/>
conference with two of his Diſciples as they were going from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Luk. 24. 30; <hi>And behold two of them went the
ſame day;</hi> the Evangeliſt gives ſpecial notice of the day: and the
ſame day he did adminiſter the Sacrament of the Supper to them:
Ver. 30, <hi>And it came to paſs as he ſate at meat with them,</hi> &amp;c. You
ſee that they were then eating; <hi>and then he took the bread, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it, and brake it, and gave it to them;</hi> theſe words he uſeth only
in the adminiſtration of the Holy Supper. <hi>Now the ſame hour</hi> ſaith
the Evangeliſt) <hi>they returned again to Jeruſalem, and found the
eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</hi> ver. 33, &amp;c.
and <hi>ver.</hi> 36, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now why did the Holy Ghoſt give ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
notice of the day, to be the ſame day, the eight day, the
firſt day of the week, the day of his reſurrection from the dead,
<hi>ver.</hi> 1, but to ſignifie that Chriſt on that day began to ſanctifie the
day of his reſurrection in religious exerciſes, to lead the way to
all that ſhould believe in him to do the like. Now beſide this,
Chriſt made two other appearances, and each of them was on
the firſt day of the week, the day in which he roſe again from the
dead, not mentioning any thing ſpoken or done by him the ſix
days between; and why all this, but to put a mark of ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
and honour on this day, the firſt day of the week,
it being now to become the holy Sabbath-day to all Chriſtian
Churches to the end of the world; and it is very obſervable,
that after Chriſts reſurrection, and before his aſcenſion, he ſpake
to his Diſciples of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of
God, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3, that is, what the Apoſtles were afterwards to do
in the Church of God, both in reſpect of Government, and
Preaching, and Writing; and then commands them that they
ſhould not depart from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but wait for the promiſe of the
Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 4; which they did, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. Now the
day on which the Holy Ghoſt was ſent from Heaven, and fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Apoſtles in that miraculous manner, was the firſt day of
the week, as is evident from the computation of the days of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,</hi>
which are here ſaid to have been fully come (or fulfilled),
<hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>4. It was afterwards the practice of the Saints in the Apoſtles
days, to ſolemnize the Firſt day of the week in a religious aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of themſelves for Sabbath duties and exerciſes; as <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7.
<hi>And upon the firſt day of the week, when the Diſciples came together
to break bread</hi> (meaning, after their uſual and accuſtomed manner)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103608:6"/>
               <hi>Paul preached unto them,</hi> &amp;c. and in 1 Cor 16. 1, 2, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt day
of the week, when ye are met together;</hi> namely, according to your
uſual cuſtom: and in both theſe places, the exact notation of the
day, the firſt day of the week, did denote to them, that this was
and ought to be the day to be kept by Chriſtians for their weekly
Sabbath; for the Apoſtles had greatly ſinned, and cauſed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Churches to have ſinned, if they had not direction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from Chriſt to obſerve that day of the week holy, as being
now the Chriſtian Sabbath, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14. 37, and the other aboliſhed
by Chriſt, as hath been already proved.</p>
            <p>5. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John, I was in the ſpirit on the
Lords day,</hi> this cannot be meant of the Seventh-day-Sabbath, for
it was above fifty years after Chriſts reſurrection when the Apoſtle
<hi>John</hi> wrote to the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and then the Seventh-day-Sabbath
was generally laid aſide by Chriſtians, and the firſt day
of the week, the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, was generally obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and kept by them inſtead of it; and therefore this title was by
the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> given to that day, without any circumſtance, as
that which was familiarly known, and grown in frequent uſe and
practice in all the Chriſtian Churches. And as Chriſt ordained the
Holy Supper inſtead of the Paſsover, and therefore ſtiled by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi> The Lords Supper; ſo becauſe Chriſt ordained the day
of his Reſurrection to be the Chriſtians day of Holy Reſt, inſtead
of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Seventh-day-Sabbath; therefore it is ſtiled by the
Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> The Lords Day.</p>
            <p>6. Ever ſince the Apoſtles time, the Firſt day of the week, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the day of Chriſts Reſurrection hath been generally obſerved
&amp; kept as the Chriſtian Sabbath in all Chriſtian Churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all ſucceeding Ages, unto this day. Now that they all ſhould
live and dye in an erroneous &amp; ſinful practice, without repentance,
ſo much controverted, and an inconſiderable party of them, much
inferior to multitudes of them both in Learning, Parts, Gifts, and
Spiritual Grace and Holineſs, ſhould yet only be in the right, who
hold the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath, the Seventh day from the Creation, to be
ſtill in force, and accordingly do obſerve and keep it, contrary to
the declared judgment and practice of all other Chriſtians, cannot
be thought but to proceed either from ignorance, or from pride,
or from both, one or both of theſe having been the root and cauſe
of all the Schiſms, and Errors, and Hereſies, which do, or ever
have diſquieted and diſturbed the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
