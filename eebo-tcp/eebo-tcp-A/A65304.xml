            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He prescribes a Gospel-pil, &amp; dips

a Copy to all the Ministers of Christ.
Their hearts must be fired not with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36750:6"/>
heat of passion, but love towards
their people. They are Christs am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
and must come with an
olive-branch of peace in their
mouths. <hi>If I speak with the tongue
of Angels, and have not love, I am as
sounding brasse, and a tinckling Cymbal,
1 Cor. 13. 1.</hi> 'Tis better to love as a
Pastor, then speak as an Angel. Love
is that <hi>flos deliciarum,</hi> that flower of
delight which should grow in the
heart, and send forth its perfume in
the lips of every Minister. 'Twas said
of <hi>Origen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Magdebur. ceut. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Cujus ex ore non tam verba

do most good; the more they are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; knotty
hearts will be soonest wrought upon
by love; the fire will go where the

being hard and stiff, the rubbing them

way to supple an hard heart, and make

               <hi>work out your own salvation with

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
your own salvation. Thirdly, the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
or the manner how we should
work it out, <hi>Cum timore &amp; tremore,</hi>
with fear and trembling. I shall speak
principally of the two first, and draw
in the other briefly in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
            <p>The Proposition is this,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>That it
should be a Christians great work to be
working out his salvation.</hi> The great
God hath put us into the world as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>That which is in the Text, called
<hi>working,</hi> hath various appellations in
Scripure. First, Sometimes it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Striving, Luk. 13. 29. Strive to

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: strive
as in an agony, or bloody sweat.
Secondly, sometimes it is called
<hi>Seeking, Mat. 6. 33. Seek ye first the
Kingdome of God,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. As a man that
hath lost a treasure, seeks diligently
for it. We have lost salvation. <hi>Adam</hi>
by eating the tree of knowledge, lost
the tree of life. Now <hi>seek,</hi> take <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
candle and lanthorn, and search
for salvation. The word <hi>seek,</hi> (as a
learned writer notes) signifies to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
a thing with inflamed desires,<note place="margin">Rem acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimè expc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere. <hi>Beza.</hi>
               </note> as a
condemned man desires a pardon.
Thirdly, Sometimes it is called <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in a race, 1 Cor. 9. 24.</hi> So <hi>run
that ye may obtaine,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

Apostle seemes to allude to the
games of <hi>Olympus,</hi> which were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
every fifth year in the honor
of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> in those games they did put
forth all their strength. Whence that
phrase, <hi>pulvere Olympico desudare.</hi> 'Tis

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36750:8"/>
hinder you in the race, and reach for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with a winged swiftnesse to lay
hold upon the mark. Fourthly,
Sometimes it is called <hi>offering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
to Heaven, <hi>Matthew 11. 12. The
Kingdome of Heaven suffers violence.</hi>
There must not only be <hi>diligence,</hi> but
<hi>violence;</hi> we must not only pray, but
pray <hi>fervently, Jam. 5. 16.</hi> not only
repent, but <hi>be Zealous and repent, Rev.
3. 19.</hi> not onely love, but <hi>be sick of
love, Cant. 2. 5.</hi> This is offering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

going down of the sun</hi> of our life.<note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 6. 14.</note> Now
this difficulty about the work of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
will appear four manner of
wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, from the <hi>nature</hi> of the work.<note place="margin">Ex natura operis.</note>
There is a metamorphosis to be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wrought. 1. <hi>The heart is to be changed.</hi>
The heart is the very nursery of sin.<note n="*" place="margin">Fomes peccati. <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </note>
'Tis the magazine where all the weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Hell. The heart is full of antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
against God,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1. 30.</note> It is angry with
converting grace; now that the byasse
of the heart should be changed, what
a work is this!<note n="*" place="margin">Quanto agone opus est, quantis vigiliis &amp; lachrymis.</note> How should we beg
of Christ, that he who turned the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet
into wine, would turn the water,
or rather poison of nature into the
wine of grace?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>The current of the life is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36750:9"/>
to be altered.</hi> That the Tyde of sin,
which before did runne so strong,
should be turned, this is not easie.
That the sinner which before was
failing hel ward, and wanted neither
winde nor tyed to carry him, should
now alter his course, and sail to a
new port, <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus,</hi> this is a
work indeed. The water may easily
be dam'd up, but no art or industry
can make it run backward in its own
channel. It was by a miracle that the
River <hi>Jordan</hi> was driven back. To
see the earthly man become heavenly;
to see a sinner move contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the wayes of Christ and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is as strange as to see the earth
fly upward, or the bowl run contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to it's own byasse.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly,<note place="margin">Ex fallacia operis.</note> salvation-work is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
in regard of the <hi>deceits</hi> about the
work. The heart is ready to take ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
false stiches in this work of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It hath the heart of self-deceit;
like those that can cog a Die; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36750:10"/>
               <hi>Austin</hi> cryes out,<note place="margin">Grande profundum est homo. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The heart is a
great deep.</hi> The heart is apt to deceive
about this work of salvation 2 ways.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, It will often make a man take
<hi>morality</hi> for <hi>grace.</hi> Alas, morality is
but nature refined, old <hi>Adam</hi> put in
a better dress. A moraliz'd man is but
a tame devil. There may be a fair
stream of civility running, and yet
much vermin of pride and Atheisme
lie at the bottom; The garnishment
of moral excellencies is but the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a garland of flowers upon a dead
man. How easie is it to be deceived
in the businesse of salvation, and with
<hi>Ixion</hi> to embrace a cloud instead of
<hi>Juno?</hi> Civility is not grace, though it
be a good wall to plant the vine of
grace against.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The heart will be ready
to deceive us in this work of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and make us take <hi>a shew of grace</hi>
for grace. <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, there is a <hi>Beryl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi>
resembles the true Diamond.
So there is something that looks like
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36750:10"/>
grace, which is not; There are two gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which help much to the working
out salvation, and we are soon decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in them. First, <hi>Repentance.</hi> True
Repentance is when we weep for sin
<hi>quatenus</hi> sinne; when we weep for it
as it is a defiling thing, it blots the
Image of God, staines the virginity
of the soul; as it is an act of unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it is a kicking against the breasts
that give us milk: but how easie is it
to prevaricate in this? 1. Many think
they repent, when it is not the <hi>offence,</hi>
but the <hi>penalty</hi> troubles them; not the
Treason, but the bloody axe. 2. They
think they repent when they shed a
few tears; but though this ice begins
to melt a little, it freezeth again; they
go on still in sinne; many weep for
their unkind dealings with God, as
<hi>Saul</hi> did for his unkindness to <hi>David;
He said to David, thou art more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then I; for thou hast rewarded me
good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil:</hi>
1 Sam. 24. 17. <hi>And he lift up his voice
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36750:11"/>
and wept, ver.</hi> 16. But for all this
he followes <hi>David</hi> again, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
after him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>So men can lift up their
voice and weep</hi> for sinne, yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their sinnes again.<note n="*" place="margin">Ille vere plangit commissa, qui non committit plangenda. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
others forsake sinne; but still
they retain the love of it in
their hearts. Like the Snake that
casts the coat, but keeps the sting;
There is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
false and true tears, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
channel water and spring
water.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Another grace condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to salvation, is <hi>faith;</hi> but how
easily are men cozened with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
pearl? There is this deceit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
faith, when men apply the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi>
of the Word, but not the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Fides non <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ligit obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum.</note>
the promise is <hi>salvation,</hi> the
precept is <hi>working out;</hi> They will
take the one, but not the other: as
if a Physician should prescribe two
receipts to his Patient, a Pill and a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36750:11"/>
Julip, he will take the Julip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is pleasant, but not the
Pill: Many will take Christ as a
<hi>Saviour,</hi> but refuse him as a <hi>Prince;</hi>
receive his <hi>benefits,</hi> but not submit
to his <hi>Lawes;</hi> This is to <hi>put asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what God hath joined together.</hi>
There being therefore such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
and deceits about this work
of salvation, we had need be the
more cautious, and curious in this
work.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ex impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditione operis.</note> the difficulty about sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation-work
ariseth from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moraes
and hindrances of this

            <p>1. <hi>From within, viz.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:36750:12"/>
2. We meet with hindrances in
this work <hi>from without.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Ab extra</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Tentations;</hi> our whole life, saith

Salvation, and make it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Reproaches; this sect is every
where spoken against,</hi> Act. 28. 22. The
old Serpent is ever spitting his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
at Religion, and the professors
of it. I may allude to that, 1 <hi>Cor</hi>
10. 1. <hi>All our fathers were under
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36750:12"/>
cloud:</hi> All the Saints of old have
passed to Heaven under a cloud of
contumely and reproach; the world
puts them in their black book,
whom God will put in his Rubrick:
The throat of the wicked is <hi>an open
Sopulchre</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 3. 13.</note>, to bury the good names
of professors in. Those who have
been the <hi>antesignani,</hi> the ensign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers
of Religion, and have carried
her colours,</p>
            <p>1. Sometimes have been <hi>tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>
and slandered. <hi>Paul</hi> was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a <hi>seditious</hi> man, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9.
The Popish Rhemists traduced <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi>
and fathered upon him this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that <hi>God was the Authour of
sinne,</hi> and that he died cursing;
though <hi>Beza,</hi> who was an eye-witness,
and wrote his life and death, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that slander, and relates what a
comfortable end he made: <hi>Martin
Bucer,</hi> that blessed man, who cried
out, in an holy triumph, <hi>I am Christs,
and the devil hath nothing to do with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36750:13"/>
me;</hi> yet the Papists slanderously
report of him, that he should deny
Christ to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> come in the
flesh; but he who was the Orator
at his Funeral, was his compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
The like slander did the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
in <hi>Burgundia</hi> raise of <hi>Beza,</hi> that
holy man; they say, that he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
death to be at hand, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his former profession of the
Gospel, and was perfectly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This
was so false, that <hi>Beza,</hi> who lived
after the slander went abroad, did
himself with great indignation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it.</p>
            <p>2. Sometimes the Saints have had
the <hi>trial of cruel mockings,</hi> Heb. 11. 36.
<hi>Cyprian</hi> was called in a jeer <hi>Copri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
Athanasius, Satanasius; David</hi>
was the <hi>song of the drunkards,</hi> Psal.
69. 12. I doubt not but <hi>Noah</hi> had
many a bitter taunt when he was
building the Ark so many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the flood, they would laugh at
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36750:13"/>
him, and censure him for an old do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
fool, that would be wiser than
all the world besides. Thus when
we see the flood of Gods wrath
coming upon the world, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to build the Ark, and <hi>work out
salvation,</hi> men will be venting their
scorne and derision: What? you
will be holier than others, more
precise than needs? all this serves
to retard salvation work, and make
it difficult.</p>
            <p>3. A third <hi>remora</hi> or hindrance in
this work is <hi>open violence;</hi> Gal. 4. 29.
<hi>as he that was borne after the flesh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
him that was born after the
Spirit, even so it is now;</hi> no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
doth a man give up his name to
Christ, and seriously set upon the
working out his salvation, but the
world raiseth her train-bands, and
sets all the Militia of hell against
him. Gods Church is like <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
ram</hi> tied in a bush of thornes;
witnesse the ten persecutions in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36750:14"/>
time of <hi>Nero, Domitian, Trajan, &amp;c.</hi>
a man strictly holy is the white that
is shot at; if the worlds musick will
not prevaile, it hath its furnace rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. be assured, Christ
and his crosse are never parted. It
is with us in our building for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as it was with the Jews in their
building the wall. <hi>Every one with
one of his hands wrought in the work,
and with the other hand held a weapon,</hi>
Nehem. 4. 17. So we must not only
be <hi>builders,</hi> but <hi>warriers;</hi> with one
hand we must work, and with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand hold a weapon, <hi>viz. the
sword of the Spirit,</hi> and fight the <hi>good
fight of faith;</hi> this is another hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
in the work; no sooner do
we begin to set out for heaven, but
<hi>bonds and afflictions abide us,</hi> Acts
20. 23. The world sounds an alarum,
and no cessation of armes till
death.</p>
            <p>4. That which makes salvation-work

When the wheeles of the soul are

moves in the way of Religion with
facility and alacrity. A childe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in obeying his father; it was
<hi>Pauls</hi> heaven to serve God. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the Law of God in the inner

is the soul carried upon those wings!
Christs service is freedome; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle calls it, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
a <hi>Law of liberty,</hi> Jam. 1. 25.
To serve God, to love God, to enjoy
God, is the sweetest liberty in the
world; Christ doth not, as <hi>Pharaoh
make his people serve with rigor,</hi> Exod
1. 13. but he layes upon them the
<hi>constraints of love, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 14. His
precepts are not burdens, but privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
not fetters, but ornaments.
Thus his yoak is easie, but to an un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>regenerate
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36750:16"/>
man the yoak hath a nail
in it, it galls and vexeth<note n="*" place="margin">Psal 2. 3.</note>; nay, so
far as corruption prevails, the best
heart findes some reluctancy. And
so much for the first reason, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the work.</p>
            <p>The second Reason why we must
put forth so much holy sweat and
industry about salvation,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> is, because
of the <hi>rareness</hi> of this work; <hi>but
few shall be saved;</hi> therefore we had
need work the harder, that we may
be in the number of these few. The
way to hell is a road way; the cawsey
of it is paved with riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
it hath a golden cawsey, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there are daily so many travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in it; but the way to heaven lies
out of the road, 'tis an unbeaten
path, and few can finde it<note n="*" place="margin">Non cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git adire Corinthum.</note> the criers
up of universal grace, say, that Christ
died intentionally for all; but then,
why are not all saved? can Christ be
frustrate of his intention? Some are
so grosse to aver that all shall actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36750:17"/>
be saved: But hath not our
Lord Christ told us, <hi>That the gate is
straite, and few there be that finde it?
Mat.</hi> 7. 14. how all can go in at this
gate, and yet but few find it, seems to
me a Paradox. The drove of men
goes to the shambles; <hi>but a remnant
shall be saved,</hi> Rom. 9. 27. The whole
diece is cut off and goes to the devil,
a remnant only saved; most of the
world are wind-falls. That <hi>olive-tree,</hi>
Is. 17. 6. <hi>with two or three</hi> olive-berries
on the top of the uppermost <hi>bough</hi>
may be a fit emblem of the paucity of
those that shal be saved. Satan goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with the harvest, God hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a few gleanings. In this great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if it should go by vote and by
pole, the devil would carry it. Some
of the learned observe<note n="*" place="margin">Brerew. enquir.</note>, that divide
the world into thirty equal parts,
nineteen of those thirty are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
with Heathenish idolatry, six
of the eleven remaining with the
doctrine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> so that there
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36750:17"/>
remaines but five parts of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
where is any thing of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
among those Christians so many
seduced Papists on one hand, and
formal Protestants on the other,
that surely but few are saved. It
being thus, it should make us strive
the more, <hi>tanquam pulvere olympico,</hi>
that we may be of the number of
those few who shall inherit salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third Reason why we should
put forth so much vigor about the
work of salvation, is, because of the
possibility of the work. Impossibility
kills all endeavour; Who will take
pains for that which he thinks there
is no hope ever of obtaining? but
<hi>there is hope in Israel concerning this</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ezr. 10. 2</note>
Salvation is a thing feasible, it may
be had; O Christians, though the

gate is <hi>open.</hi> 'Tis shut against the

               <hi>Basil</hi> compares

of, which is burn'd with the wrath of
God, and this shall be the drunkards
cup.</p>
            <p>2. Swearers: these swear away
their salvation. The Swearer it
seemes hath but bad credit; he must
stake down an oath, or none will
trust him; but let him remember,
he runnes his soul into a Praemunire.
<hi>Swear not at all</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5. 34</note>; If we must give an
account for <hi>idle words,</hi> shall not idle
oaths be put in the count-book?
When the <hi>scab</hi> breaketh forth <hi>in the
lip,</hi> that man is to be pronounced
<hi>unclean.</hi> Every oath is a wound gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the soul, and every wound
hath a mouth to cry to Heaven for
vengeance. Some are boil'd up to
that height of wickednesse, that like
mad dogs, they flie in the face of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36750:22"/>
Heaven by <hi>cursing;</hi> and let a Minister
tell them of their sinne, let him but
go about to bring them home again,
as the Law did provide one should
bring home his neighbours Asse
when he went astray<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 23. 4.</note>, and they
will kick against the reproof. Like
lime, by pouring on the water of a
reprehension, they are the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.
These are upon the spur
to damnation; but I will not touch
this pitch any longer.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Adulterers;</hi> the adulterers heart
like the swearers tongue, <hi>is set on fire
of hell.</hi> Creatures void of reason
will rise up in judgement against
such. 'Tis reported of the <hi>Stork</hi>
(that chaste creature) that it confines it
self to its own nest; and if any of the
Storks leaving his own mate, joynes
with any other, the rest fall upon
him, and pluck his feathers from him.
God would have the adulterer put to
death, <hi>Deut. 22. 22. Gregory</hi> observes
concerning the stream of fire and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36750:23"/>
brimstone poured upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> God
sent that noisome plague to let them
see the filthinesse of their sinne. This
sinne of adultery is a <hi>soul-damning</hi>
sinne, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9.</hi> the adulterer like
the flie, doth so long flie about the
candle, that at last he singeth his
soul. This sinne, though it begins
<hi>Comical,</hi> it ends <hi>Tragical;</hi> will it not
be <hi>bitterness in the end?</hi> 2 Sam. 2. 26.

so is he who neglects the time

which lie in the way.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">Object. 1</note> You bid us work out

himself to his own converting,

its own softning. But yet when God

               <hi>Answ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Yet use the means. Though
you cannot work <hi>spiritually,</hi> yet
work <hi>physically;</hi> do what you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that for two reasons.</p>
            <p>1. Because a man by neglecting
the means, doth destroy himself. As
a man by not sending to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
may be said to be the cause of
his own death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is not wanting to
us when we do what we are able.
Urge the Promise, <hi>Seek and ye shall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36750:28"/>
find,</hi> Mat. 7. 7. Put this bond in
suit by Prayer; you say you have no
power, but have you not a Promise?
Act so far as you can. Though I
dare not say as the <hi>Arminian,</hi> when
we do exert and put forth nature,
God is bound to give grace; yet this
I say, <hi>Deus volentibus non deest,</hi> God
is not wanting to them that seek his
grace; Nay, I will say more, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
his grace to none but them that
wilfully refuse it<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 5. 40</note>.</p>
            <p>The second Objection is this;<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note>
but to what purpose should I work?
there's a decree past, if God hath
decreed I shall be saved, I shall be
saved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> God decrees salvation in a
way of working<note n="*" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 13.</note>. <hi>Origen</hi> in his book
against <hi>Celsus,</hi> observes a subtil Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of some who disputed about
<hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Destiny.</hi> One gave counsel
to his sick friend not to send for the
Physician, because (saith he) it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by destiny whether thou
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36750:28"/>
shalt recover or not. If it be thy
destiny to recover, then thou needest
not the Physician; if it be not thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny,
then the Physician will do thee
no good: The like fallacy doth the
Devil use to men; he bids them not
work; if God hath decreed they shall
be saved, they shall be saved, and
there is no need of working; if he hath
not decreed their salvation, then their
working will do them no good; this
is an Argument fetched out of the
Devils topicks. But we say God
decrees the end in the use of meanes;
God did decree that <hi>Isarel</hi> should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but first they must
fight with the sonnes of <hi>Anak.</hi> God
decreed that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> should recover
out of his sicknesse, but let him lay a
fig to the boyl, <hi>Isa. 38. 21.</hi> We
do not argue thus in other things.
A man doth not say, if God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
I shall have a crop this year I
shall have a crop. What need I
plough, or sow, or manure the land?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36750:29"/>
No, he will use the means, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a Crop. Though <hi>the blessing of
the Lord makes rich,</hi> Prov. 10. 22. Yet
it is as true, <hi>the diligent hand makes
rich,</hi> Prov. 10. 4. Gods <hi>decreeing</hi> is
carried on by our <hi>working.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus having removed these
Objections out of the way, let me now
perswade you to set upon this blessed
work, the working out <hi>your salvation;</hi>
and that my words may the better
prevail, I shall propound several Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by way of Motive to excite
you to this work.</p>
            <p>The first Argument or Motive to
<hi>working,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> is taken from the precious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

pains that we may secure this from
danger. The soul is a divine sparkle
kindled by the breath of God. It
doth out-ballance the world, <hi>Mat.

God (as <hi>Origen</hi> calls it) the soul is the
<hi>Image</hi> of God. <hi>Plato</hi> calls the soul a
glasse of the Trinity. 'Tis a bright

soul, (this soul for which God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Councel in heaven when he
made it<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 1. 26</note>,) should miscarry and be
undone to all eternity? who would

            <p>3. Working out salvation is that
which will make death and heaven
sweet to us.</p>
            <p>1. It will sweeten <hi>death.</hi> He that
hath been hard at work all day, how
quietly doth he sleep at night? you

               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">

souls to Christ. Oh improve your
season; this is your seed-time, now
sowe the seeds of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
If when you have seasons,
you want hearts; the time may come
when you have hearts, you shall
want seasons. Take time while you
may; the Mariner hoists up his
sailes while the winde blows; never
had a people a fairer gale for heaven
than you of this City, and will you
not set forward in your voyage?
What riding is there to the Tearm,
I warrant you the Lawyer will not
lose his Term? Oh my brethren,
now is the Tearm-time for your
souls, now plead with God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or at least get Christ to plead for
you.</p>
            <p>Think seriously of these foure
things.</p>
            <p>First, our life doth unravel apace.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <note place="margin">* Vita ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis est similis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viganti, <hi>&amp;c. Greg.</hi>

               <hi>Gregory</hi> compares our life to the
mariner in a ship going full saile;
We are every day sailing apace to
eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:36750:32"/>
Secondly, The seasons of grace
though they are precious, yet not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.
Abused mercies will, like
<hi>Noahs dove,</hi> take their wings and fly
from us. <hi>Englands</hi> golden houre
will soon run out; Gospel-bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
are very sweet, but very swift.
<hi>Now they are hid from thine eyes,
Luk. 19 42.</hi> We know not how soon
the <hi>Golden Candlestick</hi> may remove.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a time when the
spirit hath done striving.<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 6. 3</note> There are
certain spring-tydes of the spirit, and
these being neglected, possibly we
may never see another tide come in.
When <hi>conscience</hi> hath done speaking,
usually the <hi>spirit</hi> hath done striving.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the losse of Gospel-op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunityes
will be the hell of hell.
When a sinner shall at the last day
think with himself, O what I might
have been! I might have been as rich
as the Angels, as rich as heaven could
make me. I had a season to work in,
but I lost it.<note n="*" place="margin">Pessimum istud vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habuisse <hi>Plautus.</hi>
               </note>This, This, will be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36750:32"/>
as a vulture gnawing upon him, this
will inhance, and accent his misery.
And let all this perswade you speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to work out your salvation.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, you may do this work
and not hinder your other work;
working out salvation and working
in a calling are not inconsistent.
And this I insert to prevent an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
Some may say, but if I
work so hard for heaven I shall have
no time for my trade. No sure, the
wise God would never make any of
his commands to interfere; as he
would have you <hi>seek his Kingdom,
Mat. 6. 33.</hi> so he would have you
<hi>provide for your family, 1 Tim. 5. 8.</hi> you
may drive two trades together. I like
not those that make the <hi>Church</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the <hi>shop,</hi> that swallow up all
their time in hearing, but neglect
their <hi>work at home.</hi>

They are like the Lillies of the field
<hi>which toile not, neither do they spin.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 6. 28</note>
God never sealed warrants to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36750:33"/>
He, both commands and
commends diligence in a calling.
Which may the rather encourage us
to look after salvation, because this
work will not take us off our other
work. A man may with <hi>Caleb fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
God fully, Numb. 14. 34.</hi> and yet
with <hi>David follow the ewes great with
young;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 78. 71.</note> Piety and industry
may dwell together.</p>
            <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Arg. 6.</note> The inexcusablenesse of
those that neglect working out their
salvation. Methinks I hear God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulating
the case with men at the
last day, after this manner, <hi>why did ye
not work?</hi> I gave you time to work,
I gave you light to work by, I gave
you my Gospel, my Spirit, my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
I bestowed Talents upon
you to trade, I set <hi>the recompence of
reward</hi> before you, why did ye not
work out your salvation? Either
it must be <hi>sloath or stubbornesse.</hi> Was
there any work ye did of greater
concernment? You could work in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36750:33"/>
brick, but not in gold; What can
you say for your selves why the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
should not passe? Oh how will
the sinner be left speechlesse at such a
time, and how will this cut him to
the heart to think with himselfe he
neglected salvation, and could give
no reason for it.</p>
            <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Arg. 7.</note> the unexpressible mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of such as do not work out salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Those that sleep in spring; shall
beg in harvest; After death, when
they look to receive a full Crop of
glory, they will be put to beg, as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
for one drop of water.</hi> Vagrant
persons that will not work, are sent to
the house of correction: Such as will
not work out salvation, let them
know hell is Gods house of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
that they must be sent
to.</p>
            <p>If all this doth not prevaile,<note place="margin">Arg. 8.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
lastly what it is we are working
for, none will take paines for a trifle;
We are working for a Crown, for a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36750:34"/>
Throne, for a Paradise,<note n="*" place="margin">

               </note>and all
this is comprized in that one word
<hi>salvation.</hi> Here is a <hi>whet-stone</hi> to
industry. All men desire salvation.
'Tis the Crown of our hopes; We
should not think any labour too much
for this.<note n="*" place="margin">Nullus labor durus nullu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus longum quo aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur. <hi>Hierom.</hi>
               </note>What paines will men
take for earthly Crowns and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters!
And suppose the Kingdomes
of the world were more illustrious
then they are, their foundations of
Gold, their walls of pearl, their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of Saphire, what were all this to
that Kingdom we are labouring for?
We may as well span the firmament,
as set forth this in all its splendor, and
magnificence. <hi>Salvation</hi> is a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
thing, it is as far above our
thoughts as it is beyond our deserts.
Oh how should this add wings to our
endeavours! The merchant will
run through the intemperate Zones
of heat and cold for a little prize<note n="*" place="margin">Extremos currit mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos. Horace</note>.
The Souldier for a rich booty will

gladly undergo a bloody spring for

               </note>!</p>
            <p>And so having laid down some
Arguments by way of Motive, to
perswade us to this work; I shall
now propound some means by way
of direction to help us in this work;
and here I shall shew you what are
those things to be removed which
will hinder our working, and what
are those things to be prosecuted
which will further it.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Removen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note> We must remove those things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
which will hinder our working out
salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There are six bars in the way
to salvation which must be removed.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The intanglements of the world.</hi>
While the foot is in a snare, a man
cannot run. The world is a snare<note n="*" place="margin">Divitiae saeculi sunt laquei dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli. <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </note>;
while our feet are in it, we cannot
<hi>run the race set before us,</hi> Heb. 12. 1.
If a man were to climb up a steepy
rock, and had weights tyed to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36750:35"/>
his legs, they would hinder his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent;
too many golden weights
will hinder us from climbing up this
steepy rock that leads to salvation.
While the mill of a trade is going, it
makes such a noise, that we can
hardly hear the Minister <hi>lifting up
his voyce like a trumpet.</hi> The world
choaks our zeale and appetite after
heavenly things; the earth puts out
the fire; the musick of the world
charmes us asleep, and then we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
work. In mines of gold there
are killing damps, O how many souls
have been destroyed with a damp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
from the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second bar in the way to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is sadnesse and unchearfulness:
when a mans heart is sad, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to go about his work; he is like
an untuned instrument.<note n="*" place="margin">Animae functiones tolluntur in mania, depravatur in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholia. <hi>here de Sax. Tract. de melanch.</hi>
               </note>Under
fears and discouragements we act
but faintly in Religion. <hi>David</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to chide himselfe out of this
spiritual melancholy, <hi>Why art thou
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36750:35"/>
cast down O my soul?</hi> Psalme 42. 5.
Cheerfulnesse quickens; the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi>
used musick in their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
to excite their spirits and make
them fight more valiantly. Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
is like musick to the soul,
it excites to duty, it oyles the wheels
of the affections: cheerfulnesse makes
service come off with delight, and we
are never carried so swift in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as upon the wings of delight.
Melancholy takes off our chariot-wheeles,
and then we <hi>drive on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third bar in the way to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is spiritual sloth. This is a
great impediment to our working.
It was said of <hi>Israel, they despised
the pleasant land,</hi> Psal. 106. 24. What
should be the reason? <hi>Canaan</hi> was a
Paradise of delight, a type of heaven;
I, but they thought it would cost
them a great deal of trouble and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
in the getting, and they would
rather go without it, <hi>they despised
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36750:36"/>
the pleasant land.</hi> Are there not mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
among us who had rather go
<hi>sleeping</hi> to hell, than <hi>sweating</hi> to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
I have read of certain <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
that live neare where there is
great store of fish, yet are so lazy
that they will not be at the pains to
catch them, but buy of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
such a sinful stupidity and
sloth is upon the most, that though
Christ be near them, though salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is offered in the Gospel, yet
they will not <hi>work out</hi> salvation.
<hi>Slothfulnesse casts into a deep sleep,</hi>
Prov. 19. 15. <hi>Adam</hi> lost his rib
when he was asleep; many a man
loseth his soul in this <hi>deep sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth bar in the way to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is an opinion of the easinesse
of salvation; God is merciful, and
the worst come to the worst, it is but
repent.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>God is merciful?</hi> it is true, but
withal he is just; he must not wrong
his Justice by shewing mercy;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36750:36"/>
therefore observe that clause in the
proclamation, <hi>Exod. 34. 6. he will
by no means clear the guilty.</hi> If a
King did proclaim, that only those
should be pardoned who came in, and
submited to his Scepter; could any stil
persisting in rebellion claim the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of that pardon? O sinner, wouldst
thou have mercy, and wilt not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
the <hi>weapons of unrighteousness?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>'Tis but repent.</hi> But repent?
It is such a <hi>but</hi> that we cannot hit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
God direct our arrow. Tell me
O sinner, is it easie for a dead man
to live and walk? Thou art spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
dead, and wrapt up in thy wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sheet, <hi>Eph. 2. 2.</hi> Is regeneration
easie? are there no pangs in the new
birth? is self denial easie? doest thou
know what Religion must cost, and
what it may cost? it must cost you
the parting with your lusts, it may
cost you the parting with your life;
Take heed of this obstruction. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is not <hi>per saltum;</hi> thousands
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36750:37"/>
have gone to hell upon this mistake.
The broad spectacles of presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
have made the <hi>strait gate</hi> seem
wider than it is.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fifth bar in the way to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is <hi>carnal friends.</hi> 'Tis dangerous
listning to their voyce. The Serpent
did speak in <hi>Eve. Jobs</hi> wife would
have called him off from serving

tentation to <hi>Job</hi> by his wife. Carnal
friends will be calling us off from
our work. What needs all this ado,
lesse pains will serve? We read that
some of Christs kindred, when they
saw Christ so earnest in preaching,
would give him a check, <hi>Mar.

and they tell him they know
something by Religion that is of ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
<hi>This Sect is everywhere spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 28. 22.</note>. There must be so much strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
&amp; mortification that he must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
look to see good day more; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he is discouraged, &amp; so the match
is broken off. Take heed of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
they are devils covered w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> flesh;
they are (as one saith) like <hi>Herod,</hi> who
would have killed Christ-as soon as he
was born: Thus when Christ is, as it
were, beginning to be <hi>formed in the
heart,</hi> they would in a spiritual sense
kill him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:36750:38"/>
And thus I have shewn you the bars
that lie in the way to salvation, which
are to be removed.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I proceed now in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. place to lay
down some helps conducible to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.<note place="margin">Promoven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The first is in the Text, <hi>fear and
trembling</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gemma pretiosa pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etas, sed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci è surri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r nisi à timore cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodiatur.</note>. This is not a fear of <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
but a fear of <hi>diligence.</hi> This fear is
requisite in the working out salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Let us fear lest we come
short</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 4. 1.</note>; fear is a remedy against <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
Hope</hi> is like the cork to the
net, it keeps the soul from sinking in
despair; and fear is like the lead to the
net, it keeps the soul from floating in
presumption. Fear is that <hi>flaming sword</hi>
that turns every way to keep out sin
from entring<note n="*" place="margin">Est jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor animae, Petrus Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensis.</note>; fear quickens; 'tis an
<hi>antidote against sloath. Noah being mov'd
with fear, prepared an Ark</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11. 8.</note>. The travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
fearing least night should overtake
him before he gets to his journeys end,
spurs on the faster. Fear <hi>causeth circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection;</hi>
he that walks in fear, treads
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36750:39"/>
warily; fear is a <hi>preservative against A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie;
I wil put my fear in your hearts,</hi> &amp;
<hi>you shall not depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32. 40.
The fear of falling, keeps us from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
Fear is the <hi>hadge and livery of a
Christian.</hi> The Saints of old were <hi>men
fearing God</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mal. 3. 17</note>. It is reported of holy
<hi>Anselm,</hi> that he spent most of his
thoughts about the day of Judgment.
<hi>Blessed is he that fears alwayes,</hi> Prov. 28.
14. Fear is a <hi>Christians garrison,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Si vis esse securus, semper ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</note> the
way to be <hi>secure</hi> is always to fear; This
is one of the best tools for a Christian
to work with.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, another great help in
working out salvation is <hi>love.</hi> Love
makes the work come off with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
seven years labour seemed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to <hi>Jacob,</hi> because of the love
that he did bear to <hi>Rachel.</hi> Love faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litates
every thing<note n="*" place="margin">Omnia fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note>. It is like wings to
the bird, like wheels to the Chariot,
like sails to the ship, it carries the soul
on swiftly and chearfully in duty; love
is never weary; It is an excellent saying
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36750:39"/>
of <hi>Gregory,</hi> let but a man get the love
of the world into his heart, &amp; he will
quickly be rich. So do but get the love
of religion into your heart, and you wil
quickly be rich in grace. Love is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
active grace, it despiseth dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
it tramples upon difficulties; like
a mighty torrent it carries all before it.
This is the grace <hi>takes heaven by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>
Get but your hearts well heated
with this grace, and you will be fitted
for work.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third thing conducible to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is, <hi>work in the strength of Christ.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>I can do all things through Christ
that strengthens me,</hi> Phil. 3. 13. never go
to work alone.<note n="*" place="margin">Vis gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior.</note>
               <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength lay
in his hair. And a Christians strength
lies in Christ. When you are to do any
duty, to resist any tentation, to subdue
any lust, set upon it in the strength of
Christ; some go out against sin in the
strength of resolutions and vowes, and
they are soon foiled: Do as <hi>Sampson,</hi> he
first cried to Heaven for help,<note n="*" place="margin">Judg. 16. 28.</note>&amp; then
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36750:40"/>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Tum insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Domini.</note>having taken hold of the Pillars, he
pul'd down the house upon the Lords
of the Philistines. When we engage
Christ in the work, and so take hold
upon the Pillar of an Ordinance, we
then bring down the house upon the
head of our lusts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Work low<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> be humble, think
not to merit by your working. Either
Satan would keep us from working, or
else he would make us proud of our
working. God must pardon our works
before he crowns them. If we could
pray as Angels, shed rivers of tears,
build Churches, erect Hospitals, and
should have a conceit that we merited
by this, it would be as a dead flie in the
box of perfume, it would stain and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
the glory of the work.<note place="margin">* Vaelanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili vitae hominum si remota mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sericordia cam Truti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na discuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> Our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
like good wine relish of a bad
cask, They are but <hi>glittering sins.</hi> Let
not pride poison our holy things; when
we have been working for Heaven, we
should say as good <hi>Nehemiah, Remember
me O my God, concerning this, &amp; spare me
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36750:40"/>
according to the greatness of thy mercy</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Neh. 13. 22.</note>.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Work upon your knees;</hi> be much in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Prayer. Beg the Spirit of God to help
you in the work; make that prayer, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake

blow upon my garden</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 4. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note>. We had need
have this spirit blow upon us, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so many contrary winds blowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, &amp; considering how soon holy
affections are apt to wither. The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
hath not more need of wind to
make its fruit flow out, then we of the
spirit, to make our graces flourish. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>

               <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 8. 29</note> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot;
Gods Spirit must joyn it self to
our Chariot; As the Mariner hath<note n="*" place="margin">Manus ad clavum, oculus ad coelum.</note>his
hand to the stern, so he hath his eye to
the star. While we are working we
must look up to the spirit; what is our
preparation without the spirits opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
what is all our rowing without a
gale from Heaven? <hi>The spirit lifted me
up,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 3. 14</note> Gods Spirit must both infuse grace
and excite it. We read of a <hi>wheel within
a wheel, Ezek. 1. 16.</hi> The spirit of God is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36750:41"/>
that inner wheel that must move the
wheel of our endevor. To conclude all,
pray to God to bless you in your work;
<hi>the</hi> race <hi>is not to the swift, nor the battel
to the strong, Eccles. 9. 11.</hi> nothing pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
without a blessing; &amp; what way to
obtain it but by prayer? Tis a saying
of one of the antients, The Saints car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the keys of Heaven at their girdle.
Prayer beats the weapon out of the
enemies hand, and gets the blessings
out of Gods hand.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Lastly, <hi>work in hope;</hi> the Apostle saith,
<hi>he that ploughs shall plough in hope, 1 Cor.
9. 10.</hi> hope is the souls <hi>anchor, Heb. 6. 19.</hi>
Cast this anchor upon the promise; &amp;
you shall never sink.<note n="*" place="margin">Spes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ut cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note>Nothing more
