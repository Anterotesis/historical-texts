         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOw, when the Lord of life and glory is appearing
in his Power as in the days of old, and his goodness,
mercy, and truth as in the years past, and the
riches of his Grace &amp; Salvation, which he maketh to
flow forth and spring forth from the great deep; now when he
is manifesting his light from his holy habitation, &amp; his saving
health from his dwelling place, that the sons of men might
be partakers thereof, and praise him who liveth for ever and
ever, who is the Author of Eternal Salvation unto them that
believe; the pit of darkness hath also opened its mouth, and
out of it many unclean spirits doth arise, and foggs and
mists of darkness, Ignorance and Error is also arisen out of it
to hinder the light from shining, and to darken the Air, that
the Son of Righteousness might not be beheld, and would
dam up the way that the springs of life might not refresh the
City of God, and his tender plants; that so the Prince of
darkness and the King of the bottomless pit might not lose
his Dominion, for this end hath he mustred up and is mustring
up all his men of War with their several weapons, and
all the Engines of wickedness to resist the Lamb of God, who
is risen to make War in Righteousness, that so the Kingdom
of darkness might still be established, and the Subjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
live at ease and peace in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> where Christ and
the witnesses are flain; I say for this end hath he sent out his
men of War to resist the work of the Lord, which is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Devils work; one of his Champions more stout then
his fellows is come out with his weapons of War, which are
most of them borrowed, and not his own, and the City in which
he hath encompassed himself is a refuge of lies; but however
he appears with the face of Authority and subscribes himself
<hi>John Norton Teacher of the Church of Christ at Boston</hi> in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
who was <hi>appointed thereunto by the order of the General Court;</hi>
his Book he calls <hi>The heart</hi> of New England <hi>Rent at the blasphemies
of the present Generation, or a brief tract concerning the Doctrine of the</hi>
Quakers, <hi>shewing the destructive nature thereof to Religion, Churches
and State.</hi>

Now whether <hi>John Norton</hi> was appointed of the General
Court to be Minister of <hi>Boston,</hi> or he was appointed by the
General Court to tell lies, how the heart of <hi>New England</hi> is
Rent, whether he intends, should be believed, the Reader
may judge; for his words may be understood of both: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>John Norton</hi> hath manifested his Master, that it was not
Christ who appointed him to be Minister at <hi>Boston,</hi> but
the General Court that appointed him; neither was it
Christ nor his Spirit that set him to work to publish lies to the
World, that the heart of <hi>New England</hi> was Rent, but the
General Court; neither was it Christ nor the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
that ordered him to write this Book, which he calls <hi>a
Tract concerning the Doctrine of the</hi> Quakers, but the General
Court they have ordered thee to tell lies, and thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
thy Commission and acts it, and shewes it to the
World, and the sign thereof is <hi>by the appointment of the General
Court:</hi> before we go any further, men of understanding will
Judge whose Minister, whose Souldier, whose Warrier <hi>John
Norton</hi> is, and at whose appointment and Commandment he
Ministers and Wars, and hath cleared himself to be no Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
of Christ, no Minister of Christ, but appointed to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and to War at the appointment of the General Court; and
so what will be brought forth by him in his <hi>Tract</hi> as he calls it
afterwards, as to Minister Grace to the hearers and Readers,
the Reader may Judge, seeing that he is a Minister by the
will of Man, and his work is appointed by the General
Court; and doth <hi>John Norton</hi> believe that People will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his Testimony as that the heart of <hi>New England</hi>
is broken and Rent, when as the blood-thirsty cruelty
and Barbarous actions and inhumane acts of cruelty, and
the noisome smell, and a bad example have you given to the
World, and the Laws and appointments and orders of
that General Court of <hi>Boston</hi> and <hi>New England</hi> stinkes in the
Nostrils of all sober People, which is sounded through the
World, and your State is as it was with <hi>Israel</hi> when blindness
hapened unto them through their unbelief, the effect of it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
their Apostacy, the Judges then judged for rewards,
the Priests Preached for hire and Prophets devived for mony,
and the People loved to have it so in their unbelief, and then

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38415:3"/>
pieces as flesh for the Caldron,</hi> even as you have done, banished
some from their Habitations, some from their Wives and
Children, and some you have seized upon their Lands, taken
away their goods by the Appointment and Order of your
Courts by which thou art made a Minister, and appointed to
tell these lyes, and to utter forth deceit to cover your wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to strengthen the Devils Kingdom and the subjects
thereof, against Christ and his Kingdom, <hi>who came not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
mens lives, but to save them,</hi> who came not to lay burdens,
but to take off burdens, who came not to destroy the Poor
and Needy, but to relieve the Oppressed; And have not
your General Courts done all this and much more, which
they may see and behold with confusion of face? And when
they have whipt them and scourged them, fined them and
imprisoned them, ceized upon their Lands, taken away their
goods, wasted their Estates, banished them upon pain of
death, and when nothing hath remained of all their Estates,
have ordered their Children to be sold for Bond-slaves, and
this by the appointment of your General Court, and for
no other cause but because they would not put off their Hats
to their Equals, or come to your publick Assemblies. Oh!
un-heard-of and unparallel'd wickedness, the name of your
General Court and the Appointments and Ordinances thereof
will be crowned with infamy and reproach from Generation
to Generation, but this is com'd to pass that your hypocrisie
might be made manifest, and your skirts uncovered that your
shame might appear, and that might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the Prophet, <hi>They cat up my People as men eat bread;</hi>
Are these the fruits, Symptomes and Characters that your
hearts are rent and broken in <hi>New England,</hi> or are they not
rather manifest tokens that your hearts are like Adamant, or
like the nether Mil-stone or like flint, which is harder then
ordinary stones, in which there is no remorse or reluctancy?
And is not this your state, as it was with <hi>Israel</hi> when their
hearts were hard? Doth not Christ say, <hi>By their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

and full of impudency that ever thou durst put Pen to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or that the General Court should ever appoint thee to
tell the Nations that your heart was rent in <hi>New England;</hi> but
the terrour of the Lord and the dread of God you must all
know before your hearts be rent, which is yet impenitrable
and hard, or else all these wretched Manifestations and fruits
thereof would never have appeared; but one of thy own
Generation if not thy self saith, <hi>That a Company of Thieves,
Fornicators and Fellons may cry out of deserved punishment as Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as well as we;</hi> God hath cleared us and redeemed us from
those things, but is not putting off the Hat to ones Equal, or
not joyning or coming to your Congregation, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
punishment sutable to Thieves, Fornicators and Fellons,
but Persecutors and blood-thirsty men were ever blind; for
Christ, the Prophets and Apostles and all the Holy men of
God who suffered for the Testimony of a good Conscience,
were ever reputed transgressours and Judged that they suffered
deservedly by them who caused them to suffer; Christ was
crucified betwixt two Thieves, and <hi>Herod</hi> the Governour and
his men of War set him to naught, <hi>and he was numbred amongst
Transgressors,</hi> as it is written of him, and so were all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
by them that were in <hi>Cains</hi> way, and in <hi>Baalams</hi> way;
and so hast thou with the rest of <hi>Babylons</hi> Merchants these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
years numbred us amongst transgressors, every Sect and
Opinion hitherto hath joyned us to that Opinion or Sect
which was contrary to them, but thou would marr our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
more than any, thou hath not found a Generation
bad enough to number us with in this age, but is gone back
a thousand years to fetch up Men and Doctrines and Principles,
and would fasten them upon us, and so to represent us odious
to People, thou might have spent thy time better then to have
raked in those old mouldy Histories, in which I see thou art
better acquainted then with the mind of Christ; but I shall
not trouble the Reader with thy stories, neither vindicate
their Doctrines and Principles, which were counted Hereticks,
these men are dead and gone, thou might have let them
pass, and have medled with things that pertained to thy own
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38415:4"/>
Generation, but that thy dead mind feeds upon dead things;
&amp; to tell thee and the world plainly, that thou which will lye
and lay things to their charge which they never knew nor
maintained, which may be are living and can reprove thee
for thy falshood and deceit in this Generation, thou may well
speak falsly and lay things to their charge which they never
maintained which are at such a distance as 1600 or 1000 years
ago, and if the adversaries of these men did write their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and set down their Errours and Blasphemies as I believe
many of them did, I do less credit their report, and I am not
altogether unacquainted with Ecclesiastical Histories from
whence thou hast had these Stories, although now I count
the time just lost in which I spent in those things; and though
thou Judge that we vilifie the Scripture, yet I prefer it above
and before all the Ecclesiastical Histories that I have read; I
shall not trouble the Reader with thy old <hi>Hetrodoxes,</hi> as thou
calls them, of the heads of Religion, there is many that knows
those things as well as thy self, and as for <hi>Praxes, Sabellers, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storus
Cerinthius, Eutichas,</hi> nor with <hi>Quintinius, Swinckfield, Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
David George</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> what are these to us?
And what are their Principles to us? Some thing they spoke
which was real Heresie, if the Histories be true, whereof
I much doubt, because many such as thy self were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
thereof, and something it may be was truth which might
be vindicated, not because they held it, but because it is
truth in it self; And as for thy comparing of them to us, and
their Principles to ours, doth not at all detract or invalidate
truth as it is in it self, for corrupt minds may speak true
words, and that which is truth in it self, yet not live in the
life thereof, they are Judged though, the truth in it self
stands clear, and so what as they were in their Principles and
Practise in life or in Doctrine, must they give account for; but
thou like the rest of the hireling Priests of <hi>England</hi> used alwayes
to be confuting your adversaries when they were at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
when they were dead and could not reply, or at such
a distance that they could not hear, and you are such valiant
Champions for the most part as to Disputation, except you
have Club-men and Prison-doors standing open, to fight or to
shut them in, you will hardly enter into a Dispute publickly,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38415:5"/>
or it may be if they be afraid that they shall be worsted and
their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deceit laid open, put a Key in the mouth of one, as some
did in the mouth of <hi>Humph. Norton,</hi> when he was with one of
thy Brethren, and then cry, <hi>The Opposite or</hi> Quaker <hi>he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say for himself;</hi> &amp; such dark muddy stories you used to fill
up your hour with, as to confute <hi>Arius</hi> &amp; <hi>Pelagius,</hi> men that were
hundreds of years dead, and no such Principles holden in a
Nation, and such dead stories you fill Peoples minds with, and
confute the <hi>Pope</hi> when your elbows was leaning upon the soft
Cushons on the Pulpit, and 20 or 30 s. for such a dead Story
as you told People, but when have you gone amongst them
and reasoned of the things of the Kingdom of God into their
Dominions, and convinced them by sound Doctrine, and yet
you will say Christ said, <hi>Go into all Nations and Preach,</hi> and plead
that for your Commission, and it may be stay forty years over
a hundred Families.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Hetrodoxes</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> concerning the heads
of Religion, as thou hast set down, this I say to thee,
and to all the World, we do not hold them because
any man before did hold them, or may hold them after,
but because God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit,
which also may be confirmed by the Testimony of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Truth.</p>
            <p>As to those which thou sets down as our Tenents I shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
on the Lords behalf for Truthes sake, and for the rest
thou may take them home to thy self.</p>
            <p>First concerning the <hi>Trinity</hi> thou saith, <hi>they confesse the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son and Holy Ghost, and yet they deny the Trinity, and those
to bet hree distinct Persons,</hi> for confutation of this thou brings
<hi>Heb.</hi> First and third; <hi>He is the expresse Image of his Fathers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thy <hi>Trinity</hi> is an old Popish term and we love to keep to
sound words, but by <hi>Trinity</hi> I suppose thou means three,
and thy own words shall confute thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou confesseth we say
there is Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and yet but one God, or
one Eternal being or substance in which they all subsist, but
thy word <hi>distinct</hi> is thy own and not the Spirits, yet to
distinguish betwixt Father, Son and Spirit we deny not; and
as for the first of <hi>Heb,</hi> it is in another Translation rendred <hi>the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38415:5"/>
expresse Image of his substance,</hi> for Person is too grosse a word, as
to expresse an Eternal and Divine being in, and if thou do
hold three distinct <hi>substances</hi> thou errs in thy Judgement, for
that were to make three Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They deny Christ to be God and man in one Person, and
Christ to be a distinct Person from the Father, and they acknowledge
such a Christ as unchrists Christ; <hi>and when they say</hi> Christ mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in the flesh, they mean not as the Scripture, but falaciously.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We say according to the Scripture of Truth and not
according to thy <hi>falacy,</hi> that in the man Christ did the fulness
of the Godhead dwell, and God was in Christ reconciling
the world unto himself, and he saith I and my Father are one,
and the Father the Son and the Spirit subsist in one Eternal
Power, Life and Glory, which thou with all thy stupid gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
are Ignorant of; and Christ that we acknowledge is
such a Christ as is able to save to the utmost them that come
unto him, and receive him and believe in him, and is such a
Christ is as able to raise them that have been dead, and such a
Christ giveth Eternal life to them that believe; And so that
Christ that we own doth not un-christ Christ, but by your
Doctrine who pleads imperfection and the continuation
thereof, and a continuation in sin for term of life, as one of
thy own said, <hi>sin will dwell in the house till the house be pulled down,</hi>
speaking of the natural body, which some other of thy own
Generation have called the body of sin, and so it is you that
hold such a Christ as unchrists the true Christ in thy own
words; and when didst thou enter into our thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our heart, or with what dost thou search, that thou sits
as Judge over the heart, who knowes not judgement in thy self
nor of what spirit thou art of, and so thy lies and deceit
is turned upon thee; when we say Christ manifest in the flesh
we say that holy thing which was brought forth and born of
a Virgin, and conceived of the Holy Ghost in whom the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the God-head, dwells, in whom the Eternal Power
of the Father was manifested, that he was the Christ which
was manifested in the flesh and Justified in the Spirit,
Preached among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> seen of Angels, and received
up into Glory, and this is according to Scripture of Truth, and
thy judgement must be judged.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly, Concerning the Scripture considered as the rule
of Life,</hi> They deny the Scripture or written word to be the rule of life,
and they make the Spirit without the Scripture to be their guide, they
account Chyrch, instituted worship and waiting upon God for the
Efficacious pres<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

they affirm to be an Image.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Concerning the Scripture we say they are Scriptures
of Truth and words of Truth spoken from the Spirit or Truth,
that which gave them a being is greater then they, as he that
Creates is greater then they that ar<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Created, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
above and before, and yet no Deminishing or Detracting
from the Creature; so the Spirit is greater above and before
the words, and yet this doth not Deminish, neither Derogate
from the Scripture; these and the like sound words we have
spoken to thy deaf Generation, yet a spirit of slumber being
upon them all, they could not hear that which giveth Life,
and bringeth to Life, and preserves in the Life, is a rule and a
guide to them that are enlivened, the Sons of God who were
quickned by the Eternal Spirit of their Father &amp; of Christ, and
raised from death to Life, this was their rule, as it is written, <hi>as
many as are the Sons of God are led by the Spirit of God,</hi> and we
say it is a sufficient rule of it self, and thou may as well
count the rule of the Sons of God <hi>Hetrodox</hi> and <hi>Heretical,</hi> and
the Apostles position, who said, <hi>as many as are the Sons of God
are led by it,</hi> and Christ promised unto believers the Spirit of
Truth to lead them into all Truth, and to bring things to their
remembrance, and to guide them in the path of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
what has Envy and madness eaten all the good out of
your hearts? Yet the Scripture is not so excluded by us as
thou Judgest, though we say the Spirit may lead and
direct with it, or without it, yet not contrary to it, for the
Spirit doth, will and may take up what thing it pleaseth to
manifest it self and its mind unto the Creature, and who art
thou? and what art thou? any thing but an <hi>Egyptian</hi> who
would limit it, and tie it to Paper and Ink, to words and Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
sounded and written in diverse Tongues, Languages and
Caracters; they that appointed thee for a Minister never

knew Gods Work, and we know that there are several
Ministrations and several operations, yet the same God and
the same Spirit who manifested it self, and formeth and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth
things according to its Heavenly will, to represent its
Heavenly mind to the Creature, and that which Christ hath
Ordained and Instituted to be worshipped in, waited in, and
his presence seen in, and the operation of the Spirit of Grace
in the work of the Ministry, which is for Conversion and
Edification is dearly owned by us, as that whereby we have
found the Lord and his pure presence through this or that
thing, and without and beyond all Creatures or visible
appearances, and this is not accounted Idolatry by us, as
thou falsly saith, which God will Judge thee for in the day
when he appears to take vengeance upon his Enemies in flames
of fire, and thou that talkes of trying the Spirit by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
knowes no more of God then a Horse, but what
thou knowes naturally; the <hi>Jewes</hi> had it, and they tryed
and condemned him for a blasphemer, and the Apostles for
breakers of the Law and makers of it void, and so condemned
the Lord of Life, and the Spirit by which the Prophets and
Apostles was led by, even as thou doth with us; and I never
heard of any Political order of Church Ordinance or officers
or Ordinances, not of the most dark and sottishest Marchants
of <hi>Babylon</hi> that ever spoke or wrote yet, there was sundry
gifts given and sundry Institutions in the Primitive times
which were signal things of things of a more Heavenly and

            <p>Concerning the magistrate, they own none are lawful Magistrates
who are not of their way, their non-acknowledgement of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,

be said, but the Judicious will not easily believe thee; that
there is a State of Magistracy is granted by us, and that a true
Magistrate that Rules well, and Rules in the Power of God
and is a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them that
do well, and are as nursing Fathers, who preserves mens
Persons and Estates from devourers, as a Father preserves
a Child from injury, these are Ordained of God, and
such we are subject unto for the Lords sake and for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake, and to every Ordinance of man which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant
with the honour of God and a pure Conscience, but
I believe you have few of them in <hi>New England,</hi> who are rather
like Beares and Lyons tearing and rending their Estates, and
rends and tears their flesh, and gnawes it like Evening Wolves
that the Prophet speaks of, and would thou have this count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as Gods Authority? and we tell thee and all the World in
singleness of heart and unfeignedness, that our way is Christ
the way to the Father, the Truth and the Life, the Power
of God and the Wisdom of God, and all that Rule not in his
Power rule in the Devils power, in the Dragons power, in the
Beasts power, who made War with the Lamb and killed the
Saints, and compelled them to worship, and herein they that
Rule in the Power of God and for God are manifest, and
them that rule in the Dragon and Beasts power, for they that
Rule in the Power of God answereth Gods witness in every
man, and reaches to that by his Act of Justice in the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
and he restraineth the evil doer within, and limiteth that,
and preserves the Creature as much as him lies from harm,
and his Estate from destruction, and also saveth the Innocent,
meek and harmless from the violence, and from beating and
fighting, and from them that would destroy their Persons and
Estates; and herein the Magistrate that Rules in the Dragons
power and in the Beasts power, he is also made manifest, he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38415:7"/>
reacheth not Gods witness by his Governing, he lests the
transgressor live, and is not a terrour to evil works and
workers, but a terrour to them that do well and exercise

has been made drunk with the blood of the Saints, whose
Garments have been red with Scarlet colour; and I know no
where in any Christian State (so called) where he reigns in

Beast which hath risen out of the Sea, which is amongst you,
and the beast carries you, your Church, on his back bears it
up, for all your Weapons are but carnal, and that which
wrestles with flesh and blood, which the true Church wrestles
not with, nor with Creatures, but with spiritual wickedness
and principalities and powers of darkness in the Creature,
and threw that down and saved the Creature alive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
it who was in Captivity. Oh sottish Children, when
will you learn Wisdom, and when will you hearken to reproof
of instruction which is the way to life? but remember this,
the beast shall be taken alive with the false Prophet, and them
that have wrought Miracles before him, and then shall be cast

            <p>They pretend to act from an Infallible light within them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
perfection in degrees in this life, and publish smart invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Ministers who teach the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We pretend to nothing but to that which God hath
given us through his free mercy, which we have a true right
unto, having received him as the Father hath tendered him
to be a light to open our eyes, and to be a Leader unto us and
all his People, and to be Gods Salvation, even to the ends of
the earth to them that receive him, and he is that Infallible
light which the Father sent into the world, that all men
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38415:8"/>
through him might believe, and he is the true light that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
every man, though every man hath not received him,
the fault is not in the Giver, nor in the gift, but in them
that will not receive, and he that is the life of all men, hath
lighted every man that comes into the world, and he is in us
our Hope, and our Glory, the riches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the
riches of all them that do believe, he is our Way and our Life
and Peace, I say all Glory unto him for ever, though thou
debase him &amp; set him thus at naught, and for his sake we can
bear reproaches and become fools, in that we have obtained
that in which true Wisdom stands and life Eternal; And
what is this <hi>Hetrodox</hi> to profess perfection of degrees in this
life, is not this Orthodox? used not you and do not you gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
hold perfection in part or parts, and is not that which
is perfect in parts perfect in degrees? He that feels victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
one sin by Christ the Power of God, hath not he some part
in that which is perfect, and of that which is perfect? And
if he witness victory over more, is he not come to a greater
degree or degrees of the life which is perfect? And he that
knows the blood that cleanseth from all sin, is not he perfect
and compleat in him who hath made him so? But art thou
so offended at perfection that thou dost not admit of any part
or parts, degree or degrees thereof, that thou sets this down
as a Blasphemy? And its time indeed to reprove you sharply
who are puffed up in pride and knows nothing, who teaches
contrary to the perfect life of Christ, or any degree or degrees
thereof to be attained unto; thou art perfect in wickednesse,
and a perfect Minister of Antichrist, and a perfect Heathen,
and its time to bear Testimony against you and lay you open,
and your deceit in the sight of the Sun, that them that have
but the least glimring of the Light may behold you; a pitiful
Church is that like to be which thou art Pastor of, <hi>by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of the General Court,</hi> who cryes out against any degree
of the perfect life of Christ in this life to be obtained or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
a Minister of sin, a Minister of Sathan and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that is thy name, own it.</p>
            <p>In the ninth page thou art going about to prove thy <hi>Trinity,</hi>
as thou calls it, and thou saist, <hi>The Father is a distinct subsistance,
and the Son a distinct subsistance, and the Holy Ghost is a distinct sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:38415:8"/>
and thou brings <hi>John 5.</hi> there is <hi>another</hi> bears witness
likewise, speaking of the Holy Ghost, he calls him <hi>another,</hi> and
this <hi>another</hi> thou sayes, <hi>Is Intel<gap reason="illegible" extent="7 letters">
                     <desc>〈7 letters〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Essence,</hi> and then
saith, <hi>What is more manifest then another subsistance, and another
subsistance speaks distinct subsistances,</hi> and thou saith, <hi>The Spirit is
called the hand of Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Another</hi> is not understood of another being of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life or another substance, but is understood of <hi>another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation</hi>
or Operation of the same God who subsists in the
same Power in which the Father the Son and the Spirit subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth,
as I said unto thee before, <hi>another,</hi> as to distinguish of
the Operation and Work of the Spirit, and of the Son, we
do not refuse; but to make three distinct essences and beings
is ignorance and errour, as thou saith, <hi>Another is intel<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gible of
the Essence,</hi> and so thou hast made <hi>three Essences, three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances,
three Persons and three Gods;</hi> but we say there is but one
God, <hi>and there is three that bears record in Heaven, the Father, the
Word and the Spirit, and these three are one.</hi> Now as for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
and Essence, they are unsound words coyned of your
selves, from your dark imaginations, in which there is no truth
at all, but to cast a mist; Now where the Holy Ghost is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>a Person</hi> in the Scripture I have never read, and where it
is called <hi>the hand of Trinity</hi> I have never heard of before thee,
and so thy blind ignorant conclusions and Sophistical arguing
will have little place with them that are come to know the
Teachings with the Spirit, and also keep to a form of sound
words, which thou cannot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thou saith,</hi> He that sendeth and he that is sent are distinct,
and so the Father sending the Son, and the Son sent of the Father, and
the Father and the Son sending the Spirit, and the Spirit sent by the
Father and the Son are distinct subsistances, and not the same.</p>
            <p>He that sends and he that is sent may be distinguished, but
he that sendeth and him that is sent is not so distinct &amp; afar off
one another, but that him that sendeth is with him that is
sent; and so God was in Christ reconciling the world, and
then how were they distinct one from the other, and by him
was all things made, and Christ was not so distinct or afar off
at a distance when the Heavens and the Earth was made; so
that it is truly said, without him nothing was made that was
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38415:9"/>
made, and the Spirit of God which may be distinguished in
regard of its Operation, yet it was not absent or distinct from
the Father and the Son in the Creation, neither is absent
from the Son in the Regeneration, or work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And then in thy Answer to an Objection which thou makest
thy self, <hi>How the Doctrine of life was Communicated vocally by the
Patriarchs, but it is not so now;</hi> and in thy Answer thou saith,
<hi>The Scripture is not necessary, absolutely,</hi> but it being Gods Will
to Communicate life through the Scripture, hence the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is necessary; and then thou sayes, <hi>Not the letter without
the mind of the Authour, nor the Spirit without the Scripture;</hi> and
that the words in the 17th of <hi>John 22. That they may be one as we
are one; these words give an uncertain sound,</hi> thou saist; and
further thou saist, <hi>Surely, they are under a Rule of live who hare
not the Spirit since the Canon of the Scripture is closed, so far is the
Spirit from being a Rule of life, that to us it is not the Spirit, except it
move in the written word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Gross darkness is thy dwelling-place, and out of
thick darkness all this pitiful confusion cometh, the Doctrine
of life was Communicated according to the will and mind
of God, sometime by Dream, sometime by Vision, sometime
by Revelation to the Patriarchs and Believers from <hi>Abel</hi> till
<hi>Moses,</hi> and by Faith they were followers of Christ, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they did Communicate in their Generation those things
that were manifest unto them by the Spirit, which was the
then Rule and Guide to the feet of the upright in the way of
Peace before any Scripture was written, and if the Scripture
be not necessary absolutely, thou hast said as much as we say,
therefore we' speak of a Rule and a Way which is absolute
necessary, without which no man can know the Father or the
Son, nor the way of Peace, but by the Spirit of truth which
gave forth the Words of truth, which may manifest and doth
manifest it self as it will, when it will, where it will, and how
it will, for it is unlimitted, and it will not be limitted by its
own words as to sound, but may speak words which it never
spoke before, as for instance, <hi>Paul</hi> by the Spirit said, <hi>The second</hi>
Adam <hi>the Lord from Heaven is a quickning Spirit,</hi> which none of
the Scriptures before written speaks in these very words, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38415:9"/>
if the Spirit be not Spirit without the Letter, then where
the Letter is wanting the Spirit is wanting, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
them that have the Scripture have the Spirit, which were
no less then ignorance and darkness to say, and what Rule
are they under who have not the Spirit or no measure
of it, there is but the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and they that are not ruled by the Spirit of Truth,
they are ruled by the spirit of errour, though they may
have the words to fight with and quarrel about without the
life; But last of all thou hast in plain words set the dead
letter before the living Spirit, and saith, <hi>That the Spirit is no
Spirit except it speak by the Scripture;</hi> and if the words of
Christ in the 17th of <hi>John</hi> give an uncertain sound, it is
but to thy deaf ear and to thy blind understanding, for he
spoke soundly and certainly, and prayed to the Father that
as the Father and he was one, so they also might be one,
being guided by the one Spirit of the Father in the Son, and
that they might live in the Unity of it, and have Unity
one with another in it, and with the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In thy 15th</hi> page, <hi>though thou hast set up the Letter for
a perfect Rule of life, yet here thou throws it down again,
and saith,</hi> It is to be understood as including consequences, for the
greatest part of Scripture is consequences, and the Scripture cannot
be true without consequences, for <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> are neither
commanded obedience or forbidden disobedience, for we no where
read thou <hi>Thomas</hi> or thou <hi>Mary</hi> are therein commanded obedience
or forbidden disobedience, such a one by name do this or that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I told thee the Spirit of God is unlimitted, and
whether it speaks of degrees or measures of a greater or less
thing, or whether it speaks the greater first and the lesser
after, whether it speaks from <hi>Major</hi> to <hi>Minor,</hi> or from <hi>Minor</hi> to
<hi>Major,</hi> or what may truly follow either from the greater
to the less or from the less to the greater it is all truth, but
thy Consequences is no part of this, the Spirit still demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
its own mind by what words and terms and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
it pleaseth, and will not be limitted or confined
to this or that form of words, and thou errs grosly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowing the Scripture nor the Power of God, and thy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38415:10"/>
Consequences are false, for there are the individual persons
or names of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> both commanded obedience
and forbidden disobedience, and if thou have never read
this in Scripture, I inform thee and instruct thee, thou may
read the 20th of <hi>John</hi> 16, 17. where Jesus saith unto <hi>Mary,</hi>
she turned herself and said unto him <hi>Rabboni,</hi> which is to
say Master, Jesus said unto her, <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet
ascended;</hi> here is a Prohibition, and forbidding that she
should not touch him, secondly here is a command of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<hi>But go unto my Brethren and say unto them I ascend to my
Father and your Father, to my God and your God;</hi> and in the
same Chapter thou may read in the 27th where Christ spoke
unto <hi>Thomas</hi> by name (after his Resurrection) <hi>then said he to</hi>
Thomas, <hi>reach hither thy finger and behold my hands, and reach
hither thy hand and thrust it into my side;</hi> here was a Command
to be obeyed, and <hi>be not faithless,</hi> there is a prohibition or a
forbidding of unbelief, and so thy foolishness is manifest
and ignorance of the Scripture, some of it thou sayes is an
uncertain sound, and the Scriptures fore-mentioned thou
hast denied or else never hast read it, and so art unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with thy Rule which thou quarrels and fights so much
about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then thou comes and sayes,</hi> Thou wilt vindicate some
Scriptures, <hi>and cites 1</hi> John 9. That this was the true light which
lighteth every man that comes into the world, hence they affirm
that there is a light in every man, which being followed is an
Infallible guide, and that this light which lighteth every man is the
Rule of life, and not the written word; <hi>thy Answer is,</hi> The
sence of the Text is notoriously false <hi>and thy reason is</hi> if Christ the
true light that lighteth every man be the Rule, then righteousnesse
should be by the Law; for the light which is in every man is not
Gospel light, but there is a natural light or the light of Nature,
which is to be construed in opposition to spiritual, and the light of
Nature and the light of the Spirit are contradistinct, and by this light
of Nature there is a difference put betwixt that which is good and
bad, and it will teach us not to lye nor steal, and it will lead to the
Knowledge of one God, and yet it is in opposition to one spirit, and it
will lead to know Eternity omnipotency, and it will lead to know
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38415:10"/>
the Creator, yet it is contradistinct to the spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Scripture needs none of thy Vindication, for
thou hast defamed it and sayes Christs words is an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sound, and thou hast said that neither <hi>Mary</hi> nor <hi>Thomas</hi>
was commanded obedience; thou may look back of thy lyes
and repent of them, and why is the sence of the Text ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
false, that Christ was the true light that lighteth every
man that cometh into the world without exception, and
why is this utterly false, if he be followed, that he who is
the true light is an Infallible guide, and the Rule of life,
hath he not enlighted every man that comes into the world?
if thou make exceptions where the Spirit makes none, then
thou perverts the Scripture; doth not he say I am the light
of the world, the world in the Scriptures account is set in
opposition to believers, for believers are not of this world,
but are redeemed out of it, as for example, God so loved
the world that he sent his Son into the world, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
did believe in him might not perish, but have Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
life, for it is manifest that the Saints and Believers had
life given already that followed Christ and were his sheep,
and saith Christ, <hi>I put them forth and go before them, and give
unto them Eternal life;</hi> and he said to them who had not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life, <hi>While you have the light believe in it, that you may be
the Children of it;</hi> and is not Christ Gods Righteousness, who
is given for a Covenant of light to the blind, and dead,
and lame, &amp; to the dumb to open their eyes, to quicken them,
to make them leap as a Hart, and their tongue to sing and
utter forth praise; we say Righteousness is not by the Law,
but by Christ that lighteth every man who is the end of the
Law, and why is not the light which lighteth every man
Gospel light, seeing it is said, <hi>Go Preach the Gospel in every
Creature under Heaven;</hi> go learn what that means, and if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
light must be construed in opposition to spiritual, and
the light of Nature contradistinct to the light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
then it must needs be sinful, for that which opposeth
spiritual light &amp; is set in opposition against its leading, must
needs be sinful, and that which is <hi>contra</hi> or against the light
of the Spirit must needs be sinful; and then if it be as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38415:11"/>
thou hast said, and if this must be the true sence of that
Scripture, that it must be understood of natural light, and
that natural light thou construes in opposition to spiritual,
and saith it is contradistinct to the light of the Spirit, and
in opposition unto it, that which is against the Spirits light
or the light of the Spirit must needs be darkness, sinful and
evil, and yet thou hast confessed it will teach that none
ought to lye or steal, and to know one God, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and Eternity and Omnipotency, and yet it must be
taken in opposition to the Spirit, and contradistinct from
the Spirit; that which leads to know the Creator and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Omnipotency is that Spirit of God, through
which God and the things of God are revealed, and
that that teaches that a man should not lye, that is truth,
and that that leads from sin, and accuses for evil-doing and
convicts, that is the Spirits light, as it is written, he shall
convince the world of sin; and so thou like a man who hath
lost all aim, rambles up and down in every by-path, and
like a blind man gropes, but cannot enter into the Treasure-house
of Wisdom, thou hast called the light that every one
is lighted with, the Righteousness of the Law, and no Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
light, and in opposition to spiritual, and contradistinct
to the Spirit, and in a word hath made at it at the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
but bad and evil, and then when thou hast done
thou confesseth that it will put a difference between good &amp;
evil, and shew that God is to be worshipped, and Eternity
is known and Omnipotency; And are not these the deep
things of God? And so <hi>B<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

affirms, nor of what thou speaks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further thou saith,</hi> That this little light there is, is much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried,
and thy Reason is, because it is managed by the reigning
power of darkness, and the judgement of man is corrupt, <hi>and then
thou goes on,</hi> the light of nature since the fall is not to be compared
<hi>(saist thou)</hi> with the light of the Image of God before the fall, and
it hath no proportion with Gospel light, but is gross darkness, nay,
is worse then gross darkness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:38415:11"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> And how did the light miscarry thou blind-man,
and when did the Reigning power of darkness manage it,
seeing that there is no fellowship betwixt light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the light which every man is lighted with hath
born witness against darkness and the Reigning power of it,
and though the judgment of man be corrupt, his miscarriage
is because he hath not minded the light, and because he
hath turned his back on it, and then sin entred, and then
came to Reign in the power of darkness, and corrupted the
heart, and this hath made man miscarry; and though thou
say that the light which lighteth every man is not compared
with the light of the Image of God before the fall, and hath
no proportion, I'le tell thee a riddle go learn what it means,
the light of the Image of God before the fall is the same in
it self after the fall, and holds its proportion, and is no
whit lessned or deminished in its purity in its self, although
fallen man do not see it neither can behold it, because sin
hath entred and death by sin, and that is it which obscureth
the Image of God from man, and its light, yet the light
shined in darkness, but thou concludes it is darkness, yea
worse then grosse darkness, and thou brings a proof to prove
it, <hi>ye were darkness,</hi> the Apostle doth not say that the light
which shined in darkness was darkness or worse then
grosse darknesse as thou ignorantly saith, but he said
the <hi>Ephesians</hi> or the men of <hi>Ephesus</hi> were darkness, and
not the light in them which shined in darkness, though the
darkness comprehended it not; but how now <hi>John Norton,</hi>
what will the General Court of <hi>Boston</hi> say when they see thy
confusion laid open, and the deceit made manifest to thine
and their shame and ignorance, thou confest in the 16. page,
<hi>that it would lead to know God and the worship of God, and Teach
not to lie and steal, and so forth, and to discover some of Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
as Eternity, omnipotency, and the like,</hi> here was some
good in it in thy own account, but now its become <hi>grosse
darkness,</hi> in the 18. page <hi>and worse then grosse darkness,</hi> and
so hath made as bad if not worse then any Principle that is
in a Beast; and it may truely be said of thee even in thy

            <p>
               <hi>But now thou comes to a further interpretation of</hi> 1 Job. 9.
<hi>and thou saith</hi> the light which we are enlightned with it is either
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he light of nature the light of reason or the light of saving Grace,
and th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> light enlightning is either the Word considered as the second
Person or Christ the Son considered as Incarnate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It seems that thou knowes not which it is, but
gueses like a blind man, and like a wild Archer shootes at
random; and why dost thou make such distinction betwixt
the Word the Son of God, and Christ the Son of God, thou
made but three Persons in the Trinity before, but it seems
by thy arguing thou would now make four; And as for thy
<hi>Collective</hi> and <hi>distributive light,</hi> the distinctions is that which
would cast a mist before People eyes, and thou brings the
Judgement of <hi>Calvin, Besar,</hi> and <hi>Piscator,</hi> and others, that as
concerning man endued onely with the light remaining
since the fall, they conclude him to be darkness and unable
to comprehend the light or to improve it to salvation, their
judgements is more sound then thine, though thou would
bring them to strengthen thee that the Son of God hath not
enlightned every man, they confesse, the man in the fall is
in darkness, and darkness is over him, and in that he is not
able to comprehend the light which is in him, and as to the
improvement of it, in the darkness man hath not power to
improve it to salvation, but what doth this invalidate the
light which is in darkness, the power of improving is in the
light being turned to again and received; and what if I say
it is the light of Life in its self though thou deny it, I know
what I speak; for in him was life and is life, and that life
is the light of men, and the light of the world, and so that
light which every man is lighted with, is of the life and from
the life, and so may truely be said to be the light of life in it
self, though man in the transgression doth not feel it so as
to him, but may truely say it is the light of condemnation,
because he feels it so in the operation thereof, being in the
transgression, it convicteth, reproveth, accuseth and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for evil, and therefore it cannot be the light of life to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38415:12"/>
him, till it be received closed with obeyed and followed,
and then the back is turned upon the transgression, and
man is come out of the darkness; and therefore the Apostle
spoke well and understandingly according to knowledge, that
which was ordained for life wrought death in him, that was
because the Law was against him, and he in the contrary
nature to it, the ignorance of many wise men (so account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
in this generation is such, that when they see or feel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effects, they judge there must needs be contrary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
or objects because there are different effects; for now the
same light which shewes evil and accuses for it, and judges
for it, there is one operation, and excuses him that loves it
and obeyes it, here is another operation, that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
the world of sin, of Righteousness &amp; of Judgement,
and that which consolates and gives peace to the believer is
the self same spirit; so here is not two spirits or two lights,
so that he which kindles a fire in the Earth, and appears in
flames of fire, and rendreth vengeance upon all them that
obey not the Gospel which is the Power of God, here is one
work or operation of Christ, the same bringeth Peace, Joy
and gladness, and refreshment, and makes the springs of
life to buble up in them that believe, here is another ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
yet the same Christ; these things I write to inform
thee and all where this may come, that that is truely an
appearance of Christ which sheweth sin and condemns it
in any measure, and he alone is the Judge of the quick
and the dead, and if all Judgement be committed to the
Son, then to be Judged for lying for stealing, and for
wronging any man, it is the work of Christ and the work of
the Son. Oh man thou hast much to repent of, and thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is great, which hath called Christ the light or the
light of Christ, or the light of life darkness, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct
to the Spirit, and worse then grosse darkness, so
this is thy conclusion against the first of <hi>John</hi> and the 9. that
Christ hath not enlightned every man or all men that come
into the world, but all men so qualified of every sort, so then
by thy conclusion the first of <hi>John</hi> and the 9. verse gives an
uncertain sound, like the 17. of <hi>John</hi> and 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so then its quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38415:13"/>
of men that procures light from Christ, and so its
not of Grace but of debt, but if it be of debt, which
is owing unto a Person so qualified, then it is not of
gift, but thou errs in thy Judgement, for it is by the gift of
righteousness that Justification comes upon all that believes,
it is not this or that qualification before their conversion
which is any cause of Gods enlightning them, but it is the
free love of God unto man without exceptions, or respect
of Persons that he hath lighted every man, to the intent that
all and every man might see his Error and depart from it,
and turn to him that shewes him it, who would have all men
saved and come to the knowledge of the Truth, and such is
the large love of God unto whole man-kind, which thou
wouldst restrict and bind up to such and such Persons so qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
as though qualifications of Persons were a Meritorious
cause wherefore Christ was bound to give them light, this
is rank Popery, and not according to the Doctrine of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thou citest the 2 Pet. 1. 19.</hi> We have a more sure word of
prophesie, where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that
shineth in a dark place, untill the day dawn and the day Star arise
in your hearts, hence it is inferred, <hi>thou saith,</hi> that after the
reception of the Spirit there is no need to attend to the Scripture, <hi>and
so thou goes on and sayes</hi> the word of prophesie is the Scripture of
the Old Testament, that thou art to take heed unto untill the day
dawned and the day Star arised in their hearts; and that untill signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Asw.</hi> And here thou art in confusion, I know none that
makes any such inference but thy self, for the Scripture is
seen most clearly, who know the day dawn and the day-star
arisen in their hearts; and first thou sayes, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Word of Prophecy the whole Scripture, and
then in the same page saith, that <hi>Peter</hi> expounds the word
prophesie of the Old Testament onely, so then <hi>Peters</hi> Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
by thy account, and thine is different, thou sayes
he spoke of the Old Testament, and thy interpretation is of
the whole Scripture, but thou hast mist it, both of
<hi>Peter</hi> and thy self, for <hi>Peter</hi> wrote unto People in that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38415:13"/>
Epistle in several States, yet they all might be said to
be believers, according to a proportion of faith given
unto them, and in that which thou hast cited 2 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t.
1. 19.</hi> we have also a more sure word of Prophesie, Here
is to be understood first a sure word, Secondly a more
sure word, for the Apostle in that Chapter speaking of their
diligence towards them that did believe, and declared unto
them that they had not followed devised fables, when we
made known unto you the Power and coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, but are eye witnesses of his Majesty, verse 16.
and heard the voice from this excellent glory, <hi>this is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son in whom I am well pleased,</hi> when we were with him
in the Mount, this was as sure a word to the Apostles as any
that ever the Prophets had spoken before was to them, and
so the Old Testament could not be more sure then this
which they had from the excellent glory, but this was not
so sure unto them to whom <hi>Peter</hi> wrote, and this was
only the Apostles Declaration, but the word of prophesie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which he exhorted them unto was nearer them then any
of the Prophets words or the Apostles Testimony of what
they had heard in the Mount, the testimony of Jesus is the
Spirit of prophesie, to wit that which bears witness against
sin and to righteousness, from this the Prophets spoke, and
this was that publike thing or Spirit, and they that speak not
from it speak from a private spirit of their own, and this
word of Prophesie or that wherein they could see or foresee
things to come, they were to take heed unto as unto a light
which shined in a dark place, and this was the more sure
word which he directed to, which in all thy Book thou quarels
against, and through this they saw the appearance, and
knew the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in Power and
great Glory, and did see the day dawn and the day Star arise
in their hearts, and they were to attend to this not onely
before, but also after, for by the Word of his Testimony
the Saints did overcome, and so all thy Interpretations are
false, and thine is the private Interpretation, and not from
that sure word of prophesie which the Prophets and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38415:14"/>
took heed unto, and through which they interpreted
things truely according to the mind of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the story of</hi> false Teachers arising and prevailing
among People, and what the signal nature is, <hi>and thou sayest</hi>
they are sent as scourges and as judgements to them who have not
received the Truth in the love of it, and thou brings a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
I came in my Fathers Name and ye received me not, <hi>John 5.</hi>
but if another shall come in his own Name him you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p>Its manifest that thou comes not in his name nor in Christs
Name, and if not so, in thy own name thou comes by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of the General Court at <hi>Boston,</hi> and so there will
few believe thy fabulous stories which are not worth rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
which will cast a mist before the eyes of them who cannot
see through thy deceit, and the sum is, thou sayest, of all
that the Doctrines of Devils audatiously deseminated, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
themselves to be sent of God, are signal signs of
evil times.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of Devils hath long been seminated audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously

the true Church, the Woman cloathed with the Sun hath
been in the wilderness, in a solitary place exiled because of
the Beasts power, and the Dragons Power and the false
Prophets Miracles, and because of the Doctrines of Devils,
has made it a sad time and an evil time, such as thou hast

with is grosse darkness, and worse then grosse darkness, and
that Christ left Political Officers, and that the Lords Supper
is a visible Political Church Ordinance, and that Baptism is

out of confusion and distruction; and thou must not think
to fasten <hi>Stork</hi> and <hi>Muncer</hi> upon us for thy proof, what as
they did stands upon their account and not upon ours, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38415:15"/>
that mischievous spirit of thine is that which presseth on the
Magistrate to abuse his Power, and to intrude into those
things which belongs not to him, to keep up your confused
<hi>Babel</hi> which thou calls a Political Church, which must all be
scattered with the breath of his mouth and with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his coming, whom thou yet Judges to be gross dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In thy 18th page, &amp; in the 44th page thou speaks</hi> That vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Political Church, Church-Officers and Church-Ordinances
are Gospel Institutions appointed by Christ to continue to the end of the
world, and that Command which <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Timothy</hi> is to be
kept, and that visible Political Church Estate is to continue to the end
of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I see thou art ignorant of God, Christ, Heaven,
Church, Church-Officers, Ordinances and Institutions,
the Churches of Christ were established by and in the
Power of God, and the Ministers thereof ministred, walked
and ruled in the Power of God, and the Ordinances and
Institutions of the true Church of God are pure and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
but the Church that thou art pleading for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
thereof, is a Political Church, Political Ordinances,
Political Officers, Political Institutions, Political Pastors
and Teachers, the Lords Supper a Political Ordinance,
Baptism a Political Ordinance, the spiritual Councel which
<hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Timothy</hi> about the Elders of the Church, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Holy Practise which they were to walk in, and the
godly conversation this thou calls Political; nay, further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
thou saist, <hi>Heaven stands in Policy;</hi> and in thy fourth
Chap. saith, <hi>To Christ belongs the prerogative of being the onely
Politician;</hi> these and the like damnable doctrines and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
thou hast uttered forth, and these must be proved from
the first of <hi>Tim. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> and Chap. 3. did <hi>Paul</hi> when he wrote
to <hi>Timothy</hi> when he gave him direction about Elders and such
as took care of the Church of God, did he say a Bishop is a
Political Officer, and must be blameless? or did he say a
Deacon is a Polical Officer and must be grave? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Reader thou may read these Scriptures; <hi>1 Tim. 6. 14.
1 Cor. 14. 33.</hi> and thou maist see this Sophister, and this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38415:16"/>
man that is void of understanding, who cryeth up the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
for a Rule of life, and yet holds such a Church, such
Pastors, such Officers, such Ordinances, such Institutions
which the Scripture makes no mention of, and therefore
this man having made a Monstrous body, a Politick Church,
he imagines a head like it, and therefore blasphemously
saith, Christ is the greatest Politician; much I need not say
unto this black dark stuff, which is to be confounded, which
is imaginary and deceit, which the wrath of God must scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but this I say to thee, there was no Officers in the
Church of Christ, but they were Ministers made so by the
Spirit, and were made so by the Holy Ghost, and were Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Spirit and not of the Letter, and some were
Elders and Ruled in the Church and Churches, which was
sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Christ Jesus,
and these were spiritual, and not Political; but thou hast
cleared and quitted your selves from being any such
Church, and that which you call the Sacrament which thou
calls visible and Political, and brings 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. for thy proof,
did <hi>Paul</hi> say as often as ye eat this Political bread, and drink
this visible Political Cup you shew forth the Lords death till
he come? and did Christ when he sent forth his Disciples to
preach and to Baptize in the 28th of <hi>Matth. 19.</hi> which thou
pleads must continue until the end of the world? did he send
them and say, go and Teach and Preach the visible &amp; Politick
Word of the kingdom, and Baptize them with visible Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
water, and that this should continue to the end of
the world? And little marvel if the Throne of Sathan be
exalted among you, and such Ministers as thou who Ministers
deceit, and unrighteousness and ungodliness, art set to be
a Teacher, and appointed so by the General Court, who

            <p>
               <hi>And last of all thou art coming to the Magistrates power

Notwithstanding manifold evils prevails, and the wiles of the Devil
are great and malignant, and heresie which is a horrid aspect; <hi>yet
thou saith,</hi> There is Balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi> and a Physician there;
<hi>and the Balm and the Physician is that thou saith,</hi> God hath
armed the Magistrate with Civil power for the defence of Religion,
through the Concurrences of Devine Benediction, and the Magi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<hi>of whom is</hi> Hymenius <hi>and</hi> Alexander, <hi>whom I have delivered
up unto Sathan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans</hi> It seems your Gospel that you preach hath not power in
it to prevail against Heresie, neither your weapons are able
to prevail which are but carnal; and so the Power to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Heresie and Convince Gain-sayers is wholly without
you, and though you Censure and Excommunicate, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up to Sathan, as you say, yet you being in Sathans power,
that which is against you hath Power over you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you are fain to cry up the Beasts power, which alwayes
made War with the Saints under the name of Hereticks, and
you say, that in exercising of his Power is but defensive,
I say yes it is offensive and distructive to the Government of
Christ and his Prerogative, unto whom all Power belongs
both in Heaven and Earth, and the Government lies upon
his shoulders, who is a wonderful Councellor, of whose
Government there is no end; and he is able to defend his
Church; and further more to take away thy objection is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38415:17"/>
and furthermore hath promised to keep his Church that
the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it; and therefore
thou who would have the civil Magistrate to intrude into
those things which belongs not to him, would have them
Usurpers and Traytors unto Christ the Prince of Peace, and
the King of his People and head of the Church his body,
unto whom absolute Power and Soveraignity belongeth and
Glory, which he will not give to another; And as for all
the proofs which thou brings of the Magistrates under the
first Covenant, they are all invalid, as to the second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
for all the Kings and Magistrates in the first Covenant
what as they did in and about Religion, as to the punishment
of the false prophets, and them that had familiar spirits
and wizards, they were but Typical as in reference unto
Christ the second, Covenant who hath another way to kill
the false Prophets and to make War against Heresie and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
and against all Sorcerers, Deceivers and Antichrists,
by the two-edged sword which proceeds out of his mouth,
with which his enemies shall be slain who will not that he
should Rule and exercise his spiritual Power against his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
enemies; Is not Heresie an Errour, an inbred thing?
And is an outward sword like to reach to that? Therefore
though thou may press the Magistrates or them whom thou
calls so by their Coersive power, as thou calls it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to them devine Benediction, like the <hi>Pope,</hi> for making
of Laws against that which thou and others may Judge Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
and Heresie, and execute them with Whips and
Ropes and cutting off Ears, and destroying the Creature,
yet this doth not reach to Heresie and Blasphemy, and all
the Balm and Physick that you have in <hi>New England,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your hope standeth, as hath yet appeared, are your
knotted Whips and pitched Ropes, banishment and death;
here is Balm and Physick indeed which destroys the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

            <p>
               <hi>Thou frames an Objection, and also an Answer,</hi> That the

of Conscience; <hi>thy Answer is,</hi> Church Authority is Authority, were
this Objection good, the Church may not then, <hi>thou saith,</hi> Authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deal with any of her Members, for holding forth or teaching of false
doctrine, contrary to <hi>Gal. 5. 12. and Rev. 2. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Objection is good enough, the interposing of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Authority in matters of Religion is a leading them beyond
their line, for that which is ordained for the ordering of Civil
things is not to intrude into that which is beyond its Sphere;
And why may not the true Church Authoritatively deal with
any of her Members for holding forth false doctrine? What
dost thou think that <hi>Paul</hi> in the fifth of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> when he
wished that they were even cut off that troubled them, that
he would have had them killed or beat with pitched Robes?
or would he have had the <hi>Galatians</hi> to have denied them, and
have them exercised their Authority in the Power of the Lord
Jesus Christ? And dost thou bring <hi>Rev. 2. 20.</hi> to prove that
<hi>Thyatira</hi> had not Power in the Authority of God to have thrown
out and Judged <hi>Jezebel?</hi> This was their fault, because they
suffered her, who called her self a Prophetess, to teach and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
and to eat things sacrificed to Idols, or thou Judges they
wanted some Magistrate to kill her Authoritatively; And if the
Church may not deal with the Members Authoritatively, who
makes defection from the Faith, why have you Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and thrown out so many for Hereticks in <hi>New England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou saith,</hi> Liberty of Conscience, and liberty for Errour and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
are two things; and the Error of Conscience is a Liberty to Bondage,
<hi>and thou brings,</hi> They shall put you out of the Synagogues, <hi>John 16.</hi>
and to think to murther the Saints was service unto God, was not from
Conscience but Errour of Conscience; <hi>but the Ob<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ect thou saith,</hi>
Subjected to the Coersive Power must be some Act of the outward man;
<hi>and further thou saith,</hi> There is a difference between quiet Heresie
and turbulent Heresie, Schism and Sedition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, Liberty of Conscience and liberty of Errour
and Heresie are two things, but these lyes both without the
Power and the Line of any Civil Power, as Civil Power to reach
unto, the one he should encourage, that is to say, them who
exercise a pure Conscience towards God and towards man;
and as for the other Errour in Judgement, its beyond the Power
of the Civil Magistrate to rectifie, but as it puts forth it self in
outward Acts of wickedness, as to kill, steal, murther, adultery,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38415:18"/>
defrauding, cozening and cheating in outward things, then the
sword reaches to the Act outward, but can reach no further;
And as for Heresie, Schism, Sedition, turbulent and quiet, as
thou makes distinctions, they are all one in the ground, and
you have had too many such thoughts in your hearts as that you
did God service with all your Whipping, cutting off Ears, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with Ropes, casting out of your Assemblies, and not onely
so, but out of your Countrey, and banishing them from their
Wives and Children, and all this you have done, and thinks
you have done God good service, and have cast them out and
said (as the Prophet spoke of your Generation whose hearts
were hardned) <hi>Let the Lord be glorified;</hi> these things you have
to repent of before you know or will feel remission of sins from
the Lord, though thou say you know it belongs not to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
to compel any man to be a Believer, nor to punish any
for not Believing, but Hereticks, turbulent Hereticks, we believe
belongs unto him to punish, and who must be Judge of turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Hereticks; Is not a Heretick an Unbeliever? And if the
Magistrate ought not to punish an Unbeliever, then not a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
for a Heretick is an Unbeliever; and they which are in
the Power and Authority of God, can deny such a one and
Judge him out by the Power of God, there is his punishment
according to that which thou calls Gospel Institution, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that or any further Act upon such a one, we do not read
of in all that which is called the New Testament, neither that
Christ, his Apostles or any of the true Churches or Officers or
Believers ever Commanded or Commended or Exhorted any to
stretch forth their hand against the person of any who were He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
really so, and Blasphemers really so; and therefore see
there is neither Command, Precept nor Example; Doth not
thou wretchedly err in pressing on them which thou calls Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to Act such wretched Acts of cruelty as you have done,
and thou vindicates them in it as their Duty? It's true, we
read of the Beast and of the Dragon, who made War against
the Saints and killed them, and of mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Egypt</hi> where Christ was slain, and the witnesses slain;
Now if thou wilt take these for proofs and for a ground thou
may, and so all thy twisting and twining, and vain Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
falls to the ground; And doth not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
account all you as Hereticks? and is not their Judgement that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38415:18"/>
they ought to punish you with corporal punishment? and is not
this your Judgement also page 78 that the Magistrate ought to
proceed gradually? That is, to inflict punishment by degrees
with lingring tortures, like their Inquisitions; And wherein
doth thy doctrine differ from theirs in this? Take them to
thee and thy doctrine, for thou art but a stem sprung out of the
same Root, and acts from the same Principle, and yet I tell thee
and all the world, I am not pleading for any matter of fact or
for breakers of the Law which is Righteous, for the Law is good
if a man use it lawfully, it is against murtherers, man-stealers,
and stealers of the Creatures, for Idolaters and defrauders,
and cheaters, and every Act or Fact deserves punishment suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the transgression; Now had it not been more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
done of thee to have produced the Fact of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in
<hi>New England,</hi> which hath deserved all these barbarous tortures,
then to Declare them and Publish them as Offenders in matter
of Fact, and hath none to lay to their charge; and I challenge
thee and the rest of thy Adherents to produce some matters of
Fact which the <hi>Quakers</hi> hath done, which is contrary to any
Righteous Law of God, or else own your Condemnation and
repent; and thou must not think that this poor Tract of thine
which is full of deceit and confusion, errour, blasphemy and
madness, though thou Publish it by the Appointment of the
General Court, that it will cover your wickedness or hide you
from being discovered to moderate People, neither will shelter
you in the Day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thou saith,</hi> It concerneth <hi>New England</hi> awayes to remember,
that originally they are a Plantation Religious, the Profession of purity of
Doctrine, Worship and Discipline is written upon your fore-heads,
that after <hi>New England</hi> hath now shined 20 years, should now go out
in the snuff of Morallianism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There was something amongst some of you, but you
fled the Cross as I told you before, and so that spirit that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
you in the Bishops time got up in your selves, and that
which once you had while you were under affliction here, yon
have lost, not onely the Power of godliness but the Form thereof,
and also of sound words; And now as to matter of Religion,
its rather become a place of Ostridges and Owles and Satyrs;
and for purity of Doctrine, Worship and Discipline written in
your fore-heads, if it must be tryed by your Rule, and if it be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38415:19"/>
the same 20 years that it is now, I have not heard of more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundness
in Doctrine, Worship and Discipline which I have
read on in many ages, but especially in the Scripture, and truly
your shining now is turned into blackness, and your Sun is set,
and your day is darkness, and your light is gone out as the
snuff of a Candle, because this man boasts of their Doctrine,
Worship and Discipline, take a few things out of many and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them in the light of the Lord, and compare them with
the Scripture; and so I leave them to thy Judgement.</p>
            <p>1 First speaking of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> he saith, God is a distinct
subsistance from the Son and the Spirit, and that the Son is a
distinct subsistance from the Father and the Spirit in the 9th
page; and because it is said, the Father shall give you another
Comforter; this another he saith, is Intelligible of the Essence;
so then the Son is a distinct Subsistance and Essence from
the Father, and the Spirit is a distinct Subsistance and Essence from the
Father and the Son; so here is three distinct Essences.</p>
            <p>2 And that the Spirit of God without the Letter is no Spirit,
that which obligeth a man to obey a Command of God is one
Power, and that which strengthens him and enables him to
obey is another Power, page 12. and that Christs words in the
17th of <hi>John 21.</hi> gives an uncertain sound (which are these,
<hi>That they may be one as we are one.</hi>)</p>
            <p>3 That Scripture is a perfect Rule of Life, but not without
Consequences.</p>
            <p>4 That <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> is no where mentioned in Scripture,
neither are commanded obedience nor forbidden disobedience,
contrary to <hi>John 20. 16, 17, 27.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 That that light which teaches a man there is a God, and
to Worship God, and that Parents are to be honoured, and that
a man shall not lye nor steal, and that which discovers the
Creator his Eternity and Omnipotency, is to be construed in
opposition to spiritual light, and contradistinct to the light of
the Spirit, page 16.</p>
            <p>6 That the light which is in every man, hath much miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
whilst that it is managed by the reigning power of darkness,
page 17.</p>
            <p>7. That that which lets a man see that he should not do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
what he would not have others do unto him, and shewes a
man ought not to steal nor to lye, and that which discovers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38415:19"/>
and Omnipotency; this indeed, saith he, is darkness,
it is worse then gross darkness, page 18.</p>

that are so and so qualified.</p>

            <p>Take a view of thy doctrines again, and be ashamed and

            <p>OH! <hi>New England</hi> whose heart is unbroken, and is as hard as
a stone, thy fruits declares it, and thy Iuhabitants are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
against God, thy Teachers and People are filled with
enmity against the Lord and his People, and they have not
known sorrow, nor are they acquainted with the Lord in his
Judgements, but the Rebellious, and stiff-necked lives in them;
and they are covered with a Profession of Gospel, but are as the
Wolves in sheeps clothing, who is covered with the Saints
words and Practices, but are destroying the Lambs of Christ; oh!
<hi>New England,</hi> what hast thou done? how thou hast greedily
run in the way that is not good, how hast thou opposed the way
of thine own peace, and rejected the loving kindness of the
Lord, we have heard, and we have seen, and we have been
sencible of thy wickedness, of thy mercilesness and thy cruelty
which abounds in thee, and art without respect to God aud
his Eternal Power which is over you, though you oppose it;
yet you are comprehended with it, and it shall Eternally Judge
you; your Church hath brought forth bad fruits, even of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and spiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the streets is the Lamb slain,
and the just crucified, and ye are the People that have done it,
doth not your dealing towards the People of God called Quakers
evidence this unto all the World? and Nations do hisse at you;
what, ye a gathered People? what ye a seperated People? and
brings forth persecution in such a manner, exceeding the very
cruelty of the Scribes and Pharisees, and the chief Priests, this
Nation hath wondered at your hard heartedness, &amp; sober People
are grieved at their hearts for you, that you should so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
your souls to everlasting loss, as to go on in this way as
you have done for years together, every day as it were heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
your malice and your fury against the Lamb and his
followers; Oh you Teachers and Professors which hath openly
appeared under the Dragons; Collours, who hath Warred under
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38415:20"/>
his Banner, even the Dragon which sought to devour the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child,
and by him do you make War against the Lamb and
his followers, with the Dragons weapons, Prisons, houses
of correction, whippings, banishments, cutting off the ears,
and such like cruel dealing, which is of the Dragon his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and not the weapons of the Lamb; oh what have you
done, is there not a wise man among you, are you all besotted,
and inchanted, are you all blind, is there none among you that
considers these things, hath not your own doings pierced your
hearts? hath not the innocent blood that you have shed yet struck
terrour upon your consciences? can nothing awaken you, will
not your own doings reprove you? oh consider, for you are not
hid from the Eternal eye of God, it beholds you, and you
are naked and bare before it; and your filthiness and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
is open before it, oh what floods of wickedness do
you cast out? and what wicked practices do you bring forth?
we are wounded in our spirits for you because you have lost all
feeling and sence, and are void of understanding, your ears
dull, your eyes blind, and your hearts hardned, and hath
neither Religion nor pure humanity; but do you think to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
against the Lord by your doings? do you think to weary
him out from among you? No he is stronger and his Kingdom
and Government of more force, and though he is long
suffering, yet he can dash you to pieces, and take your breath
from you, and cause you to melt away, and sink you into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and destruction, and his truth will prevail over you,
for there is a seed which you cannot quench, there is a root
which will bring forth though you choak it never so much, and
in all your glory you shall wither and pine away, and your
flower shall be cut down, and your strength shall become weak as
water, and your Authority shall sink into the bottomless pit,
and there is no vision unto you of peace and prosperity in
your way; but you shall fall with no small weight of dishonour
and affliction which shall be your portion, for God is just and
all Power is with him to break you to pieces, and he can make
you know, that he can do whatsoever he will, and you are but
as the pot-sheards of the Earth which he will break, and his
heritage shall be increased, and he will not be wanting to it,
his People shall have peace when you shall have trouble, his
People shall have joy when you shall have mourning, he shall
appear to their joy but you shall be ashamed; for your portion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38415:21"/>
shall not be like unto theirs, but the wrath of the Lamb shall
torment you, even the long suffering of God, which hath been
great towards you, shall be turned into a devouring fire, and
into fury to consume you, this shall doubtless come to passe,
for the Lord hath said it; wherefore repent ye Rulers, repent
ye Teachers, repent ye hypocrites, and if there be any among
you that will be saved, let him deliver himself by turning to
the Lord.</p>
            <p>But besides all that you have done, by way of persecution, imprisonment,
lies and slanders, cutting off ears, banishment and whippings and such like, yet
after all this here is a Book come over, Called the <hi>Heart of New England Rent</hi>
filled with false reproaches, with slanders, with false Doctrines, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations
o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Scripture, and such like stuff, which we have taken notice
of and viewed over, and returned Answer; what is this your best Divinity in
<hi>New England?</hi> we have heard of your wicked practices towards the people of
God, but now we have seen the wickedness of your Profession, and the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Religion and Doctrines, and we cannot but turn them back to you
again that if possible the Lord may open your eyes that you may be converted,
and live; and what do we fear your revilings and threatnings and your perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
in the immortal Life is our victory, which Life you cannot Reach, for
the Devil hath not power given over it; though you may have power over the
body, and over the goods, yet the immortal Life you cannot touch; and that
is Eternal victory, and that Life is our God bringing forth more and more, and
he can deliver if he will, but if he will not, we cannot bow to your Image;
nor say we have done you wrong in what we write and speak to you; for this
is our Religion, that our Conscience may be kept clear, and our zeal for God
is in this, that we may keep void of offence towards God and towards you;
by warning of you from time to time, and though we are far distant in the
outward man, yet we have a witness in your consciences; and in that we know
you, and by that shall be answered in the dreadful day of the Lord, and that day
is coming upon you, and the Judgements of the Lord the wicked shall not

               </gap>scape.</p>
            <p>O have you forgotten since you were sufferers your selves, and then it was well
with you, far better then now; for you are at ease in the flesh and have forgotten
God, and lost that sincerity which once was in you, and the very spirit of the
old Bishops which once persecuted you it is entered into your hearts, and now
li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es in you, and acts you, and in the dayes of your prosperity you are exalted,
and have forgotten the Lord, and you requite him evil for his love, and seem,
to be a people given up to do wickedly till the time of your distruction, and
like Rulers, like Teachers, all in the hard-heartedness, and in the pathes of
death and destruction, your Church, your Ministry, your Religion is all of it a
weariness, and abomination to the Lord, while that spirit of murder, and
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alice lodges in you; wherefore repent, least you perissh, the day of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
is approaching; the terrible day of the Lord is at hand;
<hi>I am a lover of righteousness and a friend to the Seed of God
throughout the world, and that waits for the Redemption
thereof.</hi>
