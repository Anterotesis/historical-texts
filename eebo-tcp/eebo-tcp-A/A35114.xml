            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW many Pens have been imploied in this Enquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Place of the Terreſtial Paradiſe,</hi> and how much rubbiſh hath been digged up, and duſt raiſed, to the great hindrance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering that which was ſo eagerly ſought for by a multitude of contradictory Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſome of them hardly reconcileable to Senſe or Reaſon, is ſufficiently known to all, and is too manifest by the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. For while ſome have evacuated the Letter, to plant a Cabalistical or Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Paradiſe of their won, others ſought for Paradiſe under the Orb of the Moon, or far above the tops of the higheſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, without the vierge of this habitable

world; and others taking it for the whole compaſs of the Earth, and others for this part, others for that, ſome under the Equinoctial line, and ſome under the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Pole, or Antarctick Circle, ſome in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> ſome in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſome in <hi>Syria,</hi> ſome in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and ſome of late in <hi>France;</hi> (and indeed where not, where a wanton fancy or an ignorant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence is pleaſed to place it?) and with no leſs abſurdities vexing the four Rivers with incredible down-falls and upriſings, in ſo occult paſſages and ſtrange diſtances, that to undertake in good earneſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them were to be mad for company: It is come to paſs that the faith of very many hath been ſtumbled, and in ſome turned to ſo profeſſed a deſpair of finding that place, that they count it not onely an impoſsibility, but an impiety, to attempt a diſcovery of it; <hi>(Impie, locum quaeris quem Deus occultum velit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pererius.)</hi> Though it cannot be denied
<pb facs="tcp:57762:5"/>
that <hi>Moſes</hi> did on purpoſe enlarge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſo full and exact a Topography, (the like not to be found in the Scriptures, or ſcarce any Secular Author) to acquaint the men of his Age, (whereto his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is fitted) and all ſucceeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, with the true Situation of that Place. But (which is worſt of all) beſide the miſchief hereby occaſioned to Believers, it hath opened the mouths of Atheiſts and Infidels, to impeach the Holy Scriptures of falſhood, who (both in former and latter daies) have hereby taken advantage to propound the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be conſidered at no higher a rate then a mere <hi>Romance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first that I meet withall (after the Dotages of the School-men upon this Queſtion were found ſo far unable to occur, as rather to foment this Scandal,) was <hi>Auguſtinus Steuchus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gubium,</hi> who, by the advantage of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, (whereof he was Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)
<pb facs="tcp:57762:6"/>
did firſt (as himſelf ſaies in his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Coſmopoeia</hi> upon <hi>Geneſis)</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to aſſert the Deſcription of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> to a Conſonance of Historicall and Geographicall verity: And herein he was followed by divers Learned men: and in <hi>Anno 1581.</hi> the Divines of <hi>Lovain</hi> ſet out a Topographicall Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Map of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> (according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he had hinted) about the Confluence of <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> in <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> But the Learned <hi>Franciſcus Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> purſuing the overture of that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, but pitching the place a little more to the North in the ſame Region, did with ſo much accurateneſs clear this Queſtion, that the whole Church of God is much beholden to him for this, and not a little for other his Annotations relating to Sacred Geography, wherein I know none before him, and very few ſince him, that are to be admitted to a Competition of the honour of that ſervice. And if that
<pb facs="tcp:57762:6"/>
Worthy man had been as happy in pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the right place, as he was ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate in his Deſcription of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> there would have needed no more to have been ſaid upon this Argument, for ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that imbred deſire we all are affected with, to know the Place of our Firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Habitation, or to <hi>ſtop the mouth of the Enemy and Blaſphemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my younger years and firſt Tyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciny in Divinity, while I was yet more patient of ſtudy, (my body not being then broken with ſo many and great infirmities as now it is, and for many years hath been) I was deſirous (according to the means that I had) to ſatisfie my ſelf in this Queſtion. For though it be not of ſo high a nature but that many a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, holding the myſtery of Faith in a pure Conſcience, may be ignorant of it without hazzard of his Salvation; yet I alwaies conceived that when we ſpeak of Theology as a Science, (which is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion
<pb facs="tcp:57762:7"/>
of the Divine) whatſoever the Holy Ghoſt hath revealed in the Sacred Code, though of remoter concernment, belongs <hi>ex officio</hi> to our cogniſance and ſtudy. The Opinion of <hi>Junius</hi> having at that time ſo univerſally obtained, and (which is rare, and an argument of the great veriſimilitude that it carried with it) being both approved and improved by Learned men of both Perſuaſions, (both Proteſtants and Papiſts) I ſaw great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to acquieſce in it, as believing it might be made good againſt all oppoſitions; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, upon a ſtricter examination, ſome Doubts did ariſe, and afterwards multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, to ſuggeſt a fear whether he might not have miſtaken his ground, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whether it might be ſafe to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the trial of this Queſtion upon thoſe Evidences which the place he pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might ſeem to afford. And hereupon being brought again under an unquiet of mind, I was enforced to caſt about, and

It is now ſix and twenty years agoe and upward ſince the firſt (and onely) Copy was drawn up, with no intention at all as then, and long time after, (till of very late) to publiſh it: in which ſpace of time I have had occaſion to obſerve divers collateral Teſtimonies, which might have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into the Text for confirmation and illuſtration of many paſſages in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; but that I abhorr the very thought of a new task, to the certain ruine of my health, already broken even to a diſability of writing, otherwiſe then by the hand of an <hi>Amanuenſis.</hi> And for this cauſe I have waved the advice of ſome, whom I have great cauſe to reſpect, perſuading me to put it into the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, and to divide the continued Diſcourſe into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sections with their Summaries, for the more accommodate uſe and eaſe of the Reader, (for the ſupply of that defect I acknowledge to be wholly due to the favour and pains of a Friend,) being content to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
<pb facs="tcp:57762:9"/>
and ſubmit it as it was in the firſt Copy, without any alteration at all, to the Judgment of this Church in which I was born, and in which, by the Grace of God, I ſerve, hoping for her Indulgence in faults upon the by, ſo I approve mine intention in the main, which is briefly this; <hi>That there was in</hi> Armenia Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>a Region called</hi> Eden, <hi>in the Eaſtern part whereof there was and is a River, which with one entire Chanel having watered the place where the Earthly</hi> Paradiſe <hi>was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, doth afterward branch it ſelf into four Streams, each reſpectively running in the ſame Courſe, and through the ſame Countreys as</hi> Moſes <hi>hath ſet them, and the Countreys themſelves even in after-Ages retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Names and Characters by which he hath deſcribed them.</hi> Each particular whereof if I have made good by the teſtimony of <hi>two or three</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57762:9"/>
credible <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> (for the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no more, and I have brought no leſs;) I ſhall acknowledg I have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what I aimed at, and ſhall contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear the imputation of many other fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings upon the by, which were impoſsible for me to avoid. For under that imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diſcovery which we have of thoſe places where the ſcene of this Diſcourſe lies, none of the Ancients having furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with Tables but onely <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> and his but imperfect ones, and few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing thoſe Regions to any purpoſe, ſo that it was neceſſary to make up that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by ſcattered Teſtimonies to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red here and there where I could find them, and to be managed many times by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures; it will be no wonder if I become obnoxious to miſtakes; and he ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his Intereſt in the common Humanity that ſhall be too rigorous in imputing them. Grant me, upon the Teſtimonies here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, that Four ſuch Streams as <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57762:10"/>
ſpeaks of were acknowledged for real in after-Ages, and if I erre in the preciſe point of place where any of them breaks from the main Stream, or in the Decourſe of it with all it its gyres and windings, with the reception of other Rivers into it, and many ſuch like, I ſhall willingly acknowledge ſuch unavoidable miſtakes, ſo the main chance be ſaved. And as I ſpeak this with reference to the Map, which muſt ſerve as a Commentary to the Diſcourſe, and was drawn by me as near as I could to the Tables of <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> ſo in the Diſcourſe it ſelf, in thoſe larger Digreſsions which I make upon the Countries themſelves through which thoſe Rivers paſs, I will not affirm that every Conjecture I make is infallible, or that I may not have erred in divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars incidental to the Illuſtrations which were neceſſary for me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute: yet am I not onely willing, but deſirous, to ſee thoſe miſtakes amended.
<pb facs="tcp:57762:10"/>
and have ſome hope that, by the help of thoſe Learned men who have begun to open the treaſuries of the Orient unto us, particularly the Tranſlation of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> Geographers, much light may be fetched, as for rectifying what is amiſs, ſo for confirming much of what I have obſerved; which howſoever it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear New to the men of this Generation, I perceive by ſuch Writings as have been tranſlated ſince this Treatiſe was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, hath obtained the credit of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and received Truth in thoſe Eaſtern parts. And upon this occaſion I could wiſh, that having ſo great helps from the knowledge of Tongues, plenty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, and the like, a little more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence might be added, as for perfecting Sacred Chronology, ſo for improving Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Geography; for want of which not onely many excellent Treatiſes have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome blemiſhes, but a good portion of the Holy Text hath lain upon our hands
<pb facs="tcp:57762:11"/>
unimproved; yea (which is ſaddest of all, and therefore moſt to be heeded) ſome places of Scripture have been carped at, and made uſe of by the Adverſary, to elevate and diſparage the credit of it ſelf: as this very place which I have to diſcourſe upon may ſerve for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance too notorious, which through the negligence of former times, in not making out the truth of it by the help of Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, but blanching it over with Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or impertinent and ridiculous Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, hath ſuffered even to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a Fable, (for that is the uſual ſtyle that <hi>Julian</hi> in his Blaſphemous Rhetorications is accuſtomed to beſpatter the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> withall.) And this giveth me often occaſion to wonder, whence it ſhould come to paſs (except to palliate ſloth, and ignorance thence ariſing) that matters of this nature ſhould be ſo ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and accounted of by very many but as mere <hi>Parerga,</hi> or things of ſo minute
<pb facs="tcp:57762:11"/>
and invaluable conſideration as not to deſerve our ſtudy: whereas it is certain that, without the help of Sacred Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, the immediate Literal ſenſe of the Text (which is the Baſis of all true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation) cannot in many places be made out, nor the Hiſtory cleared, nor the Queſtions obviouſly preſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſcuſſed; ſo that if any one ſtick moroſely upon the ſpirit of any man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, it is hardly credible what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief this may amount to. For the wily Serpent, that early found a hole to creep into Paradiſe, if he can but get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon ſuch diſſatisfaction to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt a Temptation to diſcredit, or but doubt of, the truth of any Particle of Scripture, will by degrees improve it to a queſtioning, and at length a denying the truth of the whole. To quicken our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to this ſtudy, we have not onely the example of the Ancients, who held it to be of ſingular uſe, (as appears by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius's</hi>

An evident Specimen whereof we have in the Writings of the Learned <hi>Bochartus,</hi> and the hopeful Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures already begun, and ſucceſsfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, by our alike-learned Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot.</hi>

I look upon <hi>Junius</hi> as the ableſt Aſſertor of the Cauſe I contend for, and from whom I received the Light by which I was enabled to ſearch into this Queſtion: It is not the truth of the Hiſtory of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> that I have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

with him, but the Situation of it onely in reſpect of the place, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Deſcription to it; in which if I have found ſome reaſons (and here thou hast them) to believe that he might be miſtaken, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon have been bold to transferr the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to be ſet up in a more convenient place, I have but followed the example of <hi>Junius</hi> himſelf, (who in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dealt with thoſe that went before him) and reſerve a free liberty to every man to vindicate his Opinion from the Objections th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:57762:13"/>
And all this may be done without giving any advantage to the common Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who (how impudent ſo ever) can with no more pretence of reaſon draw this into conſequence, that there was no ſuch place as <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> or ſo ſituated as <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſet it, becauſe we are not yet fully agreed upon that very ſpot of ground where it was; then that there was no ſuch City in <hi>Perſia</hi> as <hi>Perſepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> deſtroied by <hi>Alexander,</hi> becauſe ſuch as have undertaken to give us an account of the Situation of it conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch Characters as ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians have deſcribed it by, are not yet agreed upon their Verdict, whether it was <hi>Shivaz,</hi> or <hi>Eſtacher;</hi> or that there were no ſuch Colonies of the <hi>Romans</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Lindum, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodunum,</hi> and many more, becauſe our Antiquaries are at variance in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the places where they ſtood, ſome placing them in one place, ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

As for thy part, (Chriſtian Reader, for ſuch I here ſuppoſe thee to be, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the infallible Veracity of the Holy Scriptures) it will be no point of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in thee to ſmite thy Friends, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thy Adverſaries: Our Contentions are no more but a farther advance in clearing and vindicating the Holy Text, in which thou and the whole Chriſtian (yea and <hi>Jewiſh)</hi> Church are equally ingaged as well as we: nor had this Diſcourſe of mine ever (with my conſent) ſeen the light, had I not lately been provoked thereunto upon this very Queſtion by the unſufferable Inſolence and Inſultation of ſome Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripturiſts, a Generation of men lately ſprung up amongſt us, and growing very numerous and exceeding bold, owing their extraction to the moſt virulent poiſon of the leven of the Phariſees and Sadducees, (the perpetual Peſts of true Religion) now complying together in a myſtical mixture, and much improved by the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual

<pb facs="tcp:57762:15"/>
Bible for no other end but to blaſpheme it; whom to diſcover and oppoſe. I doubt not but every good Chriſtian, whoſe heart is touched with any zeal for the Honour of God and his Holy Truth, will take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equally concerned to engage with me to the utmoſt of his power. As for thoſe whoſe cuſtom it is (as Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> hath obſerved long agoe) to make themſelves merry upon their Ale-bench with the Writings of others, and think themſelves extremely witty if they can break a ſcurrilous jeſt (the Evaporation of Drink and a profane ſpirit) either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Argument or the Author; as we are willing to take notice of them among the former company, ſo for their Cenſure we referr them to the Judgment of him who will take an account of every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak; in the mean time wiſhing them more ſobriety.</p>

Now it is well known that the ſame year in which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> came under the dominion of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were releaſed from their Captivity by the Edict of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to which time from the death of <hi>Moſes</hi> there had paſſed (by certain calculation) no leſs then 916 years; all which time (and long before) this River (it ſeems) had not exiſtence <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> and therefore could not be taken notice of in the book of <hi>Geneſis. Junius</hi> could not be ignorant how apt this ſcruple was to ariſe in the mind of the Readers, upon his producing the teſtimony of <hi>Pliny,</hi> and therefore ſeeks to elude the force of it, by ſuggeſting a ſuſpicion, that it was but a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and uncertain Tradition; for, giving the reaſon of the name <hi>Nahar-malca,</hi> he tells us it was ſo called, <hi>quòd alveum hunc ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio operâque Regam fuiſſe ductum putaret vulgus.</hi> But ſure they were not the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>

that <hi>Pliny</hi> meant by <hi>Sunt qui tradunt,</hi> but ſuch Authors as, having written the Deſcription and Hiſtory of thoſe parts, he makes uſe of, and now and then names ſome of them, in his Works.

The Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Scaliger</hi> was ſo fully ſatisfied of the truth of <hi>Pliny</hi>'s relation concerning the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this River by <hi>Gobares,</hi> that he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth (by an eaſie change of <hi>G</hi> into <hi>C)</hi> it took from him alſo (as the Author) the name of <hi>Cobar,</hi> and was (in his opinion) the very ſame with <hi>Cebar</hi> in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> where the captive <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were placed. But though I cannot (for ſome reaſons) ſubſcribe to this Opinion of <hi>Scaliger;</hi> yet is it far more probable then the Opinion of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who affirms it to be <hi>Piſon;</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Nahar-malca</hi> and <hi>Piſon</hi> there is no affinity, neither in ſound nor ſignification.

But to cut off this controverſie: Suppoſe this part of <hi>Babylonia</hi> were as well ſtored with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Trees for uſe and ornament, as it was fertil in bearing Corn; yet if the other parts of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s deſcription ſute not to it as well as this, the Argument from this alone will inferre no neceſſary Concluſion: for ſo <hi>Alſtedius</hi> himſelf hath taught us, that a <hi>Fallacy of the Adjunct</hi> is then committed; <hi>Cùm uno atque altero Adjuncto ſumptis, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum vis eſt imbecilla, neceſſariun concludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

               <p>FInding therefore no ſatisfaction in this Deſcription of <hi>Junius,</hi> leſt we ſhould ſeem more willing to find a fault, then to offer our beſt ſervice (though we well know how worthleſs that is) for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the truth; let us lift up our eyes again, and ſee if haply any other place may be diſcerned where this happy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ground, ſo much ſought after, may with greater probability be found out. And here we muſt make uſe of the River as our faithfulleſt Guide; which ſpringing out of <hi>Eden,</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith) afterward divideth it ſelf into four Heads, of which <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> (by the conſent of all) were two; not any petty Streams in <hi>Babylonia,</hi> but thoſe two famous and well-known Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which encircling <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> give it its name. But can it ever be proved that <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſpring out of the ſame Fountain? This indeed is the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57762:32"/>
in diſcuſſing whereof, if the ſame ſpirit that guided the pen of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably aſſiſt our weak endeavours, the reſt of our task will become far more eaſie. It cannot be denied, that the ſeeming-concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring teſtimony of Geographers to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hath ſo farr ſtumbled ſome otherwiſe godly and learned Divines, that they have broke forth into ſpeeches not very ſeemly. <hi>Luther, Tom. 6. Comment. in Gen.</hi> 2. calls this <hi>unum de maximis Scandalis in</hi> Moſe; and having debated this Queſtion of the diſtance of the Fountains in the vulgar way, concludes, <hi>Ergò</hi> Moſes <hi>evidentiſsimè con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra ſenſum pugnat.</hi> I will not diſſemble, that the reading of this paſſage ſtruck my ſpirit with ſome horrour, and often recalled my thoughts to this meditation, (which otherwiſe I was willing to have beſtowed in more profitable matters) to try if by any means this Scandal might be removed. And why ſhould we deſpair of effecting this, when even Secular Authours themſelves are not at agreement in aſſigning the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of theſe great Rivers; ſome finding them in one place, ſome in another; ſome at a larger, ſome at a nearer diſtance? A hopefull augure, that at length they may be found ſo near as to verifie the teſtimony
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57762:32"/>
of <hi>Moſes. Strabo</hi> (that grave and learned Geographer) ſets them very far aſunder, viz. near upon 312 miles. <gap reason="foreign">

But <hi>Procopius</hi> may ſeem to draw them nearer together, for thus he writes, <hi>De Bello Perſ. l. 1.

In the ſame Book he mentioneth a City of that name not far from <hi>Niſibis:</hi> Anaſtaſia <hi>Civitas condita eſt ab</hi> Anaſtaſio, <hi>ubi erat</hi> Dara <hi>in</hi>

Meſopotamia, <hi>à</hi> Niſibi 98 <hi>ſtad. diſtans, in Romanorum Perſarúmque confinibus, cui vicina</hi> Theodoſia. But this, being well within <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> could not be the ſame with the former, ſeeing it is certain that the Fountains of <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> were in <hi>Armenia.</hi> More likely it was that <hi>Theodoſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> mentioned by <hi>Euſtathius</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

But neither is that ſo preciſely bounded, that we have any thing of certainty to affirm concerning the ſituation of it; nor, if we had, would it be much material to the end we aim at: for though the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Procopius</hi> have ſerved us to bring the Fountains of theſe Rivers nearer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet ſeeing he confeſſeth them to be diſtinct, this will not ſerve our turn. But are there any then that do affirm them to ſpring out of the ſame Fountain? Surely, if <hi>Iſidorus Hiſpalenſis</hi> do not deceive us, either he himſelf or S. <hi>Hierome</hi> had read ſome ſuch thing in an authentick Author,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57762:33"/>
viz. <hi>Saluſt</hi> the Hiſtorian; for theſe are his words, <hi>Orig. l. 13. c. 21.

His own words, <hi>De loc. Heb. voce Euphrates,</hi> are theſe: Euphrates <hi>fluvius</hi> Meſopotamiae <hi>in Paradiſo oriens: Porrò</hi> Saluſtius <hi>author certiſsimus aſſerit tam</hi> Tigris <hi>quàm</hi> Euphratis <hi>in</hi> Armenia <hi>fontes demonſtrari. Ex quo animadvertimus ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter de Paradiſo &amp; fluminibus ejus intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum.</hi> That there is a conſiderable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt theſe two in relating the teſtimony of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> is obvious at firſt ſight,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57762:34"/>
without a Prompter: for beſides a larger addition in <hi>Iſidore,</hi> that main clauſe, Tigrim <hi>&amp;</hi> Euphratem <hi>uno fonte manare in</hi> Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, is no more in S. <hi>Hierome</hi> then, <hi>Tam</hi> Tigris <hi>quàm</hi> Euphratis <hi>fontes in</hi> Armenia <hi>demonſtrari;</hi> which they might well enough be, though removed at as great a diſtance as ſome have ſet them. Yet can we not honeſtly ſuſpect, that <hi>Iſidore</hi> would falſifie either <hi>Saluſt</hi> or <hi>Hierome</hi> for ſo ſmall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And the obſervation which <hi>Hierome</hi> makes upon <hi>Saluſt</hi>'s words argues, that he conceived ſomething in them remarkable above what was ordinarily to be found, for rectifying a common Errour about the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Paradiſe. Now that the Fountains of <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> were to be ſeen in <hi>Armenia</hi> was no news, nor worthy ſo ſolemn a preface to gain credit to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, it never being queſtioned by any, but obvious in every Hiſtorian as well as <hi>Saluſt.</hi> But if he obſerved and reported them to flow out of the ſame Fountain, (which was a Secret unto moſt) well might he commend the Teſtimony of ſuch a credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Writer to the conſideration of the men of his time, as a fair way to reconcile the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Moſes</hi> with the truth of Hiſtory, the ignorance whereof had put them upon
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57762:34"/>
ſuch prodigious fancies; and ſo his aime may ſeem to have been the ſame with ours, viz. by hinting this Teſtimony, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and procure belief, that nothing was reported by <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the Original of theſe Rivers, which (if inquired after) might not alſo be made appear by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Secular Authours. But becauſe this report of <hi>Saluſt</hi> comes to us onely at the ſecond hand, and that alſo ſomewhat obſcurely, we are content no more weight ſhould be laid upon it then what in prudence it may be ſuppoſed able to bear: nor is there need we ſhould, having a ſecond at hand ready to be depoſed upon the ſame thing, and that as clearly and fully as we can deſire.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57762:37"/>
                  <hi>The ſpitis</hi> is as probable a name as <hi>Thonitis,</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> calls it ſo, placing upon it a City called <hi>Thoſpia,</hi> from which in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility it borrowed this name. And though <hi>Strabo</hi> make this and <hi>Arſena</hi> the ſame Lake, yet <hi>Pliny</hi> doth not, but ſets them at a good diſtance; for the firſt Lake that <hi>Tigris</hi> runs into he calls <hi>Arethuſa, Ptolemy Arſiſſa,</hi> (in all probability <hi>Plutarch's Arſacis)</hi> but placed by him a Degree and more to the North of <hi>Theſpitis.</hi> But whether they were one or ſeveral Lakes, it is not much material to our purpoſe: Moſt likely it is that the Lake either gave or took its name from the River <hi>Arſanias</hi> flowing into it; and ſo did the Country about it, which <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy</hi> calls <hi>Arſea,</hi> others <hi>Arſena,</hi> but <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> alwaies either <hi>Arzane</hi> or <hi>Arxane;</hi> which hath ſo near affinity to <hi>Araxis,</hi> that it leaves us no juſt cauſe to doubt that <hi>Plutarch's Araxis</hi> is the ſame River that others call <hi>Arſanias.</hi> Which being ſo, we have found theſe Rivers meeting very early together, after which their firſt Conjunction they ſeem not to part aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a long time; for (ſo far as we can diſcern them) they run in the ſame, or a near-adjoyning, Chanel, they fall both into the ſame Lakes, dive into the ground

And that there was ſo, the Author of the Book of <hi>Judith</hi> may ſerve for a ſufficient witneſs: for relating the march of <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi>'s Army under the conduct of <hi>Holophernes</hi> towards the Weſt,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57762:54"/>
he tells us, Chap. 2. 21. that <hi>they went forth of</hi> Ninive <hi>three days journey towards the Plain of</hi> Bectileth, <hi>and pitched from</hi> Becti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>near the Mountain which is at the left hand of the upper</hi> Cilicia. It is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then can be denied, by the ſequel of the hiſtory, that the Mountain which is here ſaid to lie on the left hand <hi>(i. e.</hi> to the North) of the Region called <hi>Cilicia,</hi> was that part of Mount <hi>Taurus</hi> that boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria</hi> on that ſide; and the Plains of <hi>Bectileth</hi> are ſuppoſed by <hi>Junius</hi> to be the Plains that lay about the City <hi>Bithias</hi> not far from <hi>Samoſata.</hi> But whether that were ſo or no, (for it may well be doubted, becauſe <hi>Bithias</hi> lay more then three daies journey from <hi>Ninive)</hi> yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that hereabouts (and nearer <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive) Ptolemy</hi> ſets the Region <hi>Calacine,</hi> which <hi>Strabo</hi> calls <hi>Chalachena,</hi> and both of them might as well every whit have called it <hi>Cilicia,</hi> (for ſo <hi>Pliny</hi> calls ſome of the Inhabitants of thoſe parts <hi>Silices,</hi> or rather <hi>Cilices)</hi> which is indeed no other then that Region whither the captive <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> were tranſlated when they were led away into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 6. is called <hi>Chalach,</hi> and had its denomination from the City <hi>Chalach</hi> built by <hi>Nimrod,

Gen.</hi> 10. 11. near (as may ſeem) to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt North-weſt border of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> where we have formerly found this River to make its Diviſion. And the reaſon why this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal Author</hi> calls this Region the <hi>upper Cilicia</hi> was, (in all probability) with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that other better known in the Weſt, that lay upon the Receſs of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Sea; which had (no doubt) both its name, and the reaſon of it, from the ſame <hi>Hebrew</hi> Root with this. And ſo it appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that howſoever this report of <hi>Diotimus</hi> hath hitherto paſſed for little better then a prodigious Lie, yet it is indeed a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truth, and gives us full aſſurance of the Courſe of this River in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that we have ſet it. I might here far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adde ſomething concerning another name of this River, taken up (as ſeems) in after-times; and it is <hi>Zirma, Corma, Somra,</hi> and <hi>Samura.</hi> For <hi>Agathias</hi> finds it on the North of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> under the name of <hi>Zirma, Hiſt. l.</hi> 4.

But having already tired my
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57762:55"/>
pen in this tedious ſearch, and come at length within view of that which was ſought after, I willingly ſuperſede from that needleſs labour. For who is there now that in thoſe corrupted names of <hi>Cydnus, Indus,</hi> and <hi>Gyndes,</hi> may not eaſily diſcern the miſ-ſhapen lineaments of the name <hi>Gihon,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> makes one of the four Rivers of Paradiſe? And if upon this ground we take leave to ſuppoſe the name <hi>Oena</hi> (which <hi>Ammianus</hi> gives it) to have been anciently either written or pronounced <hi>Geona,</hi> none (I think) can juſtly challenge it for an over-bold conjecture. However, certain it is that divers of the names given to this River have been by others applied to <hi>Gihon. Geog. Nub.</hi> expreſly calls that River which others call <hi>Cydnus</hi> by the name of <hi>Gihon;</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> alſo notes, who farther obſerves, that <hi>Gihon</hi> (a River run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the South of <hi>Hieruſalem, 2 Chron.</hi> 32. 30.) is alſo by an equipollent <hi>Synonymon</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">

Truly I think he will hardly perſuade any that hath attentively conſidered the Chorography of theſe parts, that the River <hi>Choaſpes</hi> fell into that Stream of <hi>Tigris</hi> that runs by <hi>Seleucia</hi> and <hi>Cteſiphon;</hi> and yet it fell into <hi>Tigris</hi> too: for even this Stream we are in ſearch of was (even now) by <hi>Stephanus</hi> called <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris minor;</hi> and with this it fell, not into the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Lakes, (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, for no part of <hi>Tigris</hi> fell into them, but they were wholly made by the effuſion of <hi>Euphrates)</hi> but into the Lakes of <hi>Suſiana,</hi> (whoſe Coaſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57762:71"/>
towards the <hi>Perſian Gulf</hi> was very fenny, as <hi>Strabo</hi> notes) and in particular that very Lake whereinto we obſerved the former River to fall, as will immediately appear. But be it ſo, that ſome of the waters of this Northern Stream fell into the Southern at the ſame place where <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith they did; yet certain it is that it was not the whole body of the Stream, but ſome ſmall Chanel drawn out of it, which ſerved not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to make the incloſed portion of ground a perfect Iſland, and is therefore by <hi>Pliny</hi> himſelf, as well as <hi>Stephanus,</hi> called <hi>Meſene.</hi> But that the main Stream held his Courſe ſtill farther on towards the North-eaſt, we have the warant of <hi>Pliny</hi> himſelf to aſſure us, who finds a Town ſituate upon the Banks of it at ſo large a diſtance from <hi>Seleucia,</hi> as will forbid us to think it could in any probability run back again unto it: for thus he writes in the fore-mentioned Book and Chapter: <hi>In Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentrionali</hi> Tigris <hi>alveo Oppidum eſt</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tace. <hi>Abeſt à</hi> Suſis <hi>CXXXV.

a little before had ſet no leſs then 450 miles, out of which if we deduct 135, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtill 315 miles; all which this River having run before it attained <hi>Babytace,</hi> it is altogether incredible that the main Stream ſhould ever turn back again ſo ſuddenly, as to fall into <hi>Tigris</hi> about <hi>Seleucia:</hi> and indeed it did not, but held its Courſe ſtill on forward even to <hi>Suſa</hi> it ſelf, having firſt met with the former River <hi>Gihon,</hi> and <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſpes</hi> with it, and afterward the River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus;</hi> by which acceſs of Waters it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a mighty Stream, and flowing on ſtill towards the <hi>Perſian Gulf</hi> it carried all theſe Rivers along with it under its own name of <hi>Tigris,</hi> as we have learned before out of <hi>Strabo.</hi> And hence it is that <hi>Benjamin</hi> in his <hi>Itinerary</hi> calls the River that paſſed through <hi>Suſa Tigris,</hi> upon a Bridge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that joyned the two parts of the City, he tells of a memorable Monument of Glaſs hung up in iron chains, made at the coſt of a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prince in honour of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> if we may believe him. Nor is the name which this River holds at this day much diſſonant from its ancient appellation: for in our modern Maps the River which runs by <hi>Suſa</hi> is called <hi>Tiritri,</hi> which <hi>Conſtantine L'Empereur</hi> in his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57762:72"/>
Notes upon the place of <hi>Benjamin</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to have been corrupted from <hi>Tigris.</hi> And no doubt but this <hi>Tigris</hi> was it whoſe Chanel <hi>Eumenes</hi> filled with the ſlaughtered bodies of <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Souldiers attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting to force a paſſage over it: for ſo it is expreſly called by <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> who notwithſtanding had already told us of their quiet and uninterrupted paſſage over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Tigris</hi> long before they attained the place of this Defeat: for that was within a daies journey of <hi>Suſa,</hi> where <hi>Eumenes</hi> had his Head-quarters, having fortified the paſſages of this <hi>Tigris</hi> that flowed by it, while <hi>Antigonus</hi> was yet in <hi>Babylonia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting his Army, and framing a Bridge of Boats over that other Stream of <hi>Tigris</hi> that ran by <hi>Seleucia;</hi> which accordingly he did, and paſſed his Army over by it into <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiana</hi> without any lett or hindrance, finding no oppoſition, till, attempting the paſſage of this <hi>Tigris,</hi> he received that remarkable Overthrow. An evidence ſo clear of this Stream of <hi>Tigris</hi> which we now ſpeak of, that it is a wonder ſome good Chronologers ſhould not hereby rather have been led on to the obſervation of it, then ſo unjuſtly (as they do) to charge <hi>Diodorus</hi> with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of which he is no way guilty,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57762:73"/>
ſave only through the default of their own miſtake. Now if <hi>Tigris</hi> were the ſame that <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth <hi>Hiddekel,</hi> as <hi>Vatablus</hi> ſaith is agreed upon by all, we need not doubt to affirm this to be the third River of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> as finding it not onely paſſing under that name, but holding a Courſe ſo anſwerable to the Deſcription of <hi>Moſes</hi> as might ſerve alone to exclude all doubting. <hi>Gen. 2. 14. And the name of the third River is</hi> Hiddekel; <hi>that is it which goeth toward the Eaſt of</hi> Aſſyria. And ſuch and ſo agreeable to the ſame point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs is the Current of this Stream as <hi>Pliny</hi> hath ſet it, that we cannot deſire a better Commentary. For if (as we have heard him ſay) this Stream, after its breaking from the other at <hi>Apamia,</hi> ran upward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, <hi>(ad Septentrionem flexus)</hi> then it muſt of neceſſity bend its Courſe towards the Eaſt of the ancient <hi>Aſſyria:</hi> ſo that howſoever it watereth alſo the South ſide of that Region; yet this intimation of its inclination towards the North brings it up alſo to the Eaſt, with ſo large a bend as may well ſatisfie as much as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth require. And indeed that Teſtimony of <hi>Pliny</hi> doth repreſent to our minds the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of this River at a higher draught to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57762:73"/>
the North, then we know well how to expreſs in a Map, keeping any tolerable correſpondence with the Tables of <hi>Ptolemy.</hi> Beſides, the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſecured us that this River was <hi>Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekel,</hi> by the circumſtances of that famous Viſion which he ſaw upon the Banks of it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. where v. 4. he calls it <hi>the great River, which is Hiddekel.</hi> For if at the time when he ſaw that Viſion he was <hi>Preſident of Suſiana,</hi> and ordinarily reſident upon his charge in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of that Province, or the place where the Royal Court uſed to be kept, viz. <hi>Suſhan the Palace,</hi> (as may be gathered from <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 2. and is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> both in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. in lib.

The Author that affirms this is <hi>Methodius:</hi> a fabulous Author, (I confeſs) and full of droſs, among which notwithſtanding ſome grains of Gold may be found; ſo that if his Traditions be well ſifted, they may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times become helpful to us to ſpell out divers uſeful Antiquities, which we may in vain ſeek for in many a better Writer. Now this ancient Author <hi>(in lib. Revel.)</hi> ſpeaking of the death of <hi>Seth,</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of his poſterity from the poſterity of <hi>Cain,</hi> hath among other things this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage: <hi>Mortuo</hi> Seth <hi>ſeparavit ſe Cognatio ejus à ſobole</hi> Caini, <hi>redierúntque ad natale ſolum. Nam &amp; Pater eorum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens prohibuerat nè miſcerentur. Et ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitavit Cognatio</hi> Seth <hi>in</hi> Cordan <hi>monte, Paradiſo terreſtri proximo.</hi> If <hi>the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Paradiſe</hi> were near the <hi>Mount Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:57762:99"/>
and that <hi>Mount Cordan</hi> or <hi>Gordiae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſtood in the ſame place where <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> hath ſet it; then we may reſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, that the happy ſeat of our Firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Habitation was at or about the very place that we have deſcribed. And now to conclude: Though all theſe evidences laid together (which ſurely are as great as well may be expected in a Subject of this nature) have not raiſed our confidence to ſuch a height as ſome have attained to, (and, as we ſuppoſe, upon far weaker grounds;) yet we verily believe that if they whom God hath bleſſed with abler parts, more skill in the Tongues, Hiſtory, Geography, &amp;c. a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger freedom from other imployments and diſtractions, with a more plentiful ſupply of Books, and other accommodations for ſuch a ſtudy, (all which we want) would reſume this Argument, and apply their pens to the farther ſearch of this <hi>not-unneceſſary Queſtion,</hi> they might here (ſooner then in any other place yet diſcovered) find out <hi>the true place of the Situation of the Terreſtrial Paradiſe.</hi>
