            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The late News or Message from Bruxels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked:
And his Majesty vindicated, from
the base Calumny and Scandal therein fixed
on him.</head>
            <p>THe last night came to my view, a Paper intituled, <hi>News from Brussels,</hi>
&amp;c. At the reading whereof, I could not but in some measure be
astonished, to Imagine, that such exquisite Malice, should still have
its continuance, and prevalency amongst some people, against that
person who should (if they duely considered their duties,) be most Dear,
Tender, and Sacred to them; such a vein I perceived there was of forged
and fictitious stuff, put into a most malitious dress of Drollery, running
through the whole Tenor thereof, and snapping and biting all along as it
went, in that sense, as might be sure most to fix calumny and slander upon
that royal person, whom it chiefly intended to wound; That I could not
but contemplate thus with my self: Is it not enough that, That Innocent
Prince, ever since his Tender years hath been hunted like a Partridge upon
the mountains from place to place, from one nation to another people,
robbed and spoyled of his large and ample Patrimony and Dominions, and
enforced to live (as it were) upon the Alms and Charity of his Neighbour
Princes, But his bright and shining vertues, most manifest and apparent to the
whole world, must still be subject to the reproach and scandal of every lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
black and sooty quill? Wert thou a Christian (Base forger) and not
a foul feind rather, clothed with humanity; Methinks the consideration
of this very particular, should draw Tears from thine eyes, or rather blood
from thy heart, then such cursed drops of mischievous malice, to issue from
thy disloyal and corrupted brain? But if thou call to mind that transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
barbarous murder, of his most glorious and Martyred father, such as
no Age since <hi>Adam,</hi> ever paralell'd: And the deep stain of that Sacred and
and Royal blood (now crying under the Altar) which fasten upon thee;
And thy therein guilty and bespotted Soul, (For, it is more then guessed
who thou art) what horrour and trembling should justly seize thy joints,
and shake the scribling instrument, of such thy traitorously invented mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
out of thy loathed and bloody hands? After which contemplation,

               </gap> a more strict and wary view of the particulars in that scandalous
Scrole: And having observed, what cunning subtilty, This forger had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and what tools he had made use of, to stamp and Mint this false and
counterfeit Coyn, I resolved to publish it, which I am perswaded will not
be ingrateful to any, unless such, who are of the Forgers crew; and of what
sort and principles they are, it is well known.</p>
            <p>First, he hath prepared a number of letters, which he would have the
reader think, to intend the persons now about his Majesty, whose names
relate to them; But see, how in <hi>ipso Lumine,</hi> he berays his own fictitious
guilt; For this <hi>H. I.</hi> which he would have thought to be the L. <hi>Iermin,</hi>
this person was known to be elsewhere, far distant from <hi>Bruxels,</hi> at the time
of the date of that piece of Forgery: In the next place, it is observable,
That before he hath wrote five lines, he fixes a No<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ious lye upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and chargeth him with Swaering; A thing <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> manifestly known,
he is so free from, That all his Attendants may <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> challenged to relate, if they
can, whether, ever they heard a profane oath <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> come from him, much
less used upon such a ridiculous idle occasion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as this forger mentions; It
being Notorious that he is, and ever hath been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so reserved in bestowing
those ready Jewels of honour (The only Treasure he is, or can be unrob'd of)
That it is not any way probable, he should squander one away, for a Letter,
and less likely, that he should publickly say and swear this. Within a few
lines after he Talks of his Majesties Resolution to waft over into <hi>Ireland;</hi>
For his <hi>S. C. C.</hi> he would have understood, to be meant Sir <hi>Charles Coot;</hi> a
very probable business, as he relates it: Pray Sir which way should he waft
(as you phrase it) it is a sign you have more skill in Forgery then in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,
and the situation of places, and nations. Next, he fains News to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is the cold Country he means; But his two
hours mentioned, smells so rank of brass, that it renders it, at first sent, a
perfect counterfeit: And what must this News do? onely introduce an
occasion to abuse and slander his sacred Majesty, and render him odious to
those of the Presbyterian Tenets, which indeed is the whole scope and
Tenor of this scurrulous doughty Epistle, and to make some persons here
think, that there is such a stock of rancour and malice, and such deep
thoughts of revenge, harboured in the hearts and mind of all persons
attending the KING, and in his own Royal heart likewise, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
pretences and shews are at present made to the contrary, to compass
their ends, yet the issues and effects of this Malice and Revenge, shall in
due time so appear, and manifest it self; That there is not a man, who
hath shewed any opposition to himself, or his late Royal Father, but sooner
or later shall feel their sad and direful stroke: And this Impress he hath so
Machiavelianly, and with such art and cunning, besprinkled and scattered
over the whole Paper, and in such several subtle and wiley ways, and such
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51976:4"/>
seeming real phrases, proper for such persons, who he would fain to be the
Writer, and Receiver, That none but his grand Tutor and Instructer, The
Divel himself (and scarce he neither) could possily outdo him, in some
parts, of this piece of artificial forgery: Others there be, which clearly
discovers the Rat by his squeaking: But above all, that bold and impudent
lye, in representing that meek and gentle PRINCE, to have no need
of spurs to Revenge, but rather a Rein to hold him in from it, is such a
piece of open and notoriously known falshood, That it is to be wondred
at, That he should escape a Dart from heaven, into his false and hollow sly
heart, whilst he was staining the <hi>paper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with that most mischievous malicious
expression, it being so known and manifest to all about him; That nothing
hath ever been, or is, more frequent with him, in his ordinary converse;
Then to express his firm and constant resolution, to adhere close to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
of his Royal Martyred Father, who <hi>inter voces extremas</hi> (as it
were) left a preceptory advice to the contrary Of such sort likewise, is
this Pasquil of the Pedigree he mentions; false fictions of a Son of <hi>Belial,</hi>
which will remain in pickle to arise up against this forger, at a Tribunal,
where the offspring of a <hi>Plantagenet,</hi> whose most innocent blood he hath
suck'd, will bring in a Record beyond <hi>Murryes</hi> Manuscript, which will
fright his guilty soul down to that place of horrour, prepared for him and
his fellow <hi>Regicides,</hi> his Pin, Crust, and Dog, Dam, and Kittlings, Piss and
Horse-spice, King <hi>Harry</hi>'s Codpiece<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the concealed Nuntio, and all that
sort of aenigmatical and Ribbald (yet very significant and malitious)
Drollery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is it, but the filthy foam of a black and hellish mouth, arising
from a viperous and venomous heart, industriously and maliciously set upon
doing what cursed mischief lies within the sphere of his cashiered power,
in such a conjuncture of Time as this, when the Nations hopes, are in a full
and just expectation of receiving a perfect cure of those bleeding deep
wounds, and wastful, and consuming miseries made, and continued by him,
and his fellow plotters, which they have so long lay panting and groaning
under?</p>
            <p>The Star and blew Ribbon, he speaks of, will be every way as fit, for the
shoulder which hath given him and his party such a shove, and as deservedly,
as a hempen halter will be for this forgers own Neck: And 'tis very possible
and probable too, They may both take their different effect in due time,
though we see what art is used to thrust that shoulder from its due merit by
such the Forgers subtleties. The <hi>Romance</hi> of his <hi>Waldense Dulmano,</hi> Byting the

As they may yet once more (if possible) fall under the worrying power of
him, and such like Ravenous Beasts of Blood, Prey, and Rapine: Sir, your
Nets are seen, and your fallacies fail you, The hooks you mention are laid
too visibly; The fish you would catch, are so far from swallowing, they will
not bite at all; you were best therefore go shave your own beard, as you have
those, in your Letter, and your Scull too: And if your brain prove not
thence more pregnant, 'Twill serve (However) to stuffe your powch in
stead of what, such your Angels were intended, to have holpen you too:
And I would wish you also to take this Advice from a friend, Give over your
Angling this way, and appear no more in publick at the side of this Pool,
least you be tumbled in over head and ears, and your self become both
the Bait and Prey to those you thus endevour to catch, and delude by
such your Drolling subtleties.</p>
            <p>And now having done with your forged Calumnies, I shall upon this just
occasion, desire leave to tell you, and those whom they were intended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
and work upon; that the Prince and Soveraigne (whom it is so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
your grand aim by this designe was to wound, though through the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious
sides of others, set up in your own Fancy) is one, to whom both you
and they, owe a Duty, and Allegiance, by all the Laws of God, Nature, and the
Land. And however, you for your part, have a minde to forget, and are not
pleased to own it, it is (however) not the lesse his due: And it is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
impossible, but upon better and due consideration, of the horrid guilt
you lye under, Divine Grace may hereafter be so infused into you, and you
thereby be made so sensible of your Crime, that perhaps you may yet cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
return to such your bounden duty, and by your future demeanour, wash
off those staines, wherewith your guilty Soul is now so fouly bespotted:
which that you may the more readily doe, I shall truly, and as knowingly,
as I believe it is possible for any in this Nation, give you this just and due
character, of that most vertuous and excellent Prince, whom (whatever your
thoughts are now) it is possible you may one day esteem it your chief ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               </gap>igne, which is truly such,
that in the opinion of very many wise and knowing men, it would put the
whole Christian world upon some difficulty, to find his parallel or equall
in all respects; His Birth and Extraction is known to be so transcendently
illustrious, that what Prince is there upon Earth, that can challenge a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or a more Noble, and Kingly, and for longer continuance, for Centuries
of years: His Person so lovely, amiable, and gracefull, that it even capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
the eyes of all Beholders, and every where generates, a noble and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
affection, respect and clemency, from the chiefest Enemies of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
and of our Nation and Dominions. His parts and endowments such,
that were we free from subjection to him, by all Laws, and to make search
throughout all Nations and People, for a complete and well accomplished

Personage to Rule over us, common Fame and Report could not but send us
to him; so meek, gentle, and sweet of Behaviour; so firm, constant, and
obliging in his Friendships, so milde, modest and patient in his Afflictions
and Sufferings; yet upon occasion so full of Princely courage and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
so knowing and discerning in his Reason and Judgement, and by his
retirement, so fitted and adapted for moderate Government: but above all,
so firmly and irremoveably fixed, to the profession of the true Protestant
Religion, testifyed many wayes against the cunning Arts, and subtle at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
and allurements, of the most inveterate enemies thereof: That it
is an infamy, never to be washed off from this Nation, (unlesse the now ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
vote and desire thereof be hearkned to, and take effect in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as may in some sort purge the same) that such a Prince as he, so qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
in all respects, and so innocent likewise, as to the first cause of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and ever since, also, saving his desire, and pursuance of his just and
undoubted Birth-right; a thing which the meanest of us would be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for by all, even by our very selves, should we omit, or be negligent of,
were it but for a poor Cottage; I say, that such a Prince as He, together with
his Illustrious, Heroick, and high-born Brethren, (all of them, even in this
their eclipsed obscurity, the renown and glory of our Nation) should (as is
hinted before) be chased from such an ample and splendid Patrimony, and
large Dominions, and that by his own Native Subjects, and Liege People,
and suffered to wander, nay, by their means hunted from place to place, from
one Nation (as is premised) to another People, and forced to live upon the
Almes and Charity (as it were) of those, who doubtlesse are not without
their grand designe upon Him, and all his Dominions, as (it may be feared)
Time will sooner or later cleerly manifest, besides, the subjecting Him, and
that whole Royal race, by this means, to the Enticements and Allurements,
and to the Stratagems, Nets, and Entanglements of those Romish Rooking
Gamesters, who are rangeing in all parts for their prey, and will be sure
to leave no stone unmoved, to work their wicked ends, where such a quarry
of Royal Game, are to be flown at, and with such advantage (as the case
stands with them) to be attempted; that the very contemplation thereof,
cannot methinks but draw Tears from the Eyes, and almost Blood from the
Hearts, of all Pious, Loyal Protestant Christians, who have any sence and
feeling, as they ought, of that deep dishonour and reproach, which by this
very meanes, must needs redound to the professors of the true Protestant
Religion, in all parts and places whatsoever, and no lesse sport and pastime
to the great Vicar general at <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Court and Conclave: but as in
the ground where Gold grows, nothing (it is said) will thrive but Gold, so
God hath hitherto preserved this vertuous Prince, most firm, sound, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

in the true Orthodox Faith, and no doubt but will so continue Him,
and make him not only in Title, but really and indeed a most magnanimous
Defender thereof, against all its adversaries.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:51976:6"/>And whereas there is either a real or seeming fear in some sort of guilty
people (and thereby the desired settlement much disturbed and retarded)
that if the old Government take place againe, and the right Pilot come at
the Head and Stern therof, that there wil be such rankor, malice and revenge
put in practice, by the all along adherers to the Royal Interest, against such
as any time opposed them; and thereby such losse, dammage and sufferings
sustained, with divers other vain and empty fears, jealousies and conjectures.
Now, as the true Character of his sacred Majesty himselfe, is before very
faithfully expressed, so surely it will nor seem incongruous and impertinent
upon this just occasion likewise, to interpose this sincere and unfeigned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
on the behalfe of those Adherers to the Royal Interest; That as
their principles are truly Christian, so they most earnestly desire to pursue
the due practice of them accordingly. And whatsoever is forged in that
malicious piece, before at large spoken of that Loyal party, especially
the main bulk and body of them (who are only considerable in this case, and
Extravagants and not to be regarded) are so far from any thoughts of Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kor,
Malice, and Revenge, in that particular, or any aime of making good
their Losses by the Estates of others (a usual vogue raised by our Peace-op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers)
that they do as fully and unfainedly forgive them, and all sorts of
them, as they desire of Heaven the forgivenesse of their own transgressions,
and do so far detest the thought of repairing their losses, that way feared, that
to see his Majesty restored, and thereby a firm and lasting Peace setled, that
so it may be conveyed to posterity, they would not onely very cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
fit down by all their Losses and Sufferings, but many thousands of
them willingly sacrifice much of their present Fortunes, and some of
them their Lives too, as a grateful offertory for such a seasonable and
all-healing mercy.</p>
