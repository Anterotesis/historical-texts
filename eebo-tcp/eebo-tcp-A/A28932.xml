            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>SEntences, witty Repartees and Jests, have ever been esteem'd by all civilized Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> have shewn what account they made of them, by their care of Collecting and Quoting them. <hi>Julius Cesar</hi> made a Collection of the Jests of his Contemporaries; the famous Historian <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> is very exact in recording all those os the illustrious Men of whom he writes the Lives: Wherein he has been imitated by <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> in his lives of the Philosophers; and among the Moderns, my Lord <hi>Bacon, Guichar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> and several others have enrich'd their Writings with them.</p>
                  <p>These Testimonies carry so much weight with them, that we cannot but join our Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb facs="tcp:105118:3"/>
with that of so many illustrious Persons: The only Question is how to make a good Choice, and not confound true Wit and Sense with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of low Thoughts, and dull, and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Jests which are imposed upon the World; and this I have proposed to do in the following Collection.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients under the names of <hi>Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms,</hi> comprehended what we call wise Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, generous and noble Sentiments, Jests and witty Repartees: However, according to our Notions, the Apophthegm thus differs from a Jest or Repartee, that the first is generally Grave and Instructive; whereas Jests and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partees instruct us and make us merry at once; nay, sometimes these are meerly diverting, and sometimes sharp and Satirical.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Bons Mots</hi> all those witty Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ingenious Replies which are the result of a true Judgment, and of a happy and quick Imagination.</p>
                  <p>Now the first and most certain Rule to know a <hi>true Jest</hi> from a false Thought, is that it may be translated into another Language, without losing any thing of its Sense and Pleasantness; for then it is certain that it runs upon the Thing expressed in it, and not upon a <hi>Pun</hi> or <hi>Quibble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:105118:4"/>
                     <hi>Puns</hi> and <hi>Quibbles</hi> are what we call playing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Words, or Equivocations; they are known by this, that being turned into another Language, they loose that resemblance of Sound wherein their subtilty consist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>; and as they affect the Ear more than the Mind, we must take care not to mistake them for true Jests. The pretended Beauty of Equivocations is only owing to Chance, which makes one and the same Word to signify several Things, and therefore their double Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is generally forc'd; but suppose it were true, <hi>a Jest</hi> is still imperfect when it runs upon the Expression, and not upon the Thought. I confess an Equivocation may be allow'd of when it offers two different Ideas to our Mind, one of which is in a Proper, and and the other in a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative Sense. But as for those miserable Puns and Quibbles, which are nothing but an empty gingle of Words, the <hi>French</hi> have branded them with the infamous Name of <hi>Turlupinades;</hi> and they ought to be banished the Conversation of polite and well-bred Persons, as only fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the vulgar Sort.</p>
                  <p>Jests and wity Repartees have ever been more frequent among the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations: Which may be ascribed, first to the quickness of their Wit, their deep Learning, and good Education; secondly, to the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:105118:5"/>
of their Government; for living for the most part in Common-wealths, they were not constrained in their Fancy by the Respect due to Sovereigns, and those whom they make sharers of their Authority in Monarchical States; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the different degrees establish'd among Men, do often keep Inferiours from speaking their Thoughts about the <hi>Ridiculum</hi> of those above them.</p>
                  <p>We may draw a double advantage from true <hi>Jests,</hi> for besides that they serve to make us mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and revive now and then a fainting Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: Several of them are full of good and wholesom Instructions, applicable to the different Exigencies of Life, both in a publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Fortune.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Stories</hi> they differ from Jests, in that they express their Subject in its full Latitude, and generally leave nothing to be guest at, as Jests do; they are sometimes divertingly Instructive; but their chief aim is to make the Hearers merry by relating sometimes a concurrence os Comical Accidents; sometimes a piece of Simplicity or Ignorance, and sometimes Malicious Tricks that have been put upon any one, to make Sport for others: In all these we must use the same Caution as we have mentioned about Jests, that is, we must take care not to confound good Stories with many pieces of low Buffoonry,
<pb facs="tcp:105118:6"/>
which tickle mean and vulgar Ears by their smutiness, dawb'd over with paltry Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Now the use a Gentleman ought to make of Jests and Stories is, never to quote them but when they come pat and <hi>à-propos</hi> to the Subject, and before those who are disposed to hear and be merry with them; without courting the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of being thought a pleasant and jocose Man, for Persons of a nice discernment will presently take notice of those nauseous Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And as the judicious <hi>La Bruyere</hi> has it; <hi>That Man who endeavours to make us Merry, seldom makes himself to be esteem'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must also observe never to usher in Jests or Stories with formal Commendations, which will prevent our hearers from being agreeably surpriz'd; for 'tis by this surprise that the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they give is principally excited. Likewise when we begin to tell them, we must not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to laugh our selves, if we intend to make the Company laugh; for those who promised us Mirth before-hand, are seldom so good as their Words; and how silly and ridiculous does that Man look who laughs by himself, at a cold and thread-bare Jest, whilst the rest can hardly force a Smile to keep him in Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?
<pb facs="tcp:105118:7"/>
Lastly, we must avoid telling a Jest or Story several times over to the same Persons, an Impertinence which makes the Conversation of old People so very distateful.</p>
                  <p>Before I make an end of this Introduction, I shall obviate an Objection which some superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Criticks will be apt to make against this Work, <hi>viz.</hi> That most of these <hi>Apophthegms, Jests, Repartees</hi> and <hi>Stories,</hi> are already known to Persons of good Education, and to Men of Learning: To which I answer, That granting this to be true, yet 'tis hoped they may be glad to find them here again, just as we are pleased to hear a fine Tune over and over, provided it be well Sung: But besides, this Collection is so vastly Rich, that it is hard, if not impossible, for any single Reader to know all it contains, and not be either instructed or diverted by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will be new to him. To which I must add, That my chief Design in this Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to facilitate the Learning of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue to the <hi>English;</hi> and that of the <hi>English</hi> Language to Foreigners, and upon that score I have taken particular care to make both Languages answer one another, as near as their different Idioms would allow.</p>

He perceiving the King earnestly bent upon his Expedition into <hi>Italy,</hi> told him in private, Sir, the <hi>Romans</hi> have the Reputation of a Warlike People, and command divers Nations that are so, but suppose we overcome them, What Fruit shall we reap by the Victory? That's a plain thing, said <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>It happened at that very time that the Governour of the Province caus'd certain Thieves to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied near that Vault where the virtuous Lady kept such desperate Mourning over the Corps of her dear Husband. The Night following a Soldier who was set to guard the Crosses, for fear the Bodies should be stollen away, having seen a light in the Tomb, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

A moment after he brought his small Supper

to the Tomb, and begins to exhort her not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe any longer in fruitless Groans and an unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sorrow; adding withal, that all Men have one common Exit; that we must all come at last to that long Home, and such other Reasons with which we generally use to cure the most distempered Minds. But she still more exasperated by so unexpected a Consolation, redoubles her Grief; tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> still the same Exhortations, and endeavours to perswade her to take some Meat, till the Waiting-woman wrought upon, as 'tis probable, as much by the smell of the Wine, as by his Discourse, reach'd her Hand to him who so obligingly invited them, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered some strength with Meat and Drink, began her self to attempt upon her Mistresses obstinacy. And what will your Ladiship get, said she, by starving your self to Death, burying your self alive, and giving up to Destiny that Breath which she does not demand from you?</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Think you the Ghosts or Ashes of the Dead,</l>
                        <l>Regard what Tears their Supervivers shed?</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>What! Do you expect to restore a dead Body to life again, contrary to the Decrees of Nature? Believe me, give over a weakness which Women alone are capable of, and enjoy the sweets of Life as long as you can. This Corps that lies here before you, shews you too too well how precious Life is, and bids you to be more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it: Every Body is willing to lend an Ear to one that presses him to eat upon such occasions; and so this Woman, faint and weak by so long an Abstinence, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd

her obstinacy to be prevail'd upon, and filled her self with Meat with as greedy an Appetite as the Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-woman, who had yielded before. Now, you know that Temptations come generally upon a full Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and those Arms which the Soldier had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to combate her Despair, the same he us'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack her Chastity: And the young Widow seeing he was neither disagreeable nor without Wit, the Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-woman still playing her Part to further his design, and then repeating to her Mistress ever and anon,</p>
                     <q>What will you still a pleasing Love withstand?</q>
                     <p>What makes me keep you any longer in suspence? The good Lady us'd the same Abstinence as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part of her Body, and the Soldier fully satisfied, remained conquerour of both. Thus they continued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether not only the first Night, but also the next Day, and the Day after that; the entrance of the Tomb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this while so well closed, that had any body come to it, they must needs have supposed that the most honest Woman in the World had expired over her dear Husband.</p>
                     <p>The Soldier charm'd with the Beauty of his Lady, and the secresy of his amourous Intreague, bought Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions as far his small stock would let him, and brought them to the Tomb assoon as Night begun to approach. In the mean time the Relations of one of those that hang'd on the Gibbets, perceiving that there was no Guard to look after them, took down the Corps one Night and buried it. As for the poor Soldier detain'd from his Duty by the Allurements of his Pleasure, seeing the next day one of those Crosseswith out its Carcase, he went to his Mistress full of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105118:63"/>
of Punishment, and told her what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: That for his part he would not wait his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but was resolv'd to do himself Justice, and punish immediately his neglect with his own Hand: That the only favour he begg'd of her was to take care of his Burial, and bestow it upon him in the same Sepulcher, equally fatal to her Husband and her Lover. The good Dame no less charitable than dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet: <hi>Oh! may the Gods forbid,</hi> said she, <hi>that I should live to see at once the Funeral of two Persons so very dear to me, I have rather hang the Dead than be the ruin of the Living.</hi> Then according to this fine Speech, she takes the Corps out of the Coffin, and having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figur'd its Face, gives it him, in order to fix it to the empty Cross. The Soldier was so wise as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ingenious Advice of so prudent a Woman: And the next Day all the People admired which way the dead Thief was got again upon his Cross,</p>

Nature had engraven in the Face of this young Man all the marks of Nobleness, and of that good Education which he ow'd to his Birth and the care of his Parents; and one might easily see that he was not born for the Condition to which his hard Fortune had reduc'd him; if he was to carry any Burden, he sunk under the lightest; yet he would needs do every thing, and forgot his Birth, to adapt himself to the present State of his Fortune. But not being able to bear hard labour, nor the course Food of Servants, he grew insensibly very weak, and neglected himself to that degree, that he did not so much as comb his Hair, which was the finest in the World. In a little time he became lean and full of Wrinckles, his Eyes grew hollow and languishing, his Hands black and course; in fine, he was not the same Man: Melancholy had sunk his Spirit, as much as Fatigue had impair'd his Health. he sigh'd often, and his affliction mov'd my Pity; I thought Fortune was very unjust to him; I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to comfort him under it; wept for his Misfortunes; taught him what he must do, and did part of it my self to ease him. His wretched state did not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him a noble Air, and I know not what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence over my Birth, which made me sensible of the difference of his, to which I willingly submitted. He knew well enough how much he was oblig'd to me, and return'd me thanks with the politeness of a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier. In short, I was so much affected with those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments, that thinking I had only Pity for his Misfortunes, I found my self in Love with his Person; and indeed I lov'd him desperately.</p>

They had not gone many paces, but two armed Men, with their Pistols cock'd, and Swords drawn, made pushing towards them: One of

them had a Paper in his Hand, which he said, he had casually took up in the Streets, and had occasion'd their difference; therefore they desired the Secretary to read it, with a great deal of Complement. The Secretary took out his Spectacles, and fell a reading the said Paper, whereof the Substance was, <hi>That it should be known to all Men, that whosoever did pass over that Bridge after Nine a Clock in Winter, and Ten in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, was to leave his Cloak behind him, and in case of no Cloak, his Hat.</hi> The Secretary started at this, one of the Rogues told him, That he thought that Paper concerned him; so they unmantled him, and my Secretary was content to go home in <hi>Cuerpo.</hi>

                     <head>154 Of an Old Impotent Lord.</head>
                     <p>AN Old Lord fell in Love with a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman that waited upon his Lady: The Frailty which is pretty common in Waiting-women, being happily supported by the Defects of an Old Man, she found strength enough in her self to resist his Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Moreover, she told her Lady of it, and confirm'd by a Shower of Tears those Proofs of her Chastity. It is not possible, Madam, said she, for me to bear it any longer: What does my Lord make of me? And how can he have the Thoughts that I can be wanting in my Duty, either to your Ladiship, or to my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? If he goes on at this rate, I beseech your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:105118:122"/>
let me be gone. The good Lady very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed against her Husband, and no less pleas'd with her Woman's Honesty, told her, Child never trouble thy self, neither think of leaving me, as long as thou art assured of my kindness to thee. Then Madam, return'd she, be so kind as to free me from my Lord's Persecutions. Well, <hi>said the Lady,</hi> there comes now in my Thoughts an expedient very fit for that purpose: Thou must dissemble a kindness for him, and afterwards give him an Assignation in thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. I, Madam, give him an Assignation? said the Waiting-woman. Hear me out, replied the Lady, When thou hast set the time, and left the Door open, I'll go in thy place into thy Bed, and thou shalt slip into my Room, and then, when he comes, I'll make him so asham'd, that he'll have no more Thoughts of tormenting thee. The Waiting-woman perform'd with care her Lady's Orders: And the Night being come, the old Dotard crept into the Chamber, and eagerly went to that Bed where his Wife waited for his coming. She did not think it convenient to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with him at first; but this Adventure being carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on more chastly than she had expected, she grew weary on't, and resolv'd to give her Tongue its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>What! is it only for this,</hi> said she, <hi>that you have been at so much pains?</hi> The Husband acknowledging his Error by his Wife's Voice, <hi>I vow, Madam,</hi> said he, <hi>my Body has been wiser than my Mind, for it has known you, when my blinded Mind took you for a handsom Maid.</hi>

                     <p>A Young Lady having lately buried her Husband, whom she call'd <hi>Old Simon,</hi> ordered a Carver to make her a Statue of Wood, as near his Figure as he could, which was laid by her Side every Night in remembrance of him. In the mean time, a young Gentleman that had a great Passion for her, by the Intercession of some Guineas, prevail'd with her Maid to lay him one Night in the place of <hi>Old Simon.</hi> The Widow went to Bed, and after her usual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cast her Arms over her dear Husband's Statue, and finding it very warm, she crept closer and closer to it, till at length they came very close together, by which she perceiv'd it was not her Wooden Bed Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. In the Morning the Maid call'd at her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-door, as she us'd to do, Madam, What will you please to have for Dinner? She reply'd, Rost the Turky that was brought in Yesterday, Boil a Leg of Mutton and Colley-flowers, and get a good Dish of Fruit. Madam, says the Maid, we have not Wood enough to dress so much Meat. <hi>If not,</hi> reply'd she, <hi>you may burn</hi> Old Simon.</p>

No, no, said she, I am very well pleas'd, for a Friend of mine got me with Child, and it is a Daughter; and if you intend to fortify our Alliance, it may be done with another Marriage, between your Son and my Daughter.</p>

                     <p>A Young Widow, rich and beautiful, was belov'd by a young <hi>Gascon,</hi> both poor and proud. This <hi>Gascon</hi> had a mind to be thought very intimate with the Lady, and boasted of more Favours than he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. The Lady, who lov'd to be Merry, resolv'd to punish him for it after a new manner: I know, said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>he to him, you have an Affection for me, and doubt not but you will give me proofs of it upon an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that now offers it self. The <hi>Gascon</hi> assur'd her he was ready to do any thing to serve her. You know, added the Widow, such a Lady of my Acquaintance, who has a Cross and Jealous Man to her Husband, that will never give her leave to lie abroad; now it is necessary, for some private Reasons, that she should lie with me to Night; and what I desire of you, is to lie in her place, that her Husband, who will come home late, finding you in his Bed, may take you to be his Wife: And as he rises earlier than she, to go about his Business, he will take no notice of any thing; for though he be Jealous of his Wife,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:105118:125"/>
he seldom disturbs her Rest at Night. The <hi>Gascon</hi> consented to every thing, and suffer'd himself to be carried to his Mistress's Friend; they dress'd his Head in Womens Night-Cloaths, and afterwards he laid himself in the Bed of the Jealous Husband, who the young Lady knew would not be at home that Night. The two Ladies left the <hi>Gascon</hi> alone in Bed, and a little while after the young Widow came in in her Night Gown, and without a Light, and went to Bed to him. The <hi>Gascon,</hi> who took her for the Jealous Husband, was in great Pain and Trouble; he lay extreamly close, and turning his Back to the young Widow, put himself as near the other side of the Bed as possible. Thus he spent a whole Night more restless and uneasy than any in his Life, being still apprehensive of some preposterous Caresses from the Jealous Husband; but his Trouble increas'd when at break of Day, the young Widow rung a Bell, at the noise of which he heard some body coming into the Room; he cover'd his Head with the Bed-Cloaths, and such was his fear of being known, that he wish'd he could have buried himself in the Bed. Now 'twas the Widow's Friend that came in, and open'd the Curtains, and at that very instant the Widow rose from Bed adorn'd with all her natural Beauties, which made almost the <hi>Gascon</hi> die with Regret, Spite, and Shame, for making such ill use of so favourable a Night.</p>

                     </gap> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonnes: Il s'agit seulement de faire un bon choix, &amp; de ne pas confondre l'Esprit &amp; le bon Sens avec quantité de Pensées basses, &amp; de Plaisanteries froides &amp; vulgaires qui se debitent dans le monde, &amp; c'est ce que je me suis proposé de faire dans ce Recueil.</p>
                  <p>Les Anciens sous le nom d'<hi>Apophthegmes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenoient ce que nous appellons Sentences, Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens nobles &amp; genereux, Bons Mots, &amp; Repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties fines: Cependant, selon nos Idées, l'Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phthegme differe d'un Bon Mot, ou d'une Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partie, en ce que le premier est ordinairement grave &amp; instructif, au lieu que les Bons Mots &amp; les Reparties nous instruisent &amp; nous rejouïssent en même tems; quelquefois même ceux-ci sont purement divertissants, &amp; quelquefois piquans &amp; satiriques.</p>
                  <p>Les <hi>François</hi> appellent <hi>Bons Mots,</hi> toutes ces Sentences &amp; Reparties ingenieuses qui partent d'un bon Jugement &amp; d'une Imagination prompte &amp; heureuse.</p>
                  <p>La premiere &amp; la plus certaine Regle pour distinguer un veritable Bon Mot d'avec une fausse Pensée, est qu'il puisse être traduit en une autre Langue, sans rien perdre de sa justesse &amp; de son agrément; car alors il est certain qu'il roule sur la chose qui y est exprimée, &amp; non pas sur une Pointe, ou sur une Rencontre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:105118:4"/>Les <hi>Pointes</hi> &amp; les <hi>Rencontres</hi> sont ce qu'on ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle des <hi>jeux de Mots</hi> ou des <hi>Equivoques;</hi> on les connoit par ceci, c'est qu'étant traduites en une autre Langue, elles perdent cette ressemblance de son dans laquelle leur subtili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>é consiste; &amp; comme elles regardent plus l'Oreille que l'Esprit, nous devons prendre garde de ne pas les confon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre avec les <hi>veritables Bons Mots.</hi> La pretenduë beauté des Equivoques n'est qu'un effet du ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, qui fait qu'un même Mot signifie plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieurs choses; ainsi leur double application est presque toûjours forcée; mais supposé qu'elle fut juste, le Bon Mot est imparfait lors qu'il ne roule que sur l'Expression, &amp; non par sur la Pensée. J'avouë que l'Equivoque peut être sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable lors qu'elle offre deux Idées differentes à nôtre Esprit, dont l'une est dans le sens propre &amp; l'autre dans le sens Fignré: Mais pour ce qui est de ces mechantes Pointes, qui ne sont qu'un vain son de Mots, les <hi>François</hi> les ont no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tées d'infamie sous le nom de <hi>Turlupinades,</hi> &amp; elles doivent être bannies de la Conversation des gens polis &amp; bien élevez, n'étant propres qu'à divertir le Vulgaire.</p>
                  <p>Les Bons Mots &amp; les Reparties fines ont été plus frequentes parmi les anciens <hi>Grecs</hi> que parmi les autres Peuples: Ce que l'on peut at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribuer, premierement à la vivacité de leur Esprit, à leur profond <hi>sçavoir,</hi> &amp; à leur bonne Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb facs="tcp:105118:5"/>
secondement: Car la pluspart vivant dans des Republipues leur Esprit n'etoit pas retenu par le respect deu aux Souverains, &amp; à ceux aux quels ils font part de leur Autoritè dans les Etats Monarchiques; où les divers degrez qu'on y a etablis parmi les Hommes, empêchent sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent les inferieurs de dire ce qu'il pensent sur le Ridicule de ceux qui sont au dessus d'eux.</p>
                  <p>On peut tirer un double avantage des Bons Mots, car outre qu'ils servent à nous diver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ir, &amp; à ranimer une Conversation languissante, il y en a plusieurs qui sont remplis de belles In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, qu'on peut appliquer aux differents Etats de la Vie, dans une Fortune publique ou privée.</p>
                  <p>Pour ce qui est des <hi>Contes,</hi> ils different des <hi>Bons Mots</hi> en ce qu'ils exposent leur sujet dans toute son étenduë, &amp; ne laissent d'ordinaire rien à deviner comme font les <hi>Bons Mots.</hi> Ils instruisent quelquefois en divertissant, mais leur principal but n'est que de rejouïr leurs Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teurs en rapportant tantôt quelque rencontre d'Accidens plaisans; tantôt quelque rencontre d'Accidens plaisans; tantôt quelque naïveté ou quelque Ignorance; &amp; quelquefois des Tours malicieux, dont on s'est servi pour divertir les autres aux depens de quelqu'un. Dans les Contes il faut user de la même precaution dont nous avons parlé touchant les Bons Mots,
<pb facs="tcp:105118:6"/>
c'est à dire, nous devons avoir soin de ne pas confondre les bons Contes, avec plusieurs Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonneries basses, qui chatouillent les Oreilles du Peuple par leurs ordures, cachées sous de mé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes Equivoques.</p>
                  <p>L'Usage qu'un ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nête homme doit faire des Bons Mots &amp; des Contes, est de ne les citer que lors qu'il viennent à propos &amp; naturellement au sujet, &amp; en presence de ceux qui sont disposez à les entendre &amp; à s'en divertir; sans rechercher l'occasion de faire le plaisant &amp; l'enjoüé, car les gens d'un discernement delicat connoissent d'a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord ces sortes d'Affectations; &amp; selon le judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieux Mr. de <hi>la Bruyere: Il n'est pas ordinaire que celui qui fait rire, se fasse estimer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Il faut aussi observer de ne pas introduire les Contes &amp; les Bons Mots par des loüanges étudiées, qui empêchent nos Auditeurs d'être a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréablement surpris; parce que c'est par cette surprise que le plaisir qu'ils excitent est princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palement cause Il faut encore que lors que nous les racontons nous n'en rions pas les pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miers, si nous voulons faire rire la Compagnie; Car il arrive souvent que ceux qui nous o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t assuré qu'ils vont nous faire rire, ne tiennent pas leurs promesses; &amp; rien n'est si sot ni si ridicule qu'un homme qui rit seul d'une Pensée froide &amp; usée, pendant que les autres tâchent en vain
<pb facs="tcp:105118:7"/>
de soûrire pour l'empêcher de perdre Contenance. Enfin, il faut éviter l'inconvenient de dire un Conte ou un Bon Mot plusieurs fois aux mêmes Personnes, ce qui est un Ridicule qui rend la Conversation des vieilles gens si desagréable.</p>
                  <p>Avant que de finir cette Introduction, je pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viendrai une Objection que quelques Critiques de mauvaise humeur pourront faire contre cét Ouvrage, qui est, que la pluspart de ces <hi>Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegmes, Bons Mots, Reparties</hi> &amp; <hi>Contes</hi> sont deja seus par les Personnes bien élevées, &amp; par les gens de Lettres; à quoi je repons, que quand cela seroit, on espere pourtant qu'ils seront bien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aise de les retrouver ici, de même qu'on entend avec plaisir un bel Air, quoi qu'on l'ait deja en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendu, pourveu qu'il soit bien chanté. Dailleurs ce Recueil est si grand &amp; si riche, qu'il est diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, pour ne pas dire impossible qu'un même Lecteur sache tout ce qu'il contient, &amp; qu'il ne soit instruit ou diverti par quelque chose qui aura pour lui la grace de la nouveautê. A quoi je dois ajoûter que mon dessein principal dans ce Recueil est de rendre la Langue <hi>Françoise</hi> facile à appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre aux <hi>Anglois,</hi> &amp; l'<hi>Angloise</hi> aux Etrangers; &amp; c'est pour celá que je me suis attaché avec soin â faire repondre ces deux Langues l'une à l'autre autant que leurs differens Idiomes l'ont pû per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mettre.</p>
