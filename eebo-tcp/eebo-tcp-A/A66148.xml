            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <hi>RIght Truſty, and Right Well-beloved Cozens; and Right Truſty, and Well-beloved Cozens; and Truſty, and Right Well-beloved: We Greet you well.</hi> We cannot have better Reaſon to Promiſe Our Self an end of our <hi>Common Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Calamities,</hi> and that Our One Juſt Power and Authority will (with <hi>God</hi>'s Bleſſing) be <hi>Reſtored</hi> to Us, than that we hear You are again acknowledged to have that Authority and Juriſdiction, which hath always belonged to You, by your Birth, and the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of the Land; and We have thought it very fit and ſafe for Us to call to You for <hi>Your Help,</hi> in the Compoſing the <hi>Confounding Diſtempers</hi> and <hi>Diſtractions</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> on which Your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are next to thoſe We have undergone Our Self. Therefore, You cannot but be the moſt proper Counſellors, for removing <hi>theſe Miſchiefs,</hi> and for <hi>preventing the like,</hi> for the future. How great a Truſt We repoſe in You, for the Procuring and Eſtabliſhing a <hi>Bleſſed Peace</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> for the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> will appear to You by Our Incloſed <hi>Declaration;</hi> which Truſt, We are moſt confident, You will Diſcharge with that Juſtice and Wiſdom, that becomes You, and muſt always be expected from You; and that upon Your Experience, how one Violation ſucceeds another. When the known Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Rules of Juſtice are Tranſgreſſed, You will be as Jealous for the <hi>Rights of the Crown,</hi> and for the <hi>Honour of the King,</hi> as Our Self: and then you cannot but diſcharge your Truſt with <hi>Good Succeſs,</hi> and provide for, and Eſtabliſh the <hi>Peace, Happineſs,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> upon that Foundation which can only ſupport it, and We ſhall be all Happy in each other: And as the whole Kingdom will bleſs God for You, We alſo ſhall hold Our Self Obliged, in an eſpecial manner, to Thank You in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, according to the Affection You ſhall expreſs towards Us. We need the leſs enlarge to You on <hi>this Subject,</hi> becauſe We have likewiſe Writ to the <hi>Houſe of Commons;</hi> which, we ſuppoſe, they will Communicate to You. And We Pray <hi>GOD</hi> bleſs your Joynt-Endeavours, for the Good of us All. And ſo We bid You very Heartily, Farewel.</hi>
