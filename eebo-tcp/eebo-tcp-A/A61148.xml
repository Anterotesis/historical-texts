         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO
THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His History being wrote in calm and quiet Times, and
by a person whose temper and disposition was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutable
to them, had the ill hap to have an hideous storm
tread upon the heels of it; which, among other greater
Wrecks and Ruines, might very likely have buried
this, never to have been raised up again: But Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
had so disposed of it, that a Copy of it light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into more Ingenuous and Noble hands, it was
thought a sin by them to stifle, and conceal it from the World, which now being
in dotage, and infinitely in love with Change, may reade here (if they do not feel
it already) the sad Effects which an unruly and a misgovern'd Reformation,
usher'd in by Tender Consciences, brings upon them.</p>
            <p>Nor doth it come forth now to cast any Obloquy upon that Church or Nation,
famous in former Times for so much Piety, that the devotion of the Natives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
so cold a Clime (whether you consider the rich Endowments, or magnificent
Structures of Places dedicated to Gods Service) can hardly be match'd, but to
shew rather the variation of all Humane Things, and how easie it is to slide from
something that might look like Superstition, into the contrary Vices of Sacriledge
and Profaneness, for which they have felt so remarkable a Scourge, that unless
it be in the same Island (and, all Circumstances considered, scarce in that) can
the whole World, and the Stories of it, sute them with a Parallel.</p>
            <p>But there is lesse to be said of this, because if the Times become patient of
hearing Truth, you may possibly by the Industry of some good hand, have the latter
and more Fatall part of the Story: For though this Cloud in the North was at first
no bigger then a Hand, and might have been grasp'd, and easily dispers'd by the
Authority then in being (had it not miscarried in being too tender towards it) hath
since, for the sins of both Nations, rowl'd it self into a more Universal Darkness,
and pour'd down such a sweeping Rain upon us, as hath carried away all that is
<pb facs="tcp:50008:4"/>
Sacred with it. And for us that live to see the Desolation on all hands, our onely
portion left us, is to mourn in secret, for
<q>—Nihil, praeter plorare, relictum est.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And that you may know to how innocent and unbyassed a person you owe this
Story, do but impartially reade it, and you shall finde it woven with so even
threed, and so much of the spirit of meekness in all the passages of it, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Rage of the first Reformers, nor the Fury of them who in after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>imes
did second them, could tempt him to dispense so much with his own nature, as to
passe any bitter Reproof upon them, but leaves them upon the Stage with the bare
Narrative of their actions, and trusts the judgement of the Reader, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
or to acquit them.</p>
            <p>What the Life of this Author was, hath been diligently and faithfully collected
by a Reverend Person of that Nation, who out of the midst of the Ruines of
his Church, hath gather'd out of the Rubbidge of it, the substance of these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Particulars; that this world of ours being now grown barren of such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
might at least have an excellent Copy set before them, which if they have
not the Will to imitate, yet let them use it as they do their Pictures, and commend
the Hand, though they neglect his Virtues.</p>
            <p>There is no more to say to thee, but this, That if there be so much Devotion in
thee, as to melt thee into Prayers and Tears for the Sufferings of thine own Church;
Let there be so much Charity too, as to bestow some of them on our Neighbour
Nation, from whom our Ruine came; and have since so deeply smarted for it, that
a discreet, and a very considerable person among them, hath so far in my hearing
expressed his Penitence for it, as to say, <hi>That it was true, that he with the
rest of his Nation had buried Episcopacy, and their Ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
in one and the same Grave, but upon the sad consequences
of it, they could be content to tear up the very earth of that Grave
with their Teeth, so that they might raise up Both again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when this single Vote shall come to be the Vote of the whole Nation,
God is where he was, and without the attending the Revolution of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s
Great Year, can when he pleaseth, and by what means he pleaseth, restore
them to their former Happiness.</p>

when they are rear'd, then in their foundations,
yet that this Reverend Prelat, raised in his own
Countrey to the highest honour that his condition
was capable of, may not seem obscurely to have
stole into the World, as a Mushrome of a nights
growth, or as that <hi>Roman</hi> did, of whom it is said in <hi>Tacitus, Videtur</hi>
Curtius Rufus <hi>è se natus,</hi> It can no way be impertinent to mention
that he was descended from the Lairds of <hi>Spotiswood</hi> in the <hi>Merse,</hi> an
ancient race of Gentlemen, and the chief of that surname. His
Grandfather died in the bed of honour with his King, <hi>Iames</hi> the
fourth, in the battel of <hi>Flodden</hi> field, a battel that might have been
looked upon as most unfortunate to that Nation, had not their latter
contests by the sword proved infinitely more unhappy.</p>
            <p>His Father was no sword-man, but betook himself to the study of
the Arts, passing his course of Philosophy in the Colledge of <hi>Glasgow,</hi>
with a purpose the better to enable himself for Theology, to which,
by the guidance of Gods Spirit over him, he stood most affected. But
matters of Religion being at that time in his Countrey like the eddies
of waters, rowling, and confused, (the old way questioned, and the
new persecuted) none knowing in this turning tyde which wayes the
times would run, he withdrew himself into <hi>England,</hi> where bringing
with him an unsetled mind, and doubtfull what party he should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to, Providence cast him upon a familiarity with Archbishop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> who soon confirm'd him in those truths which afterward he
never varied from. About the time of the death of King <hi>Iames</hi> the
fift he returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereby occasion given by the Earl of
<hi>Glencarn</hi> (to whom he had applied himself) he became known to
<hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who finding him a person judicious, and
discreet, and fitted by these qualities for managing of business, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
<pb facs="tcp:50008:5"/>
him to <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of <hi>England,</hi> when <hi>France</hi> upon some jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
was so unkind to him as to cast him off. Affaires upon this
succeeding to the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> his mind, the Earl came into <hi>England,</hi>
with whom some moneths he there remained: But longing to see
the smoak of his own Countrey, he returned once more to enjoy
himself among his friends; where being known to Sir <hi>Iames Sandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
of <hi>Calder,</hi> (a person of great authority in those times) he was
moved by him to accept of the Parsonage of <hi>Calder,</hi> which upon the
beginning of the Reformation was then void. Not long after this,
he was made Super-intendent of <hi>Lothian, Merse,</hi> and <hi>Teviot-dale,</hi> where
he exercised fully the power, and discharged faithfully the Office of a
Bishop, though under another style; For it was not the Office, but
the name, which the first Reformers out of humor startled at, though
they who have succeeded them (for in errors of this kinde, the last
comers think they have done nothing, unless they out-bid the former)
have since to their own ruin cast out both. He continued in this
holy function, with the approbation of all good men, till his death;
when being full of days, and leaving the persume of a good name
behinde him, he peaceably departed out of this life on the fift of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
in the year 1585. His Wife was <hi>Beatrix Crichton,</hi> a grave and
a discreet Matron, daughter to the Laird of <hi>Lugton</hi> an ancient Baron
of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And from these Parents <hi>Iohn Spotiswood,</hi> the Author of
this History, descended.</p>
            <p>Born he was in the year of our Lord 1565, when he was no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
brought into the World but a remarkable passage accompanied it;
For among the rest that were present (not ordinary Gossipers, but
women of good note) there was one among them who in a sober,
though in a prophetick fit, taking the childe in her armes, called aloud
to the rest in these or the like tearms, <hi>You may all very well rejoyce at the
birth of this childe, for he will become the Prop, and Pillar of this Church, and
the main and chief instrument in the defending of it.</hi> From what principle this
praediction came, or how she was thus inspired, I will not search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but that her words came really to pass, may evidently appear to
him that reads this short story of his life.</p>
            <p>His education was answerable to his birth, for being a child of
a pregnant wit, great spirit, and good memory, he was by the care of
his parents brought up in the University of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where he came so
early to perfection, that he received his degrees in the sixteenth year
of his age: for though the fruits of the earth under that Northern
Clime do not mature so soon, the men generally are of a better mold,
and mellow as early into a ripeness, as any of those Nations, who
because they have more of the Sun plead for a priority, forgetting
that some kinde of grain are ripened best by Frosts. And this so
many excellent men of all sorts, as have been of that Nation, are so
many examples of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50008:5"/>But to revert to this one among the rest, who having laid his
foundation in humane Arts and Sciences, did not make his period
there, but used them as the rundles of a ladder by which he might
climbe higher to the knowledge of diviner things, to the practise of
which by way of charge he was sooner called then he expected; for
his father being by age and weakness of body unable to appear any
more in publick, none was thought fitter to succeed in the Parsonage
of <hi>Calder</hi> then his son; though otherwise in a well-govern'd Church,
his age (being then but eighteen) might in an ordinary course have
been a barre against him; but his early parts, and his conscientious
diligence in attending this cure, supplied his defect of years, and the
greenness of his youth was corrected, and tempered by so sober a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
as no man could either despise his youth, or think him unfit for
the employment.</p>
            <p>Nor were these virtues of his buried, and confined within the
boundaries of his Parish; for having formerly had a relation to the
Noble family of <hi>Lennox,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An. 1601.</note> he was looked upon as the fittest person of
his quality, to attend <hi>Lodowick</hi> Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> as his Chaplain in that
honourable Ambassy to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> for confirming
the ancient amity between both the Nations: wherein he so discreetly
carried himself, as added much to his reputation, and made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that men bred up in the shade of learning, might possibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the Sun-shine, and when it came to their turnes might carry
themselves as handsomely abroad, as they whose education being in
a more pragmatick way usually undervalue them. In the retinue of
this Noble Person he returned from <hi>France</hi> through <hi>England,</hi> where
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being in her declining age, was in his Masters
name saluted by this Ambassadour, who seeing her night draw on
so fast, could the easier guess that his Masters rising in this Horizon
was not then far off.</p>
            <p>Some two years after this,<note place="margin">An. 1603.</note> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (after the glorious
reign of fourty four years) by her death made way for King <hi>Iames</hi> her
successor, and when all the World stood at gaze what would become
of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> (which the Jesuit under the name of
<hi>Dolman</hi> had bandied over into <hi>Spain,</hi> and some of the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme,
were then in consultation (though upon different purposes)
to make a game of it at home) there was a diviner hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which so unexpectedly ordered it, that without any contest at
all, it settled on the right heir, to the admiration of the neighbouring
Nations, and (had we known our own good) to the infinite happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this. This King being to take possession of his hereditary
Crown here, chose out for his attendants, the most eminent persons
of all kindes: and among his Clergy this Author (being then no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advanced then to his Cure of <hi>Calder)</hi> was summoned to this
<pb facs="tcp:50008:6"/>
service. That year, <hi>Iames Beaton</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> dying, the
King (who being of excellent parts himself, could the better disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and value them in others) not only preferred him to that See, but
farther admitted him for his prudence and dexterity in Civil things
to be one of his Privy Councel in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And being graced with
these honors, he was sent back from <hi>England</hi> the same year to attend
Queen <hi>Anne</hi> in her journey to <hi>London,</hi> who knowing his integrity
made him her Almoner for the better dispensing of her Charity,
which could not confidently be credited but to clean hands and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt
heart, such as his really was.</p>
            <p>Not long after this,<note place="margin">An. 1610.</note> he presided in the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where
the power of Bishops, <hi>ex Iure postliminii</hi> was restored. The same
year upon the Kings command, he with the Bishops of <hi>Brechin</hi> and
<hi>Galloway</hi> repaired to <hi>London,</hi> where he received the solemnities of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
from the Bishops of <hi>London, Ely,</hi> and <hi>Bath,</hi> in the Chappel at
<hi>London<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At his entry to the Archbishoprick of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> he found the
Revenues of it so dilapidate, that there was not One hundred
pounds <hi>sterling</hi> of yearly Rent left, to tempt to a new Sacrilege: But
such was his care and husbandry for his Successors, that he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
improved it, and yet with so much content to his Diocese, that
generally both the Nobility and Gentry, and the whole City of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi>
were as unwilling to part with him, as if he had been in the
place of a Tutelar Angel to them.<note place="margin">An. 1615.</note> But part with him they must;
for after eleven years presiding there, the See of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> being
vacant, King <hi>Iames</hi> (who like another <hi>Constantine</hi> thought himself as
highly concerned in providing Successors for Churches, as Heirs
for his Crown) removed him from <hi>Glasgow</hi> (being then about the
age of fourty nine years) to be the Primate and Metropolitan of all
<hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next year after this,<note place="margin">An. 1616.</note> he presided in the Assembly at <hi>Aberdene,</hi>
where the Earl of <hi>Montross</hi> being the Kings Commissioner, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
Marquis of <hi>Huntley</hi> was upon his Penitence received
into the Bosome of the Church. And at the same Assembly there
past an Act for the drawing up a Liturgie for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and some of the most learned and grave among the rest <hi>(William
Cowper</hi> Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> being designed the chief) were deputed to
that Work, wherein the Service of God, and the Peace of that Church
was so deeply concern'd: Which I the more willingly mention, that
the deceived party might know, that the designe of a Liturgie,
which was afterward look'd upon as the dangerous <hi>Trojan</hi> horse, sent
in by their suspected Neighbours, might have proved more properly
such a <hi>Palladium</hi> to them, as might have preserved them to this day,
had they not onely scornfully, but seditiously rejected it, and have
<pb facs="tcp:50008:6"/>
therefore found the same fate as they of <hi>Troy</hi> did; of whom it was
observed,
<q>Peritura Troja perdidit primùm Deos.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Being invested by the Kings favour in this Primacy, he made so
much farther use of it, as he procured Three hundred pounds <hi>sterling</hi>
of yearly Rent (being by the Sacrilege of former times swallow'd
up in the Crown-Revenues) to be restored to his See: Nor did he
finde any difficult business of it; for certainly these latter Ages have
not produced in any Nation, a Christian Prince that understood bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then he the horror of Sacrilege, and the Concernments of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which never suffers more, then when the Professors of it are
exposed to Scorn and Poverty. For, however this was the portion
of the best and Primitive Times, when the Christian Faith had no
publick Civil Authority to own it, yet after it had pleased God to
make Kings the Nursing-Fathers, and Churches were endowed by
pious men, their Revenues were ever held Sacred, till the Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of some, and the Profaneness of others, had consulted with
that subtile Oracle, that delivers it <hi>tanquam è Tripode,</hi> that there can be
no such sin as Sacrilege; for as Nothing can be given to God, so
Nothing can be taken from him.</p>
            <p>All King <hi>Iames</hi> his time he lived in great favour with him, and
was the prime Instrument used by him in several Assemblies,<note place="margin">The Assembly of <hi>Perth</hi> 1618.</note> for
the restoring the ancient Discipline, and bringing that Church to
some degrees of Uniformity with her Sister Church of <hi>England;</hi> which
had we on both sides been worthy of, might have proved a Wall of
Brass to both Nations. Nor was his Industry less for the recovery
of some remnants and parcels of the Churches Patrimony, which
(though they were but as a few Crums in comparison of that which
at a full Meal Sacrilege had swallow'd) he found to be an hard Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
yet by his zeal and diligence he overcame many difficulties,
and so little regarded his own ease, that for the effecting of this, and
what else conduced to the recovery of that Church in Patrimony and
Discipline, they who knew the passages of his life, have computed
that he made no less then fifty journeys from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was he less gracious with King <hi>Charles</hi> his blessed Son,<note place="margin">An. 1633.</note> who
was Crown'd by him in the Abbey Church of <hi>Holyrude-house,</hi> with
such high applause and acclamations of that Nation, that it could
not have been possibly imagined, that such an <hi>Hosanna</hi> should ever
be turned into a <hi>Crucifige;</hi> or that a Prince, so passionate a lover of
his own native Countrey, should finde such enemies in the bowels
of it, as either to contrive, or to assist his Ruine. But thus God had
ordered it (as in the case of <hi>Iosiah)</hi> rather as a Punishment for our
sins, then his, that leaving his earthly Crown (which to him really
<pb facs="tcp:50008:7"/>
proved but a Crown of Thorns, whatever it may prove to others)
to the bold Hand that would next venture to take it up, he might
be put in possession of a more glorious Diadem, and sit Crowned
there, where (if the joyes of heaven admit of such a diversion) he
looks down upon things below, and all that happens here, with so
much unconcernment, as what was said of the brave Roman, may
in a Christian sense be more sutable to him,
<q>

            </p>
            <p>But to return to this pious man (who was so happy as to have his
eyes closed, before the Crown which he so solemnly set upon his
Masters Head, was to the astonishment of the World snatcht from
him) there must be added to this story, That as he enrich'd his See
of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> so he did the like for S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> procuring the Revenues
of the Priory (being then in Lay hands) to be added to his Church.
But having compassed this, to shew that it was done rather for the
Churches interest then his own, he dealt by way of humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the King, that of his large Diocese of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> so much
as was of the South-side of the River of <hi>Forth</hi> might be dismembred,
for the erecting of a new Bishoprick: which accordingly was done,
and being amply endowed, was seated in their Prime City of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two years after this,<note place="margin">An. 1635.</note> the Earl of <hi>Kinnoul</hi> being Chancellour dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(a Person of singular Prudence and Integrity) his Majesty knew
not where to fill the place with a Successor, with whom he might
more securely trust his Conscience, then with this aged Prelate,
near to God by his Function, and by his age (being then arrived to
<hi>Davids</hi> great Climacterick) so neer to his end as might well put him
in remembrance, that the account which he was to give of his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardship
could not be far off. And this honour he enjoyed to his death,
with the approbation of all, only such excepted, whose evil eye at the
Clergy, and their own particular ambition wrapt into such a fancy, as
made them think every honour to be misplac'd that was not setled on
their own shoulders.</p>
            <p>He had not fully measured out four years in the discharge of the
duties of this place (which did not so entangle him but that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the Church which then was drawing on filled him full of
thoughts which way he might divert it) when that unhappy design
which had been so long hatching under the wings and warmth of a
mal-content and seditious party, began to be ready to fly abroad. And
what could be called for as a fitter Midwife to this birth, then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:50008:7"/>
that at least might look like Religion. For the rule was given
long ago, before ever <hi>Macchiavel</hi> lived to vent it, and is likely to hold
to the end of the World,
<q>
                  <l>—Quoties vis fallere Plebem,</l>
                  <l>Finge Deum.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And from hence rose that storm, which with so much violence fell
on this Reverend good man, that he was forced by it for safety of his
life to retire into <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An. 1639.</note> where age and grief, with a sad soul in a
crazy body had so distempered him that he was driven to take har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in <hi>New-castle,</hi> till by some rest, and the care of his Physicians,
he had recovered so much strength as brought him to <hi>London.</hi> But
this proved but a short reprieve, for being come thither he fell into a
relapse, and the sentence of death being to be executed on him, he
took his bed some nine dayes before, waiting for that blessed hour,
when being freed from any farther heart-breakings for those evils he
could not prevent, he might be admitted into his Masters joyes, where
future calamities could not reach him.</p>
            <p>In this time of his sickness, and preparation for his end he was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> and some other Bishops, with
whom, with great devotion, he received that blessed <hi>Viaticum,</hi> the
Bread that came from Heaven, in the strength of which he was to pass
unto Eternity.</p>
            <p>After which though his desire was rather to compose himself for
privacy and silence, then to admit of any company, he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the visits of many honorable Persons. Among whom the visit of
the Marquiss <hi>Hamilton</hi> (being looked upon by the eye of the World as
disaffected to the whole Order) deserves more particularly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred;
and the circumstances of it you shall have in those tearms
as they are related.</p>
            <p>The Marquiss coming neer to his bed-side, was pleased to say, My
Lord, I am come to kiss your Lordships hands, and humbly to ask
your blessing To which the Archbishop with a soft voice answered,
My Lord you shall have my blessing, but give me leave to speak these
few words to you; My Lord I visibly foresee, that the Church and
King are both in danger to be lost, and I am verily perswaded, that
there is none under God so able to prevent it as your Lordship: And
therefore I speak to you as dying Prelat in the words of <hi>Mordecai</hi> to
<hi>Esther, If you do it not, Salvation in the end shall come where else, but you and
your house shall perish.</hi> To whom the Marquiss made this worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
That what he foresaw was his grief, and he wished from his
heart he were able to do that which was expected from him, though
it were to be done with the sacrificing of his Life, and Fortunes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which upon his knees he received the Archbishops blessing and
departed. I shall make no Commentary upon it, for the best interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of words are actions,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50008:8"/>As he lived, so he died in peace, with a stilness so much more then
ordinary, that they who were about him, could not by any outward
agony perceive when that peaceable Soul of his departed. But before
that last minute (sad to his friends, but to him infinitely joyful) had
closed up those eyes, which had so long been watchful for the Church
he govern'd, his Intellectuals and best Faculties being clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed,
and desiring to leave the world a copy of the faith he died in,
he premised it to his last Will and Testament in this form following:</p>
            <p>First, for that I esteem it the duty of every Christian (especially of those whose
service it hath pleased God to make use of in his Church) to make some open decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Faith wherein he lives and dies, I profess that I believe all the Articles
of that ancient Christian Creed, commonly called <hi>The Apostles Creed;</hi> the sum
whereof is, That God is One-in Three Persons; the Father, Creator of all things;
the Son, made Man in fulness of time, who by his bitter Possion and Death ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
redeemed Mankinde, rose from death, and ascended to Heaven, from whence
he will come to judge all flesh; and the Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father
and the Son, the Sanctifier of all that believe; That this God hath chosen to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Church, the Members whereof living in Communion, though never so disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
shall by his infinite mercy receive remission of all their sins, and being raised
again in their Bodies, at the last day shall enjoy everlasting life.</p>
            <p>This is the sum of my faith: Other Additaments which Ignorance and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
have super-induced into Christianity, I simply refuse, beseeching God to purge
his Church from the Errors and Superstition that hath crept into the same, and at
last to make us all that are called Christians, the Sheep of one Fold.</p>
            <p>For matters of Rites and Government, my judgement is, and hath been, That
the most simple, decent, and humble Rites should be chosen, such as the bowing of
the knee in the receiving the holy Sacrament, with others of the like kinde; Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
being as dangerous to Religion as Superstition. As touching the Government
of the Church, I am verily perswaded that the Government Episcopal is the onely
Right and Apostolick Form; Parity among Ministers being the breeder of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
as experience might have taught us. And for those Ruling-Elders, as they
are a meer humane Device, so they will prove (when the way is more open to them)
the Ruine of both Church and State.</p>
            <p>In the simplicity of this Faith he lived, and in this he died, like one
of the Bishops of those Primitive Times, when the modern names
of-Faction were not known; and whosoever agreed to these Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
the Church was not so nice a Mother as to cast them out. And
though in the passages of his life, enough hath been said already to
give you the Character of this excellent Person: yet because Pictures
drawn at length, where nothing of the figure or proportion is left our,
are the most graceful Pieces, I shall so far enlarge it for the Readers
sake, as may with more advantage induce him to copy it out into his
own life and manners.</p>
            <p>And for this, though the voice of publick fame be loud enough to
<pb facs="tcp:50008:8"/>
give directions, yet I shall rather ow them to those persons of integrity,
who in his Life time being admitted to be neerer witnesses of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
then others, may with more security be hearkned to. For
flattery followes no man farther then his grave, and it were well if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
went no farther.</p>
            <p>And this he had the less reason to fear, because in his Life he had set
so severe a watch upon himself, that his conversation was without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
even in those times, when the good name of every Clergyman
was set at a rate, as formerly were the heads of Wolves. Only one hath
been found (that ever I heard of) who thought he could not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vindicate his <hi>Diana</hi> the new-modeld Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of the kingdom of Christ were then busy to set up a
kingdom of their own) unless he raked into the grave of this innocent
person, and violated his dust, whom in his Life time he could not look
upon without reverence. Nor shall I do him the honor to name him,
much less to answer him, but rather leave him to the Tribunal of his
own Conscience, where if the Court be not infinitely corrupted, he
stands condemned already. And this I forbear the rather, that writing
his Life, I might in this particular imitate the Life I write of, which had
so much of moderation and calmeness in it, that though he had many
encounters with those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (such as Bishop <hi>Nazianzen</hi>
complains of) yet he never dealt with them at their own weapons, but
borrowed his from the Armory of his Saviour, from whence he was
furnished with humility enough to oppose their pride, and meekness
enough to answer their choler.</p>
            <p>As for his Patience in suffering, which is a neighbor virtue to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
he is a rare example; for living in those tumultuous, and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
times, when Rapine, and Malice was called Zeal, and
Sedition wore the colours of Religion, and being thereupon driven
both from his native Countrey, and from the honors, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he enjoyed, he was never so much as heard to complain
of his enemies, but upon his death-bed made it his solemn prayer to
God, that he in his own particular might be forgiven upon no other
tearms, then as he for Christs sake forgave them.</p>
            <p>For piety he was more for substance, then for shew, more for the
power of godlyness, then the bare form of it. Frequent he was in his
private Prayers, and in the publick worship of God of such an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
carriage, as might warm the coldest congregation to gather heat,
and to joyn with him in the same fervency and height of his devotion.</p>
            <p>For preaching he was rightly gifted, though not in the Modern sense,
where ignorance and impudence, without any farther commission,
make up the Preacher. For his constant way was to deliver much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in few words, not affecting or looking for applause from them, who
doat upon the best lungs, and the longest Preacher, but considering se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
whose message he brought, he discharged it with so much judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:50008:9"/>
and yet with such simplicity of spirit, as might sooner get Souls
for God, then Praise from men.</p>
            <p>For outward works of Charity, he looked upon them as the proper
Badge of his heavenly Master, and could no more esteem him a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
who boasted of his faith without them, then he could believe a
Thorn or Brambleto be a Fig-tree. And in his own particular he acted
in this way to the utmost of his means, for besides the dispensing of his
private Charity, where the right hand was not to know what the left
hand did, he publickly upon his own charges built, and adorn'd the
Church of <hi>Darsy</hi> after the decent English form; which if the boisterous
hand of a mad Reformation hath not disordered, is at this time one of
the beautifullest little pieces of Church-work, that is left to that now-unhappy
Countrey. Nor is it to be buried in silence, what he did in a
time of famine, for the relief of the Isles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> when he did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incite others to a liberal Contribution, but led the way to them by his
own example, in such a proportion as suted rather with the largeness of
his minde then of his fortunes.</p>
            <p>There remain but two things more to be accounted for, The Children
of his Body, and the Issue of his Brain: The former was numerous, but
of these, three onely came to perfect age, whom he had by <hi>Rachel Lindsay</hi>
daughter to <hi>David Lindsay</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rosse,</hi> of the house of <hi>Edzell,</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
family in <hi>Scotland.</hi> His eldest Son Sir <hi>Iohn Spotiswood</hi> lives yet,
though not in a plentiful, yet in a contented condition, not any way cast
down, or asham'd of his Sufferings, but comforting himself rather,
that in this general Ruine brought upon his Countrey, he hath kept his
Conscience free, though his Estate hath suffered.</p>
            <p>His second Son was Sir <hi>Robert Spotiswood,</hi> a great ornament to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for his many and rare abilities, who after he had studied nine years
abroad, was for his great wisdome and knowledge in the Laws, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
first by King <hi>Iames</hi> to be Lord of the Session extraordinary, and
afterward by King <hi>Charles</hi> not onely to be the constant President thereof,
but to be his chief Secretary for that Nation. And although he suffered a
violent death upon the Scaffold at S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> yet seeing he was found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of no Crime but that of Loyalty and Fidelity to his Master, which
in no Records of Law, nor in any Age but this <hi>(ubi ipsa rerum nomina
perdidimus)</hi> was ever reckoned among Treasons, let his Memory he had
in honour, as of a Martyr that suffered for Righteousness sake: for which
he had so great a zeal, that upon that very Scaffold where he was to suffer,
he shew'd such a religious and honest boldness towards his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as to call to as many of them as curiosity had brought thither to
see his end, That they should keep fast their Duties to their God, and to
their King, and beware of those seditious Ministers, into whose mouths,
as into the Prophets of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the lying spirit had entred, both to seduce
them, and to ruine that noble Nation.</p>
            <p>The third left of his Progeny was a Daughter, who being virtuously
<pb facs="tcp:50008:9"/>
and religiously bred, was happily married to Sir <hi>William Saint-clare</hi> of
<hi>Rosline,</hi> one of the ancient Barons in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for any Works that he left behinde him (besides the memory of
his life, which might have made the greatest Volumn) I hear of none
extant but this excellent History: For though he were a person both of
great Place and Parts, he was not easily tempted to trouble the Press, and
to shew himself abroad. Nor was this History undertaken by him by
any free motion of his own, but by the instance and command of King
<hi>Iames,</hi> whose discerning spirit had singled out him as a person best qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
for an Historian, with Prudence, and Candor, and clearness of
style, and so much innocent courage, as neither to fear to speak the Truth,
nor to dare to speak a Lie. And though his obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of his Soveraign had a very powerful influence upon him, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to deal with a King who made not his Will his Law, but being a great
Master of Reason, was as ready to hear, as to give it; he took the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in an humble way to propound several Objections, one of which
more especially deserves to be remembred, not onely for the Historians
sake, but for his that set him on work: and it was thus; <hi>It is not unknown
to your Majesty</hi> (saith the Bishop, being willing enough to finde an hansom
excuse) <hi>that your Majesties Mother being defamed by the bold Writings of a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Party, and the credulity of easie people (who to avoid the trouble of searching
into them, use to swallow such Reports as these without chewing) hath not left a
clear name behinde her: And as in mine own pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ticular judgement I cannot joyn with
them in those Scandals which they have with so malicious a falshood cast upon her,
so your Majesty must give me leave to say, that in all things she did I cannot approve
her: And being of necessity to speak of her in the Series of this History, what to
do therein I know not.</hi> To whom the King replied, <hi>Speak the Truth man, and
spare not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon this encouragement from so excellent a King (which few
of the Rulers of this present world dare give to their Historians) he
chearfully set about this Work, and laying aside all Partialities, that he
might more faithfully go through with it, he had not onely the use of
all the Registers both of Church and State in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but of all Letters
of State that could any way concern the Work he was about, which
either were sent to him, to be survey'd by his own eyes, or transcribed
by sworn Officers, and attested by the Clerks hands. With this caution,
and with these advantages he undertook, continued, and finish'd this
History, as the Intervals of publick business, and his own private Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Devotions would give him leave. And the Work being of that
nature, as not to be <hi>Res Ingenii,</hi> and to be woven out of his own Brain,
but such as required search and deliberation, and such helps as were
not alwayes ready at command, but were to be waited for, let not the
Reader wonder that this History begun by King <hi>Iames</hi> command, should
not come into the world till both King <hi>Iames</hi> was in his grave, and the
Writer too; but let him rather wonder that it comes out now: for it
<pb facs="tcp:50008:10"/>
was left like an Infant of the Israelites in an Ark of Reeds, and if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
had not found out very tender hands and heart to save it, it had
been lost. And now it is time to bring this Reverend Prelat to his grave,
though his good name and story may be longer lived. The manner of
his burial by the command and care of his religious King, was solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ordered, for the corps being attended by many mourners and at least
800 Torches, and being brought neer the Abbey Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi>
the whole Nobility of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> (then present at Court)
with all the Kings servants and many Gentlemen came out of their
Coaches, and conveied the body to the West-dore, where it was met by
the Dean and Prebendaries of that Church in their Clerical habits, and
buried according to the solemn Rites of the <hi>English</hi> Church, before the
extermination of decent Christian burial was come in fashion:</p>
            <p>Above his Corps these words following are engraven in brass.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is not amongst men a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
help for the attaining unto
wisdome, then is the reading of
History. We call Experience a
good Mistris, and so she is; but
as it is in our Scottish Proverb,
<hi>It seldome quits the cost:</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
not so; it teacheth us at
other mens cost, and carrieth this
advantage more, that in a few hours reading, a man may
gather moe Instructions out of the same, then twenty men
living successively one after another, can possibly learn by
their own experience. Therefore hath History by all wise
men been ever held in good estimation: and none thought to
deserve better of the Church and State wherein they lived,
then they that have taken the pains to record unto Posterity
the things fallen forth in their dayes: <hi>For there is
no new thing under the Sun; what hath been, or is, the
same also shall be,</hi> saith the Preacher.</p>
            <p>To know the success and event of every course, there
needs onely the knowledge of things past, and a fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of them with the present. Now this knowledge is
chiefly got by History; The want whereof hath bred in our
Church many strange mistakings: For did men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how things went at our Reformation, and since that
time, they would never have been moved to think that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy
was against the Constitutions of this Church; One
of the first things done in it, being the placing of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents
<pb facs="tcp:50008:12"/>
with Episcopal Power, in the same, and no act
so often iterated in the General Assemblies of the Church,
as that Ministers should be obedient to their Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
under pain of deprivation. Then for the Consistorial
Discipline brought from <hi>Geneva</hi> some sixteen years after
the Reformation; did men know the troubles raised thereby,
both in the Church and State, with the necessity that your
Majesties Father of blessed Memory was put to for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
that confused Government, they would never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
nor cry it up as they do. To remedy this want, and let
all that desire to be truly informed of things fallen out in our
times, I took the pains to collect this History, which I do now
humbly present unto Your Sacred Majesty: If the same shall
be graciously accepted, as I cannot but presume upon Your
accustomed humanity to all, I have that I desire: for with
me it is a small thing to be judged of others; God knoweth,
I have followed the Truth, and studied to observe the Laws
of History.</p>
            <p>The Collection premitted in the two first Books, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the planting and progress of Christian Religion in this
Kingdome, with the worthy Instruments that God raised to
propagate the true Faith, both here and in the neighbouring
Countries, contained no great matters: as of those first
Ages, whereof we have few or no Records remaining, how
should any great things be truly affirmed? Yet the little I have
found and brought together, may let us see the exceeding
goodness of God toward this Nation, having so soon after
the Ascension of our Saviour unto the heavens, made the
Gospel here to be Preached, and a Church thereby gathered,
which to this day hath found a safe harbour under Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Royall Progenitors. Fourteen hundred years and
above we reckon, since King <hi>Donald</hi> the first of that name
his imbracing the Christian Faith: All which time there hath
not been wanting in the Royall Stock a most kinde Nursing
Father to this Church: or if a careless and dissolute King
(which in so long a succession of Princes is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred)
<pb facs="tcp:50008:12"/>
happened to reign, the same was ever abundantly
repaired by one or other of the Kings that followed; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did this bring them less happiness then honour; For
give me leave, Sir, to speak it, which I hold not unworthy
of your Majesties consideration, the <hi>Scottish</hi> Kingdom
once the least of nine Kingdoms that ruled in the Isle, by
the wonderfull providence of God, is now so encreased,
first in the person of your Majesties blessed Father, and
now in your own, as the Scepter of the whole is put into
your Majesties hands, which that you may long happily
sway and your posterity after you to the worlds end, is the
hearty wish of all loyall Subjects. For my part (next to
God his undeserved love) I do ascribe this happiness to the
piety and devotion of your princely Ancestors, and to their
zeal in maintaining the rights and liberties of this
Church. Your Majestie keeping the same course (which
blessed be God you hold) you may be confident of God his
protection against all dangers whatsoever, for he will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
them that honour him, and never turn away his face
from his Anointed.</p>
            <p>God Almighty I beseech to multiply his blessings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Majesty and your Royal Progeny, to give you
the desire of your heart, and clothe all your Enemies
with shame.</p>

thought meet to begin at the time in which this Kingdom
did first receive the Christian faith; for albeit we have
few or no Records left us of those first times, yet as much
is to be found in stories, as will shew what was the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Church in every age. And herewith we must
content our selves, till we come to the times that yield
greater plenty of matter, when I shall come to our own
time. I purpose to set down at length the things that have happened both in
the Church and State, together with the counsels and causes of those events,
without the which, the History should be of little use; For take away from story
the causes whereupon, the manner how, and the purpose wherefore things were
done, that which remaineth is more like a Fable then an History; delighting the
Reader, it may be, for the present; but giving little or no instruction at all. I am
not ignorant how unsafe it is to write of matters so recent, and what offence it
may give to divers persons; but the desire I have to give posterity a true infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of things, and to have them made wise by our errours, weigheth down
with me all such feares; wherefore without further prefacing, to begin.</p>

<hi>Donald</hi> with his Queen and divers of his Nobles, being then solemnly baptized.
Yet was not that the first time wherein Christ was here made known: for <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> who lived some yeares before, speaking of the propagation of the Gospel
throughout the world, doth reckon among the countreys the parts of <hi>Britannie,</hi>
unto which the <hi>Romanes</hi> could not finde accesse; and what these parts were we
cannot doubt, all the In-land of <hi>Britannie</hi> being then made subject to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi>
and no part free, but that little corner of the Isle which the <hi>Scots</hi> did inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.
Moreover, it cannot in reason be thought, that the conversion of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was all wrought at one instant, great alterations, such as that must needs
have been, not being made, but by little and little; so as we may well think that
numbers of people have been won to the Christian profession, before the same
was publickly embraced by the King and his Nobles.</p>
               <p>But who they were that God used as instruments in that work,<note place="margin">The Planters of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this Kingdom.</note> is not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known; <hi>Nicephorus</hi> writeth that <hi>Simon Zelotes</hi> (after he had travelled through
<hi>Egypt, Cyrene, Afrique, Mauritania,</hi> and <hi>Lybia)</hi> came at last <hi>ad occidentalem Ocea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
insulásque Britannicas,</hi> and there preached the Gospel; <hi>Dorotheus</hi> addeth,
that he was crucified in these parts. There be Authours likewise of no small cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
who write that S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle after his first imprisonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> did
visit this Isle, and preach the Gospel in the utmost parts thereof.</p>
               <p>The opinion most commonly received is,<note place="margin">Reasons why Pope <hi>Victor</hi> could not be the worker of our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> that Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> upon the intreaty
of King <hi>Donald,</hi> did send hither some Preachers, and that these were the men that
wrought our conversion: but this cannot hold, for divers reasons. As first, if the
King did move the Pope in any such businesse, it must needs have been upon
some knowledge and liking he had of the Christian profession; and if so, the
Preachers that he sent hither, could not be the first that taught us the faith of
Christ. Again, the estate of the time maketh this opinion improbable; for the
year, in which the King is said to have sent that legation to <hi>Rome,</hi> was the very last
of Pope <hi>Victor</hi> (for he suffered Martyrdome in the year 203.) and hardly we
can think, that in the heat of persecution, which then did rage in all the <hi>Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
Provinces, the King would have imployed any in such a message. Thirdly, if
our conversion had been wrought by Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> how came it that our Church
was not fashioned to the <hi>Romane</hi> in outward Rites, especially in the observance of
<hi>Easter,</hi> whereof <hi>Victor</hi> was so zealous, as he excommunicated all the Churches
of the East for their disconformity with the <hi>Romane</hi> in that point? And it is clear,
that for the space of many ages our Church did keep a form different from the
<hi>Romane,</hi> and with much adoe was brought to accept their Customes and Rites.
Last of all, the learned Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> although he will have our conversion
to be made by some one of the <hi>Romane</hi> Bishops, esteemeth this which is said of
<hi>Victor</hi> no better then a fable; for how is it, sayes he, that neither <hi>Beda,</hi> nor <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
nor S. Hierom have made any mention of it? In all likelihood, if any such
thing had been, some one or other of them would have remembred the same.
Leaving therefore this conceit, and not deeming these other opinions very war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,
if place may be given to conjecture, I verily think that under <hi>Domitians</hi>

our Church did still retain the custom of the Oriental, and maintain their practice

he was about to do it, the Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> put him to other businesse; he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

utmost ends of the Isle; The <hi>Scots</hi> in the mean time keeping the Marishes, and
Mountains, though they durst not encounter the <hi>Romane</hi> forces because of their
numbers, yet did annoy them much, taking them at advantages; which <hi>Severus</hi>
perceiving, and that there were no means utterly to subdue them, as he had first
intended, he made offer of peace, if so they would quit what they possessed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Wall of <hi>Adrian,</hi> and the River of <hi>Forth.</hi> The condition, though hard and
unreasonable, was yielded unto by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who desired to be freed of so mighty
an enemy; and he to exclude them from the rest of <hi>Britaine,</hi> did raise a wall of
stone betwixt the Rivers of <hi>Forth</hi> and <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> but <hi>Cratilinth</hi> coming unto the Crown in the year 277. made
it one of his first works to purge the Kingdome of heathenish superstition, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
the <hi>Druids,</hi> a sort of Priests, held in those dayes in great reputation. Their
manner was to celebrate sacrifices, and perform their other rites in Groves, with
leaves and branches of Oake, and thence saith <hi>Pliny,</hi> they were called <hi>Druides;</hi> for
<gap reason="foreign">

doth further write,<note place="margin">A short descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the <hi>Druides.</hi>
                  </note> that besides the managing of sacrifices which were committed
to them, they were trusted with the decision of controversies, private and publick;
and that such as would not stand to their judgement, were interdicted from
being present at their sacrifices and holy rites; which was taken for a grievous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
It is likewise testified of them, that they were well learned in all natural
Philosophy, men of moral conversation, and for Religion not so grossely ignorant
and superstitious, as other heathen Priests; for they taught, <q>That there was one only
God, and that it was not lawful to present him in an image: That the soules
of men did not perish with the bodies, and that after death men were rewarded
according to the life they led on earth.</q> Some also have written that they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
of the conception of a Virgin, and of the birth of him who should be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of the world: But that such mysteries were revealed unto them, and so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the Prophets of God in the Old Testament had scarce the like, is not credible.
They lived likewise in great respect with all sorts of people, and ruled their
affaires very politickly; for being governed by a President, who kept his residence
in the Isle of <hi>Man,</hi> (which then was under the dominion of the <hi>Scots)</hi> they did once
every year meet in that place to take counsel together for the ordering of affaires:
and carried matters with such discretion, that <hi>Cratilinth</hi> found it difficil enough
to expulse them, because of the favour they had among the people.</p>
               <p>But that which furthered not a little the propagation of the Gospel in these
parts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diocletian</hi> his persecution.</note> was the persecution raised by <hi>Diocletian,</hi> which at that time was hot in the
South parts of <hi>Britaine.</hi> This brought many Christians, both Preachers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
into this Kingdom, who were all kindly received by <hi>Cratilinth,</hi> and had the
Isle of <hi>Man</hi> given them for their remaining, and revenues sufficient assigned for
their maintenance. In this Isle King <hi>Cratilinth</hi> erected a stately Church to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Sodorense fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> which he adorned with all necessary ornaments, and called

died peaceably in the same Isle. Our stories report that at the same time there
lived in this Kingdom divers zealous and notable Preachers, of which number they
name these six, <hi>Modocus, Priseus, Calanus, Ferranus, Ambianus,</hi> and <hi>Carnocus;</hi> that
seem to have been men of principal note, and of them all generally it is witnessed,
that living solitary, they were in such a reputation for their holinesse of life, as the
Cells wherein they lived, were after their deaths turned into Temples or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
And of this it came that all the Churches afterwards erected, were called <hi>Cells,</hi>

these Cells, whereas people assembled to hear service: somewhat it maketh for
this, that in certain old Bulls and rescripts of Popes, I finde them termed <hi>Keledei,</hi>
and not <hi>Culdei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same <hi>Boeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bishops in Scotland at the first planting of the faith.</note> out of ancient Annals, reports that these Priests were wont for
their better government to elect some one of their number by common suffrage,
to be chief and principal among them, without whose knowledge and consent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was done in any matter of importance;<note place="margin">Boeth ibidem.</note> and that the person so elected, was
called <hi>Scotorum Episcopus,</hi> a <hi>Scots</hi> Bishop, or a Bishop of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Neither had our

the third, who first divided the countrey into Dioceses, appointing to every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
the limits within which they should keep and exercise their jurisdiction. After
that time they were styled either by the countreys whereof they had the oversight,
or by the City where they kept their residence.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Cratilinth;</hi> during his Reign, Christian Religion did prosper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
and <hi>Fincormachus</hi> his Cousin-germane that succeeded, keeping the
same course, gave in his time a perfect setling unto it: So great a happinesse it is to
have two Kings of qualities alike good, succeed one to another; for what the one
beginneth, the other doth perfect and accomplish.</p>
               <p>Yet this felicity endureth not long, the state both of the Kingdome and Church,
being within a few yeares after his death quite overturned by this occasion;<note place="margin">Maximus the Roman prefect practiseth with the <hi>Picts</hi> against the Scots.</note>

a man born in <hi>Spain,</hi> but of <hi>Romane</hi> education, being sent Lieutenant into <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
and presuming to bring the whole Isle under his power, did practise secretly
with the <hi>Picts</hi> for rooting out the <hi>Scots,</hi> promising that all the lands which the <hi>Scots</hi>
possessed should be given to them.<note place="margin">Bouch. li. 6.</note> The <hi>Picts</hi> a perfidious people, greedily embracing

and King <hi>Eugenius,</hi> with the most part of his Nobility, slain.</p>
               <p>This defeat was followed with a rigorous edict,<note place="margin">The Scots ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled</note> commanding all the <hi>Scots,</hi> of
what age, sexe, or condition soever, to depart out of this Isle before a certain day:
which was so precisely executed,<note place="margin">Buchan. li. 4.</note> as neither man nor woman, young nor old, were
permitted to stay; nay not a Church-man (though all of that profession were in
good esteem among the <hi>Picts</hi> themselves at the time.) Thus all the <hi>Scots</hi> went in
exile, betaking themselves some into <hi>Ireland,</hi> others into the countreys of <hi>Denmark,
Norway, Sweden,</hi> or where it was in their fate to be cast: onely some few Church-men,
after they had long wandred from place to place, got privately into <hi>Iona</hi>
one of the West Isles; where living in a poor condition, they laid the foundation
of a Monastery, which in succeeding ages became famous by the beneficence of
our Kings, and the sanctity of the Monks that there professed. Never was any
Church or Kingdom brought to a greater desolation, but how long it continued,

               <p>Whether <hi>Regulus</hi> had such a vision or not, I leave it to those that list to believe.
But that he did bring with him such Reliques is not improbable; for in these times
Christians did hold the bones and reliques of <hi>Martyrs</hi> in a respectful reverence:
which doth in no sort justify the abuses which afterwards crept into the Church,
when from the keeping of Reliques, they grew to worship and adore them; yea, and
in many places, Priests out of their covetousnesse did use impostures, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

These and the like abuses did justly bring the keeping and carrying about
of Reliques to be detested. In the time of persecution, when the bodies of Martyrs
were thrown into the fields and cast into dung hills, it might be held a charitable
and pious work to gather and preserve them: but now that those things are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously
used, and vile receipts therewith practised, no wise man will allow
such follies. <hi>Better it were,</hi> as <hi>Cassander</hi> advised, <hi>to incite people to the</hi> imitation

the books that he had brought with him from <hi>Rome.</hi> Never was any Prince more

the <hi>Churches</hi> he founded, reckoned to 365. and the <hi>Priests</hi> he ordained, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
to be <hi>three thousand,</hi> may sufficiently witnesse. He lived 122. years, and ended
his days in the city of <hi>Downe</hi> within the Province of <hi>Ulster,</hi> in the year of our Lord

And even at this day in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> certain <hi>hymnes</hi> compiled by him, are
sung in the Festivals of the <hi>Nativity,</hi> and <hi>Epiphany;</hi> which sheweth in what esteem
he was held.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Irish</hi> writers contend,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sedulius</hi> proved to be a <hi>Scottish</hi> man against the <hi>Irish</hi> writers.</note> that this <hi>Sedulius</hi> was their countrey man born, as
the like they affirm of all that were of any note in our Church in those first ages.
And albeit in divers of his works he doth intitle himself <hi>Sedulius Scotigena,</hi> and
that <hi>Sixtus Senensis Trithemius, Baronius,</hi> and divers others, do all witnesse him to
be of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, yet they will have him to be an <hi>Irish,</hi> because forsooth in
those elder times the name of <hi>Scoti</hi> was common to the inhabitants of the <hi>greater</hi>
and <hi>lesser Scotland;</hi> But this reason is naught: for granting that the countreys were
so distinguished of old, and that <hi>Ireland</hi> was called <hi>Scotia major,</hi> and the part of
<hi>Britain</hi> which the Colonie deduced from thence did inhabit, <hi>Scotia minor,</hi> whereof
there is some appearance: yet that will not infer him to be an <hi>Irish</hi> more then a
<hi>Scot.</hi> This I trust they will not deny, that <hi>Scotland</hi> was Christian long before <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and that <hi>Sedulius</hi> of whom we speak, was come to a good age before <hi>Patrick</hi>
went about their conversion. Now if he had been an <hi>Irish</hi> by Nation, would not
he much rather have imployed his travels to instruct his countrey men in the truth,
then have spent his time abroad among strangers? Further, I should desire these
who plead so earnestly to have our men esteemed to be of their countrey, to name
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50008:17"/>
any one another worthy of credit,<note place="margin">An. 500.</note> that since the <hi>Scots</hi> were reduced from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile
by <hi>Fergus</hi> the second, did ever call <hi>Ireland, Scotland the greater.</hi> They will not
finde any of trust:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Scotland</hi> a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie deduced from <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> the name of <hi>Scots</hi> being long before appropriated to the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
reduced from thence, and quite extinct among the <hi>Irish.</hi> It is true, that we oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finde
the <hi>Scots</hi> called <hi>Irishes,</hi> like as yet we term commonly our <hi>Highland-men,</hi> in
regard they speak the <hi>Irish language,</hi> and retain divers of their customes. But that
the <hi>Irish</hi> were called <hi>Scots,</hi> or the countrey of <hi>Ireland</hi> called <hi>Scotland,</hi> since they grew
to be different nations, and were known to be so, I am confident will not be shewed.
To close this; howsoever <hi>Ireland</hi> be the <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> the <hi>daughter,</hi> as a reverend
Prelate hath written, &amp; we deny not: (for our first progenitors we hold came from
that countrey) there is no reason why the <hi>sons</hi> which the <hi>daughter</hi> hath brought forth,
should be reckoned the sons of another <hi>Mother,</hi> and she thereby robbed of her honor.</p>
               <p>But to our story; the condition of this Church in those times was most happy,
all the care of Preachers being to winne souls unto <hi>Christ; Avarice</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> the
two main pests of the Church, had not as yet seised upon them; so as they were held
with all people in great veneration. <hi>Beda</hi> saith, that <hi>whosoever did meet them by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
either in the streets, or otherwise in journeying by the way, they would not depart
without their blessing.</hi> And which increased greatly the felicity of the time, the

and that the <hi>contempt of Ministers</hi> breedeth ever <hi>contempt of Religion;</hi> did carefully
provide for their necessities, appointing to them <hi>Mansion places</hi> at the Churches
where they served,<note place="margin">Tithes decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Church.</note> with a competent portion of <hi>land</hi> thereto adjoyning, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring

                  <hi>fruits, herbs,</hi> and <hi>flocks,</hi> which did either produce or
nourish, to appertain properly to the Church. He did further enact for the safety of
their persons, <hi>That if any should happen to smite a Church-man, his hand should be cut
off; and if the Church-man was killed, that the murtherer should lose all his goods, and
be burnt alive.</hi> For the greater reverence of Church-censures, it was likewise his
ordinance, <hi>That whosoever were by the Church excommunicated, should not be admitted
to stand in judgement, nor credit given to their testimony.</hi>

in a sport of hunting, that some Noble-men falling at discord, there was
a great slaughter committed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aidanus</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth warre against the <hi>Picts.</hi>
                  </note> the Authours whereof fearing the severity of Law,
fled to <hi>Breudeus</hi> King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> and being remanded according to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

and rebuked him bitterly for making warre with his neighbour upon so light an
occasion; wherewith he is said to be no lesse moved then with the losse he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
for <hi>Columba</hi> striving to be gone, he caught him by the hand; and confessing
he had been too hasty, entreated his best advice, and counsel how to repair things.
But he replying that no advice could redresse the harm that was done; the King
burst forth into tears: <hi>Columba</hi> fell also a weeping; and after a little space, said that
he would counsell him to make peace: which he was content to do at his sight. The
matter moved to <hi>Brudeus,</hi>

                  </note> he likewise agreed to remit all to <hi>Columba,</hi> who shortly
after brought them to be friends. But the heart-burning between the two people
ceased not, which <hi>Ethelfrid</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (a wicked and avaritious
man) craftily entertained,<note place="margin">The <hi>Picts</hi> overcome, and <hi>Aidanus</hi> getteth the victory.</note> stirring the <hi>Picts</hi> to make fresh incursions upon the <hi>Scots,</hi>
so as <hi>Aidanus</hi> was compelled to take Arms; <hi>Columba</hi> being advertised of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
the King was put to, gave order that private supplications should be made
for his safety, and the overthrow of his enemies: which falling out according to
their wishes, was generally ascribed to <hi>Columba</hi> his devotion. For as the report
went, in the same hour wherein the enemies were defeated, he did call his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues
together, and willed them to turn their <hi>prayers</hi> into <hi>thanskgiving,</hi> for that the
King had obtained the victory: yet was the place of the conflict distant from <hi>Iona,</hi>
where <hi>Columba</hi> lived 200. miles at least.</p>

of a good age; neither did the King <hi>Aidanus</hi> long survive him. The <hi>Irish</hi> contend
that <hi>Columba</hi> died in the City of <hi>Down,</hi> and was buried in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Patricks Tomb;</hi> and for

               <p>But it carrieth no likelihood that <hi>Columba</hi> being so farre in years, would make a
journey into <hi>Ireland,</hi> or that <hi>Aidanus,</hi> who loved him so dearly, would suffer him to
depart whilest he lived; It may be that upon some occasion his bones were translated
thither, yet the pilgrimages made in superstitious times to the Isle <hi>Iona</hi> for visiting
his grave, do shew what the received opinion was of his death and burial.</p>

esteemed,<note place="margin">Boeth li. 9.</note> should be in any sort stained, gave out that he was <hi>born of a Virgin:</hi>
which was believed of simple and credulous people. But the reproach which lay

                  </note> where living
a solitary life, he founded a Monastery betwixt the Rivers of <hi>Elwid</hi> and <hi>Edwy.</hi>
They write <hi>that in his Monastery there were daily entertained six hundred threescore
and three persons; of which number three hundred were kept at some manual work within
the Monastery; other three hundred did labour in the fields, and practise husbandry; and
the rest being appointed for divine service, had the day and night divided among them,
so as one company succeeding to another, there were some alwayes in the Church, praying
and praising Almighty God.</hi> Having stayed there a few years, he resigned his place
to <hi>Asaph,</hi> a godly and vertuous man; and returning to <hi>Scotland,</hi> he made his abode
at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where he layed the foundation of a stately Church, and was therein at
his death interred.<note place="margin">

did never eat flesh, nor taste wine or any strong drink; and when he went to rest,
slept on the cold ground, having a stone for his pillow; and that notwithstanding
he lived thus hardly, he did attain to the age of ninescore and five years. Many ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miracles have been ascribed unto him; but certainly he was a man of rare
parts, and worthy to have been made a subject of truth to posterity, not of fables
and fictions, as the Legends of Monks have made him.</p>

the <hi>Picts,</hi> and was so beloved and honoured in his life, as after his death the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
of <hi>Aldham, Tuningham,</hi> and <hi>Preston,</hi> did contend who should have his corps to
bury.<note place="margin">Boeth li. 9.</note> As they grew to some heat, the Bishop of the bounds (the story doth not
expresse his name) intervened,<note place="margin">Lesl. li. 4.</note> and willed the people to deferre the funeral to the

his wil in that businesse. The next day they found three Coffins with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
corpses, betwixt which, no difference could be perceived; and interpreting
this for a miracle, went away each of them with a Coffin, well satisfied and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
What policy the Bishop used in this is not known, but hereby we may see
how easily people were in those times led with their teachers. The other, <hi>Conval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>

that they were a people indocile, and froward, that the pains taken upon

not to give over the work at any hands, for that the bad successe of <hi>Cormanus</hi> labours
might possibly proceed from himself, that had not used the people tenderly, nor according
to the Apostles rule, <hi>fed them at first with milk;</hi> and therefore desired some other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

               <p>This opinion allowed by all, none was thought fitter for this service then he who

                  </note> and so with common consent was <hi>Aidan</hi> ordained Bishop,

fault which he supposed <hi>Corman</hi> had committed, and so tempered his doctrine, as
multitudes of people daily did resort unto him to be instructed. It was a great
hinderance unto him at first that he was not skilled in the <hi>Saxon</hi> tongue, neither
did the people understand his language; but this defect the King himself supplied,
interpreting to the auditory all that <hi>Aidanus</hi> delivered in his Sermons. So by the

heart was never lifted up within him,<note place="margin">An. 651.</note> but still he shewed himselfe courteous and affable,
and of the poor most compassionate.</hi> Among examples of his liberality towards these,
the same <hi>Beda</hi> relateth, <q>That sitting at Table on <hi>Easter</hi> day, and <hi>Aidanus</hi> by
him, when it was told that a number of poor men were at the gate expecting his
Almes; he commanded to carry the meat that was set before him unto them, and
the platter of silver wherein it was, to be broke in pieces, and distributed among
them. <hi>Aidanus</hi> beholding it, took the King by the right hand, and kissing it, said,
<hi>Nunquam marcescat haec manus,</hi>
                  </q> never let this hand consume or wither. Which, as he
writeth, came also to passe. <q>For being killed in battel, and his arm and his
hand cut off, the same was inclosed in a silver shrine, and remained for many
years uncorrupted, in the Church of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Bamborough.</hi>
                  </q> This and the other

in such fables and fictions.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Aidanus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Bishop Aida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> he was an ensample of <hi>abstinence, sobriety, chastity, charity,</hi> and all
other <hi>Episcopal vertues;</hi> for as he taught, so he lived, was idle at no time, nor did he
admit any of his retinue to be so, but kept them in a continual exercise, either read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scripture, or learning the Psalmes of <hi>David</hi> by heart. If he was invited to
any feast (as rarely he went) he made no stay, but after a little refreshment taken, got
himself away. In preaching he was most diligent, travailing through the countrey,
for the greater part on foot, and instructing the people, wheresoever he came. In a
word, he was deficient in no duty required of a good Pastor; and having govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Church in those parts most happily the space of 17. years, died in the Isle of
<hi>Lindisfarne</hi> (now called <hi>Holy-Island)</hi> the place he choosed for his residence; where
he was also buried.</p>
               <p>After his death,<note place="margin">

                  </note> which happened in the year 651. <hi>Finnanus</hi> was ordained Bishop,
and sent to the <hi>Northumbers</hi> from <hi>Scotland:</hi> he followed his predecessor in all,
and was greatly troubled by <hi>Romanus,</hi> or <hi>Conanus</hi> (as other name him) about
the observing of <hi>Easter.</hi> This <hi>Conanus</hi> born in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had lived some years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea, and was much taken by the <hi>Romane</hi> rites; for advancing whereof (so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
he was that way) he left his station in <hi>Kent,</hi> and coming to <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
did challenge the Bishop to a dispute. The Bishop answering, that he
would not refuse to dispute, but to admit an alteration in Church rites,
whilest he lived, he would not; the dispute ceased, and so for the time that he sate
Bishop, <hi>Easter</hi> was celebrated after the ancient manner of the <hi>Scots: Finnanus</hi> in the
mean time applying himself to better exercise, did work the conversion of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi>
and <hi>Mercians.</hi> For having baptized <hi>Penda</hi> the Prince of <hi>Mercia,</hi> he sent
with him four preachers, who reformed all that part of the countrey. <hi>Divina,</hi> or
<hi>Duina</hi> a <hi>Scottish</hi> man was one of those preachers, and consecrated Bishop of <hi>Finnan</hi>
in the year 656. In the catalogue of the <hi>Bishops of Lichfield,</hi> I finde him first placed.
There succeeded to him, <hi>Kellach</hi> a <hi>Scottish</hi> man also; but he renouncing his charge
because of the contentions that arose, returned to his countrey.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Finnan</hi> having governed the Churches of <hi>Northumberland</hi> the space of ten
years,<note place="margin">

erected: so great was the affection of these <hi>Northumbers</hi> to these preceding Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,

was brought,<note place="margin">The contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie about <hi>Easter</hi> waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and placed in that See. In his time the controversie of <hi>Easter</hi> was again
wakened, and more hotly followed then before; great dealing there was to work
him to a conformity, but he would not forsake the course that his predecessors had
kept. After divers conferences a publick dispute was in end condescended
to,<note place="margin">A dispute for the time of <hi>Easter.</hi>

was Abbesse; she was a professed adversary to all the rites of <hi>Rome,</hi> especially
Clerical tonsure; which made <hi>Colman</hi> more willingly to agree unto the meeting.
<hi>Oswy</hi> King of <hi>Northumbers,</hi> with <hi>Elfred</hi> his son, were present in person, and many
Ecclesiastick men of all degrees. The reasoners were <hi>Colman</hi> on the one part, who

now shining throughout the world, it is not lawful for a Christian to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
or to offer carnal sacrifices unto God. Thus S. <hi>Iohn</hi> keeping the custom
of the law, began the celebration of <hi>Easter</hi> upon the 14. day of the first moneth,
at evening, not caring whether it fell upon the Sabbath day, or any other day of
the week: But S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christians, it is clear by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, which did ratify and confirm the

<hi>Peter,</hi> nor doth your celebration of <hi>Easter</hi> agree either with the Law o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> observing it according to the Law, had no respect to the first day
after the Sabbath, whereas you keep not <hi>Easter</hi> but on the first of the Sabbath;
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did celebrate <hi>Easter</hi> from the 15. of the Moon to the 21. which you
do not; for you keep <hi>Easter</hi> from the 14. to the 20. day, and often you begin
<hi>Easter</hi> on the 13. day at night, whereof the Law maketh to mention, neither
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50008:21"/>
did our Lord the authour of the Gospel eat the Passover on the 13. day, but
upon the 14. at night, and at the same time he did celebrate the Sacrament of
the New Testament in remembrance of his death and passion; So, as I have said,
you neither agree with Law, nor Gospel, with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the
celebration of the greatest festivity.</q>

                  <q>And did <hi>Anatholius</hi> then, who in the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
history is so highly commended, go against both the Law and the Gospel,
when as he said that <hi>Easter</hi> ought to be kept from the 13. day to the 20? or shall
we think our most reverent father <hi>Columba,</hi> and his successours who were all dear
unto God, did transgresse in observing <hi>Easter</hi> after that manner? They were men
of great piety and vertue, and their miracles have declared; and I making no
doubt of their holinesse,</q> will endevour to follow their order and discipline.</p>
               <p>Then said <hi>Wilfrid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wilfrid his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> 
                  <q>It is known that <hi>Anatholius</hi> was a godly and learned man;
but what have you to do with him, that observe not his customes? for he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the true rule of keeping <hi>Easter,</hi> and observed the <hi>circle of 19. yeares,</hi> which
either you know not, or if you do, ye set at nought, although the same be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the universal Church of Christ; he did so account the 14. day as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the same to be the 15. at night after the manner of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
and so the 20. day he believed to be the 21. in the evening; which distinction
you know not, as appears by this, that sometimes you keep <hi>Easter</hi> on the 13. day
before the full Moon. As to your father <hi>Columba</hi> and his followers, whose rule
and precepts confirmed by miracles, you confesse to follow, I may answer, That
in the day of judgement the Lord will say to many that prophesied in his name,
did cast out devils, and wrought other miracles, <hi>I know you not.</hi> But God
forbid I should speak this of your fathers, seeing it is better to believe
good of those we know not, then ill. Therefore I will not deny them to have
been the servants of God and be loved of him, seeing they served God with good
intent, though in simplicity. Neither do I think the order they keep in <hi>Easter</hi> did
hurt them much, so long as they had none among them, that could shew the right
observation thereof; If the truth had been shewed them, I doubt not they would
have followed the same, as well in this matter, as in others which they knew.
But if you and your associates should refuse the decrees of the Apostolick Sea,
or rather of the whole Church allowed by holy Scripture: now after you have
heard the same, without all question you sin heavily. Howbeit your fathers were
holy men, you must not think that a few dwelling in a corner of a remote Isle,
are to be preferred to the universal Church of Christ. And if <hi>Columba</hi> your
Father, yea and ours also if he was of Christ; was mighty in miracles, yet is
he not to be equalled to the Prince of the holy Apostles, unto whom the
Lord said, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this rock will I build my Church, against which;
the gates of hell shall not prevail; and will give unto the keyes of the kingdom of
heaven.</hi>

                  <hi>taking hold

unto <hi>Peter; he answered, that it was truth:</hi> And can you shew, <hi>sayes he,</hi> that the like
authority was given to your Father <hi>Columba?</hi> Colman <hi>answered, Not. Then said the

of the kingdom of heaven were given to him: <hi>They answered that they did. Then said

<hi>Ferqhard:</hi> the Nobility having consulted to depose him from his Kingdom for the
detestable cruelties he had committed, by <hi>Colman</hi> his authority they were onely
kept back, who told them, <hi>That the punishment of Kings belonged to God, and that he
ere it were long would take vengeanee of his wickednesse:</hi> which as he foretold came to
passe; for the King after a few dayes being at hunting, happened to be bitten by a
Wolfe, and falling into a feaver, such a putrefaction ensued in his body, that out of
every part there issued abundance of lice, and vermine, which made him abhorred
of all men. Languishing in this consumption a long space, and touched with a bitter
remorse for his wicked life, he sent for <hi>Colman,</hi> to whom he expressed a great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for the ill life he had led, intreating the help of his prayers, and to testifie his
humiliation, would needs be carried forth to the next fields wrapped in sackcloth;
where after an open confession made of his wickednesse, he was absolved by <hi>Colman,</hi>
and shortly after yielded up the ghost.</p>
               <p>The memory of this, which was yet fresh in the mindes of people, together with
the report of his constancy (for so it was interpreted) did purchase unto him great
love and reputation; but he making short stay at home, went soon after into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where he built a Monastery for the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> that followed him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They not well agreeing, he bought a piece of ground and founded a religious
house for the <hi>English</hi> apart. Bishop <hi>Lesly</hi> in his Chronicle writeth, that after this
he passed into <hi>Germany,</hi> and having travelled through <hi>Boheme, Hungary,</hi> and a great
part of <hi>Greece,</hi> as he returned by <hi>Austria,</hi> he was killed by some Pagans in those parts:
for this he citeth <hi>Iohannes Stabius</hi> the Historiographer of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the first. But
whatsoever became of him, he was certainly a man of great integrity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
much respected of all men.</p>

a Bishop, who had been Tutor to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the sixt, being sent in Ambassage
to <hi>Alfrid</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> fell in such a liking of the rites he saw there used,
as at his return he became an earnest perswader of his countreymen to receive
them, and prevailed with many. Yet the Monks of <hi>Iona,</hi> whose governor he had
sometimes been, did strongly oppose; others that loved not to be contentious, retired
themselves; among whom <hi>Disybodius,</hi> and <hi>Levinus</hi> are said to have been two:

the execution; the friendship contracted had almost turned into deadly enmity,
because of a rumour that went, that she was made away by the Kings knowledge.

                  <note place="margin">Bonifacius an Italian came into Scotland.</note> an <hi>Italian</hi> named <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> a
grave and venerable person as he described, and was judged by the vulgar sort to be
the Pope; some hath written that he was elected successour to <hi>Gregory</hi> the great,
but declined the charge out of a desire to promove religion in these Northern
parts. I rather think he came hither to confirm our acquaintance with the <hi>Romane
Church.</hi> As ever that was, for the paines he took in preaching the Gospel, and the
Churches he erected in this Kingdom, he deserveth of us an honourable remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.
For landing in the River of <hi>Tay</hi> at the mouth of a little water that divided
the countreyes of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Mermis,</hi> he there built a Church to the memory of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, another not farre from thence, he built at <hi>Telin,</hi> and a third at
<hi>Restennoth;</hi> and having finished these works, he did visit the countreys of <hi>Marre, Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,
Murray,</hi> and <hi>Bogieland,</hi> preaching the Gospel whithersoever he came, neither
did he rest till he came to the countrey of <hi>Ross,</hi> and choosing <hi>Rosmarkie</hi> for the place
of his residence; erected there a Church, where after his death he was buried. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochus</hi>
a learned Bishop of his countrey, taking delight in his company, followed him
in all these ways; and that he should not be separate from him in death, gave order
that he should be interred in the same Church and near unto <hi>Boniface;</hi> for he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived
him many years, and died in the 94. of his age, his bones were afterwards
translated to <hi>Lismore</hi> in <hi>Argile,</hi> because of his labours employed in reforming that
Church.</p>
               <p>Whether or not I should mention among these,<note place="margin">Bonifacius made Arch-Bishop of Mentz.</note> that <hi>Boniface</hi> who was by <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
the second preferred to be Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> I know not, so many writers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
him to have been born in <hi>England;</hi> but of what countrey soever he was,
none did ever adventure more for the Pope then he did; for he is said to have
brought the <hi>Bavarians, Thuringians, Hessians,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Germany</hi> more, to
submit themselves in all matters Ecclesiastick to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet was he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
greatly opposed (besides some <hi>Germanes)</hi> by two of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, <hi>Clemens</hi>
and <hi>Sampson,</hi> who at the time remained in those parts. These did openly in their
Sermons inveigh against him as a corrupter of Christian doctrine, charging him,
<q>First, for that he studied to winne men to the subjection of the Pope, and not to
the obedience of Christ. 2. That he laboured to establish a soveraign authority
in the Pope his person, as if he were onely the successour of the Apostles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all Bishops are their successours as well as he. 3. That he went about the
abolishing of Priests marriage, and extolled the single life beyond measure; and,
4. That he caused Masses to be said for the dead, erected Images in Churches, and
introduced diver rites unknown to the ancient Church.</q> For this <hi>Clemens</hi> in a
Councel holden at <hi>Rome,</hi> was excommunicated and condemned for an heretick,
The sentence is to be seen in the <hi>third Tome</hi> of the <hi>Councels,</hi> wherein none of these
particulars is mentioned, but other false aspersions are cast upon his fame, as hath
been the custom of handling those, that oppose the corruption of the <hi>Romane Church.
Bonifacius</hi> alwayes going on in his course, and seeking to make the like reformation
amongst the <hi>Frizons,</hi> was with 54. of his followers killed in the 64. year of his age,
and hath therefore a chief place in the <hi>Romane Martyrologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this did so little terrifie others, as about the same time certain <hi>Scottish</hi> Monks,
did adventure upon the <hi>Saxons,</hi> to bring them under the Popes obedience; <hi>Palto,
Tanco, Korvila,</hi> and <hi>Haruchus,</hi> (so they name them) being consecrated Bishops of
<hi>Verden</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> one after another, did all of them lay down their lives in that

Martyrdom, and counting it their glory to suffer in the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> his cause.
Nor were they Monks onely that were so given, but even of the Bishops, <hi>Sedulus</hi>
and <hi>Pergustus</hi> were vehemently set that way, and having assisted in a Synod called
at <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Gregory</hi> the second, in the year 721. (as their subscriptions extant in the
books of Councels do testify) after their return, made great disturbance in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50008:23"/>
Church for the erecting of Images, and put divers preachers from their livings
for resisting that course.</p>
               <p>In all this time, which is not a little to be admired, the <hi>Eremitical life</hi> was in such
esteem, not with <hi>Clergy-men</hi> alone, but with the greatest <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> that
they forsaking their honours and dignities, betook themselves thereto, as the most
contented and desirarable sort of life. Of these last our stories do name <hi>Drostanus,</hi>
the Uncle, or as others say, the Nephew of King <hi>Aidanus;</hi> Prince <hi>Fiacre,</hi> the second
son of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Florentius</hi> a Gentleman of honourable birth and
estate, who did all, nigh at one time, sequester themselves from the world, not out
of any grief or discontent, whereof they had no cause, but upon a meer apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the vanity of worldly greatnesse.<note place="margin">The story of Fiacre.</note> The story of <hi>Fiacre,</hi> as <hi>Boeth</hi> rehearseth
it, is especially memorable. This Prince being committed to the education of <hi>Cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Man,</hi> after he came to some years, did steal away privately to <hi>France,</hi>
and his intention being discovered to <hi>Pharo,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> he had by his gift a
little Cell in a solitary place appointed for him. There separating himself from all
company he spent his time wholly in prayer and divine contemplation. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
after a litle time, his elder brother King <hi>Ferquhard</hi> to be deposed for his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
government; whereupon Commissioners were sent to recall him as being
the next heir of the Kingdom. He getting intelligence of their coming, did betake
him to his prayers, and with many teares besought God to confirm his mind in the
resolution he had taken, and divert them by some means from disturbing his rest:
So as when they came unto him, he appeared unto them leprous; looked so defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as they were amazed to behold him; but they (notwithstanding this, did not
judge him unfit for government) resolved to deliver their Commission, intreating
him to return to his countrey, where he would finde the aire more healthfull, and
in a short time by the help of Physicians recover his health. <hi>Fiacre</hi> at first excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himself by his infirmity, when he perceived them insist for his return, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishing
that sort of life; did cut them off with this answer: <hi>I have,</hi> said he, <hi>made
choice of this condition of life, which you see, and am contented with this litle Cell for my
dwelling, these garments</hi> (pointing to his apparel) <hi>serve me for clothing, and my food is a
simple pottage of herbs, which I dresse to my selfe; more I desire not, nor would I change
this state of life with the most fortunate King in the world. I seem to you deformed, yet
is my body sound, and my blood uncorrupted, but it is the will of God I should look so, that I
may be kept humble, and learn to amend my life. Go you therefore home and shew my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Noblemen that sent you hither, that I live content in this private manner, and
will not change it with any state whatsoever; and from me, desire them to serve God
purely, to live justly, and entertain peace among themselves: which if they do, they shall
be alwayes victorious over their enemies.</hi> This said, he withdrew himself into his Cell,
and they finding that there was no means to prevail with him, departed.</p>
               <p>The Commissioners at their return making report of that they had seen, and his
resolution; his only sister <hi>Syra</hi> was so much moved with it, as taking with her
some Virgins in company, she went to visit him, and after some conference render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
self and those that came with her religious in the city of <hi>Meaux.</hi> This <hi>Fiacre</hi>
is the same, to whose memory divers Churches in <hi>France</hi> are dedicated, and is said
to have died in the year 665.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florentius</hi> (whom I named) taking the like resolution went into <hi>Germany,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bal. cent. 14.</note> and in
the countrey of <hi>Alsatia</hi> upon the River <hi>Hasel,</hi> built a little Chappel for his private
use, where he lived, retired from all company, and purchased to himself great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
It happened <hi>Rathildis</hi> the daughter of <hi>Dagobert</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> to fall
sick in the time, of a disease that deprived her both of sight and speech, and being
recommended to <hi>Florentius</hi> prayers, she within a little while recovered. Whereupon
King <hi>Dagobert</hi> did build a magnifick Abbey, called yet <hi>The Abbey of Haselah,</hi> and
committed the Government thereof to <hi>Florentius.</hi> There was difficulty enough to
winne him from his solitary life, yet so earnest were the solicitations used unto
him, that in end he yielded, and was after that made Bishop of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> upon the
death of <hi>Rotharius.</hi> Twelve years he governed that See most wisely, giving proof
of his vertue, and worth, as well in the <hi>active,</hi> as <hi>contemplative</hi> life. Before his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50008:24"/>
death he founded a Monastery for <hi>Scottish men</hi> at the river <hi>Bruschius</hi> in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and
placed therein <hi>Argobastus, Theodotus,</hi> and <hi>Hidolphus,</hi> who had accompanied him
from <hi>Scotland,</hi> his body according as he directed, was there interred after his death.</p>
               <p>Never did this countrey abound more in learned men, then at this time; our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

name likewise <hi>Divinicus, Conganus, Dunstanus, Medanus,</hi> and <hi>Modanus,</hi> as famous
men all for their piety and learning. But they that King <hi>Achaius</hi> sent to <hi>Charles the

Clemens, Rabanus Maurus,</hi> and <hi>Flaccus Albinus,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Alcuinus;</hi> these four
he sent with Prince <hi>Gulielme</hi> his brother into <hi>France,</hi> at the time of the league made
with that people, which to this day remaineth inviolate: and by them it was, that
the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <hi>Scotus</hi> after he had stayed some years at

and lived in special credit with him. The book that came forth under <hi>Charles</hi>
his name against Images, was thought to be penned by him; for he was a man of
great learning, as the many books left by him to posterity do shew. <hi>Ubique pius,

the catalogue of his works, will wonder how any one man should in his life have
penned so much, and upon so divers subjects; for besides that he did illustrate the
whole Books of Scripture with his Expositions, he left a number of profitable
tractates in every Science to posterity. After <hi>Clemens</hi> was gone from <hi>Paris,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the University some years; and being made Abbot of <hi>Fulden,</hi> upon a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure

               <p>And now to the occasion of these troubles I mentioned;<note place="margin">Hungus King of Picts supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Achaius King of Scots.</note> There reigned in the
time of King <hi>Achaius</hi> amongst the <hi>Picts, Hungus</hi> a Prince well inclined, and a great
lover of Religion and Justice. <hi>Athelstane</hi> King of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> having usurped
upon divers of his neighbours, and inlarged his Kingdome by subduing the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumbers,</hi>
did likewise invade the <hi>Picts,</hi> intending the conquest of that part of their
Kingdom, which lay next unto his. <hi>Hungus</hi> hereupon did move King <hi>Achaius,</hi> who
had married <hi>Fergusiana</hi> his sister, for some supply; and he no lesse offended with
<hi>Athelstans</hi> oppressions, then was <hi>Hungus</hi> himself, sent to his aid ten thousaud men,
under the leading of of Prince <hi>Alpin</hi> his son. <hi>Hungus</hi> supplied with this power;
entered into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and having made great depredations, returned home
with a rich booty; <hi>Athelstan</hi> following upon his heels, overtook him at a little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
not farre from <hi>Hadington;</hi> which put <hi>Hungus</hi> in a sore fright, for a great part
of his Army was dismissed and gone home; yet not seeing a way to eschew the
fight, he gave order for the battel against the next day, and in the mean time betook
himself to prayer, spending most part of the night in that exercise. A litle before day
falling into a slumber, it seemed to him that the Apostle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrew</hi> stood by him,
and assured him of the victory; which vision being related to the Army, did much
encourage them. The History addeth, that in the joyning of the battel there
appeared in the aire a <hi>Crosse,</hi> in form of the letter X; which so terrified the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as presently they gave back: King <hi>Athelstane</hi> was himself there killed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Village took the name, which at this day it enjoyeth of <hi>Athelstan</hi> Foord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hungus</hi> to expresse his thankfulnesse for the victory gave to the Church of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hungus his thankfulnesse for his victory.</note> now called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrews</hi> divers rich gifts, as Chalices, Basons, the Image of
Christ in gold, and of his twelve Apostles in silver. He gave likewise a case of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
gold for preserving the Reliques of S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and restored to the Spirituality
the tithes of all cornes, cattel, and herbage within the Realm; exempting them
from answering before any temporal Judge. Further, he did appoint the <hi>Crosse</hi>
of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrew,</hi> to be the badge and cognisance of the <hi>Picts,</hi> both in their warres and
otherwise; which as long as that Kingdom stood, was observed, as is by the <hi>Scots</hi> as
yet retained. But all this was spoiled, as we said, by <hi>Feredeth</hi> the third in successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from <hi>Hungus,</hi> after which time nothing prospered either with him, or with
that people.</p>
               <p>For the line masculine of their Kings failing, <hi>Alpin</hi> the son of <hi>Achaius</hi> did claim

the Crown as next in blood by vertue of an old Covenant betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and

<hi>Dundy,</hi> took King <hi>Alpin</hi> and many of his Nobles prisoners: which victory he used
most foully, putting all the Nobles to death, killing the King, and causing his head
to be set upon a pole in <hi>Abernethy,</hi> or as others write, in the city of <hi>Camelon.</hi>
               </p>

stories,<note place="margin">The succession of Bishops in this Church after the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Picts.</note> and warranted in any sort, for the first six hundred
years of our Church, and being now come to the time
wherein this Church by enlarging of the Kingdom received
a further extention in bounds, and therewith an addition of
more wealth, and state; I will, as beginning with a new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
follow the story therof by the succession of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
especially in the See of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> upon
which the rest did depend.</p>
               <p>The first Bishop who fate in this See,<note place="margin">Adrian the first in this accompt killed by the Danes.</note> was <hi>Adrian,</hi> killed by the <hi>Danes</hi> in the Isle
of <hi>May,</hi> in the year 872.<note place="margin">An. 872.</note> with <hi>Stolbrandus</hi> a Bishop, <hi>Monanus</hi> an Archdeacon,
<hi>Glodianus</hi> a Presbyter, and a number of other Churchmen, who fled thither for
their safety. Whilest this Bishop lived, <hi>Constantine</hi> the second the son of <hi>Kenneth</hi>
did keep a convention in <hi>Scone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A convention at Scone for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the State.</note> for reforming the disorders which the loose and
dissolute government of his predecessour <hi>Donald</hi> the first had caused. In that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
beginning was made at the Clergy, and concerning them it was ordained,
<q>That they should reside upon their charges,<note place="margin">An. 860.</note> and have no medling with secular
businesse. That they should instruct the people diligently, and be good ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in their conversation. That they should not keep Hawks, Hounds, or Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for pleasure. That they should carry no weapons, nor be pleaders of civil
causes, but live contented with their own provisions. And if they were tried to
transgresse in any of these points that for the first fault they should be fined in a
pecuniary mulct,</q> and for the second deprived from their office, and living.
Thus was it not held in that time a diminution of Ecclesiastical authority, for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to give Lawes to the Clergy, and to punish them, if they were found guilty of
any offence or crime.</p>
               <p>Divers other statutes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
abuses crept into the Realme,<note place="margin">Statutes for redressing abuses.</note> were then also
concluded: as, <q>That drunkennesse should be punished with death, that none
should eat above one meal a day, nor accustome themselves to lye softly, or use
any recreations,</q> but such as might inure them to sufferance and labour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that good King did banish all riot and luxury, and in a short time brought the
Kingdom again to a flourishing estate. But the <hi>Danes</hi> (as we said) invaded the
countrey, and practising many cruelties whilest he did pursue them, who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched

in a convention held at <hi>Forfare,</hi> by an unanime consent of his Estates, he ordained,
<q>That all Priests should from thenceforth be exempted from paying tribute,<note place="margin">Boeth l. 10.</note> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
watch, and going in warfare. That they should not be drawne before tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Judges for any civil cause, but that all matters concerning them should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
by their Bishops; the judgement of Matrimonial causes, right of Tithes,
Testaments, Legislatory actions, and all things depending upon simple faith, and
promise, should be committed to the Bishops, with power to them to make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
and constitutions Ecclesiastical, to try hereticks, blasphemers, perjured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and Magicians, and censure such as they did finde delinquent in that kind;
And that all Kings succeeding should at the time of their coronation, take oath
for maintaining the Church in their liberties.</q> These favours had the Clergy in the
following ages used with that moderation and equity which they ought, we should
not have seen nor felt the interruptions that have been made upon Church liberties,
with the incroachments which in our time have been justly complained of.</p>
               <p>In this time lived that famous Scholar <hi>Ioannes Scotus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Io. Scotus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Aerigena.</note> called <hi>Aerigena,</hi> from the
place of his birth, which was the town of <hi>Aire</hi> in the West parts of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This
man being very young, went to <hi>Athens,</hi> and followed his studies there some years,
attained to great perfection in the <hi>Greek,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Boeth l. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> languages. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
afterward to <hi>France,</hi> at the request of <hi>Carolus Calvus,</hi> he translated in
<hi>Laetine</hi> the work of <hi>Dionysius de coelesti Hierarchia;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lesl l. 5.</note> at which Pope <hi>Nicolaus</hi> took
exception, and wrote to King <hi>Charles</hi> on this manner. <hi>Relatum est Apostolatui nostro,
quòd opus Dionysii Arepagitae, quod de divinis nominibus, vel coelestibus ordinibus, Graeco
descripit eloquio, quidam vir,</hi> Joannes <hi>genere</hi> Scotus, <hi>in Latinum transtulit: quod jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
morem nobis mitti, &amp; nostro debuit judicio approbari; praesertim cùm idem</hi> Joannes,
<hi>licèt multae scientiae esse praedicetur, olim non sanus in quibusdam frequenti rumore dicatur.</hi>
We have been informed that one called <hi>Iohn</hi> of the <hi>Scottish</hi> nation hath translated
the work which <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi> did write of the names of God, or of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Orders, into the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue: which book ought according to the custome,
have been sent to us, and approved by our judgement; especially since the said
<hi>Iohn,</hi> albeit he be esteemed of good learning, hath been of long time held to be
unsound in certain points of doctrine. Now the point which the Pope did chiefly
quarrel, was his opinion of the Sacrament; for he had published a Treatise, <hi>De cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore
&amp; sanguine Domini,</hi> wherein he maintained <hi>Bertram</hi> his doctrine of that point.
<hi>Scotus</hi> having knowledge of this, and thinking he could not be safe in those parts
because of the Popes dislike, came into <hi>Britain,</hi> and was welcomed by King <hi>Alfred</hi>
a great favourer of learned men, by whom he was employed to teach the languages
at <hi>Malmsbury</hi> Abbey, and by some Scholars who could not indure the severity of
discipline, was stabbed to death in the year 884. and buried in the same Abbey.</p>
               <p>4. Bishop <hi>Malisius</hi> dying, <hi>Kellach</hi> the second, the son of one <hi>Ferlegus</hi> succeeded
in his place: he was the first Bishop of this Kingdom that went to <hi>Rome</hi> to seek con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,<note place="margin">King Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine the third forsaketh the publick life.</note>
and lived to a great age, for he sate Bishop 35. years. In his time <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the third King of that name, wearied with the troubles of a publick life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
his temporal dignity, and betook himself to solitude among the <hi>Culdees</hi>
in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrews;</hi> with whom he spent his last five years, and there died.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Killach</hi> these successively were Bishops.<note place="margin">Paslet. l. 6. c. 27.</note>

               <p>8. <hi>Maldwin</hi> the son of <hi>Gillander,</hi> and</p>
               <p>9. Tuthaldus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50008:26"/>In this time the coelibate of the Clergy was violently urged,<note place="margin">An. 977.</note> and married Priests
thrust from their livings; which raised great stirres in the Church, but the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are not recorded,<note place="margin">Camd, ant.</note> nor the broyles which thereupon insued. I read in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of the <hi>Britannick</hi> Church, that in the year 977. a Councel was gathered at
<hi>Calne</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire</hi> for that businesse, to which <hi>Beornellus</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Scotland</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by <hi>Alfrithe</hi> the widow of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> who favoured the cause of married Priests.
This Bishop, a man of great learning and eloquence, is said to have defended the
conjugal life of Priests by solid reasons taken out of Scripture, and to have put all
the opposites to silence. But <hi>Dunstane</hi> the Archbishop, who presided in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
when he saw that reason could not bear out the earand, fell a threatning, and
said that notwithstanding all their arguments they should not carry away the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;
which he had no sooner spoken, then the beames of the house wherein they
sate at Councel, bursting asunder all were overturned, and fell headlong to the
ground; many were bruised, and some killed with the fall; <hi>Dunstan</hi> himself
only escaped without harm, the beam whereon he stood remaining whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
Such as favoured the cause of Monks, did interpret this accident to be a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
given by God on their side; others said that <hi>Dunstan</hi> had wrought this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
by sorcery, (for many supposed him to be a Magician.) However it was, the
married Priests (though repining) were forced indeed to yield and submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
What became of <hi>Beornellus,</hi> I read not, nor whether he returned to his
countrey.</p>
               <p>The names of some other Bishops we have, who were in good accompt at that
time, such as <hi>Blaanus, Englatius, Colmocus,</hi> and <hi>Moveanus</hi> Confessor to King <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi>
the third, a wise and valiant King, and one who might have been reckoned
amongst the best Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if about his latter end he had not stained his fame with
the murther of <hi>Malcolm</hi> his Nephew, whom he made away by poyson; but the
ambitious desire he had to settle the succession in his own posterity, let him to work
this villany: which he carried in so covert a manner, as no man did once suspect him
thereof (the opinion of his integrity being universally great:) but as wicked facts
can never be assured, though possible they may be concealed; his mind was never
after that time quiet, the conscience of the crime vexing him day and night with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
fears. In end (whether it was so in effect, or if his perplexed minde did form
the self such an imagination) whilest he lay asleep, he heard a voyce speaking to
him in this sort: <q>Doest thou think, that the death of <hi>Malcolm</hi> that innocent
Prince treacherously murthered by thee, is hidden from me, or that thou shalt
passe any longer unpunished? No, there is a plot laid for thy life which thou shalt
not escape: and whereas thou didst think to transmit the Crown firm and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to thy posterity,<note place="margin">Boeth l. 11.</note> thou shalt leave the Kingdom broken, distracted and full
of trouble.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The King awaked with the voyce was stricken with great terrour; in the morning
early calling <hi>Moveanus,</hi> he laid open to him the grief and vexation of his minde:
who giving the King his best counsel for the pacifying of his conscience,<note place="margin">Buchan. l. 6.</note> did advise
him to bestow almes upon the poor, visit the graves of holy men, have the Clergy
in greater regard then he was accustomed, and perform such other external satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as were used in those times. The King following his directions did carry
himself most piously, not thinking by these outward deeds of penance to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
for his sin; for they were not become as yet so grossely ignorant, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that by such external works the justice of God is satisfied; albeit some idle
toyes, such as the visiting the graves of the Saints, kissing of Reliques, hearing of
Masses, and others of that kinde, which Avarice and Superstition had invented,
were then crept into the Church; yet people were still taught, that <hi>Christ</hi> is the
only propitiation for sin, and that by his blood the guilt thereof is only washed
away.<note place="margin">King Kenneth murthered in the Castle of Fettercarne.</note> This being still the doctrine of the Church, to think that <hi>Kenneth</hi> was any
other, is scarce charitable. Alwayes as he was visiting the grave of <hi>Palladius,</hi> being
invited to lodge in the Castle of <hi>Fettercarne,</hi> he was there treacherously murthered.

<hi>Gregorius</hi> divers Canons for their better government. At the same time in a
convention kept at <hi>Scone,</hi> to reward those that had done well in the late warres,
he gave away all the Crown lands, reserving little or nothing to himself. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
to requite his liberality, did grant to him and his successours Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
the Ward of all their lands, with the benefit that might accrew by the marriage
of the heir. But this being casual and uncertain, proved unsufficient for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Royal estate, so that necessity (the sure companion of immoderate largition)
did force him to make unlawful shifts:<note place="margin">Boeth l. 11.</note> whereby he came to be as much hated in
end,<note place="margin">Past. l. 4. c. 44.</note> as he was loved at first; and by some villains that thought themselves wronged
by him, was murthered in the Castle of <hi>Glammes</hi> after he had reigned 30. years.
Before his time the titles of <hi>Thane</hi> and <hi>Abthane,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Buchan. l. 6.</note> were the only titles of honour and

                  <hi>Duncan</hi> the first his Nephew by <hi>Beatrix</hi> his daughter succeeded to the Crown,<note place="margin">An. 1034.</note>
whose weaknesse and simplicity made way to <hi>Mackbeth</hi> his Cousin-germans usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation;<note place="margin">Buchan. l. 7.</note> for he conspiring with <hi>Bancho</hi> a man of great place, deprived the King
both of his Crown and life, in the seventh year of his reign. The Kings two sons,

                  <note place="margin">Boeth l. 12.</note> surnamed <hi>Canmore,</hi> and <hi>Donald Bane,</hi> fearing the cruelty of the Tyrant,
withdrew themselves and fled; <hi>Malcolme</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Donald</hi> into the <hi>West Isles.</hi>
Thus none being to oppose, <hi>Mackbeth</hi> did assume to himself the Crown, and for the
first ten years governed the Kingdom better with justice then he got it. Afterward
growing suspicious, and seeking to rid himself of those that might prove his enemies,
he began his cruelty at <hi>Bancho,</hi> who had an hand with him in the Kings murther: and
inviting him on a night to supper with his son <hi>Fleanche,</hi> as they were returning to
their lodgings, made some lie in the way to murther them. <hi>Bancho</hi> doubting no
harm was killed, but his son <hi>Fleanche</hi> through the darknesse of the night escaped.
The Nobles detesting this treachery, and fearing it might turn to be their own
case, retired home to their dwellings. <hi>Mackbeth</hi> finding himself to be forsaken of
his Nobles, and knowing that he was hated by the people, fell then to practise open
Tyranny, and forging quarrels against the better sort, did upon light causes put
divers to death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thane of Fife,</hi> called <hi>Mackduffe,</hi> a man of great power, out of a suspicion he
conceived fled into <hi>England;</hi> where meeting with <hi>Malcolme</hi> the lawful heir of the
Crown, after he had exponed the misery whereunto the countrey was brought by

with you; for as to these vices we have been talking of, I thank God none of them do
reign in me, onely I speak this to discover your minde and disposition.</hi> Thus both agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the enterprise, they gave private notice to their friends of their coming;
and obtaining a supply of ten thousand men, from King <hi>Edward</hi> under the leading
of <hi>Sibard</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland, Malcolmes</hi> Grand-father by the Mother, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into <hi>Scotland.</hi> The rumour of this Army did cast <hi>Mackbeth</hi> into a great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and not knowing what to do, (for he was deserted of all) he shut up himself
at first in the Castle of <hi>Dunsinnan,</hi> a Fort that he had lately built. The Army
marching thither, how soon they came in sight, <hi>Mackbeth</hi> out of a new fear forsook
the Fort, and made to flye by horse; but being pursued by some of <hi>Malcolme</hi> his
friends, he was overtaken and killed.</p>
               <p>Upon this victory <hi>Malcolme</hi> was declared King, and crowned in <hi>Scone</hi> the 25. of
<hi>April,</hi> 1057.<note place="margin">Buchan. l. 7.</note> Soon after his Coronation, calling the Estates together at <hi>Forfar</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
the children of those that <hi>Mackbeth</hi> had forfeited: and to correct the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perances
of the people, and to recall them to the ancient frugality, made divers
good statutes, repealing that beastly Act of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the third, which appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the first night of the new married woman to appertain to the Lord of the

               <p>In this Convention likewise the Bishops,<note place="margin">Dioces appointed by the Bishops.</note> who, as we shewed before, did indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently

<hi>Malcolme</hi> I must relate a few things belonging to that purpose. <hi>Edmond</hi> King of
<hi>England</hi> surnamed <hi>Ironside,</hi> being treacherously killed at <hi>Oxford, Canutus</hi> a <hi>Dane,</hi>
who reigned in a part of that kingdome, attained the absolute dominion of the
whole. This <hi>Edmond</hi> left two sons, <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> whom <hi>Canutus</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
entertained very kindly, but afterwards seeking to establish the Crown in
his own posterity, he sent them to <hi>Volgarus</hi> the Governour of <hi>Swain</hi> to be murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Governour pitying the estate of these innocent youths, conveyed them
secretly unto <hi>Solomon</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> giving out to <hi>Canutus</hi> that they were made
away; <hi>Edward</hi> (surviving <hi>Edwin</hi> his brother) married <hi>Agatha</hi> sister to the <hi>Queen</hi> of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> and daughter to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the second, by whom he had a son
called <hi>Edgar,</hi> and two daughters, <hi>Margaret</hi> and <hi>Christian.</hi> After <hi>Canutus</hi> his death
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50008:28"/>
succeeded <hi>Harold</hi> his eldest son, whose reign was cruel and short, and four years
only. And after him <hi>Hardicanutus,</hi> who died suddenly in the second year of his
reign, and was the last of the <hi>Danes</hi> that ruled in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon his death <hi>Edward</hi> brother to <hi>Edmondlronside</hi> living then in <hi>Nomandy,</hi> was
recalled and Crowned King of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Winchester,</hi> in the year 1042. This is he
that is called <hi>Edward the Confessor,</hi> a most pious King, who having no issue, sent to
<hi>Hungary</hi> for his Cousin <hi>Edward,</hi> and for his children. <hi>Edward</hi> soon after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
died, so <hi>Edgar</hi> surnamed <hi>Atheling</hi> remained, to whom King <hi>Edward</hi> would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have resigned the Crown; but such was the modesty of that young Prince,
as he did absolutely refuse to reign during the King his life: That lost him the
Crown, for upon the death of the King, <hi>Harold</hi> son to Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> was preferred,
Prince <hi>Edgar</hi> his right utterly misknown. But <hi>Harold</hi> his reign continued not long.
<hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> commonly called <hi>the Conqueror,</hi> having killed him in a
battel fought in <hi>Sussex</hi> the next year, usurped the kingdom to himself. <hi>Edgar</hi>
fearing the Conquerors cruelty, took sea with his mother <hi>Agatha,</hi> and his two sisters,
<hi>Margaret</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> intending to return into <hi>Hungargy,</hi> but were by Tempest
driven upon the coast of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where King <hi>Malcolme</hi> that had learned by his
own sufferances to compassionate the distresses of others, did most courteously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, and shortly after their coming took <hi>Margaret</hi> the eldest sister of <hi>Edgar</hi>
to wife, a Lady of rare vertue; who though she brought him little or no portion,
made both him and his kingdom happy.</p>
               <p>How soon the <hi>Norman</hi> had setled his dominion in <hi>England,</hi> he sent to King <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colme</hi>
to require <hi>Edgar</hi> his competitor and fugitive (as he termed him) to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.
<hi>Malcolme</hi> refused, holding it an unseemly deed in a King, to deliver any
person that took their refuge to him,<note place="margin">King Malcolm and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour at Warre.</note> much more to betray a Prince allyed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
unto his mortal enemy. Hereupon Warre was proclaimed, and one <hi>Roger</hi> a
Nobleman of <hi>Normandy</hi> sent to invade <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which was then in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the <hi>Scots. Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloucester</hi> did second him with a great power,
but both these were put to the worse. <hi>Odon</hi> the <hi>Normans</hi> brother, who of a Bishop of
<hi>Bayeux</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> as likewise his own son <hi>Robert,</hi> whom he employed with
several Armies, did prosper no better; so as wearied of the warres, he began to
think of peace:<note place="margin">Peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongst them.</note> neither was <hi>Malcolme</hi> unwilling unto it; and after some treaty, it
was accorded, That King <hi>Malcolme</hi> should retain <hi>Cumberland</hi> with the same right
that his predecessours did enjoy it: and that the subjects of each kingdom might
know their limits, and how farre they were to passe; a stone-crosse was erected in
<hi>Stammore,</hi> which was called the <hi>Ree Crosse,</hi> that is, the Crosse of Kings; for on the
North side thereof, the Armes of the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> were graven, and upon the
South, the Armes of the King of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This peace held firm all the Conquerours time,<note place="margin">The contrary disposition of King Malcolm, and William Rufus.</note> but <hi>William</hi> called <hi>Rufus</hi> his son
succeeding, it quickly dissolved; neither could it be otherwise, considering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
disposition of the two Kings; for as <hi>Malcolme</hi> was religiously given, and a
great Benefactor to the Church, so <hi>Rufus</hi> in all his carriage, manifested no affection
that way: For to inlarge his Forest at <hi>Winchester,</hi> he demolished thirty Churches,
and forced <hi>Anselme</hi> that good Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to quit the kingdom, for the
liberty he used in his reprehensions. It was also thought that the interview of the
two Kings at <hi>Gloucester</hi> did further their dislike (as hath been often observed to fall
out in the meetings of Princes.) For <hi>Malcolme</hi> departed from him in displeasure,
<hi>Rufus</hi> by some secret practice got the Castle of <hi>Anwick,</hi> whereupon arose the warre;
in which King <hi>Malcolme</hi> and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his son did both perish.</p>
               <p>A little before the beginning of this warre,<note place="margin">Bishop Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius dieth.</note> Bishop <hi>Gregorius</hi> died, and in his

taking him aside from the rest of the company unto a secret place, he did challenge
him as a Traytor, willing him, if he had any valour, to shew the same, and rather
take his life in an honest manner, then treacherously. The man confounded with
the boldnesse of the King, fell upon his knees and intreated pardon; which the King
granted, retaining him still in his service as before. The magnificence of his Court
whilest he lived was great; and in the State to distinguish the degrees of Honour, he
introduced the titles of <hi>Earl, Baron,</hi> and <hi>Knight,</hi> in the place of <hi>Thane,</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thane,</hi>
which were the titles before in use.</p>
               <p>His Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> was in her place no lesse famous in all the vertues that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

in the advancing of publick works. The Church of <hi>Carlile</hi> she built upon her own

bestowed that way. By her the King had a fair issue, six sons, and two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;<note place="margin">Her issue by King Malcolm.</note> the first called <hi>Edward,</hi> died with his father at <hi>Anwick;</hi> the second called <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>

any other indirect meanes moved the businesse, and so taking it to come of God;
howsoever it grieved him, that the Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> should lack the benefit of
his service; gave his consent, and having obtained King <hi>Henry</hi> his licence (without
whose knowledge he would not have him go into a strange countrey) sent him to
<hi>Alexander</hi> with an ample recommendation,<note place="margin">Archbishop of Canterbury his letter to king Alexander.</note> in substance this: <q>We give unto
God (said he) everlasting thanks, for that it hath pleased him to open the eyes of
your mind, and make you know and seek that which you should; and to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
self we esteem our selves greatly bound, because of your friendly and familiar
usage: for albeit your desires tend to our hurt, and are not lesse grievous to us, then
if you should pull out our eyes, or cut off our right hand, we cannot but commend
your desire, and so far as we may in God, obey the same. Therefore unwilling,
and yet willing, we yield unto your will; willing in so farre as we perceive it
is Gods will which we dare not withstand, nor will we in any thing willingly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please;
yet unwilling, for that we are left alone, and deprived of his fellowship,
who as a Father ministred unto us consolation in time of grief, giving us sound
advice in many perplexed cases, and was to us a most helpful Brother in this our
infirm and old age. If any other should have required him of us, we would no
more have parted with him, then with our own heart; but there is nothing, which
in God we can deny you. Thus we send unto you the person that you desired,
and so free, as you may lay on him what charge you will, so as it be to the honour
of God, and to the credit of the Mother Church of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Do therefore
what you purpose wisely, and remit him unto us with diligence to be consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
because delay in that errand may breed impediments, that we desire to
eschew, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eadmerus</hi> bringing with him this Commendatory letter,<note place="margin">Eadmerus hist. l. 5. &amp; 6.</note> was the third day
after his coming elected Bishop by the Kings licence, and with consent both of the
Clergy and Laity; but the next morning whilest the King conferred with him apart
touching his consecration, he began to magnifie the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and
the authority it had over all the Churches of <hi>Britain;</hi> declaring that by his
leave, he would seek the Episcopal benediction from the Bishop, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it at the hands of any other:<note place="margin">King Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der offended that Eadmerus would not be consecrated in Scotland.</note> which offended the King greatly; for by
no meanes could he endure to hear of this Churches subjection to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
Thereupon the Monks who had been trusted in the yeares preceding
with the intromission of the rents, were charged to uplift the same, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede
the elect his possession. Yet within a few dayes the King going in an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
against some rebels in the countrey of <hi>Ross,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is invested in the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of the Noblemen.</note> by the intercession of Noblemen
it was agreed that <hi>Eadmerus</hi> should receive the Ring out of the Kings hand, and
the Crosier being laid upon the Altar, he should take up the same, and that way
be invested into the Bishoprick. In this sort was he entered to his charge, the
Clergy and people accepting him for their Bishop.</p>
               <p>Mean while,<note place="margin">Thurstan the Archbishop of York opposes the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus.</note> 
                  <hi>Thurstan</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> who was then beyond sea, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to solicit King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> by his letters to impede the consecration;
for which effect, three several messages were sent to King <hi>Alexander. Eadmerus</hi> upon
the distast the King had taken of him, was not much respected: which he perceiving,
and withall considering that the King being his unfriend, his service could not be
very profitable to the Church and Kingdome, resolved to go unto <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and
seek the advice of his brethren and friends in those parts. This signified to the King,
he said that the Bishop had nothing to do with <hi>Canterbury,</hi> nor so long as he lived
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50008:30"/>
should any Bishop of <hi>Scotland</hi> professe subjection to that See.<note place="margin">An. 1124.</note> Which being report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Bishop, he replied in passion, <hi>That not for the Bishoprick, nay not for all</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>would he deny himself to be a Monk of</hi> Canterbury.</p>
               <p>Falling thus more and more in the dislike of the King,<note place="margin">Eadmerus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth into England upon the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</note> and jarres daily encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
he employed the Bishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> to try the king his minde towards him:
who told him that he found the King greatly displeased with his courses, and if he
continued in the same minde, he was not to expect his favour. Hereupon <hi>Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus</hi> resolving to depart, delivered back the Ring which he had received from the
King, and laid down his Crosier upon the Altar, with a protestation that he was
forced thereunto, and so went away. The King did by his Letter purge himself
to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> declaring that it was not his fault, but wilfulness
on <hi>Eadmerus</hi> his part, which made him relinquish his charge. But the Archbishop
a man of courteous nature not willing further to enquire of the reasons of <hi>Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus</hi> his departure, passed over the businesse with a gentle answer to the
King for that time. I finde upon better advice, that <hi>Eadmerus</hi> made offer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and give the King satisfaction in all he required; but herein he was preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a new election, which the King had caused to be made.</p>
               <p>15. For how soon it was advertised that <hi>Eadmerus</hi> had a purpose to return,<note place="margin">He purgeth himself to the Archbishop.</note> the
King for his own peace did think it most sure to have one of his Subjects preferred
to the place; and so recommending to the Chapter <hi>Robert</hi> Prior of <hi>Scone,</hi> he with
an uniform consent was chosen Bishop, and stood elect two years (for before King
<hi>Alexander</hi> his death,<note place="margin">Robert Prior of Scone elected Bishop of Saint Andrews, and consecrated at York.</note> which happened in the year of our Lord 1114. he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated;) then he received the benediction at the hands of <hi>Thurstan</hi> Bishop of
<hi>York,</hi> with reservation of the priviledges of both Churches which if the King had
lived, would not have been permitted; for he was a Prince that stood much upon
his royalty,<note place="margin">The Abbey of Scone and Saint Columbe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> and would not endure at any hand the least encroachment either upon
his Kingdome, or upon the Church. The Abbeys of <hi>Scone</hi> and S. <hi>Columbe</hi> were
founded by this King. To the See of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> he was a great Benefactor, and
gave the lands called <hi>Cursus apri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cursus Apri given to Saint Andrews.</note> the Boars chace, and was resolved to do more in
that kinde, if he had not been taken away by death.</p>
               <p>But what may be thought lacking in him was abundantly supplied by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and successor King <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">King David succeeded to Alexander, and his beneficence to the Church.</note> whose beneficence that way exceeded all others;
for besides the repairing of these Monasteries which was either by age become ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous,
or were defaced by injuries of warre, he erected the Bishopricks of <hi>Rosse,
Brichen, Dunkeld</hi> and <hi>Dumblane,</hi> with the Abbeys of <hi>Iedburgh, Kelsoe, Melrose, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle,
Halirudhouse, Kinlosse, Combuskenneth, Dundrennan</hi> and <hi>Holmecultram</hi> in <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland;</hi>
he founded likewise two religious Houses at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> one for the <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctins,</hi>
another for the <hi>white Monks;</hi> and for professed Virgins, two Monasteries, one
at <hi>Berwick,</hi> and another at <hi>Carlile:</hi> all which he provided with competent Revenues.</p>
               <p>Some of our Writers have taxed this most worthy King for his immoderate
profusion,<note place="margin">King David taxed of profu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion.</note> as they call it, on these Monasteries; and <hi>Holinshed</hi> saith that his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable
liberality towards the Church, made his Successors oppresse their
Nobles at home, lay impositions upon the people, and doe many other things
prejudiciall to the Commonwealth, that they might have wherewith to maintain
their royall estates. But herein he erreth greatly, for let an examination be taken
of the behaviour of our Kings in the ages succeeding, it will appear that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
either with their own Subjects at home, or with their Enemies abroad
have been more justifiable then the doings of any of their Neighbours: neither can
it be shewed, that any one of them did ever take those indirect courses which he
mentioneth, for penury or want. But it is easie to speak ill, and deprave the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the best Princes.</p>
               <p>It is true, that profusenesse in any person, especially in a King, is not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,<note place="margin">His magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence vindicate from these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>spersions.</note>
for that it bringeth a great mischief both to the King and Subjects; but
the bestowing of sixscore thousand Franks (that is the highest estimate they make
of his donations) cannot be called an immoderate profusion. He was certainly a
most wise King, and knew well his own work, and could proportion his Gifts to
his Revenues. Neither was his liberality an hindrance to his Successors in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50008:30"/>
of the like pious works;<note place="margin">An. 1159.</note> for <hi>Malcolm</hi> who succeeded did erect the Abbey of
<hi>Couper</hi> in <hi>Angus, Santray</hi> in <hi>Lothian,</hi> and a religious house at <hi>Manwell</hi> for profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Virgins. King <hi>William</hi> erected the Abbey of <hi>Aberbrothock,</hi> and his Queen <hi>Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garda</hi>
the Abbey of <hi>Balmerinoch.</hi> The like did the following Kings in their own
times, which shewed that he did not leave his Successors destitute of means to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their royall estate. This further will I boldly affirm, that if there be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
excusable in Princes, it is this: for besides that these foundations are the most
lasting monuments to glorifie their memories, they are the readiest helps which
they shall finde to supply their necessities at all occasions.</p>
               <p>Now whereas some have disapproved these donations because of the fruits that
ensued,<note place="margin">Buch. l. 7.</note> meaning the abuses that crept in by the corruption of the persons, who
did afterwards enjoy them;<note place="margin">The faults of person ought not to be cast on things abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> if this reason should hold, the best of Gods creatures,
and the most pious institutions which ever were in the world, should be all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
for what is it that was ever put in the hands of men to use, that hath not
been corrupted? and to cast the faults of men upon the things themselves, is a
great iniquity.</p>
               <p>But this superfluous enriching of Monasteries whereof they speak,<note place="margin">Whence the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perflous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys proceed.</note> came not
by this mean. The foundations at first were moderate, and no way excessive; but

as a work not beseeming their dignity, they to flatter the Predicans, who had then
all the way among the popular, and to be recommended of them for charitable
and devout Prelates, gave away almost all their own Churches, and impropriated
them to Abbeys,<note place="margin">Buch. l. 7.</note> leaving a poor Priest to do service in the Parish: and of this did
spring a world of evils, which since that time could never be remedied. This I
thought needfull to be said for vindicating the same of that good King, who in
all his actions, both private and publick, lived beyond all censure, so as it is truly
said of him, <q>That the most learned wits who have gone about to frame the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a good King, could never devise nor imagine such a one, as he did expresse
himself in the whole course of his life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to follow our purpose; Bishop <hi>Robert</hi> living under this King, and some six
years after,<note place="margin">Bishop Robert dieth.</note> did carry himself in all the parts of his charge commendably; he foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Priory of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and obtained to the City the liberties of a <hi>Burgh
Royall,</hi> placing therein one <hi>Mainard</hi> a <hi>Fleming</hi> to be Provost, and departing this life
in the year 1159. after he had sate Bishop 35. years was buried in the Church of
S. <hi>Rewle,</hi> the Cathedrall not being as yet built.</p>
               <p>There flourished in this time two of our Countreymen,<note place="margin">Richardus de sancto Victore with David a Presbyter.</note>

a Channon regular of the order of S. <hi>Angustine,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> a Presbyter. This

to accept the Charge, but would not forsake the Monastery, saying, <hi>That he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50008:31"/>
had washed his feet, and could not contaminate them again with the dust of earthly cares.</hi>
Whereupon <hi>Arnold</hi> Abbot of <hi>Kelso</hi> was elected, and in presence of King <hi>Malcolm</hi>
the fourth consecrated by <hi>William</hi> Bishop of <hi>Murray.</hi> This Bishop had been the
year preceding directed to <hi>Rome</hi> with one <hi>Nicholaus</hi> the Kings Secretary, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> his usurpation upon the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
being then returned, carried himself as Legate to the Pope; which power he resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned
to <hi>Arnold</hi> after his Consecration, as he was enjoyned by <hi>Engenius</hi> the third,
who then held the Chair.</p>
               <p>In a Convention of the Estates kept the same year, <hi>Arnold</hi> did earnestly insist
with the King to make choice of a wise for assuring the royall succession, and to
that effect made a long speech in the hearing of the Estates; but the King had taken
a resolution to live single, and would not be diverted. <hi>Edward</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdene</hi>
was much blamed for confirming him in that course, and for that cause hated of
many. The Cathedrall of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> a fair and stately Church whilest it stood,
was founded by this <hi>Arnold,</hi> but before the work was raised to any height he died,
having sate Bishop one year, ten moneths, and seventeen days onely.</p>
               <p>17. Upon <hi>Arnold</hi> his death the King did recommend his Chaplain <hi>Richard</hi> to
the place, who was immediately elected by the Convent, but not consecrated for
the space of two years after, because of the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> his pretensions.
One <hi>Roger</hi> held at that time the See of <hi>York,</hi> a man ambitious beyond all measure,
who from being Archdeacon of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was by the means of the Archbishop
<hi>Thomas Becket</hi> preferred to that place; no sooner was he advanced, but he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of Pope <hi>Anastasius</hi> the fourth a Bull, whereby he was designed <hi>Metropolitane of
Scotland;</hi> but the King and the Clergy (notwithstanding the Popes authority was
in those days greatly respected) refused to acknowledge him. <hi>Anastasius</hi> dying,
by whom the Archbishop <hi>Roger</hi> was maintained, the Prelates of <hi>Scotland</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene,
and by themselves performed the Consecration. <hi>Roger</hi> incensed herewith
sent to <hi>Rome,</hi>

within bounds, took many ways to wrong this good King, and make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised

King of <hi>Scots</hi> would not endure that wrong. <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> under whose

and finding that the King would not break with <hi>Henry</hi> for so little a cause, nor see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a way to repair himself, abandoned his charge, and went unto the Monastery
of <hi>Tours</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where he abode till he was forced by the Popes authority to
return.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> finding this injury dissembled,<note place="margin">Buch. l. 7.</note> went afterwards more plainly to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50008:31"/>
work;<note place="margin">An. 1165.</note> for having desired <hi>Malcolm</hi> to come to <hi>London</hi> to do homage for the lands

<hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Boeth. l. 13.</note> thinking thereby to alienate the minde of the <hi>French</hi> King from the <hi>Scots.</hi>
Again, when he had returned home, inviting him of new to a Parliament kept at
<hi>York,</hi> upon a forged quarrell, as if he had crossed King <hi>Henry</hi> his affairs in <hi>France,</hi> he
was declared to have lost all his lands in <hi>England:</hi> And not content to have
wronged him in this sort, to stir up his own Subjects against him, made the report
goe, that King <hi>Malcolm</hi> had voluntarily resigned all those lands. Which did so irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Nobles, as presently after his return putting themselves in Arms, they
did besiege the Town of <hi>Bertha,</hi> where the King remained, and had not failed to
use violence, but that by the intercession of some wise Prelates matters were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
The Nobility being grieved to see the King so abused, did urge him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
warre, but he loving rather to have matters peaceably agreed, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to accept <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Huntington,</hi> and suffer <hi>Northumberland</hi> to goe to
King <hi>Henry.</hi> This displeased the Subjects, and diminished much of the regard that
was formerly carried to him, which he took greatly to heart, and shortly after died,
as was thought, of displeasure.</p>
               <p>The good King being thus taken away,<note place="margin">Buch. l. 7.</note> his brother <hi>William</hi> succeeded in the

for the restitution of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> he had many good words given him,
and promise made, that at the meeting of the Parliament a course should be taken
to his content. In this hope he followed King <hi>Henry,</hi> going then in expedition to

was not shortly to return unto <hi>England,</hi> and that he was sed onely with fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
he took his leave and came home. Presently after his return, he sent an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald
to denounce warre, unlesse <hi>Northumberland</hi> were restored. King <hi>Henry</hi> being
then ingaged in the <hi>French</hi> warres, and not willing to make himself more busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
was content to quit that part of <hi>Northumberland</hi> which King <hi>VVilliam</hi> his
great Grandfather had possessed. Yet suddenly forethinking what he had done,
he stirred up underhand those that lived in the Borders to make incursions upon
the <hi>Scots.</hi> This being complained, and no redresse made, King <hi>VVilliam</hi> raised an
Army,<note place="margin">King William surprised at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</note> and went into <hi>England,</hi> and at <hi>Anwick</hi> as he was taking the aire, suspecting

whole State, may appear by the Articles condescended upon, for obtaining his
liberty, which were:</p>
               <p>1. That for his redemption there should be paid one hundred thousand pounds sterling
money, the one half in hand, the other half after a short time; and for assurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the Counties of <hi>Cumberland, Huntington</hi> and <hi>Northumberland</hi> be morgaged to

the absence of many of their number,<note place="margin">Sa. Daniel.</note> and the want of the inferiour Clergies
consent, deferred to give any answer at that time. The next year the same matter
was renued, and followed earnestly by a Legate sent from the Pope, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to reform the abuses he should finde in the Churches both in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland.</hi> This Legate called <hi>Hugo,</hi> and styled <hi>Cardinall de sancto Angelo,</hi> having
sent his Apparitors with a citation to the Bishops of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A meeting of the Scotish Clergy at Northampton.</note> for their appearing
before him at a certain day in <hi>Northampton,</hi> they went thither with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their Clergy. The Assembly being met, and all ranked in their places, the
Cardinall (who had his seat somewhat higher then the rest) made a long speech
in commendation of <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> shewing what excellent Virtues these
were, and how much to be desired of men of <hi>spirituall profession;</hi> whereof when
he talked a while, he came in end to perswade <hi>the Clergy of</hi> Scotland <hi>to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Primate of</hi> York: which he said <hi>was a thing very convenient for them,
and would turn greatly to their ease and commodity; for having no Superiour amongst
themselves, nor Metropolitane to decide Controversies that possibly might happen, there
could none be fitter then their neighbour the Archbishop of</hi> York, <hi>a Prelate of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and one whose credit in the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>might serve them to good use; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
besought them to lay aside all grudges and emulations, and dispose themselves to live
in all times after, as members of one and the same Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bishops who feared to offend the Legate made no answer,<note place="margin">Gilbertus Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus his reply to the Legate:</note> and after a long
silence, a young Chanon named <hi>Gilbert</hi> rose up, and spake to this effect: <q>The
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ever since the faith of Christ was embraced in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
hath been a free and independent Church, subject to none, but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose authority we refuse not to acknowledge. To admit any
other for our Metropolitane, especially the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> we neither
can nor will; for notwithstanding the present peace, which we wish may long
continue, warres may break up betwixt the two Kingdomes; and if it shall
fall out so,<note place="margin">Boeth ibidem.</note> neither shall he be able to discharge any duty amongst us, nor can
we safely and without suspicion resort to him. For the controversies which you
my Lord Cardinall say may arise amongst our selves, we have learned and wise
Prelates who can determine the same; and if they should be deficient in their
duties, we have a good and religious King, who is able to keep all things in
frame and order, so as we have no necessity of any stranger to be set over us:
And I cannot think that either his Holinesse hath forgotten, or you my Lord
that are his Legate,<note place="margin">Scon. l. 8. c. 16.</note> can be ignorant of the late exemption, granted unto <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi>
our last King; since the grant whereof, we have done nothing which may
make us seem unworthy of that favour. Wherefore in the name of all the
<hi>Scotish</hi> Church we doe humbly entreat the preservation of our ancient liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,</q>
and that we be not brought under subjection to our enemies. These
speeches he delivered with an extraordnary grace, and in so passionate a manner,
that all the hearers were exceedingly moved, the <hi>English</hi> themselves commending
his courage and the affection he shewed to his Country. But the Archbishop of
<hi>York,</hi> who looked not for such opposition, called the young Chanon to come unto
him, and laying his hand upon his head, said, <hi>Ex tua pharetra nunquam venit ista
sagitta,</hi> meaning that he was set on to speak by some others of greater note. So
the Legate perceiving that the businesse would not work, and that the opposition
was like to grow greater, he brake up the Assembly. After which the Prelates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home,<note place="margin">Boeth. l. 13.</note> were universally welcomed; but above the rest the Chanon <hi>Gilbert</hi>
was in the mouthes of all men, and judged worthy of a good preferment; and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50008:32"/>
soon after was promoved to the Bishopr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">An. 1178.</note> and made Chancellor of
the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The year following one <hi>Vibianus</hi> a Cardinal <hi>(titulo sancti Stephani in monte Caelio)</hi>
came into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scon. l. 8.</note> in shew to reform abuses, and do some good to the <hi>Church,</hi> but
in effect to extort moneys from Churchmen. For at this time it was grown to be
an ordinary trick of the Popes, when they stood in need of moneys, to send forth
their Legates unto all Countreys, sometimes under a colour of reforming abuses,
sometimes for the recovering of the Holy land, and sometimes upon other pretexts.
This Cardinall having stayed a while in <hi>Scotland,</hi> took his journey into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and in his return would needs make a new visit of this Church; for which effect,
he convened the Clergy at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the moneth of <hi>August,</hi> and established di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Canons; which the Clergy esteeming prejudiciall to their liberties, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent
after he was gone revoke and disannull; but what these Canons were,
our Writers do not remember.</p>
               <p>18. It was a fatall year this to many of our Churchmen,<note place="margin">The Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews elected Bishop.</note> both Bishops and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots;

<hi>Hugo,</hi> one of his Chaplains (whom he much favoured) to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
But they taking another course made choice of the Archdeacon <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi>
who was an <hi>English</hi> born.<note place="margin">The King dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased maketh his Chaplain to be choosed of new.</note> The King displeased therewith, did swear by the Arm of

                  </gap>this was his ordinary oath) that so long as he lived <hi>Scot</hi> should never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
that place: So he sent a Command unto the <hi>Chanons</hi> to make a new election,
appointing <hi>Ioceline</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> their assistant; and thus was <hi>Hugo</hi> his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
elected.</p>
               <p>The Archdeacon appealed to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con appealeth to Rome.</note> and going thither complained of the wrong
done to the Church, entreating the Pope for redresse. Hereupon <hi>Alexius</hi> Subdean
of the <hi>Romane</hi> See, was dispatched to try and examine the cause. At first the King
made difficulty to admit him, but afterwards yeelding, the two elections being
tried by the Legate, sentence was given for the first; and <hi>Iocelin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi>
with the rest of the Clergy that assisted the second, excommunicated. This
done the Legate called an Assembly of the Bishops, Abbots, and whole Clergy at
<hi>Haliroudhouse,</hi> and made <hi>Matthew</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdene</hi> publickly to consecrate the
Archdeacon upon <hi>Trinity Sunday</hi> 1178.</p>
               <p>He not the lesse fearing the Kings displeasure left the Realm,<note place="margin">His journey thither.</note> and went to <hi>Rome,</hi>
where he was honourably entertained by Pope <hi>Lucius</hi> the third, who sent Letters
to the King,<note place="margin">Pope Lucius his Letter to the King.</note> and admonished him not to usurp upon the Church, and to remit
the Bishop who was lawfully elected and consecrated, to enjoy his place with qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse.
This Letter the Story saith was conceived in milde terms, for the Pope
feared to incense the King, lest he should follow the ensample of his Cousin <hi>Henry</hi>
King of <hi>England,</hi> that some 8. years before had made away <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for his obstinate and wilfull opposition in some matters not unlike:
yet the King nothing moved with the Letter, to make his displeasure the better
known, did confiscate all the revenues pertaining to the See of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and
banished those whom he understood to favour the Bishops cause.</p>
               <p>The Pope advertised hereof,<note place="margin">The Pope pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Realm, is stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of the Archdeacon.</note> resolved to put the Realm under Interdiction. But
the Bishop prostrating himself at his feet, besought him not to use any such rigour,
saying, <hi>That he would much rather renounce his dignity, then have so many Christian
souls for ought that concerned him, defrauded of spirituall benefits.</hi> The Pope highly
commending the goodnesse and patience of the Bishop, held him from that time
forth in more regard,<note place="margin">The Bishop of Dunkeld dieth, and the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick offered by the King to the Archdeacon.</note> and at his request forbare the Interdiction. Mean while it
happened that <hi>VValter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dunkeld</hi> departed this life; whereupon the King
taking occasion, sent to recall the Bishop with offers of great kindenesse, protesting
that if it had not been for the oath he rashly made, he would willingly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to his enjoying of the See of S. <hi>Andrews:</hi> But seeing it did touch him in
Honour and Conscience (as he esteemed) to be yeelding thereto, he requested
the Bishop to accept the Benefice of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> which was then fallen void, and was
in value not much inferiour to the other.</p>
               <p>This the Bishop communicated to the Pope, who desired to have the matter qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50008:33"/>
advised him to return,<note place="margin">An. 1188.</note> and accept the offer. Thus was the Archdeacon by
the Popes consent preferred to <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> having the rents of the Archdeacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reserved to him during his life,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shop accepted Dunkeld.</note> in recompence of his losses. <hi>Hugo</hi> this way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be possessed, <hi>Andrews</hi> took journey to <hi>Rome</hi> that he might be reconciled to
the Pope,<note place="margin">Bishop Hugo dieth.</note> and being absolved for his intrusion, in his return died some six miles
from the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the 6. of <hi>August,</hi> 1188. ten years and ten moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his election.</p>
               <p>At this time newes was brought from the <hi>East,</hi> of the prevailing of <hi>Sultan Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine</hi>

<hi>Holy land,</hi> and to employ all their credit and means, as well in their own countreys,
as with other Christian Princes their neighbours, for the furtherance of that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.
To befray the charges of the voyage, both Kings by consent of their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and Nobles ordained, that all their subjects, both Clergy and Laity, (such except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as went in the voyage) should pay the tenth of all their moveables either in gold
or silver. King <hi>Henry</hi> having laid this imposition upon his subjects at home, sent <hi>Hugh
Pusar</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Duresme</hi> with other Commissioners to collect the tenths of the
Clergy and Laity in this kingdom: which the King and States, interpreting to be an
encroachment upon their liberties would not permit, yet for advancing that holy
action,<note place="margin">Sa. Daniel.</note> they did offer a supply of 5000. Marks sterling, which King <hi>Henry</hi> refused but
the enterprise upon a quarel that arose betwixt the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> was
at that time dashed, and so the collection was no further urged.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> a little after this,<note place="margin">Buchan. l. 7.</note> ended his life, and <hi>Richard</hi> his son who succeeded,
resolving to pursue the action of the <hi>holy Warre,</hi> to assure the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who
he feared would take some advantage in his absence, restored all the Castles
which were delivered to King <hi>Henry</hi> his Father,<note place="margin">Sa. Daniel.</note> and released him and his posterity
of all Covenants made and confirmed by Charter unto King <hi>Henry,</hi> as extorted
from him being then his prisoner, reserving only such rights to himself, as had been
and were to be performed by <hi>Malcolme</hi> his brother to his Ancestors Kings of
<hi>England.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lesl. l. 6.</note> King <hi>William</hi> to requite his kindnesse, gave unto <hi>Richard</hi> ten thousand
Marks sterling,<note place="margin">King of Scots his kindnesse to the King of England.</note> and caused his brother <hi>David</hi> (to whom he resigned the Earldom
of <hi>Huntington)</hi> go in company with him. There went under his charge 500. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
who were all in their return cast away by a tempest at sea, only the Earl
himself having his ship driven upon the coast of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was taken prisoner, and led
to <hi>Alexandria;</hi> where being redeemed by some <hi>Venetians,</hi> he was brought to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> and freed by an <hi>English</hi> Merchant in the City, that had known
him in former times. From thence he returned safe unto his countrey, the fourth
year after his setting forth, to the great joy and contentment of the King his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who took him to be lost. The part where he arrived being, as <hi>Boethius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,<note place="margin">Boeth. l. 13.</note>
before that time called <hi>Alectum,</hi> had the name changed, and upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

the Town now called <hi>Dundy,</hi> is a compound word of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Tay.</hi> As ever this
was, the Town there situated received many priviledges of King <hi>William</hi> at that time

to congratulate his safety went into <hi>England,</hi> where he contracted a great sickness;
the rumour whereof being dispersed, and his death much suspected, gave occasion
of divers insolencies at home: amongst others <hi>Herald</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Cathnes,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a malice conceived against the Bishop of that countrey, (who as he alledged, had

out his eyes, and cut forth his tongue. This inhumanity the King at his return

<hi>Guallo</hi> being displeased that the Interdict had passed so easily (for he was a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely

of the Monks called <hi>Vallis umbrosae.</hi> These Orders not being known before in this
Church, by their crafty insinuations with people, and the profession they made in
leading an austere life, did supplant the credit of the Priests, drawing to themselves
all the force and credit of the spiritual Ministery, and were upheld by the Popes,
whose designes they studied especially to advance. The King, who looked no
further then the devout profession they made,<note place="margin">Scon. l. 10. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This Bishop kept a severe hand over the Clergy, especially the Monks and

at <hi>Perth</hi> in the 1242. (where the King himself with divers of the Nobility did assist)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50008:35"/>
made many good Constitutions as well for reformation of abuses, as for securing
of Clergy men in their possessions and rights. In his time fell out great troubles
betwixt the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the second, and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth; for
which a generall Councell was called by the said <hi>Gregory</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and thither were
summoned all the Bishops of Christendome. The pretext was, the relief of the
<hi>Holy land,</hi> which at that time was in great distresse; but <hi>Frederick</hi> apprehending
the intention to be against himself, resolved to hinder the meeting of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and having belayed the ways, made the Bishops of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glasgow</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
as they travelled through <hi>Germany.</hi> Upon their promise to return home,
they were afterwards set at liberty: not the lesse they sent their procurations thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

unto the Church, and it being notorious, that the Pope was to employ the moneys
to other ends, (for he was then warring against <hi>Manfred</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily)</hi>
therefore the same was denied, and <hi>Rustane</hi> prohibited to enter into the Realm.
The King not the lesse in token of his affection sent to the Pope 100. Marks
sterling; and for the furtherance of the holy Warre did levy 1000. men, which
he sent to <hi>Lewes</hi> the French King, who had determined to adventure himself of
new against the Infidels, under the charge of the Earls of <hi>Atholl</hi> and <hi>Carrick.</hi> All
these dyed in that Warre, partly of the plague, as did <hi>Lewes</hi> himself, and partly by
the sword of the Enemy.</p>

was at that same time built, and endowed by the King with large Revenews: The

sent for licence to be consecrated, were detained a long time, and had returned
without effectuating their errand, if <hi>Edward</hi> the first of <hi>England,</hi> who coming from
the Holy land was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> had not by his intercession prevailed with the
Pope, and obtained licence for the consecration, which was performed at <hi>Scone</hi> in
the year 1274. in the presence of the King and divers of his Nobles. At the same
time, <hi>William Fraser</hi> Dean of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> was preferred to be Chancellour.</p>
               <p>The Pope shortly after this having convocated a Councell at <hi>Lyons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Councel at Lyons.</note> caused cite
all the Prelates thereto; to this effect a meeting of the Clergy was kept at <hi>perth,</hi>
where it was concluded,<note place="margin">Scon. l. 10. c. 34.</note> that the Bishops <hi>(Dunkeld</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> onely excepted)
should addresse themselves to the journey, and be at <hi>Lyons</hi> before the first of <hi>May.</hi>
Hopes were given of great reformation to be made in that Councel, especially of
the Orders of <hi>Mendicants,</hi> who were mightily increased and grown to the highest
of depravation. The Councel was frequent, there being present (as my Authour
saith) two Patriarchs, fifteen Cardinals, five hundred Bishops, and a thousand
other mitred Prelates, besides the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi>
and many other Princes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first proposition was for the</hi> holy warre,<note place="margin">A supply for the holy Warre.</note> and concerning it the Councel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
That a tenth of all the Benefices in Christendome (the priviledged Churches not
excepted) should be paid for six yeares; That all Penitentiaries and Confessors should urge
offendors to assist that holy businesse with their wealth and riches; and that every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
without exception of sex or quality, should pay a yearly penny during that space, under
pain of excommunication.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Acts of the Councel.</note> 
                  <hi>the Councel ordained,</hi> 1. That no
procurations should be paid to Bishops or Archdeacons, unlesse they did visit the Churches
in their own persons. 2. That no Churchman should possesse more Benefices then one,
and should make his residence at the Church he retained. 3. That without the Popes licence
no Clergy should answer the impositions, which might happen to be laid upon them by
Princes or States. 4. That the <hi>Mendicants</hi> should be reduced to four orders, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norites,</hi>
the <hi>Predicants, Carmelites,</hi> and <hi>Heremites</hi> of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> who should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in their present state, untill the Pope should otherwise think good. And 5. a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prohibition
was made to advise or admit any new orders, besides those which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
had allowed.</p>
               <p>Some other Acts of lesse moment were passed,<note place="margin">All the Acts overturned by dispensations.</note> whereof the extract under the
hands of the publick notaries of the Councel was sent to this Church; but all these
statutes turned in a short time to smoke: pluralities being of new dispensed with,
with the clause of <hi>Non obstante,</hi> which then first came in use. The orders of the
Friers and Monks restored one by one, as first the <hi>Cistertian</hi> Monks, who redeemed
their order by the paiment of 500000. Marks;<note place="margin">Scon. l. 10. c. 35.</note> then the <hi>Bernardines</hi> with the
summe of 600000. Crownes: the other Orders made in little sort their Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Whereby it appeared, that the statutes there enacted were only devised to
raise summes of money, and not out of any purpose those Fathers had to redresse
abuses. The same year was one <hi>Bagimund</hi> a Legate directed hither, who calling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him all the Beneficed persons within the kingdom, caused them upon their oath
give up the worth and value of their Benefices; according to which they were taxed.
The table (commonly called <hi>Bagiments rolls)</hi> served for the present collection, and
was a rule in after times for the prizes taken of those, that came to sue for Benefices
in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>

of superiority over the kingdome; it was sufficiently known that <hi>Scotland</hi> from the first

any other power whatsoever. That their ancestors had valiantly defended themselves
and their liberties against the <hi>Romanes, Picts, Britains, Danes, Norishes,</hi> and all
others who sought to usurp upon them; and howbeit, <hi>said he,</hi> the present occasion hath bred
some distraction of mindes, all true hearted <hi>Scotch</hi> men will stand for the liberty of their
countrey to the death: for they esteem their liberty more precious then their lives, and in
that quarrel will neither separate nor divide; wherefore as he had professed in way
of friendship, and as an Arbiter elected by themselves to cognosce and decide the
present controversie, they were all in most humble manner to intreat him, that he would
proceed to determine the question, which they and their posterities should remember with
their best affections and services. <hi>King</hi> Edward, <hi>although he was not well pleased

               <p>The Bishop of S. <hi>Andrewes</hi> who was lately come from <hi>France,</hi> not enduring to

of <hi>Glasgow</hi> and <hi>Isles</hi> at liberty, and the submitting of all controversies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

               <p>
                  <hi>Kings</hi> Edwards <hi>answer to the Popes letter was,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">King Edward his answer.</note> That from all antiquity the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and superiour dominion of <hi>Scotland</hi> did appertain to the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi>
even from <hi>Brutus</hi> unto his own time. That it was never yet heard that the Kingdome
of <hi>Scotland</hi> belonged to the Church, nor did he think the <hi>Scots</hi> would confesse so much.
And that if he should yield to his desire, he would unquiet his own Kingdome, and draw
upon himself the hatred of his subjects; which he knew his Holiness would not wish. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prayed him to hold him excused, and to be perswaded of his affection to the See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick.
<hi>He moved likewise his Nobility, who were then met in Parliament at</hi> Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clne,
<hi>to write to the Pope to the same effect. Albeit somewhat more roundly
they told him,</hi> That the King their Lord ought not to undergoe his judgement in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of that kinde, neither send his Procurators about that business as he had been required,
seeing that was to call in doubt their Kings title, to the prejudice of his Crown, the royal
dignity, the liberties, customes, and laws of <hi>England,</hi> which by their oath they were
bound to observe; and would defend with their lives. Nor would they permit the King,
although he would, in any way to attempt the same. Wherefore they besought his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
to meddle no more in that matter. <hi>The Pope having his hands full otherwise
at the time, did upon this dimit the</hi> Scottish <hi>Commissioners, who had made a long
stay at</hi> Rome <hi>with great promises of favour, when he should see it to be convenient.
The supplication directed to the Pope, is by some of our Writers said to be sent after
King</hi> Edwards <hi>second expedition into</hi> Scotland, but I rather think it was at the first.</p>
               <p>Whilest these things were a doing, <hi>William VVallace</hi> a Gentleman well descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">William Wallace.</note>
but of no great estate, began to shew himselfe, and gathering (out of a desire
to free his countrey from the subjection of <hi>England)</hi> a company of such as would

of the Church of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> nigh to the sepulcher of <hi>Gamelinus.</hi> He was a man
careful of the Church, and sought by all means to better the estate thereof. At his
first admission to the See he purchased the Priory of <hi>May,</hi> from the Abbot of
<hi>Reading</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which he gave afterwards to the Prior, and Chanons;

unto him; which was the thing that wrought his advancement; yet the <hi>Culdees,</hi> who
claimed a chief voice in the election of the Bishop, withstood him mightily at the
first. Before the Abbey was founded, the <hi>Culdees</hi> were the onely electors of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop:
afterwards being excluded by a Bull of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the second, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was committed to the Prior and Chanons;<note place="margin">Pasl. l. 6. c. 2.</note> whereupon arose a great controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
amongst them, which by the authority of good King <hi>David</hi> was agreed in these
times, that so many of the <hi>Culdees</hi> as would become Chanons, and enter in the
Monastery,<note place="margin">The Culdees and Chanons strife.</note> should have voice with them. But to elude this appointment, a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat
was procured from the Pope to admit none in the Convent without the advice
of the Prior, and most part of the Chanons: by which means the <hi>Culdees</hi> were kept
out, and deprived quite of all voice in the election. <hi>William Comin</hi> their Provost
supposing to get some advantage of the Prior in these troublesome times, did
strongly oppose <hi>Lambertons</hi> election, and the matter by an appeal drawn to the
Consistory of <hi>Rome,</hi> they both went thither to debate their rights: in end <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton</hi>
prevailed, and was consecrated by Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> in <hi>Iune</hi> 1298. This turned
so to the disgrace of the <hi>Culdees,</hi> as after this time we hear no more of them, the
name and Order being by little and little quite extinguished.</p>
               <p>About the same time were the <hi>Templars,</hi>

the Pope (this was <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth) was mightily offended with them for inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the corruptions of his Court, and sinfulnesse of the Clergy; which they
maintained to be the only cause of all the miseries of Christendome, especially
of the <hi>Holy land.</hi> But howsoever their destruction was wrought, all Authours te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
that notwithstanding the cruel torments which divers of that profession were

               <p>

Order being brought forth to die, and whilest the fire was kindling before him,
having his life offered, if he would quickly declare, that what he had deponed in
the time of his imprisonment, both of himself and of his whole Order, was true, did
utter these words; <hi>In these my last actions, it being unpardonable impiety to lie, I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and frankly confess, that I committed a great offence, both against my self and my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and that therein I have deserved a most tormenting punishment, because in favour of
them for whom I should not, and allured with the sweetness of life I have in my tortures
slanderously imposed many impieties, and detractions upon the Order, which hath ever
deserved well of the Christian world. I have no need of life obtained by intreaty, much
less retained by lying, and defamation.</hi> This said, and he being set to the pile, and fire
kindled about the neather parts of his feet to wring out from him a confession, even
when the flames began to waste and fire his entrails, he never swarved from
the constancy of his former speech, or shewed the least change and alteration of
minde. With him two other of the same Order did suffer (one of them being of
a great family, and brother to the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>Vienna)</hi> who shewed the like constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.<note place="margin">Plessis.</note>

against them,</hi> and that <hi>the Pope died the same day to which he was cited,</hi> being the

40. day after their execution. Partly by these testimonies, and partly by the clause

de jure non possumus, tamen pro plenitudine potestatis dictum ordinem reprobamus,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
by way of right we cannot, yet of the fulnesse of our power we reprobate

did present him to the King, intreating that he might have his lands resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and be admitted into his service; King <hi>Edward</hi> answered, <hi>That he could not
look for good service of him, whose father had proved such an enemy; and that the lands
were disponed to others that had merited better.</hi> So the Gentleman despairing to finde
any favour with the King, did await still upon the Bishop.</p>
               <p>Afterwards hearing that <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> had taken the field,<note place="margin">The Bishop committed to Prison.</note> he stole away secretly,

years after his fathers death) to take possession of the Countrey, and came with a
world of people, (they are reckoned to be no fewer then two hundreth thousand)
they were encountred by King <hi>Robert</hi> at the River of <hi>Bannockburn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Boeth. l. 14.</note> and wholly

of warre, when some eight years after they attempted to repair themselves, they
were forced with much dishonour to return and become suiters to the Pope to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
for peace.</p>
               <p>To this effect a Legate was sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate sent to disswade the King from troubling En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</note> who had audience given him at

                  </q>
King <hi>Robert</hi> answered, <q>That the Pope could not be ignorant of the estate of that

and graced with many privileges by the Popes his predecessors, had always

Bishop thirty years: a Prelate wise, active, and a great Benefactor to the Abbey,
wherein for the most part he kept his residence; The buildings, whereof now we
onely behold the ruines, were erected upon his charges. It is reported, that being
asked by one of his servants on a night,<note place="margin">Scon. l. in Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo episc. S. Andreae.</note> 
                  <hi>Why he did lay out so great summes for the

to build more then his successors should well maintain.</hi> Which he indeed performed,
for besides the repairing of his Palace in S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> he built at <hi>Monymaill, Torrey,
Dersey, Inchmortach, Mufchart, Ketins, Lincon, Monymusk,</hi> and <hi>Stow</hi> in <hi>Twaddale,</hi>
houses of good receipt for himself and his successors. He finished the Cathedrall
Church which had been many years a building, and dedicated the same with great
solemnity in the year 1318. He adorned the Chapter house with curious seats, and
ceeling, furnished the Chanons with pretious vestments for the daily service,
stored their Library with Books, and at the Dedication of the Church procured
of the King (who honoured the same with his presence) a yearly rent of 100. Marks
to be paid to the Abbey forth of the Exchequer; which annuity was afterward
redeemed by the donation of the Church of <hi>Fordon</hi> in <hi>Mernis:</hi> he himself the

as the donations yet extant do testifie; and dying at the last in the Priors
Chamber within the Monastery, was buried in the new Church on the north side
of the high Altar, in the year 1328.</p>

<hi>The subtile Doctor;</hi> and was followed of a number, who after his name are

his spirits did return,<note place="margin">Camd. Brit.</note> and that striving to get forth, he was there smothered;
whereupon an <hi>Italian</hi> did write this Epigram:

                  <note place="margin">An. 1341.</note> when the warres were so hot betwixt the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
did dissemble his Countrey, and pretend himself to be an <hi>English</hi> born to
eschew the hatred of the Students. In <hi>Colein</hi> where he might without danger shew
of what Countrey he was, he did professe himself a <hi>Scot,</hi> and the <hi>Minorites</hi> (of which
Order he was) did therefore upon his Tomb erected in their Church, at the end of
the Quire nigh unto the high Altar, set this Inscription, which is there yet to be
seen:

whereby it was declared <q>a thing unfitting, that an <hi>English</hi> Prelate should be Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

publication (made at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>September</hi> 1472.) the Bishops out of spite and

the Legation, and the Courtiers who made sale of all the Church-livings,
apprehending that the same would be reformed, combined all against him, and
went to the King, informing that he had accepted a Legation from the Pope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his licence, which was prohibited by the Lawes of the kingdome, and might
prove hurtful to the king, and that in contempt of his Majesty he had gone to
<hi>Rome</hi> without once asking him licence.</p>
               <p>The King possessed with these informations did inhibit the Bishop how soon he
landed to exerce any part of his Legation,<note place="margin">The King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiteth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his Legation.</note> till the King should try the complaints

the day he exhibited his Bulls, and shewed the power he had to reform abuses in
the Ecclesiastical state intreating the King not to impede him in the execution of his
charge; but his adversaries having corrupted some of the Kings Officers, and given
(as it was said) the summe of eleven thousand Marks in hand, his petition was not
regarded: his accusers to colour their proceedings the better, made an appeal to the
Pope, offering to qualify before him the invalidity of the Bulls which he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased.

ere he made even with them; The Queen-mother (who had taken the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>

Court, which she easily obtained: Thereupon the young King his escape from the

office and place; seventeen years he lived Bishop of this See, and was herein most
unfortunate, that under the shadow of his authority many good men were put to
death for the cause of Religion, though he himself was neither violently set, nor

many gave eare, and a great following he had both for his learning and courteous
behaviour to all sorts of people. The Clergy grudging at this, under colour of

these words, <hi>Lord Iesus receive my spirit.</hi> His body was quickly consumed (for the

up such compassion in the beholders,<note place="margin">Frier <hi>Campbell</hi> dieth of a Phrensie. History of the Church. p. 23.</note> as many of them doubted not to say, that he
suffered an innocent, and was indeed a true Martyr of Christ. This opinion was
further confirmed by the death of Frier <hi>Campbell,</hi> and the manner of it; for within
a year and lesse, he fell into a phrensie, and died as one desperate.</p>
               <p>The rumor of this execution stirred up some in all the quarters of the Kingdome
to enquire of the reasons of his suffering,<note place="margin">Numbers brought to the knowledge of the truth by his suffering.</note> and what the articles were for which he
was condemned; by the inquisition whereof, many were brought to understand,

insist much on these points: <q>That the Law of God is the onely rule of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
That if Gods Law be not violated, no sin is committed: That it is not in
mans power to satisfie for sin: and that the forgivenesse of sin, is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

mercy of God in Christ.</q> Of Purgatory, Pilgrimage, prayer to Saints, Merits

whereupon he grew to be suspected as one inclining to heresie. About the end of
Lent, upon some occasion he went to <hi>Dundy,</hi> and being there, was advertised, that
another of his Order was set up to resute the points of Doctrine he had taught;
which moved him to return to S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and confirm the same points which he

               <p>Thereupon he was called before the Bishop,<note place="margin">Frier <hi>Seaton</hi> called before the Bishop.</note> and charged to have affirmed in his

not, was a <hi>dumbe dogge,</hi> and one that fed not the flock, but his own belly.
The Frier answering, <q>That he had said indeed, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> required a Bishop
to be a <hi>Teacher,</hi> and that <hi>Esay</hi> called them <hi>dumb dogges</hi> who did not preach, but
that he himself had affirmed nothing. I declared, said he, what the Spirit of
God said, with whom if men offend not, they cannot justly offend with me; and
those that have reported my speeches, seem to be unlearned affes, who cannot
put a difference betwixt that which <hi>Esay,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, and that which of
my self I speak. I never said that you my Lord and the other Bishops who preach
not, are <hi>dumb dogges,</hi> I onely told what the Prophet and the Apostle said in

of an audacious and bold spirit, he dissembled his anger, minding to bring him in

state or degree soever he was, if once they did account him an heretick to speak in
his own defence; Notthelesse for himself, he offered to return, and justifie his

him in duty to see that every one who is accused of his life, be permitted to
use his lawful defences: for howsoever the Prelates held, that such matters belong
not to the cognition of the Prince, he would make the contrary manifest by their
own lawes, if he should be once heard. Wherefore he besought his Highnesse not
to be led any more by their informations, but to use the authority committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him by God, and not to suffer these Tyrants proceed against him, till he was
brought to his answer, which he would not refuse to give, so as he might be assured

                  </note> after he had stayed a while at <hi>Berwick</hi> he went to
<hi>London,</hi> and became Chaplain to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in whose service he died.
In the book of Martyrs I read, that <hi>Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> by his crafty and
subtle perswasions, induced him to make a recantation of sundry points at <hi>Pauls
Cross;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</note> but what his belief was of most of the Articles of Christian faith, it appeareth
by the Treatises he left behinde him; his examination by <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi>
(which he likewise published, discovering the policies they used to circumvene him)
doth testifie his constancie in the truth, and that he never denied any point which
formerly he had taught.</p>
               <p>Soon after his flight,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Henry Forrest</hi> Martyr.</note> one <hi>Henry Forrest</hi> was delated for saying that Master <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Hamilton</hi> died a Martyr, and thereupon was brought to S. <hi>Andrews:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the probation was not clear enough, Frier <hi>Walter Lainge</hi> was appointed to
confesse him. The simple man that feared no harm, being asked by the Frier
what was his judgement of Master <hi>Patrick,</hi> answered, <hi>That he esteemed him to be a
good man, and that the Articles for which he was condemned, might well be defended.</hi>
This confession revealed by the Frier, was taken for a sufficient evidence, and the
poor man condemned to be burnt as an heretick. As he was leading out to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded,
he complained grievously of the Frier who had betrayed him, crying out,
<hi>Fie on falshood, fie on false Friers, revealers of confession. Never let any man trust them
after me. They are despisers of God, and deceivers of men.</hi> And when they were taking
from him his Orders, (for he was of the Order of the <hi>Bennet and Collet</hi> (as they used
then to speak) he cried aloud, <hi>Take not onely from me your Orders, but your Baptisme also.</hi>
So being carried to the place of execution, (which was appointed to be at the
North stile of the Abbey, to the end the hereticks of <hi>Angus</hi> might see the fire) he
suffered death most constantly. Whilest they were consulting upon the manner of
his execution, one <hi>Iohn Lindsay</hi> a plain and simple man who attended the Bishop,
gave advice to burn him in some hollow <hi>cellar:</hi> for, <hi>the smoke,</hi> saith he, <hi>of Master
Patrick Hamilton hath infected all those on whom it blew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet the persecution still proceeding,<note place="margin">Divers cited to appear at <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirudhouse.</hi>
                  </note> divers were cited to appear at <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi>
by <hi>Iames Hay</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> who sate as Commissioner for the Archbishop of
S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> amongst others <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Levingston,</hi> brother-germane to
Master <hi>Patrick,</hi> with <hi>Katharine Hamilton</hi> his sister. The Gentleman was advised by
the King secretly, (for he loved the man) not to appear, and was for his contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
condemned. His sister appearing, and questioned upon the point of <hi>justification
by works,</hi> answered simply, that she believed no person could be saved by their
works. Master <hi>Iohn Spence</hi> the Lawyer, (whom we named before) held a long
discourse with her about that purpose, telling her that there were divers sorts of
works, <hi>works of congruity,</hi> and <hi>works of condignity;</hi> in the application whereof he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50008:46"/>
consumed a long time.<note place="margin">An. 1534.</note> The woman growing thereupon into a chafe, cried out,
<hi>Work here, work there, what kind of working is all this? I know perfectly that no works
can save me, but the works of Christ my Saviour.</hi> The King was present all the time,
and laughed heartily at the answer, yet taking the Gentlewoman aside, he moved
her to recant her opinions, and by her ensample divers others at the same time
abjured their profession: of which number were, Sir <hi>William Kirk</hi> Priest,
<hi>Adam Daes, Henry Cairnes,</hi> Master <hi>William Iohnston</hi> Advocate, Master <hi>Henry
Henryson</hi> Schoolmaster in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Stewart</hi> In-dweller in <hi>Leith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These persons scarce dismissed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Normand Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay</hi> and <hi>David Straiton</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</note> Master <hi>Normand Gourlay,</hi> and <hi>David Straiton</hi>
were brought to trial. Master <hi>Normand</hi> was charged for denying <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and
saying that <hi>the Pope had no jurisdiction within Scotland; David Straiton</hi> was charged
with the same points, and further was accused, for maintaining that <hi>Tythes were not
due to Churchmen:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts of Martyrs.</note> which point he denied, confessing that the tithes of some fishes
which his servants had taken at sea, being too rigorously exacted, he said, that if
they would have the tithes of the fishes they should go and receive them where the
stock was taken; and that he gave order to his servants to cast every tenth fish
they took into the Sea, because he saw nothing but rigour would content the
Church.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman had been in former times very quarellous and turbulent,<note place="margin">History of the Church.</note> but
was then become another man, through frequenting the company of <hi>Iohn Areskyn</hi>
of <hi>Dun,</hi> by whom it pleased God to enlighten his mind with the knowledge of his
truth, and to kindle in his heart such a love to the same, as usually he was heard to
pray for strength and spiritual courage, that if he should be brought to suffer for
Christ, no fear of death nor corporal pain might cause him shrink. And it clearly
appeared, when he was brought to his answer, that his prayers were heard. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
of the offers made him to recant and burn his bill, (as they spoke at
that time) he stood most constantly to the defence of the truth, and gave great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to Master <hi>Normand Gourlay,</hi> who suffered with him. These two were
burnt at one stake the 27. of <hi>August,</hi> 1534.</p>
               <p>At the same time was sentence pronounced against <hi>Alexander Alesse,</hi> Master
<hi>Iohn Fife,</hi>

                  <hi>Iohn Mackbee,</hi> and one <hi>Macdongal,</hi> who were summoned to the said
Diet, and compeered not. These persons fled afterwards into <hi>England,</hi> where
they remained a while well entertained. <hi>Alexander Alesse</hi> by the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> came in favour with <hi>King Henry</hi> the eighth, and
was called commonly <hi>the Kings Scholar;</hi> as he was indeed a man of good learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and gave thereof a notable proof in his dispute with <hi>Stockeslie,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
before the Convocation in the year 1537. After <hi>Cromwels</hi> death, taking with
him Master <hi>Iohn Fife,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bal. cent. 14.</note> he went into <hi>Saxony,</hi> where they lived Professours together
a long time in the University of <hi>Lipsia. Macdongal</hi> went also in their company, and
came to good credit, being elected Burgomaster of one of their Townes. <hi>Iohn
Macbee,</hi> commonly ealled <hi>Doctor Machabeus,</hi> during his aboad in <hi>England,</hi> was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
entertained by <hi>Nicol Saxton,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who made much accompt
of him, but afterwards going to <hi>Denmark</hi> became Chaplain to King <hi>Christian,</hi> in
whose service he died in the year 1550. Thus it pleased God to provide for these
men after their exile.</p>
               <p>Some four years after,<note place="margin">Divers accused of heresie in a meeting at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </note> the Bishops kept a meeting at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the moneth of

                  <note place="margin">An. 1538.</note> This poor man not long before had been called before the Bishop of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keld</hi>

                  </note> for preaching every Sunday to his Parishioners upon the Epistles
and Gospels of the day, and desired to forbear, seeing his diligence that way
brought him in suspicion of heresie. If he could find a <hi>good Gospel,</hi> or a <hi>good Epistle</hi>
that made for the liberty of the holy Church, the Bishop willed him to preach
that to his people, and let the rest be. The honest man replying, <hi>That he had read
both the new Testament and the old, and that he had never found an ill Epistle or an ill
Gospel in any of them.</hi> The Bishop said, <hi>I thank God I have lived well these many years,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50008:46"/>
and never knew either the old or new. I content me with my Portuise, and Pontificall, and if
you Dean</hi> Thomas <hi>leave not these fantasies, you will repent, when you cannot mend it.</hi>
Dean <hi>Thomas</hi> answered,<note place="margin">History of the Church.</note> that he believed it was his duty to do what he did, and
that he had laid his accompt with any danger that might follow. So at this time
being brought in question with the persons above named,<note place="margin">Vetimo Febr. 1538.</note> they were all together
condemned, and burnt in the fire upon the Castle hill of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This year in <hi>Glasgow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Frier <hi>Russel</hi> and one <hi>Kennedy</hi> martyred at <hi>Glasgow.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hieronymus Russel</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Gray Friers,</hi> and one
<hi>Kennedy</hi> a young man of <hi>Aire,</hi> not past 18. years of age, were accused likewise of

cold in those businesses, Master <hi>Iohn Lawder,</hi> Master <hi>Andrew Oliphant,</hi> and
Frier <hi>Maltman</hi> were sent from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to assist at their trial; <hi>Kennedy</hi> at his first
appearing in judgement discovered some weaknesse, and would gladly have saved
his life by denying the points laid to his charge;<note place="margin">History of the Church.</note> but encouraged by <hi>Hieronymus,</hi>
and by the answers he made to the Judges, he gathered his spirits, and falling down
upon his knees, brake forth in these words; <hi>Wonderful O God is thy love and mercy
towards me a miserable wretch, for even now when I would have denied thee, and thy
Son the Lord Iesus Christ, my onely Saviour, and so have thrown my self into everlasting
condemnation; thou by thine own hand hast pulled me back from the bottome of hell, and
given me to feel most heavenly comfort, which hath removed the ungodly fear, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
oppressed my mind. Now I defie death, do what you please, I praise God, I
am ready.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Frier reasoned long, and learnedly against his accusers, and being answered
only with railings, and bitter speeches, said, <hi>This is your hour, and power of darknesse;
Now you sit as Iudges, and we stand wrongfully condemned, but the day cometh which will
shew our innocencie, and you shall see your own blindness, to your everlasting confusion;
Go on,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop disswadeth the execution.</note> 
                  <hi>and fulfill the measure of your iniquity.</hi> At which words the Archbishop was
greatly moved, affirming that these rigorous executions did hurt the cause of the
Church more then could well be thought of, and therefore declared, that in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
it should be best to save the lives of the men, and take some other course
with them; but these others who were sent to assist, told him expresly, that if he
followed any milder course, then that which had been kept at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they
could not esteem him the Churches friend: whereupon he was compelled to give
way to their cruelty, and thus these Innocents were condemned to be burnt
alive.</p>
               <p>All the time they were preparing the fire,<note place="margin">The courage of <hi>Russel</hi> at his dying.</note> 
                  <hi>Hieronymus</hi> comforted mightily the
young man, using these speeches unto him, <hi>Fear not brother, for he is more mighty
that is in us, then he who is in the world. The pain which we shall suffer is short, and light,
but our joy and consolation shall never have an end; death cannot destroy us, for it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
already by him, for whose sake we suffer: Therefore let us strive to enter in by the
same straight way, which our Saviour hath taken before us.</hi> Many other comfortable
speeches he uttered, which moved the hearers wonderfully. When they were
brought to the place of their suffering, they used not many words, but commending
their souls to God, after they were tied to the stake, endured the fire constantly,
without expressing any token of fear or amazement.</p>
               <p>It was about the same time,<note place="margin">Master <hi>George Buchannan</hi> eseapeth out of prison.</note> that Master <hi>George Buchannan</hi> (who for his rare eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was afterwards in great fame) for some biting verses against the <hi>Franciscans</hi>
was committed to prison, but he escaping by a window of the chamber, wherein
he was detained prisoner, whilest the Keepers were fast asleep, fled into <hi>France.</hi>
Thus there passed few dayes,<note place="margin">Buchan. l. 14.</note> wherein some one or other was not called in question
for Religion.<note place="margin">The History of the Church.</note> But the more hot the persecution was, the favourers of the truth did
every day the more increase. And now had the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Iames Beaton</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the charge of all Church-affairs to his Nephew the Cardinal (who succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his place) for he was aged and sickly himself,<note place="margin">The Archbishop committeth the charge of all affairs to his Nephew the Cardinal.</note> and not seen often abroad. In
his last dayes he began to erect the new Colledge in S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and set men
awork to build the same; but neither lived he to finish the work, nor were the
moneys he left in store to that use rightly bestowed. Some contestings a few
years before he and the Clergy had with the King, because of the impositions laid
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50008:47"/>
upon the Prelates,<note place="margin">An. 1539.</note> for the entertainment of the Senators of the Colledge of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
So as the matter was drawn by an appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Gawine Dumbar</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Aberdene</hi> appointed to prosecute the same,<note place="margin">A contest for the imposition laid upon the Clergy for the Lords of Session.</note> But this ceased upon an accord
made, which was, that the Senate should consist of fourteen Ordinaries with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
seven of the Spiritualty, and as many of the Temporalty; the President
alwayes being of the spiritual estate, and a Prelate constitute in dignity. According
to this appointment, a ratification passed in Parliament <hi>anno</hi> 1537. and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of <hi>Cambuskennoth</hi> was elected President of the new Senate in the year 1539.<note place="margin">Buchar. l. 14.</note>
The Bishop a little after he had assisted as witnesse at the Christening of the Kings
first son,<note place="margin">Lesl. l. 9.</note> who was born at S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> departed this life, having designed his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
in all the Benefices he enjoyed, which were not a few; for besides the

... <hi>Hamilton</hi> of the house of <hi>Roplock,</hi> the Abbacie of <hi>Kilwining.</hi> All which,
the King for the esteem wherein he held this Bishop whilest he lived, confirmed
to them according to his Will: he was buried in the Abbey Church before the
high Altar.</p>

                  <hi>Andrews,</hi> whereof he was made Provost, and died there being of a good age: a man
well inclined, ingenious, and according to these times not unlearned. He wrote
the story of his countrey, howbeit in a <hi>Sorbonick</hi> and barbarous style, yet very

taxing in divers places the lazinesse and superfluity of the Clergy: which could

also of an exceeding courteous and humane inclination. Yet is he traduced by
some of the <hi>English</hi> Writers for a fabulous and partial Historian. But they who
like to peruse his History, will perceive that this is spoken out of passion and malice,

not to have tasted in the space of 32. days. This proof given of his abstinence, he was
dimitted, and coming forth into the street halfe naked, made a speech to the people

abuse the ignorant multitude, for that the opinion of Purgatory, Pardons and

treating too familiarly with him, that was lying under the highest censure of the

that if he should break the Diet, the same might breed the <hi>English</hi> Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and be an occasion of warre, on which he would not hazard, unlesse he knew
of means to entertain the same. The Clergy hereupon besides the representation
of some moneys in hand, made offer of an annuity of fifty thousand Crownes, if
warre should fall out; declaring withall, that by confiscating the goods of hereticks,
he might gain an hundred thousand more.<note place="margin">The King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth himself to King <hi>Henry.</hi>

this the King being ruled wholly by the Cardinal, followed in all things the
appetite of the Clergy, giving commission to Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> his Theasurer, to
call and convene all persons suspected of heresie, and inflict the punishments, which
after trial they should be found to merit. The King was also heard say, <hi>That none
of that sort should expect any favour at his hands, nay not his own sonnes, if they should
prove guilty;</hi> which put many in fear.</p>
               <p>But this continued not long,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iames Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> for Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> becoming suspected, and
accused of a practice against the King his life, was shortly after executed; and warre
breaking out with <hi>England,</hi> he found the Nobility averse from the incursions he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make, which did greatly discontent him. These thoughts, with some
fearful visions he had by night that much terrified him, withdrew his mind wholly
from the extremities on which the Clergy had set him:<note place="margin">The King troubled with visions.</note> for at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> on a night
as he slept, it seemed to him that <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> Justice Clerk came unto him with a
company of devils; crying, <hi>Woe worth the day that ever I knew thee or thy service, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thee against God and against his servants, I am adjudged to hell torments.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
awaking, he called for lights, and causing his servants to arise, told what he
had heard and seen.<note place="margin">History of the Church.</note> The next morrow by the light of day, advertisement was
brought him of the Justice Clerk his death, which fell out just at the time that the
King found himself so troubled, and in the same manner almost; for he died in great
unquietnesse,<note place="margin">The Justice Clerk his fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death.</note> iterating often these words; <hi>Iusto Dei judicio condemnatus sum,</hi> by
the righteous judgement of God I am condemned. The form of his death answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the dream so justly, made it the more terrible.</p>
               <p>Another vision he had in the same place not many nights after, which did more
affright him; whilest he lay a sleeping, he imagined that Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> whom
he caused to be executed, came unto him with a sword drawn in his hand, and
therewith cut off both his Armes, threatening within a short time to return and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of his life. With this he awaked, and as he lay musing what the dream
could import, news were brought him of the death of his two sonnes, <hi>Iames</hi> and
<hi>Arthur,</hi> who died at S. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Striveling,</hi> at one and the very same hour. The
next year, which was the year of our Lord 1542. being overwhelmed with grief
and passion,<note place="margin">The King died at Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>An.</hi> 1542, the eighth of <hi>December.</hi>
                  </note> for the losse of his Army received at <hi>Solway;</hi> he departed this life at
<hi>Falkland</hi> in the 32. year of his age. Some few dayes before he died, he had adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
that his Queen was delivered of a daughter at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> at which time
it is said he burst forth in passion, saying, <hi>It came with a lasse,</hi> (meaning the Crown)
<hi>and will go with a lasse, fie upon it;</hi> after which he was not heard to utter many
words.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal hearing that the King was deceased,<note place="margin">The Cardinal forgeth the Kings Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> did suborn a Priest called
<hi>Henry Balfour,</hi> to form his last Will, whereby it was declared, that he had committed
to the Cardinal, the Earls of <hi>Huntley, Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> the government of the
Realm, during his daughters minority. This Will he caused publish in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> on

it a meer forgery,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> elected Governour.</note> did choose the Earle of <hi>Arran</hi> Regent and Governour of the

that all things should be reformed which were amisse both in Church

and Kingdome.<note place="margin">An. 1542.</note> But this hope soon vanished, in the manner that ye shall hear.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hearing that his Nephew the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was dead, and
that he had left one only daughter of seven dayes old,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>England</hi> seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to unite the Kingdomes by marriage.</note> began to think of uniting
the two Kingdomes, and reducing the whole Isle under one Government, by the

Hereupon he sent for the Earls of <hi>Cassils</hi> and <hi>Glancarne,</hi> the Lords of <hi>Fleming, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
and <hi>Gray,</hi> (who were taken prisoners at <hi>Solway,</hi> and detained in <hi>England</hi>) to

them, with an offer to dimit them freely, so as they would promise to use their
best means with the Governour, and others of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their consents to the Match. The Noblemen liking the motion, and esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it a ready means to establish a lasting Peace, gave their promise to deal faithfully
in it, and so were sent home with many liberal promises, if the marriage should take
effect. In their company returned the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> and his brother Sir <hi>George,</hi>
(who had been exiled a long time in <hi>England</hi>) with letters to the Governour from

withall of the disgraces that he and his Master the King of <hi>England</hi> received.
The Governour answering first his complaint of the insolencies committed, said,
<hi>He should take trial, and punish the committers in such sort, as all might see what affection
he bore to the King and Countrey of England.</hi>

                  <hi>But for the pledges,</hi> he said, <hi>I can neither move

raised in the countrey by the Cardinal, and how uncertain I am of mine own estate; Till

               <p>The countrey hereupon drew into factions.<note place="margin">The countrey goeth into factions.</note> The Governour and some few

(who lived then in <hi>France</hi>) for the old emulation between the two houses of <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi>

he could not have forgotten, would easily (as they thought) move him to joyn with
them.<note place="margin">Buchan. l. 15.</note> Besides, they considered that his presence and friendship, which was great
in the countrey, would aid and countenance their course not a little. Hereupon
were messengers dispatched in haste, with letters to the <hi>French</hi> King, and to the
Earl himself. The letters written to himselfe were full of affection, and therein
hopes given of his Match with the Queen mother, and of the Regencie of the Realme,
during her daughters minority. And (as flatterers are never wanting to great men)
there were some about him, when they understood that he was called home, put
him in hope of the Crown it self, if the young Queen should happen to depart this

life. For the late King was known to have intended the same, and the Governours
title, they said, would trie nought, himselfe being illegitimate, and procreated in an
unlawful marriage, upon a divorce led between his Father and Dame <hi>Elizabeth
Home</hi> his wife, which made him uncapable not of the Crown only, but even of his
private inheritance. With such conceipts they filled the young Noblemans head,
and (as men are made easily to believe what they earnestly desire) encouraged by
these hopes, and the <hi>French</hi> Kings promises, he returned home.</p>
               <p>At his coming having saluted the Governour, with whom he dissembled in the
best sort he could,<note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed by the Queen-mother and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> and visiting the Queen-mother and Cardinal at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> who
did very kindly receive him, he went to see his friends, and imparted to them the
causes of his return, with the hopes that were given him, and the promise he had of
aid and supply from the King of <hi>France.</hi> They approving the course he had taken,
advised him to follow his fortune, and promised their assistance to the uttermost.
A few dayes after being advertised, that the Governour was gathering forces to
take the young Queen from her Mother, he came to the Queen-mother with four
thousand men,<note place="margin">The young Queen remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
                  </note> and abode with her, till by a common consent her daughter was sent
to <hi>Striveling,</hi> and committed to the custody of the Lords, <hi>Grahame, Areskin, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingston,</hi>
and <hi>Lindsay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mean while the Governours brother did earnestly ply him to relinquish the

without imparting his mind to the Noblemen, who kept Court with him at
Halirudhouse,<note place="margin">Buchan. l. 15.</note> went privately to <hi>Striveling,</hi> and submitted himself to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
receiving absolution at his hands, and renouncing the profession he made of
the truth, with the alliance contracted with <hi>England.</hi> A deed that lost him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the countrey, and brought him in great contempt; for after this fact was
he never in regard, the Cardinal from thenceforth carrying all the sway, and leaving
him only the shadow of authority.</p>

                  </note> the Cardinals next care was, to rid the Court and the Councel of
the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> which was brought about in this sort. Queen-mother by her
letters to the <hi>French</hi> King did advertise what an alteration was made, how the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
was brought by the Cardinals means to break with <hi>England,</hi> and that for
assuring the peace of the countrey, there was nothing more required, then the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> back under some fair colour,<note place="margin">Buchan. l. 15.</note> for that his stay at home
might prove dangerous, and a suspicion there was already of his inclining to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which might breed greater troubles then yet had been seen, therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
the King to recall him with speed.</p>
               <p>The Nobleman suspecting no such dealing (for all that time he was used with
great demonstrations of love and kindnesse by the Queen-mother) began to urge
the performance of promises, and had his hopes cunningly entertained, till the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
returned from <hi>France;</hi> at which time he was advertised by some friends in that
Court, that the <hi>French</hi> King was hardly informed of him, and some courses he had
taken, and howbeit he was invited to return, he should not find the welcome he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
This made him more instant with Queen-mother then before, but it was
not long ere he felt himself deluded;<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> finding himself abused, goeth to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> whereupon he retired home discontent, and
laid many wayes to repair himself, but all sorted to no effect; so as he resolved in
end, having lost the <hi>French,</hi> to offer his service to the King of <hi>England,</hi> by whom
he was kindly received, and afterwards honoured with the alliance of King <hi>Henry</hi>

               <p>The woman <hi>Helene Stirke,</hi> was accused for her refusing to pray unto the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> when she was in labour of her birth, and saying, she would <hi>only pray to God</hi> in

he would give no pardon. Thus the poor innocents were taken to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

a pithy exhortation to the people, beseeching them to fear <hi>God,</hi> and forsake the

husband, but could not be permitted, sentence being given against her that she
should be drowned; yet she followed him to the place of execution, exhorting him
by the way to patience and constancy for the cause of <hi>Christ.</hi> And as she parted
from him said, <hi>Husband be glad, we have lived together many joyfull dayes, and this day
which we must die, we ought to esteem the most joyfull of all, because now we shall have joy

of water not farre of, where having commended her children to the charity of her
neighbours, and giving a little babe who was sucking upon her breast unto a nurse,
she died with great courage and comfort.</p>

Burgesses were banished, and the Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> Provost of the Town discharged of
his office, because he was suspected to favour the hereticks; his place was given to
<hi>Iohn Charterhouse</hi> of <hi>Kilfawnes,</hi> and the Citizens commanded to accept him for their

their Provost, the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and <hi>Normand Lesley,</hi> son to the Earl of <hi>Rothese,</hi>

the Town by the Bridge, <hi>Normand Lesley</hi> and his followers were appointed to
enter at the South-gate, and S. <hi>Magdalens</hi> day appointed for their meeting. The
Lord <hi>Gray</hi> came early in the morning, but <hi>Normand</hi> who brought his company by
water,<note place="margin">Buchan. l. 15.</note> was hindred by the tide; yet all being quiet in the Town, and no appearance of
stirre, the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> resolved to enter, esteeming his own forces sufficient; but he
was not farre advanced, when in the street called <hi>Fishstreet,</hi> the Master of <hi>Ruthven,</hi>
with his company that lay close in some houses near by,<note place="margin">The Lord Gray invading <hi>Perth</hi> is repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> issued forth upon him, and
compelled him to turn back. The disorder in the fight was great, every one hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

he was not ill pleased with the affront that <hi>Gray</hi> had received; for he loved none of

                  </note> advertisement was made to the Cardinal, that
Master <hi>George Wishart,</hi> for whom he had searched a long time, was in the house of
<hi>Ormeston</hi> in <hi>Lothian.</hi> This man being of all the witnesses that God raised in that time
to advance his truth, the most worthy; the Reader will not mislike that I set down
the story at large. He was a brother of the house of <hi>Pittarrow</hi> in <hi>Mernis,</hi> a man of
great knowledge, and pleasant utterance, indued also with many rare vertues;
humble, modest, charitable, and patient even to admiration; some time he had
spent in the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and out of a desire to promove the truth in
his own countrey, came home in the year 1544. making his chief resorts in the
Towns of <hi>Dundy,</hi> and <hi>Montross,</hi> where he taught publickly with great profit and
applause.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal incensed with the following he had among the people,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wishart</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from preaching at <hi>Dundy.</hi>
                  </note> discharged
them of <hi>Dundy</hi> to receive him. Whereupon <hi>Robert Mill,</hi> a man of great authority
in the Town, either corrupted by the Cardinals gifts, or because he feared some
trouble might fall upon the Town for his occasion, did one day as he had ended his
Sermon,<note place="margin">History of the Church.</note> openly prohibit him to come any more amongst them, and not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Town with his Sermons. He after a little silence turning himselfe to the
speaker, said, <hi>God is my witnesse, that I minde ever your comfort, and not your trouble,
which to me is more grievous then to your selves. But sure I am, to reject the word of
God, and drive away his messengers, is not the way to save you from trouble. When I am
gone, God will send you messengers, who will not be afraid either for burning or banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I have with the hazard of my life remained amongst you preaching the word of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and now since your selves refuse me, I must leave my innocency to be declared by
God. If it be long well with you, I am not led with the spirit of truth; and if trouble unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
fall upon you, remember this is the cause, and turn to God by repentance; for he is
merciful.</hi> The Earle <hi>Marshal</hi> and some other Noblemen, who were present at the
Sermon, dealt earnestly with him to go with them into the North, but he excusing
himselfe, took journey into the West parts.</p>
               <p>He had not been long there,<note place="margin">He goeth to the West, where the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to apprehend him.</note> when the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> advertised of the

for that effect made a journey unto the Town of <hi>Aire. Alexander</hi> Earle of <hi>Glain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne,</hi>
hearing what the Bishop intended, hasted to the Town, offering to place
Master <hi>George Wishart</hi> in the Church where the Bishop was preparing to preach;
but he would not consent, saying, that the Bishops Sermon would not do much
hurt, and that he would teach, if they pleased, at the Market Crosse; which he did,
divers of the hearers which were enemies to the truth, being converted at the same
time. The Sunday following, being desired to preach at the Church of <hi>Machlin,</hi>
he went thither, but the Sheriffe of <hi>Aire</hi> had in the night time put in a Garison of
souldiers in the Church to exclude him; <hi>Hugh Campbell</hi> of <hi>Kingzeacleugh</hi> with
others of the Parish offending thereat, would have entered the Church by force, but
he would not suffer it, saying, <hi>It is the word of peace that I preach unto you, the blood
of no man shall be shed for it this day; Christ is as mighty in the fields as in the Church,
and he himselfe when he lived in the slesh, preached oftner in the Desert and upon the
Sea-side, then in the Temple of Ierusalem.</hi> So walking along to the edge of the <hi>Mort</hi>

which had consumed a great many people, was still raging in the Town, he choosed
to preach upon the head of the East-gate, the infected persons standing without
the gate, and those that were free within. His Theam was the 20. verse of the 107.
Psalme; <hi>He sent his word and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction.</hi>
Thereupon taking occasion to speak of the dignity and excellency of the word of
God, and the punishments that follow the contempt of the same, as also of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, and his readinesse to pardon those that truly turn unto him, with the
happy estate of such as God taketh to himselfe out of this misery; so he comforted
the people, as they were instant to have him stay with them, judging themselves
happy if they should die affisted with such a Preacher. Neither did he forsake them
all the time the plague continued, and not suffering the poor who were destitute of
means, to lack any necessary helps more then the rich.</p>
               <p>It happened whilest he stayed there,<note place="margin">A Priest apprehended that intended to kill him.</note> that a Priest called Sir <hi>Iohn Weighton,</hi> having

taking the Priest in his Armes,<note place="margin">History of the Church.</note> besought them to be quiet, saying, <hi>He hath done no

journey: will some of you be pleased to ride to yonder place</hi> (pointing with his finger to a

turning back to the Town, they who went forward to the place, found some
threescore horsemen laid to intercept them; whereby he understood the letter to
be counterfeited. They declaring at their return what they had seen, he said,
<hi>I know I shall end my life in the hands of that man,</hi> (meaning the Cardinal) <hi>but it will

fell upon his knees, sending forth many sighs and grones; then prostrating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
upon the ground, he lay in that sort almost an hour, weeping and praying,
and then returned to his rest. <hi>William Spaldin</hi> and <hi>Iohn Watson,</hi> who lay in the same
chamber, and had followed to see whither he went, began to ask him, as if they had
known nothing, where he had been; whereunto he made no answer: in the morning
inquiring of new wherefore he rose in the night, &amp; what was the cause of such mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
(for they told him all they had seen him do) he with a dejected countenance,
answered, <hi>I wish you had been in your beds, which had been more four your ease, for I was
scarce well occupied.</hi> But they praying him to satisfie their minds further, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
some comfort unto them, he said, <hi>I will tell you, that I assuredly know my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
is nigh at an end, therefore pray to God for me, that I shrink not when the battel wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
most hot.</hi> Hearing these words, they burst forth in tears, and said it was to them a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50008:52"/>
small comfort:<note place="margin">An. 1545.</note> whereunto he replied, <hi>God will send you comfort after me, this Realm
shall be illuminated with the light of Christs Gospel, as clearly as ever was any Realme
since the dayes of the Apostles. The house of God shall be built in it; yea it shall not lack
(whatsoever the enemies shall devise to the contrary) the very Capestone: neither shall this
be long in doing, for there shall not many suffer after me. The glory of God shall appear,
and truth shall once triumph in despight of the Devil. But alas, if the people become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful,
the plagues and punishments which shall follow, will be fearful and
terrible.</hi>

               <p>This said,<note place="margin">Wishart preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at <hi>Leith.</hi>
                  </note> he addressed himselfe to the way, and went that night to <hi>Perth,</hi> the
next day he came to <hi>Leith,</hi> where he kept himselfe close, expecting some adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
from the Gentlemen of the West; no advertisement coming, he waxed
heavy and sorrowful, and being askt, what made him so heavy? he said, <hi>I have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to bring people out of darknesse, but now I lurk as a man ashamed to shew himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men.</hi> They perceiving his desire was to preach, answered, that they would
gladly hear him, but considering the danger he might fall into, they could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
him to do it; he replied, <hi>If you and others will hear me the next Sunday, I shall preach
in Leith; (let God provide for me as best pleaseth him)</hi> Which he did, taking for his
text the Parable of <hi>the Sower,</hi> out of the 13. Chapter of <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Gospel.</p>
               <p>Having ended his Sermon,<note place="margin">He goeth to East <hi>Lothian,</hi> and preacheth at <hi>Haddington.</hi>
                  </note> he was by the Gentlemen his auditors counselled to
leave the Town (for they held his abode in that place dangerous:) which advice he
followed, remaining some time with the Laird of <hi>Brunston,</hi> and sometime with
the Laird of <hi>Languedry</hi> and <hi>Ormeston;</hi> yet every Sunday in one Church or other he
taught openly, unto the time of his apprehension. The last Sermon he made was
at <hi>Haddington,</hi> where he received from the Gentlemen of the West a letter, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
they could not keep the Diet appointed at <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> which grieved him so
much, as calling <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> (who then attended him) he said, <hi>I am weary of the
world, since I perceive men too weary of God;</hi> yet he went to the Pulpit, and rebuking
the people of that Town for the contempt of the Gospel, told them, that <hi>strangers
should possesse their houses, and chase them from their habitations;</hi> which came shortly to
passe. In that Sermon as he had alwayes done since his last coming into <hi>Lothian,</hi> he
spake of the short time he had to live, and told that his death was more nigh, then
they did beleeve.<note place="margin">He goeth to <hi>Ormeston,</hi> and dimitteth <hi>Iohn Knox.</hi>
                  </note> All that night he stayed in <hi>Haddington,</hi> and the next morning
bidding those of his acquaintance farewell, as it were for ever, he went on foot to
<hi>Ormeston,</hi> (for the frost was vehement) accompanied with the Laird of the place,
<hi>Iohn Sandelands</hi> of <hi>Caulder,</hi> and <hi>Chretchton</hi> of <hi>Brunston. Iohn Knox</hi> was
desirous to have gone with him, but he willed him to go back, saying, <hi>One is enough
at this time for a sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they had supped,<note place="margin">There he is apprehended and delivered to the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> upon promise.</note> he fell in a long discourse of the happy estate of Gods
children, and having ended that purpose, said he had a desire to sleep, but first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the 51. Psalme to be sung; which done, he went to bed. About mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
the house was belayed with horsemen, that the Governour sent to take him
prisoner. The Laird refusing to deliver him, and thinking to get him shifted,
the Earl <hi>Bothwell</hi> Sheriffe of the County came,<note place="margin">History of the Church.</note> and he required he should be put
in his hand, upon promise that his life should be safe, and that it should not be in
the Cardinals power to do him any hurt. The Laird reporting this to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George,</hi> he
requested him to open the gate, saying, <hi>The blessed will of God be done.</hi> So the Earl en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the house, to whom M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George</hi> said, <hi>My Lord, I praise God that so honourable a man
as you are doth receive me this night, in the presence of these Noble men; For I am assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
your Honour will not permit anything to be done unto me against the Order of the law;
I am not ignorant that all the law which they who seek my life use, is nothing but a corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and a Cloake to shed the blood of Gods Saints: yet I less fear to die openly, then to be
murthered in secret.</hi> The Earl answered, <q>I shall not only preserve your body
from violence, if any be intended against you, but I will promise you on my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in the presence of these Gentlemen, That neither the Governour nor
Cardinal shall be able to harme you, and that I shall keep you in my own power
till either I make you free, or bring you back to the place where now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:50008:52"/>Upon this promise was he delivered and put in the Earles hands, who departed
with him to <hi>Elphinston,</hi> where the Cardinal was attending the successe; it being
told him that young <hi>Calder</hi> and <hi>Brunston</hi> were with the Laird of <hi>Ormeston,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Lairds of <hi>Calder</hi> and <hi>Ormeston</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> he sent to

brought back to the house of <hi>Hales,</hi> (the Earls principal house in <hi>Lothian</hi>)
but Queen Mother at the Cardinals desire, being earnest with the Earle to have
sent him again to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> albeit in regard of his promise he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a long time, yet overcome in end by her intreaty, he yielded; So was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>George</hi> of new taken to the Castle,<note place="margin">Wishart carried to S. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                  </note> and after a short stay there, conveyed to S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>

               <p>The Cardinal not thinking it expedient to delay his trial,<note place="margin">The Cardinal sends to the Governour for a Commission.</note> wrote to the Prelates
to meet at S. <hi>Andrews</hi> the 27. of <hi>February.</hi> The Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
gave advice to seek a Commission from the Governour to some man of quality,
that might execute Justice, left all the burthen should lie upon them; whereunto the
Cardinal agreed, supposing the Governour would make no scruple in the matter;
nor had he made any, if <hi>David Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of <hi>Preston</hi> knowing what was sought,
had not seriously disswaded him, advising him rather to use his power in the
defence of Gods servants, then to arm their adversaries with his authority.
<hi>For it is marvelled,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">David Hamilton of <hi>Presson</hi> disswadeth the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> said he, <hi>that you should give such liberty to wicked and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
men, thus to oppresse poor innocents, unto whose charge no crime is laid; onely
they are accused for preaching the Gospel of Christ, which your selfe not long since openly
professed, and exhorted others to professe, promising by your authority to maintain the
same.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Buchan. l. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>The opinion which men had of your affection to the truth, was that which chiefly
procured your advancement to the place you now hold in the Realm; and now consider what
are mens thoughts and speeches of your proceedings, or rather what a fearful unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it is on your part to Almighty God, who hath bestowed upon you so many blessings.
You are rid of your neighbours at home (who envied your honour) without blood and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
you have lately reported victory of the forain enemy that was stronger by much
then your selfe, and now will you persecute Gods servants for the pleasure of flagitious men,
who neither can hide their wickednesse, nor have care to dissemble it? Remember how sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
the late King was taken away, when he followed these courses which now you run. They
who by their perverse counsels wrought his undoing, are leading you on to the same destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
At the first they were your open enemies, and resisted your promotion to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with all their might, but now I know not how they have snared you by their malicious
devices. Think upon King</hi> Saul, <hi>who was exalted by God from a mean estate to be King
of</hi> Israel; <hi>so long as he obeyed the word of God, he prospered, but how soon he grew diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
he became miserable. Compare the successe you have had in your affairs with his
prosperity, and you will find it not unlike; and of this you may be assured, that except you
take another course, your end shall be no better then his, perhaps worse: wherefore be wise,
and suffer not your selfe to be led any more by the counsels of wicked men, neither let poor
innocents at their appetites be thus cruelly murthered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governour moved with these speeches,<note place="margin">The Governour desires the Cardinal to deferre the trial.</note> did answer the Cardinal, <q>That
he should do well not to precipitate the mans trial, but to delay it untill his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for as to himself he would not consent to his death before the cause were well
examined; and if the Cardinal should do otherwise, he would make protestation
that the mans blood should be required at his hands.</q> This answer grieved the
Cardinal not a little, for he knew that the delay would work the prisoners escape,
and to commit the cause to examination, he saw it was more dangerous. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in a great passion he replied, <q>That he wrote not unto the Governour, as
though he depended in any matter upon his authority, but out of a desire he had
that the hereticks condemnation might proceed with a shew of publick consent,
which since he could not obtain, he would be doing himselfe that which he
held most fitting.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he made a citation to be given forth,<note place="margin">A citation for his appearance.</note> and Master <hi>George</hi> to be charged to
appear the next morrow, to answer for his seditious and heretical doctrine. Master
<hi>George</hi> receiving the summons, said, <hi>The Cardinal hath no need to summon me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I am in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50008:53"/>
his hands, and kept fast in irons, so as he may compell me to answer at what time he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
But to manifest,</hi> saith he, <hi>what men you are, it is well done to keep your formes and
constitutions.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">History of the Church.</note> The next day the Cardinal and Prelates being met in the Abbey
Church, the prisoner was presented by the Captain of the Castle, and then the
Sub-prior called Master <hi>Iohn Winrame,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">At his trial the Sub-prior preacheth.</note> a man of good learining, and one who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
favoured the truth, went up into the Pulpit as he had been injoyned; he took
for his Theam the words of our Saviour in the thirteenth of <hi>Matthewes</hi> Gospel,
concerning <hi>the good seed,</hi> which he interpreted to be <hi>the word of God; heresie</hi> he
said was the <hi>ill seed,</hi> and that he defined to be, <hi>a false opinion fighting directly against
the word, and defended with pertinacie.</hi> Thereafter falling to speak of the causes of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
he said the <hi>main cause</hi> was, the ignorance and negligence of those who had the cure
of soules, and neither understood the word of God, nor could use the same to the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of false teachers, and the reducing of those who were gone astray. In the latter part
of his Sermon, speaking of the way how heresies should be discerned, he said, <hi>That
as the Goldsmith knoweth the fine gold from the counterfeit by the touchstone, so is heresie
discerned by the true, sincere, and undefiled word of God.</hi> And in the end concluded,
<hi>that hereticks ought to be punished, and might lawfully be put to death by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now albeit that was said made directly against themselves,<note place="margin">He is accused by Master <hi>Iohn Lawder</hi> a Priest.</note> who were there met,
not to confute heresie, but to bear down the truth, and punish those that found fault
with their pride and licentiousnesse; yet as all had been spoken for them they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
and after their wonted form, placed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George</hi> in a seat erected for
that purpose, and over against him, Master <hi>Iohn Lawder</hi> a Priest in another, who
having a scroll of a paper in his hand, containing the Articles laid unto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George</hi>
his charge, did use many bitter and reproachful words; all which he heard very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
not moving or changing once his countenance.<note place="margin">Buch. n. l. 15.</note> Being required to answer,
before he would utter a word, he bowed his knees, and made his prayer to God;
then standing up, intreating them in most humble manner, to suffer him repeat the
summe of the doctrine which he had taught since his coming into <hi>Scotland:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His answer.</note> which
he said, was nothing but what the ten Commandements of God, the 12. Articles of
Christian faith, and the Lords prayer contained. In <hi>Dundy</hi> he said, that he had preached
a part of the Epistle to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And as he was going on, to shew what form
he kept in his preaching, he was interrupted by the accuser, who with many oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
speeches calling him an heretick, a runnegate, a traitour and thief, said that it
was not lawful for him to preach, and that he had usurped the power at his own
hand, without any lawful calling of the Church. The Prelates also prohibiting all
discourses willed him to answer simply, yea, or nay; fearing if liberty was given
him to speak, he should draw some of the hearers to his mind.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George</hi> perceiving that he could not have audience, appealed to an equal
and indifferent Judge.<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George Wishart</hi> his appellation.</note> Whereunto <hi>Lawder</hi> replied, that the Cardinal was a more
then sufficient Judge for him: and then he reckoned out all his styles, saying, that he
was Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Meropois,</hi> Chancellour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory
of <hi>Aberbrothock; Legatus natus, legatus à latere,</hi> and the second person
within the Realm. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George</hi> calmly answered, <hi>I do not condemn my Lord Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
but I desire the word of God to be my Iudge, and some of the Temporal estate, with
certain of your Lordships here present, because I am my Lord Governours prisoner.</hi> At
which words some foolish people that stood by cried out, <hi>Such man, such Iudge;</hi>
meaning that the Governour, and others of the Temporal State, were hereticks
like unto himself.</p>
               <p>Then would the Cardinal have pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
sentence without any further process,<note place="margin">Sentence of death pronounced against him.</note>
but being advertised to let the accusation be read, and hear what he would say, lest
people should think him wrongfully condemned; he commanded the Priest to
read the points distinctly, and receive his answer to every one of them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.
The Articles laid to his charge were eighteen in number, which with the
answers he made, the Reader may at his leisure see in the book of Martyrs. After
they had spent some houres in this sort, sentence was pronounced against him,
and he condemned to be burnt as an heretick. Then was he led back to the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50008:53"/>
Castle, and lodged in the Captains chamber that night, the greatest part whereof
he spent in prayer.</p>
               <p>Early in the morning the Prelates sent two Friers to advertise him that he must
die,<note place="margin">Two Friers sent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse him.</note> and askt if he would confesse himself: he answered, <hi>That he had no businesse with
Friers, nor would he willingly conferre with them, but if they were disposed to gratify him
in that sort,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Sub-prior.</note> 
                  <hi>he desired to speak with the learned man that preached the day before.</hi> This
being permitted, the Sub-prior came, and talked with him a good space: At last he
askt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George</hi> if he would receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>Most willingly, so I may have it ministred according to Christs institution, under
both kindes of bread and wine.</hi> Hereupon the Sub-prior went to the Bishops, and
told that he had conferred with the prisoner, who did solemnly affirm that he was
free of all the crimes, and that he did utter this not out of a desire he had of life,
but to manifest his innocency (which was known to God) before men. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
offended with these speeches of the Sub-prior, said, It is a long time since we
knew what a man thou art. The Sub-prior answering nothing, asked if they would
permit the Sacrament to be given to the prisoner: the Cardinal conferring with the
rest of the Bishops a while, answered in all their names, That it was not reasonable to
give any spiritual benefit, to an obstinate heretick condemned by the Church.</p>
               <p>When Master <hi>George</hi> heard that the Sacrament was denied him,<note place="margin">He communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth with the Captain of the Castle.</note> being asked by
the Captain of the Castle, going then to breakfast, if he would take a part with him,
he answered, <hi>Very willingly, and so much the rather because I perceive you to be a good
Christian, and a man fearing God.</hi> Then turning himself to the Captain, he said, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you in the name of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Buchan. l. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>and for the love you bear to our Saviour Iesus Christ, to be
silent a little while, till I have made a short exhortation, and blessed this bread which we
are to eat, so that I may bid you farewell.</hi> The table being covered, and bread accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the custome set upon it, he spake about the space of an half hour, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Supper, and of our Saviours death and passion, exhorting those that
were present to mutual love, and to the leading of an holy life, such as becometh
the members of Christ. Then giving thanks, he brake the bread, distributing to
every one that was present a portion; likewise having tasted the wine, he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the cup unto them, exhorting them to remember with thankfulnesse the death
of our Lord Jesus, in this his communion with them. <hi>As to my self,</hi> he said, <hi>there is
a more bitter potion prepared for me, only because I have preached the true doctrine of
Christ, which bringeth salvation, but pray you the Lord with me that I may take it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
as out of his hand;</hi> and so concluding with a new thanksgiving, he withdrew
himself to his chamber.</p>
               <p>Within a little space,<note place="margin">Two executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners lead him to the place of his suffering.</note> two executioners came up unto him, one of whom appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
him in a black coat of linen, the other fastened some bags of powder upon
all the parts of his body; and thus arrayed, he was brought to an utter room,
where he was commanded to stay, till all things were prepared. A scaffold in the
mean time erecting on the East part of the Castle towards the Abbey, with a great
tree in the middest in manner of a gibbet, unto which the prisoner was to be tied;
and right against it was all the munition of the Castle planted, if perhaps any should
press by violence to take him away. The fore Tower was hanged with Tapestry
and rich Cushions laid for ease of the Cardinal and Prelates, who were to behold
that spectacle. And when all things were made ready, he was led forth with his
hands being tied behinde his back, and a number of souldiers guarding him to the
place of execution.<note place="margin">History of the Church.</note> As he was going forth of the Castle gate, some poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who were lying there, did ask of him some almes for Gods sake, to whom he
said, <hi>I have not the use of any hands wherewith I should give you almes, but our merciful
God, who out of his abundance feedeth all men, vouchsafe to give you the things which are
necessary both for your bodies, and for your soules.</hi> Afterwards two Friers met him,
crying, <hi>Master George pray to our Lady, that she may be mediatrix for you to her sonne:</hi>
to whom he said, <hi>Cease, tempt me not my brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being come to the place of execution,<note place="margin">His death and the manner of it, 2. <hi>Martii</hi> 1545.</note> and gone up upon the scaffold, he turned
himself towards the people, and besought them not to offend with the good word
of God because of the torments they saw prepared for him, desiring them withall
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50008:54"/>
to shew his brethren and sisters who had often heard him,<note place="margin">An. 1546.</note> that the doctrine he
taught was no wives fables, but the true Gospel of Christ given him by the grace
of God, which he was sent to preach, and for which he was then with a most glad
heart and mind to give his life. <hi>Some have falsely spoken,</hi> said he, <hi>that I should hold the
opinion that the soules of men departed, sleep after their death untill the last day; but I
know and believe the contrary, and am assured that my soul shall this night be with my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in the heavens.</hi> This said, he bowed his knees, and having conceived a short but
most pithy prayer, he was tied to the stake, &amp; then cried aloud, <hi>O Saviour of the world,
have mercy upon me; Father of heaven, I commend my spirit into thine holy hands.</hi> The
executioners having kindled the fire, the powder that was fastned to his body, blew
up. The Captain of the Castle who stood near unto him, perceiving that he was
yet alive, willed him to be of good courage, and commend his soul unto God; <hi>This
flame</hi> (said he) <hi>hath scortched my body, yet hath it not daunted my spirit, but he who from
yonder high place beholdeth us with such pride,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His prophesie of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals death.</note> 
                  <hi>shall within few dayes lye in the same as
ignominiosly, as now he is seen proudly to rest himself.</hi> After which words, one of
the tormentors drawing the cord that went about his neck, stopt his breath, so
as he spake no more.<note place="margin">Buchan. l. 15.</note> The fire increasing, his body was quickly consumed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ashes.</p>
               <p>But the Cardinals malice not yet satisfied,<note place="margin">Prayers inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to be made for him after his death.</note> caused the same night a Proclamation
to be made through the City, that none should pray for the heretick under pain of
the heaviest censures that could be inflicted. And then the Priests triumphing
did in all meetings, extoll the Cardinal above the skies, saying, <hi>That he not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Governours authority,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Priests extoll the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal.</note> 
                  <hi>had by himself caused justice to be executed upon that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and kithed a most worthy Patron of the Ecclesiastical estate. If the Church,</hi> said they,
<hi>in former times had found such a Protector, matters had not been reduced to the doubtfull
terms wherein now they stand; but long or this time by her own power and authority she had
been able to maintain her self.</hi> Such insolent speeches they were heard to utter in
every place. The Cardinal himself also seemed to be greatly pleased with that which
he had done, presuming it should keep all his enemies in fear; yet it proved the very
rock on which he and all his fortunes perished: for the common sort of people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
mightily against his cruelty, and some of good birth and quality did open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vow that the blood of Master <hi>George Wishart</hi> should be revenged, though they
should give life for life: of which number, <hi>Iohn Lesley</hi> brother to the Earle of
<hi>Rothes,</hi> forbare not in all companies openly to avouch, that his hand and dagger
should be the Cardinals Priests.</p>
               <p>Nor was he ignorant of the general hatred carried unto him,<note place="margin">He contracted his base daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the heir of <hi>Craford.</hi>
                  </note> and thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fortify himself with some strong alliance, which he shortly after made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
one of his base daughters to the Earle of <hi>Craford</hi> his sonne and heir. The
Nuptials were performed with an exceeding pomp and magnificence. But he did
not long enjoy the content he took in his Match, for <hi>Normand Lesley</hi> sonne to the
Earle of of <hi>Rothes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Buchan. l. 15.</note> who had followed him a long time, and done him good servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
having moved him in the behalf of some friends that were interessed by the
restitution of the Lairds of <hi>Cleish, Easter Weimes,</hi> and certain others who been
forfeited in the late Kings time, was not answered as he expected; for which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into a choler, and alledging the Cardinals promise in the businesse, he said, that
he would not be deluded in that sort. The Cardinal, who had not been accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to such speeches, and thought he was not used with that respect which became,
chafed mightily, so as after an unseemly altercation they parted in wrath.</p>
               <p>This discord publickly rumoured,<note place="margin">A conspiracy against the Cardinal.</note> divers that hated the Cardinal (some for the
cause of Religion, and some for other private respects) did reparie to <hi>Normond,</hi> and
working upon his passion, incensed him with their words, wondering how he
could look for any good from him that was a man hated of God, and all good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And as it falleth out in such conferences, whilest every man was recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the injuries he had suffered in private, and talking of his violent courses, one
amongst the rest said, that they should do God good service, and no small benefit to
the countrey, to make an end of that vitious and ungodly tyrant whom all good
men did hate: and with such words inflaming one another, at last they agreed to cut
him off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:50008:54"/>The principal undertakers were <hi>Normond Lesley, Iohn Lesley</hi> his Uncle, <hi>William
Kirkaldy</hi> of <hi>Grange, Peter Carmicall</hi> of <hi>Fife,</hi> and <hi>Iames Melvile,</hi> one of the house
of <hi>Carneby;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators.</note> the Plot was to meet at S. <hi>Andres</hi> in the most private manner they
could, and surprise the Castle some morning before the servants were stirring.
And that the enterprise should not faile, they gave hands to be in the City the
28. of <hi>May,</hi> promising in the mean time so to carry themselves, as no suspicion might
be taken of their purpose. Thus at the day appointed, <hi>Normond</hi> accompanied with
five onely, came to the City, and went to his accustomed lodging; <hi>William Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldy</hi>
was there a day before, <hi>Iohn Lesley</hi> who did professe enmity to the Cardinal,
entered not till night was fallen. Upon Saterday morning the 29. of <hi>May,</hi> rising
about three of the clock, they met in the Abbey Church-yard, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
that <hi>William Kircaldy,</hi> and six with him (for they did not exceed twelve
in all) should attend the opening of the gate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Grange</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the Castle.</note> and assure it for the rest. All things
succeeded to their wishes, <hi>Grange</hi> at his first coming found the gate open; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
with his company, entertained the Keeper with some speeches, asking if the
Cardinal was stirring, and how soon he would rise. <hi>Normond</hi> came shortly after,
and some two with him; last of all, came <hi>Iohn Lesley</hi> with other two; whom as soon
as the Keeper saw, suspecting some bad practice, he made to draw the bridge, but
they laying hands upon him, took the keys, and assured the gate.</p>
               <p>Then appointing four of the company to watch the chamber where the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
lay that no advertisement should go unto him,<note place="margin">The servants and workmen put to the gate.</note> they went to the several cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in which the servants lay asleep, and calling them by their names (for they were
all known unto them) they put fifty of his ordinary servants, besides the workmen,
Masons, and Wrights, who were reckoned above a hundred, (for he was then forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Castle) to the gate, permitting none to stay within, but the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>
the Governours eldest sonne, whom they thought best to detain upon all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
This was performed with so little noise, as the Cardinal did not hear, till
they knockt at his chamber. Then he asked, who was there? <hi>Iohn Lesley</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
My name is <hi>Lesley.</hi> Which <hi>Lesley,</hi> said the Cardinal? is that <hi>Normond?</hi> It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that he must open to those that were there. The answer gave him notice
that they were no friends; therefore making the dore fast, he refused to open.
They calling to bring fire,<note place="margin">The Cardinal killed.</note> whilest it was in fetching, he began to commune with
them; and after some speeches, upon their promise to use no violence, he opened
the dore; but they rushing in with their swords drawne did most inhumanely kill
him, he not making any resistance.</p>
               <p>The tumult was great in the City,<note place="margin">A tumult in the City.</note> upon the rumour that the Castle was taken.
The people armed, and such as favoured the Cardinal, made haste intending to scale
the walls;<note place="margin">Buchon. l. 15.</note> but when it was told them, that he was dead whom they sought to help,
their hearts cooled. The people still crying for a sight of the Cardlnal, his corps was
brought to the very same place, where he sate beholding Master <hi>George Wisharts</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
Upon the sight whereof, they dissolved; many then calling to mind the
Martyr his last words, were thereby confirmed in the opinion they had of his piety
and holinesse.</p>
               <p>Such was the end of this unfortunate man, who in his life was ambitious beyond
measure,<note place="margin">The Cardinal his description.</note> and in punishing of those he esteemed hereticks, more then inhumane;
a barbarous part it was in him to sit and behold the Martyring of Master <hi>George
Wishart,</hi> taking pleasure in that which no man could look on without pity. But the
hatred he bare to the truth, and the care he had to maintain his own greatnesse, was
such, and so excessive, as he did both forget himselfe, and the place he held
in the Church, and now doth remain a tragical ensample in story, to admonish every
man to keep within his bound, and hold that moderation which is fitting.</p>
               <p>The rumour of this fact being quickly dispersed through the countrey,<note place="margin">How the fact was interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Countrey.</note> every
man commended or condemned it as his passion led him. They who stood in awe
of his power, did highly commend the enterprise and praise the doers, and of that
sort divers came to congratulate the fact, offering to take one part with them.
Others who were more wise, and moderate, though they disliked not the fact, (as
hoping to enjoy their profession with greater liberty) did yet abhorre the form and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50008:55"/>
manner, judging it to be foully done, especially on the part of <hi>Normond,</hi> at whose
hands he did not look for any harme. And indeed few or none of those who had an
hand in that work, escaped an extraordinary judgement; God thereby declaring,
that howsoever it pleaseth him in the execution of his judgements, to use sometimes
the ministery and service of men, yet doth he not allow of their wicked disposition,
and for most part faileth not to reward them with the same, or the like that they do
unto others.</p>
               <p>But in the Church a fearful uproare was raised upon this accident,<note place="margin">A great stirre in the Church by this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the Priests and
Friers exclaiming every where against the murther, as the most odious which in
any memory had been committed. The Bishops running upon the Governour (who
was no lesse troubled with the fact then themselves) desired some course might be
taken for the speedy punishment of the murtherers: but he following the course of
law, directed summons for their appearing to underlye trial, which they contemned,
and were therefore denounced Rebels.<note place="margin">The murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers accursed.</note> The Ecclesiastick Judges to be nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
for their parts, did solemnly curse the actors, and all that should receive or

               <p>41. Mean while the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
did nominate his base brother for the place;<note place="margin">The Governours base brother elected Bishop.</note>
who was elected by the Chanons, and soon after confirmed by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third.
For he fearing the defection of the Realme from the obedience of the <hi>Romane</hi> See,
as <hi>England</hi> had given the ensample, was glad to gratifie the Governour, and with
the Bulls which were freely exped, wrote both to the Governour and to the Bishop,
that they should make their zeal appear, in vindicating the injury done to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
estate.</p>
               <p>Upon the receipt of these letters,<note place="margin">The Castle besieged, and supplied from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> it was resolved to besiege the Castle, which
beginning about the end of <hi>August,</hi> continued untill the moneth of <hi>Ianuary;</hi> howbeit
to small effect: for the passage by Sea being open, they were supplyed with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
from <hi>England</hi> by King <hi>Henry,</hi> to whom they had obliged their faith by
two several messages for defending the Castle, and maintaining the contract with
<hi>England:</hi> which the Governour fearing he was induced to capitulate with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
and yield unto the conditions following.</p>
               <p>1. That the Governour should procure unto them a sufficient absolution from
the Pope for the slaughter of the Cardinal,<note place="margin">A c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pitulation with the besieged.</note> and till the same was returned, that they
should retain the Castle, and not be pursued by force.</p>
               <p>2. That they, their friends, servants, and partakers, should simply be remitted
by the Governour, and never be called in question for the said slaughter, but
should enjoy all commodities spiritual and temporal, which they possessed before
the committing thereof.</p>
               <p>3. That the besieged should give pledges for rendering the Castle, how soon
the absolution was returned from <hi>Rome;</hi> and for surety of the pledges, that the Earl
of <hi>Arran</hi> eldest sonne to the Governour, should remain in their custody untill the
absolution was returned, and they secured to their content.</p>
               <p>The conditions were to the besieged more advantagious then honourable to the
Governour,<note place="margin">The Governor sendeth to <hi>France</hi> for a supply.</note> but neither the one nor the other intended performance; for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
at the same time sent a messenger to <hi>France,</hi> with letters from the Queen
<hi>Dowager,</hi> and from himself, intreating a supply of Ships and Gallies, to batter the
house on that part which looked towards the Sea, and debarre the Keepers of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
provision. They on the other side, were resolved not to forsake King <hi>Henries</hi>
protection, of whose assistance they were confident. The proceedings of the next
summer, shall clear the intentions on either side; in the mean time, let us hear how
the affaires of Religion went the rest of this winter.</p>
               <p>Divers, as we touched before,<note place="margin">Divers joyned with those within the Castle.</note> upon the newes of the Cardlnals death, came and
joyned with those that had killed him, especially Master <hi>Henry Balnaves,</hi> the <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi>
of the house of <hi>Raith,</hi> and some Gentlemen of <hi>Fife,</hi> to the number of seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
persons, who all entered into the Castle the day after the slaughter, and
abode there during the time of the first siege.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Rough</hi> and <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> preach to the besieged.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn Rough,</hi> he that had attended
the Governour as Chaplain in the beginning of his Regiment, came also thither,
and became their Preacher.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50008:55"/>After him came <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> but not till the siege was raised, and the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made, whereof we have spoken. The adversaries of Religion taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of this, did cast in the teeth of both the Preachers and Professours the murther
committed, as though they did all approve the same; and Bishop <hi>Lesley</hi> in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
speaking of <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> saying, that <hi>He did think to attain to the top of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
profession, by triumphing that way upon the slaughter of a Priest and Cardinall.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not, but this his doing was scarce allowable, and that it had been a wiser part in
him not to have gone towards them at all; yet since he did neither accompany
them at the fact, nor came unto them till the conditions of peace were granted; his
guiltinesse was not such as they make it to be; neither will I say that he was grieved
at the Cardinals death, but rather glad that such an enemy was taken out of the
way: but that he did insult upon his death, or allow the manner of it, cannot be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirmed as to that which is objected, forth of the narration made of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the book intituled, <hi>The History of the Church of Scotland,</hi> where the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
seemeth indeed to commend the fact; though that history be ascribed to <hi>Iohn
Knox,</hi> it is sure that he did not penne the same, as I shall make clear in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place.</p>
               <p>How soon the Governour was gone,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Rough</hi> preaching in the city, is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by the Clergy.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn Rough</hi> did openly preach in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Church, and was much haunted by the people; at which the Clergy offending,
a great stirre was raised: Dean <hi>Iohn Anand</hi> oppugning his doctrine both by word
and writing, <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> did take on him to maintain the same: and the matter
being brought to a dispute, after long reasoning upon the authority of the <hi>Romane</hi>
Church, <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> did offer to prove, <q>That the present Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
was more degenerate from the purity which it had in the dayes of the Apostles,
then was the Church of the Jewes from the Ordinances given by <hi>Moses,</hi> when
they consented to the death of our Saviour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such as were present at the reasoning,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> maintained his doctrine in a Sermon.</note> having requested <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> to make
good what he had spoken, he took occasion the Sunday following to preach in the
Parish Church, chusing for his Theam the 24, and 25. verses of the seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Daniel;</hi> In the Sermon after he had spoken of <q>the care that God had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
of his Church, to forewarne her of the dangers that were to happen, many
years before the same fell out; and illustrated that point by the predictions of <hi>Israels</hi>
captivity, the prophesie of the <hi>four Empires,</hi> namely the <hi>Babylonian, Persian, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
and <hi>Romane,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The substance of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> his Sermon.</note> and foretelling of the <hi>Beast</hi> that should afise out of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>Romane Empire;</hi> he said that by that <hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> was to
be understood, in regard all the marks assigned by <hi>Daniel,</hi> did pertain to that
Church, and to no other power which ever was in the world. Then falling to
speak of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> he shewed that there was not any one person meant by that
title, but a body and multitude of people, having a wicked head, that should not
only be sinful himself, but the occasion also of sin to all that should be subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. And that he was called <hi>Antichrist,</hi> because he was <hi>contrary to Christ,</hi> in
life and doctrine, in lawes. The contrariety of <hi>life</hi> he made clearly by decipher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the corrupt and beastly conversation both of the Popes themselves, and of
their Clergy. The contraiety of <hi>doctrine</hi> he qualified by comparing the doctrine
of the <hi>justification by faith</hi> taught in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> with the doctrine of <hi>justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by works,</hi> maintained by the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> And the contrariety of <hi>lawes</hi>
he proved by the observation of dayes, abstaining from mears, and forbidding of
marriage, which <hi>Christ</hi> had made free. In end he came to speak of the <hi>marks of
the Beast,</hi> one he said was in the Text, where it was said, <hi>He shall speak great words
against the most high;</hi> but what greater words said he can be uttered then to call
the Pope the Vicar of Christ, the successour of <hi>Peter,</hi> the head of the universal
Church; most holy, most blessed, one who cannot erre, that may make right of
wrong and wrong of right, that of nothing may make somewhat; that hath all
verity inclosed in the shrine of his breast, that hath power over all men, no man
having power over him, and through he draw ten thousand millions of souls with
himself to hell, that none may or ought to say that he doth wrong? which words
he shewed, were expressed in the common law, and could not be denied. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50008:56"/>
note more remarkable, he adduced forth of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> his Revelation, where
it is said, that <hi>the Babylonian whore shall make merchandise of the souls of men;</hi> which
never any did of what profession soever they were, the Pope and his followers
excepted: for they (said he) take upon them to mitigate the paines of souls in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
and to release them by saying of Masses, selling of Pardons, and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
which none besides them ever did: whereupon he inferred, that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was quite degenerate from her first purity, and that very beast
foreshewed in the Scriptures, &amp;c.</q>

to answer his allegations, if they found any one of them not consonant to truth.

wondered how he could suffer such heretical and schismatical doctrines to be

as followeth.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That no mortal man can be the head of Christs Church.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Pope is Antichrist, and so not a member of Christs mystical body.</item>
                  <item>3. That no man may make or devise a Religion that is acceptable to God, but
that he is bound to observe and keep the Religion received from God,
without chopping or changing the same.</item>
                  <item>4. That the Sacraments of the New Testament ought to bee ministred
as they were instituted by <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and practised by his Apostles,
nor ought there any thing be added unto them, nor diminished from
them.</item>
                  <item>5. That the Masse is abominable idolatry, blasphemous to the death of <hi>Iesus
Christ,</hi> and a profanation to the Lords Suppers.</item>
                  <item>6. That there is no Purgatory, in the which the souls of men can either be pined
or purged after this life, Heaven being appointed for the faithful, and Hell
for the reprobate and unfaithful.</item>
                  <item>7. That prayer for the dead is vain, and to the dead is idolatry.</item>
                  <item>8. That Bishops are no Bishops, except they preach themselves wthout a
Substitute.</item>
                  <item>9. That tithes by Gods law do not appertain necessarily to Churchmen.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This last Article I would not omit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> his judgement of tithes.</note> because it is alledged by those that penned
the story; whether it was a point of <hi>Iohn Roughs</hi> preaching or not, I cannot say, but
for <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> it is clear by his Sermons and writings still extant, that he held it a
point of <hi>high Sacriledge to rob and spoile the Church of tithes.</hi> It is true that many in
these times, offending with the extortion of Churchmen, did hold that <hi>tithes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
not to the Church by any divine right;</hi> and knowing that this opinion would
find easie passage among the people, as also serve to abridge the means and power
of Churchmen, they were the more ready to deliver such doctrines; but this was
done rather out of passion then judgement: for he that will not wilfully shut his
eyes against the truth, cannot but know that tithes are the Lords, and the portion
that he hath served for the maintenance of his worship and service: But to leave this.</p>
               <p>The Sub-prior and others of the Clergy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> his answer to the Sub-prior and Clergy.</note> that convened with him, having laid
these Articles to their charge, <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> answered, that for himself he was glad to
declare his mind in those points, before so modest and judicious an auditory;
and turning to the Sub-prior, <hi>It is a long time,</hi> said he, <hi>since I have heard that you
are not ignorant of the truth; Therefore I do appeal your conscience before the supreme
Iudge, that if you think the Articles wherewith we are charged contrarious to the truth of
God, that you plainly open your self, and suffer not the people to be deceived; but if in
your conscience you know them to be true and sound, then I will crave your patrocinie, that
by your authority the people may be moved to embrace the truth, whereof now many doubt,
because of your indifferencie.</hi> The Sub-prior answered, <q>That he came not there
to judge, but to conferre of these points, and would, if he pleased, reason a little
of the power of the Church, which in my opinion (said he) may very lawfully

devise rights and ceremonies for decoring the Sacraments,</q>

any ceremony, giving it a signification to his pleasure.</hi> One <hi>Arbuthnet</hi> a gray Frier rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
so hotly in the contrary, that forgetting himself, he denied the <hi>Apostles</hi> to
have received the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> when they penned their Epistles. The Sub-prior
checking the Frier, did after a little space dimit the Preachers with a brotherly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
to take heed what doctrine they delivered in publick.</p>

of any controverted point, which might breed question, and minister unto people

of <hi>Queen Maries</hi> persecution, he fled with the wife that he had married unto <hi>Fries<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and wonne his living with the knitting of Caps, hose and such like wares; and
in <hi>November</hi> 1557. coming to <hi>London</hi> for providing some necessaries to maintain

in <hi>Islington,</hi> where they who professed Religion, used quietly to meet.</p>
               <p>Being brought before <hi>Bonner</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is brought in question, and examined by <hi>Bonner</hi> Bishop of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> and questioned, if at any time
since his last coming into <hi>England,</hi> he had preached; he answered; <hi>That he had
not preached, but in some places where godly people were assembled, he did read the prayers
of the the Communion Book, set forth in the Reign of King</hi> Edward <hi>the sixth.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked, what his judgement was of the said book, he confessed, <hi>That he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the same, as agreeing in all points with the word of God.</hi> The Bishop used many
perswasions to make him recant, and detained him some weeks in prison, to try
what he would do: but finding him resolute, and constant in his profession, he
brought him forth to be judged. Where (one <hi>Morgan</hi> a Bishop of S. <hi>Davids</hi> assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
he was charged, first, <hi>That being a Priest, and in Orders, he had married a wife;</hi>
next, <hi>That he refused to use the Latine Service;</hi> and thirdly, <hi>That he would not go
to the Masse.</hi> To the first point he answered, <hi>That Orders were not an impediment to
marriage, and that he had done lawfully in taking a wife.</hi> To the second and third he
said, <hi>If he were to live</hi> Methuselahs <hi>dayes, he would neither use the Latine Service, nor
be present at Masse, which he counted abominable.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He suffered Martyrdom and is burnt in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>
                  </note> Upon these answers he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
degraded, and put in the hands of the secular Magistrate, who the next
morning being the 21. of <hi>November,</hi> caused him to be burnt in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> Thus
ended that worthy Minister and Martyz of Christ, of whom I thought fit in this
place to say so much, though his sufferings fell out some years after.</p>
               <p>The summer following about the beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> the absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

it was said, <hi>remittimus crimen irremissibile,</hi> we remit a crime which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
refused to accept the same. It was answered that such a clause was insert
only for aggravating the crime, and that the absolution was in it self valid enough.
But they would not be satisfied;<note place="margin">The Castle of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> again besieged at the coming of the <hi>French</hi> Gallies.</note> and so complaining that promise was not kept with

               <p>In the end of the same moneth there arrived twenty one Gallies sent from
<hi>France,</hi> under the command of <hi>Leon Strozius,</hi> within sight of the Castle. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50008:57"/>
arriving, came with such diligence, as divers who belonged to the Castle, being in
the City, had no leisure to re enter; and some who were gone thither for private
businesse, were forced to stay within. Shortly after his coming, the siege was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by sea and land, trenches cast, and the Canons planted, some in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
steeple, some in S. <hi>Salvators,</hi> and some in the street that leads to the Castle.</p>
               <p>Then began the battery both by sea and land,<note place="margin">The Castle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by land and sea.</note> but that of the sea did not great
harm. The siege continuing all the moneth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> upon the twenty nineth day in
the South-quarter (on which the Canon had played furiously that morning) a great
breach was made; this terrifying the defendants, who to that time shewed great
courage, expecting reliefe from <hi>England,</hi> (and indeed a navall Army was prepared
to come, but King <hi>Henry</hi> dying about the same time, it was stayed) beside the danger
they apprehended of the breach, the plague within the house was hot, &amp; thereof eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day a number died: So perceiving no help, and the sickness increasing, they came
to a capitulation, where it was agreed, that the lives of all within the Castle should
be saved,<note place="margin">The Castle reduced upon capitulation.</note> the Principals transported unto <hi>France,</hi> and if they liked not to remain

who sent his men to receive the prisoners, and make spoile of all that was in the
house. They found of victuals great store, wherewith they furnished the Gallies.
But the Cardinals treasure and household-stuffe, which was very precious, pleased
them better. All this with the wealth the defendants had (for they had brought
all their substance thither) fell into the hands of the <hi>French;</hi> the fourth or fifth day
after the Gallies put to Sea, and about the midst of <hi>August</hi> arrived safe at <hi>Roan</hi> in
<hi>Normandy,</hi> where some of the prisoners were incarcerated; others detained all the

               <p>This revenge taken of the Cardinals death,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> gave the Priests some satisfaction,

sent Proclamations through the countrey, charging all that could bear Armes,
to meet at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for the defence of the Realm; many of all sorts assembled,

who was a Nobleman well inclined,<note place="margin">His letter to the Governour and Nobility.</note> and hated the shedding of blood, to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Governour and Nobility, intreating them to consider, <q>That both the
Armies consisted of Christian men, who above all things, (if they were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
of their profession) ought to wish peace and quietnesse, and have in detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
warre, and unjust force; as likewise to remember that the cause of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
invasion did not proceed from covetousnesse or malice, but from the desire
of a perpetual peace, which could not be so firmly made up by any mean, as by
marriage, which they knew was promised, and by the publick consent of the
whole Estates ratified, upon conditions more beneficial to the <hi>Scots</hi> then to
the <hi>English,</hi> insomuch that they were called not unto a servitude, but unto a
common fellowship, and a liberal communication of all their fortunes, which
could not but be more commodious to the <hi>Scots,</hi> then to the <hi>English;</hi> the hope
of advantage, and the fear of injuries being alwayes greater from the party that is
more strong, to that which is the weaker: And for the businesse in hand, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
them to consider this especially, that seeing there was a necessity of giving
their Queen in marriage to some man, if they did either respect their profit or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
they could not make a better choice, then of a King their neighbour, born
in the same Isle. joyned in propinquity of blood, instructed in the same lawes,
educated in the same manners and language, superiour in riches, and in all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

peace,<note place="margin">An. 1548.</note> together with the oblivion of ancient grudges, and hatreds. For
should they take a stranger to be their King, differing from themselves in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
manners, and lawes; great evils and discommodities could not but arise,
as they might know by that which had fallen out in the like case to other nations,
by whose ensample he wished they should be made wise. As for the part of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he said if they did find the minds of the <hi>Scots</hi> not estranged from peace, they
would remit somewhat of their right, and be contented that the young Queen
should be kept amongst themselves, untill she were fit for marriage, and might
chuse a husband to her self by advice of the Nobility; during which time, all
hostility should cease betwixt the two Kingdomes, it being provided that the
Queen should not be sent to any forain countrey, nor contracted in marriage
with the <hi>French</hi> King, nor any other Prince: which if the <hi>Scots</hi> would faithfully
promise, he would presently retire with his Army, and recompense all injuries
done since his coming into <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the sight and estimation of honest men.</q>

believing this to be the effect of the letter, became mightily incensed. Nor did any

counsel what should be done with the young Queen, concluded to send her to

               <p>Hereupon the next summer arrived at <hi>Leith</hi> three thousand <hi>Germanes</hi> under the

Monsieur de Mallery, and <hi>Monsieur d' Ossel, Monsieur d' Esse</hi> being General

Army, he beleaguered the Town of <hi>Haddington,</hi> which the <hi>English</hi> had at that time
made very strong. The Nobility being there convened, entered of new into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
touching the young Queen, and the course that should be taken with her.

                  </note> which the Queen her Mother longed to have done. The Noblemen
were not of one minde, for such as favoured the reformation, were of opinion that
the conditions offered by <hi>England</hi> (which were then come to light) should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
because that would bring with it ten years of peace at least; in which time,
if either King <hi>Edward of England,</hi> or the young Queen should depart this life, all
things would return to their first estate: and if no such things happened, yet the
Kingdome being at rest, and freed of the present troubles would grow to some bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ease within it self, and they might more maturely advise what course was fittest
to be taken: <q>Delay, they said, in matters of such consequence was safest, and that
precipitation might bring with it a suddain, but untimely repentance.</q> The rest
stood all for the <hi>French,</hi> most of them being corrupted with gold, and others with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50008:58"/>
large promises.<note place="margin">An. 1550.</note> The Governour himself had an annuity promised of twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
francks, and a company of men at Armes, to the Earle of <hi>Arran</hi> his sonne.
All these pretending the safety of the young Queen, did reason that there was no
other way to be rid of the <hi>English</hi> warres, but that one: For as long as the <hi>English</hi>
have any hope, said they, to speed, they will still be troubling; but when they shall
see the Queen gone, and that there is no remedy, they will cease from their pursuit.
The greatest number inclining that way, it was concluded that the young Queen
should be conveyed to <hi>France.</hi> Shortly after, the <hi>French</hi> Navy that lay at <hi>Leith,</hi>
giving out that they were to return home, compassing the North Isles, received

going through the countrey with <hi>Iustice Courts,</hi> (as they call them) vexed the
people mightily; and whereas during the warre men enjoyed the liberty of their
profession, a new persecution was raised, which took the beginning at one <hi>Adam
Wallace</hi> a simple man, but very zealous in his Religion; he was taken at <hi>Winton</hi> in
<hi>Lothian</hi> by the Bishops direction, and brought to his trial in the Church of <hi>Black

                     <hi>Adam Wallace</hi> accused of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</note> the Earles of <hi>Angus, Huntley, Glaincarne,</hi> and divers others of

Purgatory;</hi> fourthly, <hi>for maintaining that prayers made to the Saints, and for the
dead were meerly superstitious;</hi> and fifthly, <hi>for calling the Masse an idolatrous service,
and affirming that the bread and wine in the Sacrament of the Altar, after the words of
consecration, remained bread and wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the first he answered,<note place="margin">His answer.</note> 
                  <hi>That he never judged himselfe worthy of so excellent a
vocation as is the calling of a Preacher, nor did he ever presume to preach; onely he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
that in some private places he did read a part of the Scripture at times, and make a
short exhortation thereupon to those that would hear him.</hi> It being replied that he
ought not to have medled with the Scriptures; he said, <hi>That he esteemed it the duty of
every Christian to seek the knowledge of Gods word, and the assurance of his own salvation,
which was not to be found but in the Scriptures.</hi> One that stood by saying, What then
shall be left to the Bishops and Churchmen to do, if every man should be a babler
upon the Bible?<note place="margin">History of the Church.</note> he answered, <hi>It becomes you to speak more reverently of God and of his
blessed word; and if the Iudge did right, he would punish you for your blasphemy: But to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50008:58"/>
your question. I say, that albeit you and I and five thousand mo would read the Bible, and
conferre together upon it, yet we leave more to the Bishops to do, then either they will do or
can; for we leave to them the preaching of the Gospel of Christ, and the feeding of the
flock, which he hath redeemed by his own blood, which is a burthen heavy enough; neither
do we them any wrong in working out our own salvation so farre as we may.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the second he answered, <hi>That it was as lawful for him to baptize his own childe,
since he could not have a true Minister, as it was to</hi> Abraham <hi>to circumcise</hi> Ismael <hi>and his
family.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the third and fourth heads, more generally he said, <hi>That he never believed nor
maintained any thing, but that he found in the book hanging at his girdle:</hi> which was
the Bible in <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>English.</hi> And being urged to be more particular,
he answered, <hi>That if he were disposed to speak of these matters, he would require a more
upright and indifferent Iudge.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> upon that, saying he was a fool to
desire another Judge then the Governour, and the Bishops there present; he replied,
<hi>That the Bishops could not be his Iudges, because they were open enemies to the doctrine he
professed. And for the Governour, he doubted if he had the knowledge to discern lies from
truth, and the inventions of men from the true worship of God. The Iudge that he desired,</hi>
he said, <hi>was the book of God, by which if he should be convinced to have taught, spoken, or
done in matters of Religion, any thing that was repugnant to the will of God, he would not
refuse to die; but if he tried innocent, and was found not to have spoken or done any thing
contrary thereto, then he desired the protection of the Governour and Nobility, against
the Tyranny of malicious men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being enquired what he did think of the Masse,<note place="margin">Acts of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</note> he said, <hi>That he had read the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in three languages, and had never found the word</hi> Masse <hi>in them all, and that the thing
which was in greatest estimation with men, was nothing but abomination in the sight of
God.</hi> Then did all the company cry out, <hi>Heresie, heresie, let him be condemned.</hi> So
the poor man was sentenced to be an heretick, and put in the hands of Sir <hi>Iohn
Campbel</hi> of <hi>Lundie,</hi> Justice deputy, who having adjudged him to die, sent him back
to prison, because the night was coming on; all that night he spent in singing of
Psalmes, which he had learned by heart, and the next day was led forth to the fire,
which was prepared in the Castle hill, being inhibited to speak unto the people; yet
when he came to the place of execution, he intreated the beholders, <hi>Not to offend
with the truth because of his sufferings,</hi> saying, <hi>The disciple is not above his Master:</hi> and
as he was proceeding, the Provost of the Town who had the oversight of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
did interrupt him, saying, that he would not be permitted to speak to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
whereupon having in some few words commended his soul to God, he took
his death most patiently.</p>
               <p>The same year there arose a great contention amongst the Churchmen,<note place="margin">A contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among Churchmen for saying of <hi>Pater noster.</hi>
                  </note> for
saying the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> upon this occasion. One <hi>Richard Marshal,</hi> Prior of the <hi>Black
Friers</hi> at <hi>Newcastle</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> had been in S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and in one of his Sermons
taught, that the <hi>Pater noster should be said unto God only, and not unto the Saints.</hi> Some
Doctors of the University taking exception against his doctrine, stirred up a <hi>Gray
Frier</hi> called Frier <hi>Tottis</hi> to confute him, and prove that the <hi>Pater noster</hi> might be
said unto the Saints. The Frier, an audacious and ignorant fellow, took the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand and reading his text out of the fifth of S. <hi>Matthewes</hi> Gospel,<note place="margin">The foolish preaching of a Frier in Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> upon this subject.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are
the poor in spirit, for unto them belongeth the kingdome of heaven,</hi> gathered upon it,
that the <hi>Pater noster</hi> might be said to <hi>Saints,</hi> because all the <hi>Petitions</hi> in the prayer,
said he, appertain to the <hi>Saints:</hi> for if we meet an old man in the street, we will
say, <hi>Good morrow Father,</hi> much more in our prayers may we call the <hi>Saints</hi> our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi>
and seeing we grant they are in <hi>heaven,</hi> we may say to every one of them, <hi>Our
Father which art in heaven.</hi> Then we know, said he, God hath made their <hi>names holy,</hi>
so we may say to any of the Saints, <hi>Hallowed be thy name.</hi> And as they are in the
<hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> so that <hi>Kingdome</hi> is theirs by <hi>possession;</hi> therefore when we
pray for the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> we may say to any of them, <hi>Thy kingdome come.</hi> In
like manner, except <hi>their will</hi> had been the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they had never come to that
<hi>Kingdome;</hi> therefore seeing <hi>their</hi> will is <hi>Gods</hi> will, we may say to every one of
them, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> But when he came to the fourth Petition, he was much
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50008:59"/>
troubled to find a colour for it,<note place="margin">An. 1543.</note> confessing it was not in the <hi>Saints</hi> power to <hi>give us
daily bread;</hi> yet they may <hi>pray,</hi> said he, to <hi>God</hi> for us, that <hi>he will give us our daily
bread.</hi> The like glosse he made upon the rest of the Petitions, but with so little sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the hearers, as they all fell a laughing, and the children meeting him in
the streets, did cry and call him, <hi>Frier Pater noster,</hi> whereof he grew so ashamed,
that he left the City.</p>
               <p>Yet in the University,<note place="margin">Acts of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. p. 1274.</note> the contention ceased not, whereupon the Doctors did
assemble to dispute, and decide the question. In that meeting, some held that the
<hi>Pater noster</hi> was said to God, <hi>Formaliter,</hi> and to Saints <hi>Materialiter;</hi> others not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the distinction, said that the <hi>Pater noster</hi> ought to be said to God <hi>Principaliter,</hi>
and to Saints <hi>minus Principaliter;</hi> others would have it <hi>Ultimate, &amp; non ultimate:</hi>
others <hi>Primariò, &amp; secundariò</hi> and some (wherewith the most voices went) said that
the <hi>Pater noster</hi> should be said to God, <hi>Capiendo strictè,</hi> and to Saints, <hi>Capiendo largè.</hi>
Yet did they not setle upon the distinction; and after divers meetings, when they
could not agree by common consent, the decision was remitted to the Provincial
Synod, which was to meet at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>Ianuary</hi> following. A simple fellow that
served the Sub-prior in his chamber for the time, thinking there was some
great matter in hand, that made the Doctors to convene so often, asked him one
night as he went to bed,<note place="margin">A pleasant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and jest of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prliors servant.</note> what the matter was? The Sub-prior merrily answering,
<hi>Tom</hi> (that was the fellowes name) <hi>we cannot agree whom to the Pater noster should be
said;</hi> he suddainly replyed, <hi>Sir, whom to should it be said but unto God?</hi> then said the
Sub-prior, <hi>What shall we do with the Saints?</hi> he answered, <hi>Give them Ave's and
Creeds enow in the devils name, for that may suffice them.</hi> This answer going abroad,
many said, <hi>He hath given a wiser decision then all the Doctors had done with their
distinctions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Synod convened,<note place="margin">The decision of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Synod.</note> the question was again agitated, and after much
reasoning, the same being put to voices, it was found that the <hi>Pater noster might be
said unto the Saints.</hi> But the Bishops and such as had any judgement would not
suffer the conclusiou to be enacted, ordaining the Sub-prior at his return to S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
for setling the minds of people, to shew that the <hi>Pater noster ought to be said to
God, yet so that the Saints ought also to be invocated.</hi> And thus ended that conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In this meeting,<note place="margin">The Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme called The two-peny faith.</note> order was taken for publishing an <hi>English</hi> Catethisme, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a short explanation of the <hi>Commandements, Belief,</hi> and <hi>Lords Prayer;</hi> and the
Curates enjoyned to read a part thereof every Sunday and holy day to the people,
when there was no Sermon. This being imprinted, was sold for two pence, and
therefore called by the vulgar <hi>The two-peny faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The year following,<note place="margin">A Provincial Synod kept at <hi>Linlithgow.</hi>
                  </note> another Provincial Councel was kept at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> in
which the maintainers of any opinions contrary to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and the Decrees of the Councel of <hi>Tyent,</hi> made in the time of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the
third received. Some Acts were made for reforming corrupt lives of the Clergy,
but little or no execution followed; they to whom the correction belonged, being
themselves in the highest measure faulty and culpable.</p>
               <p>But the next year brought with it an alteration in both Kingdomes,<note place="margin">An. 1553.</note> to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
great content;<note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth of <hi>England,</hi> dieth</note> for in <hi>England</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt departed this life, a Prince
of rare piety, and the special comfort of those who professed the Reformed Religion;
in whose place Queen <hi>Mary</hi> succeded, one wholly devoted to the Pope and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
And at home the Governour was induced by <hi>Robert Carnegie</hi> (on whom he
relied much) and by <hi>Panter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queen Regent admitted to rule by dimis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Governour.</note> to dimit the Regencie to Queen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of whom the Clergy held themselves more assured. She following the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of her brother the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Cardinal of <hi>Loraine,</hi> set her self to
maintain Popish superstition at the uttermost, using lesse cruelty then did Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> but more policie, and to the same end. So as now the fear of change in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was gone, and the hopes quite dasht of those that sought Reformation; yet
the Lord by his providence did otherwise dispose things, and made that a mean to
advance Religion amongst us which men thought should be utterly extinguished;
for some of those that fled from Queen <hi>Maries</hi> persecution, taking their refuge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Kingdome, did not onely help to keep in the light which was begun
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50008:59"/>
to shine,<note place="margin">An. 1554.</note> but made the Sunne break up more cleare then before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Harlow</hi> a man of simple and mean condition, came first into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
he had served some years in the <hi>English</hi> Church with good approbation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>William Harlow</hi> a Minister.</note> and
was at this time very comfortable to the faithful.</p>
               <p>After him came <hi>Iohn Willock</hi> a <hi>Franciscan</hi> sometime in the Town of <hi>Aire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Willock</hi> a Convert.</note> who
for love of Religion had left the countrey, and lived in <hi>England;</hi> when the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
arose there, he fled into <hi>Embden</hi> in <hi>Friesland,</hi> where he professed Medicine,
and by that occasion was made known to <hi>Anna</hi> Countesse of <hi>Friesland,</hi> then a
widow, who employed him in a Commission to the Queen Regent, in the year
1554. His Commission giving him some liberty, he kept most company with those
he saw well affected in Religion; and during the time of his aboad, was a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager
of the professors. Returning the next year with commendatory letters
from the same Countesse to Queen Regent, he made his stay in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where
notwithstanding he was visited with an heavy sickness for divers moneths, he ceased
not daily to instruct and exhort such as came unto him, who were neither few,
nor of the meaner sort.</p>
               <p>In the end of the year <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> came into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> to whom many of good
note repaired; for he taught daily in the house of one <hi>Iames Sim</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where
he was secretly kept. In his teaching he laboured chiefly to inform his hearers, that
in no case it was lawful to be present at the Masse, or to partake of the Papistical
Sacraments.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> his conference with young <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence at the Masse.</note> 
                  <hi>William Maitland</hi> younger of <hi>Lethington,</hi> a man of good learning and
utterance, resorting often to his Sermons, and perceiving his vehemency in that
point, took occasion one day in the presence of his auditors to say, <q>That he did
not think his doctrine well grounded, and that wise men ought to serve the time,
and not expose their lives to unnecessary dangers, and so make themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to the Church. For even the Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> said he, to eschew the
tumult of the people at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> went into the Temple, and purified himself
with four men, that had a vow upon them, which otherwise then for eschewing
the present danger, he would not have done.</q> To this <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> answered, <hi>That
men ought so to serve the time, as they neglect not their obedience unto God, whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
how great soever the danger be, may not be transgressed. For the ensample
alledged,</hi> he said, <hi>the dissimilitude was great, seeing to go into the Temple to purifie and
pay vowes, was sometimes commanded by God himself, whereas the Masse from the first
invention of it was abominable idolatry, and never allowed of God.</hi> Further he said,
<hi>that it might justly be doubted, if either S.</hi> Pauls <hi>fact, or the advice that S.</hi> James <hi>and the
Elders of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>gave him had any good warrant, seeing the event proved not such
as they did promise to themselves;</hi> for S. <hi>Paul was so farre from purchasing thereby the
favour of the</hi> Jewes, <hi>as to the contrary they rising in a tumult, threw him forth of the
Temple, and had almost killed him; so as it seemed God did not allow his doing, for that it
served to confirm the obstinate</hi> Jewes <hi>in their superstition.</hi> By these and the like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to the rest of the allegations propounded, the hearers were so satisfied, as
they resolved to go no more to Masse, but to make an open separation, whose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample
divers others both of the Town and Countrey followed.</p>
               <p>This being observed by the Priests,<note place="margin">The Priests offended at the dishant of the Masse.</note> and others of the inferiour Clergy they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to the Bishops, and shewed how the Church-service was contemned, and
people drawn away to private conventicles. The Bishops meaning the case to the
Queen Regent, she was much commoved; yet advised them to use their own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and spare her for a little time, lest the Articles of the marriage which was
then treating betwixt her daughter and the <hi>Daulphine</hi> of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Diet deserted.</note> might receive
some crosse at the Convention of the Estates. Hereupon they took counsel to call
<hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> and summoned him to appear in the Church of <hi>Black friers</hi> at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
the fifteenth of <hi>May.</hi> But when the day came, they took a new device and
deserted the Diet, pretending some informality in the Summons; howbeit the
true cause was, that a number of Barons and Gentlemen were come to the Town
to assist him. After that time his preaching grew publick, and was more frequented
then before. The Earls of <hi>Glencarn</hi> and <hi>Marshall,</hi> repaired daily thereto, and were so
taken with his Sermons, as they did counsell him to write unto the Queen Regent,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50008:60"/>
and intreat her to make a Reformation of the Church;<note place="margin">An. 1556.</note> which he did; the letter was
delivered by the Earle of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> but she calling it a Pasquill, gave the same to
the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and made no more accompt thereof. This is that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which was afterwards published in Print, and intituled, <hi>A letter to Queen
Dowager.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Letters about the same time were brought to <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> from the <hi>English</hi>
Church at <hi>Geneva,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He goeth to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </note> declating that they had elected him to be their Preacher, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing
him to come and accept the Charge. This letter he communicated with
those that were his ordinary auditors; and when he saw them exceedingly grieved
for his departing, gave his promise to return, how soon they should finde it
fit to recall him.</p>
               <p>Soon after he took leave of them and went to his journey,<note place="margin">He is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, and burnt <hi>in effigie.</hi>
                  </note> but was not well
gone, when upon a new citation directed by the Clergy (because he appeared not)
he was condemned for an heretick, and burnt <hi>in effigie,</hi> at the Mercat-crosse of
<hi>Edinburgh;</hi> This was done in the moneth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1556. the copy of the sentence
being sent unto him, he published an Apology, intituling it <hi>An appellation from the
Clergy to the Nobility and Commons of</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>This year many prodigious signes were observed: A Comet of that kind, which
the Astronomers call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Divers prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious signes.</note> the vulgars a firie Bissome, shined the whole moneths
of <hi>November, December,</hi> and <hi>Ianuary;</hi> great Rivers in the middest of winter dried
up, and in the summer swelled so high, as divers Villages were therewith drowned,
and numbers of cattel feeding in the valley grounds carried to the sea; Whales of
a huge greatnesse were cast out into sundry parts of the River of <hi>Forth;</hi> hailstones
of the bignesse of a Doves egge falling in many parts, destroyed abundance of
Cornes; and, which was most terrible, a firie Dragon was seen to flie low upon the
earth, vomiting forth fire both in the day and night season; which lasted a long
time, and put the people to a necessity of watching their houses and Corn-yards.
These direful signes (as every man is led by his fancy to presage) were taken by
some to be progonosticks of great troubles that should ensue upon the Match with
<hi>France;</hi> others said that thereby was signified some great change in the estate of
the Church.</p>
               <p>And indeed after this the estimation of the Clergy daily diminished,<note place="margin">The esteem of the Clergy decayeth.</note> and divers
of that number relinquishing their order, made open profession of the truth. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Iohn Dowglas,</hi> a <hi>Carmelite Frier,</hi> forsaking his Order, became a Chaplain to the Earl
of <hi>Argyle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Iohn Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las a Carmelite</hi> forsaketh his Order.</note> who resided then at Court, and spoke openly in his Sermons against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

the doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and submit themselves to the doctrine of <hi>Christ.</hi> And
in all the parts of the countrey, some were daily breaking forth, especially from
the Cloisters; and declaiming against the corruptions of the Church. The Bishops
perceiving it would be to no purpose to convene the Preachers before themselves
for heresie, moved the Queen Regent to call them before the Councell for raising
mutinies, and stirring up people to sedition, hoping that way at least to restrain
their publick teaching:<note place="margin">The Preachers cited before the Councel.</note> but at the day appointed for their appearance, such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of people did accompany them, as it was held safest not to call them till the
multitude was disperst; and for that effect a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was given out, charging
all persons that were come to the Town without licence of the Authority,<note place="margin">A Proclamaon for the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
immediately to the borders, and attend the Lieutenant in the service against

of the West countrey,<note place="margin">The Gentlemen of the West complain of their oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> who were but lately returned from the
same service esteeming this a sort of oppression, went in a tumult to the Palace,
and entering the Queens Privy chamber, complained of the unreasonable Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
that was sent forth. The Queen began to excuse the matter, and shew the
necessity of their attendance for some short time, but they would not be satisfised;
And one <hi>Iames Chalmers</hi> of <hi>Gaitgirth,</hi> a froward and furious man, stepping forward,
said, <hi>We know Madam that this is the device of the Bishops who stand by you; we avow to
God it shall not go so, they oppresse us and our poor tenants for feeding their idle bellies,
they trouble our Preachers, and seek to undoe them and us all; we will not suffer it any

longer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 1558.</note> And with those words, every man made to his weapon. The Queen being
extremely feared, gave them many good words, praying them to use no violence,
and saying, that she meant no ill to their Preachers; that she would hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
betwixt the Bishops and them; and that the present Diet with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
given out should be discharged: so the force ceased, and all was quiet for
that time.</p>
               <p>Not long after,<note place="margin">Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners chosen for the young Queens mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the <hi>Daulphin.</hi>
                  </note> there arrived a messenger from the <hi>French</hi> King with letters to
the Nobility, desiring that the marriage should be consummated betwixt the
young Queen, and the <hi>Daulphin</hi> his son, and that certain Commissioners should be
sent to assist the solemnity. A convention of Estates being called to this purpose in
<hi>December</hi> following, choice was made of eight persons to go in that journey; for
the spiritual Estate were named <hi>Iames Beaton</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and <hi>Iames
Stewart</hi> Prior of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> base brother to the young Queen; For the Nobility,
<hi>Gilbert Kennedy</hi> Earl of <hi>Cassils, George Lesley</hi> Earle of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> Lord <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming;</hi>
For the Burrowes, <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> Provost of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Ares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi>
of <hi>Dun</hi> Provost of <hi>Montrosse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great dysasters that happened both in their going and returning,<note place="margin">The misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in that voyage.</note> brought
many to think the marriage would not prove happy, and prosperous. For having
shipped at <hi>Leith</hi> in the moneth of <hi>February,</hi> they were dispersed by a mighty tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
and one of their vessels that carried their horses, cast away at S. <hi>Ebbes</hi> head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they left the <hi>Scottish</hi> shore; another wherein the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and Bishop of
<hi>Orkney</hi> sailed, with all the furniture for the marriage (which was very rich and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
perished upon the coast of <hi>France,</hi> nigh unto <hi>Bulloign,</hi> the Earl and Bishop hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
escaping by the shipboat, which carried them to land. Neither had they any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fortune in their return homewards; for at <hi>Deep,</hi> divers of the chief persons fell
sick and died. The Bishop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> a man of singular wisdome and experience,
(who in his time had performed many honourable ambassages, to the credit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of his countrey) ended there his life the 14. of <hi>September,</hi> 1558. the Earl of
<hi>Rothes</hi> died two-dayes after him, and the Earl of <hi>Cassils</hi> Thesaurer of the Realm,
a vertuous Nobleman, went the same way. The Lord <hi>Fleming</hi> a brave young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> suspecting some contagion, and deceased in <hi>December</hi>
following. These deaths falling out so suddainly together, bred a suspicion in many
that they were made away by poison: which was the rather believed, because the
<hi>French</hi> King was known to be displeased for their refuse of the matrimonial Crown
to his son; however it was, the apprehension taken therefore, begate a great hatred
of the <hi>French</hi> amongst the people of this Realme.</p>

and answer, for you keep my Lord here too long;</hi> he notthelesse continued in his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that done he arose, and said, <hi>he ought to obey God more then man; I serve a
mightier Lord then your Lord is. And where you call me</hi> Sir Walter, <hi>they call me</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>and not</hi> Sir Walter; <hi>I have been too long one of the</hi> Popes Knights: <hi>now say what
you have to say.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:50008:61"/>Oliphant <hi>then began with this question,</hi> What thinkest thou of Priests marriage? <hi>He
answered,</hi> I esteem it a blessed bond, ordained by God, approved by Christ, and made free
to all sorts of men; but you abhorre it, and in the mean time take other mens wives and
daughters, you vow chastity, and keep it not.</p>
               <p>Oliphant <hi>proceeding said,</hi> Thou sayest that there is not seven Sacraments. <hi>He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,</hi>
Give me the Lords Supper, and Baptisme, and take you the rest and part them
amongst you.</p>
               <p>Oliphant. <hi>Thou sayest that</hi> the Masse is idolatry. <hi>He answered,</hi> A Lord sendeth
and calleth many to his dinner, and when it is ready ringeth the Bell, and they come into
the Hall, but he turning his back upon the guests, eateth all himself, giving them no part;
and so do you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliph.</hi> Thou deniest the Sacrament of the Altar to be the body of Christ really in flesh
and blood. <hi>He answered,</hi> The Scripture is not be taken carnally, but spiritually; and your
Masse is wrong: for Christ was once offered on the Crosse for mans sin, and will never be
offered again, for then he put end to all sacrifices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliph.</hi> Thou deniest the office of the Bishop. <hi>He answered,</hi> I affirm they whom you
call Bishops, do not Bishops works, nor use the Offices of Bishops, but live after their own
sensual pleasures, taking no care for the flock, nor yet regarding the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliph.</hi> Thou speakest against pilgrimage, and callest it a pilgrimage to whoredome.
<hi>He answered,</hi> I say that pilgrimage is not commanded in the Scripture, and that there is
no greater whoredome in any place then at your pilgrimages, except it be in the common
brothels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliph.</hi> Thou preachest privately in houses, and sometimes in the fields. <hi>He answered,</hi>
Yea man, and upon the sea too, when I am sailing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliph.</hi> If thou wilt not recant thy opinions, I will pronounce sentence against thee.
<hi>He answered,</hi> I know I must die once, therefore as Christ said to <hi>Judas, Quod facis
fac citò;</hi> you shall know that I will not recant the truth, for I am corn, and no chaffe; I
will neither be blowne away with the wind, nor burst with the flaile, but will abide both.
<hi>These answers he gave with a great boldnesse, to the admiration of all that were
present.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then did <hi>Oliphant</hi> pronounce sentence,<note place="margin">Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against <hi>Walter Mill.</hi>
                  </note> ordaining him to be delivered to the
temporal Judge, and burnt as an heretick; but because no man could be found to
supply the place of a Judge, (for <hi>Patrick Lermond</hi> Bailiffe of the Regalty did abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
refuse) nor in the whole City so much as a cord to be had for money to tye
him,<note place="margin">The Bailiffe of the Regality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth to be Judge.</note> after he should be condemned, his life for one day was prolonged. The next
morning one of the Archbishops domesticks called <hi>Alexander Somervaile,</hi> a wicked
and flagitious man, supplying the place of the temporal Judge, condemned him to
the fire; and because no cords could be had, the ropes of the Archbishops Pavilion
were taken to serve the purpose.</p>
               <p>As the time of his suffering drew near,<note place="margin">His constancie at his suffering.</note> his constancy and courage still encreased;
for being conveyed to the fire with a number of armed men, when he was come to
the place, and the Priest <hi>Oliphant</hi> did command him to go to the stake, he said, <hi>No,
I will not go, except thou put me up with thy hand; for by the law of God I am forbidden
to put hands in my self, but wilt thou put to thy hand and take part of my death, thou shalt
see me go up gladly.</hi> Then <hi>Oliphant</hi> putting him forward, he went up with a chearful
countenance, saying, <hi>Introibo ad altare Dei;</hi> and desired he might be permitted to
speak to the people. <hi>Oliphant,</hi> and the executioners said, that he had spoken too
much, and that the Bishops were offended with the delay. Yet some youths that
stood by, willed him to speak what he pleased, giving the executioners and Bishops
both to the devil. So after he had made his prayer upon his knees he arose, and
standing upon the coales, spake to the people a few words to this effect. <q>Dear
friends, the cause why I suffer this day, is not for any crime laid to my charge,
though I acknowledge my self a miserable sinner before God, but only for the
defence of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> set forth in the old and new Testaments: for which as
many faithful Martyrs have offered their lives most gladly, being assured after
their death to enjoy endlesse felicity; so this day I praise God, that he hath called
me of his mercy amongst the rest of his servants, to seal up his truth with my
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50008:61"/>
life, which as I have received of him, so willingly I offer it to his glory. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as you would escape eternal death, be no more seduced with the lyes of the
Priests, Monks, Friers, Priors, Abbots, Bishops, and the rest' of the sect of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist;
but depend onely upon <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and his mercy, that you may be
delivered from condemnation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The multitude that lookt on made a great lamentation,<note place="margin">The people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at his speeches.</note> for they were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
moved with his words. When the fire was kindled, and began to flame, he
cried, <hi>Lord have mercy on me, pray good people whilest there is time;</hi> and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
shewing a wonderful courage and resolution of spirit. The Citizens took
his death so grievously, that lest it should be forgotten, they made up a great heap
of stones in the place where his body was burnt; and when the Priests had caused
the heap twice or thrice to be carried away, denouncing such as should bring any
stones thither accursed; still it was renewed, untill watches were appointed to see
who they were, that brought any stones to the place, and charge given to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them. The Epitaph made upon him is worthy the inserting.</p>

the very death of Popery in this Realme; for thereby the minds of men were so

themselves by promise and subscription to oaths, if any should be called in question
for matters of Religion at any time after, they should take up Armes, and join
in defence of their brethren against the tyrannous persecution of the Bishops.</p>
               <p>The work of Reformation did hereupon take a beginning,<note place="margin">The worthy men that lived in this time.</note> the story whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

so farre as I have been enformed or learned by diligent search.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>David Lindsay</hi> of <hi>Mont</hi> shall first be named,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>David Lindesay</hi> of the <hi>Mont.</hi>
                  </note> a man honourably descended,
and greatly favoured by King <hi>Iames</hi> the first. Besides his knowledge and deep
judgement in Heraldry (whereof he was the chief) and in other publick affairs, he
was most religiously inclined, but much hated by the Clergy, for the liberty he used
in condemning the superstition of the time, and rebuking their loose and dissolute
lives. Notthelesse he went unchallenged, and was not brought in question; which
shewed the good account wherein he was held. Divers poesies he wrote in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tongue, which gave evidence of his quicknesse of wit, and the knowledge he
had in histories. In the beginning of the Governours Regencie, he did attend him
till the Governour misled by ill counsel, made his authority subject to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal.
After that time he lived for the most part private, and died in a good age, the
Queen Regent having the administration of affairs.</p>
               <p>Next to him shall be remembred Mr. <hi>Patrick Cockburn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Patrick Cockburn.</hi>
                  </note> a Gentleman of the
house of <hi>Langton,</hi> in the <hi>Merss;</hi> this man having attained by his studies to great
learning, lived a long time in the University of <hi>Paris</hi> well esteemed. What course he
took afterwards I know not, nor where he died; but by the Treatises yet extant
that he wrote, it appeareth that he was a man of good learning, and a favourer of
the truth.</p>
               <p>The third shall be <hi>Iohn Mackbrair</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Galloway,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brair.</note> who forsaking the

as Minister. Afterwards called by some occasion to the charge of a Church in
the lower <hi>Germany,</hi> he continued there the rest of his dayes. Some Homilies he left
upon the Prophecie of <hi>Hosea,</hi> and an History of the beginning and progresse of the
<hi>English Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these I shall adde our countreyman <hi>Robert Wachop,</hi>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50008:62"/>
an adversary to the truth,<note place="margin">An. 1130.</note> seeing by his vertue and learning he purchased both cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and dignity in forain parts; and, which almost exceedeth beliefe, being blind
from his very birth, onely by learning the lessons and conferences of learned men,
he grew to such knowledge, as in the University of <hi>Paris</hi> none of the Doctors
was held more learned, nor had a more frequent auditory: being afterward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to the Archbishoprick of <hi>Armach</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he was employed in divers le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to the Emperour, and King of <hi>France</hi> by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, which he
discharged with such prudence, as he came to be greatly esteemed with all the
Princes to whom he was known. At last in his return homewards from <hi>Rome,</hi> in the
year 1551. he died at <hi>Paris,</hi> much lamented of all that University.</p>
               <p>Coming now to set down the Catalogue of Bishops in the rest of the Sees, I

third King of <hi>Picts,</hi> about the year 729. to the memory of S <hi>Columbe,</hi> in which the
<hi>Culdees</hi> were placed; King <hi>David</hi> in the year 1130. did erect it to be a Bishops See;
and recommending one <hi>Gregorius</hi> to the place, obtained Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third
his confirmation thereof;<note place="margin">The succeessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bishops in that See.</note> he sate 42. years, and was much favoured by that good
King. The lands of <hi>Anchtertaile,</hi> with divers others appertaining to that See, were
of King <hi>David</hi> his gift. This Bishop diet at <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> in the year 1169.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Richard,</hi> Chaplain to King <hi>William,</hi> was elected in his place, and consecrated
in S. <hi>Andrews</hi> upon the vigils of S. <hi>Laurrence</hi> by <hi>Richard</hi> Bishop of S. <hi>Andrews.</hi> This
Bishop was commended for vindicating the Church of <hi>Abercorne</hi> forth of the
hands of a laick person named <hi>Iohn Avonele,</hi> who claimed the Patronage thereof;
he sate four years, and dying at <hi>Crawmold,</hi> was buried in S. <hi>Colmes Inche</hi> in the
year 1173.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Cormacus</hi> succeeded in his place, to whom King <hi>William</hi> gave the lands of
<hi>Dalgathy;</hi> he died in the year 1177.</p>
                  <p>4. In his place was chosen <hi>Walter de Bidden,</hi> who was Chancellour to King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi>
but he lived not many years.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Iohn Scot</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man born, being Archdeacon of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> had been ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Bishop of that See, but that his election being withstood by the King as we
shewed before, he was after <hi>Biddens</hi> death promoved by the Popes consent to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keld;</hi>
a man that made conscience of his charge, and was painful in his office. The
countrey of <hi>Argyle</hi> was at that time of the Dioces of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> the people whereof
did only speak <hi>Irish,</hi> and neither understood the Bishop, nor he them. Upon this he
travelled to have the Dioces divided, and <hi>Argyle</hi> erected into an Episcopal See; and
to that effect sent a letter to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the third, intreating that one <hi>Eval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
his Chaplain, who could speak <hi>Irish,</hi> a wise and godly person, might have the
charge of that part committed to him; for, <hi>How,</hi> said he, <hi>can I make an accompt to
the Iudge of the world in the last day, when I cannot be understood of them, whom I teach?
The maintenance is sufficient for two Bishops, if we be not prodigal of the patrimony of
Christ, and will live with that moderation, which becometh his servants; it shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be much better to diminish the charge, and increase the number of able workmen in the
Lords field.</hi> The Pope reading the letter, and considering how earnest he was to be
eased of his charge, though to his own temporal losse, said, <hi>It is the study of others to
enlarge their bounds and livings, not caring how it goeth with the people, and here is one
that requesteth his Benefice may be parted in two. O how few Bishops are now in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world so disposed!</hi> and so commending greatly the Bishops disposition granted
his request, sending back <hi>Evaldus</hi> (for he was the messenger) consecrated Bishop
as was desired. The Bishop glad to have obtained his desire, entered <hi>Evaldus</hi> to the
charge, and followed diligently his own in that part which remained. Some few
dayes before his death, he rendred himself a Monk in <hi>Newbotle,</hi> and there departed
this life in the year 1203. his body was interred in the Quire of that Church upon

                  <p>6. After his death <hi>Richard Provand,</hi> King <hi>Williams</hi> Chaplain, was consecrated
Bishop, and lived a few years onely in the See, for he departed this world in the

                  <p>7. <hi>Iohn Leicester,</hi> cousen to King <hi>William,</hi> and elected successour, and dying at
<hi>Crawmond,</hi> was buried in <hi>Inchcolme</hi> with his predecessour in the year 1214.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Hugo,</hi> called <hi>Hugo de sigillo,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Aberbrothock,</hi> succeeded unto <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
a man of a sweet and amiable disposition, he was called <hi>the poor mans Bishop,</hi>
and lived not a year after his consecration.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Matthew</hi> Chancellour of <hi>Scotland</hi> was then elected, but he died the same year
before he was consecrated.</p>

died in the year 1236.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Galfrid Liverance</hi> was elected in his stead. This Bishop was a zealous man,
he reformed the service of the Church <hi>ad usum Sarum;</hi> and ordained the Chanons
to make residence at <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> giving them the Commons of that Church for their
entertainment. He died at <hi>Tibbermoore</hi> in the yeare 1249. and was buried at
<hi>Dunkeld.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. After <hi>Galfrids</hi> death <hi>Richard</hi> Chancellour to the King succeeded, and dying

for the King being in <hi>Ireland</hi> with an Army for the supply of his brother <hi>Edward,</hi>
the <hi>English</hi> taking advantage of his absence, sent two Armies to invade the kingdom;
the one by land, the other by sea. The Sea Army landed in <hi>Fife,</hi> near to <hi>Anchter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile,</hi>
(where the Bishop had his residence) which the Sheriffe of the countrey for
hindering their depredations went to encounter, but at the sight of their numbers
he gave back and fled; the Bishop hearing of their flight, brought forth his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
train, and casting himself in the Sheriffes way, asked why he fled: and having
checkt him bitterly for his cowardize, called for a lance, crying aloud, <hi>You that
love the honour of</hi> Scotland, <hi>follow me.</hi> By this forwardnesse he put such courage in
the rest, as they returning upon the <hi>English,</hi> did chase them all back to their ships,
one of the ship-boats overcharged with the company that leapt into it was sunk,
and in that conflict were drowned and slain 500. <hi>English</hi> and above. The honour
of this victory was wholly ascribed to the Bishops courage, for which he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
favoured by the King. He built in his time the Quire of <hi>Dunkeld</hi> from the ground,
which the Army of <hi>England</hi> had demolished; redeemed the lands of <hi>Green oke</hi> from
one <hi>Simon Cader,</hi> and gave to his Archdeacon the Church of <hi>Logia Leguhy,</hi> with the

things in his time to his Church, building and inlarging it at his own charge, and
acquired thereunto divers lands, as the town of <hi>Crawmond,</hi> with the lands adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for which he gave in excambion, the lands of <hi>Cambo</hi> in the same Parish, and
the lands of <hi>Muchler</hi> besides <hi>Dunkeld.</hi> He died the 16. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1436. and was
buried hononrably in S. <hi>Ninians</hi> Chappel of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> which himself had built.</p>
                  <p>21. To him succeeded <hi>Donald Macknachtan</hi> Dean of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> Doctor of the
Common law, and Nephew to Bishop <hi>Robert</hi> his predecessour; he was elected by the
Chapter, but King <hi>Iames</hi> the first misliking the choice, opposed his entry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he took journey to <hi>Rome</hi> to obtain his election confirmed, and died by the way
as he was travelling thither.</p>
                  <p>22. <hi>Iames Kennedy</hi> Nephew to King <hi>Iames</hi> the first by his sister, was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the See, two years he sate Bishop in <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> and was afterwards transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> as before we have shewed.</p>
                  <p>23. Upon his translation Mr. <hi>Alexander Lawder</hi> Parson of <hi>Rothow,</hi> and brother
germane to the Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> then Chancellour of the kingdome, was elected
Bishop, but he died the same year (which was the year 1440.) at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and
was buried with his Ancestors in the Church of <hi>Lawder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. Mr. <hi>Iames Bruce</hi> Parson of <hi>Killmeny,</hi> was after him consecrated Bishop of
<hi>Dunkeld</hi> at <hi>Dunfermlin</hi> the fourth of <hi>February</hi> in the year of Christ 1441. and sate
Bishop the space of 6. years. In the seventh year he was translated to the Bishoprick
of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and made Chancellour of the kingdome.</p>
                  <p>25. To him succeeded Mr. <hi>Iohn Ralston;</hi> he was Secretary to King <hi>Iames</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and sate Bishop little above three years, dying in <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> in the year 1450.
where he was buried.</p>
                  <p>26. Master <hi>Thomas Lawder,</hi> Preceptor or Master of <hi>Lowtrey,</hi> who had been Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
to Kings <hi>Iames</hi> the second in his youth, at the age of 60. years was elected
Bishop after <hi>Ralston</hi> by the Kings recommendation; he took great paines in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and by his continual exhortations and exemplary life, wonne that unruly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the obedience of God and the King. Having finished the building of the
Church, he dedicated the same in the year 1454. and adorned it in most magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
manner. He obtained of the King an erection of the Bishops lands on the
North side of <hi>Forth,</hi> into a Barony called <hi>the Barony of Dunkeld;</hi> as likewise the
lands in the South, into another which was called <hi>the Barony of Aberlady:</hi> built a
Bridge upon the River of <hi>Tay,</hi> nigh to his own Palace; founded a number of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanries,
and Prebends, partly in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> partly in <hi>Dunkeld;</hi> made purchase of
two lodgings, one in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and another at <hi>Perth,</hi> for the receipt of his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours:
and having done many good works, resigned his Bishoprick because of
his great age, to Master <hi>Iames Levinston</hi> Dean of <hi>Dunkeld.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. This resignation was crossed a while by <hi>Thomas Spence</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdene,</hi>
whose credit in the Court was great at that time, but upon transaction amongst
themselves, the Kings consent was obtained, and he consecrated at <hi>Dunkeld</hi> by <hi>Iohn
Hepburn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dumblaine, Iohn Balfour</hi> Bishop of <hi>Brichen,</hi> and the said <hi>Thomas
Spence</hi> in the year 1476. He sate seven years two moneths and five dayes, and dying
at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> was buried in the Isle of <hi>Inchcolme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. The Chapter after <hi>Levingstones</hi> decease made choice of <hi>Alexander Inglis</hi>
Dean of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> and Keeper of the Rolls in the time of King <hi>Iames</hi> the third, but
Pope <hi>Sextus</hi> the fourth cassing his election, gave the Bishoprick to <hi>George Brown</hi>
Chancellour of <hi>Aberdene</hi> (who was then at <hi>Rome</hi>) and consecrated him Bishop in
Saint <hi>Iames</hi> Church, <hi>Anno</hi> 1484. The King displeased with this promotion, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him rebel, and complained thereof to the Pope and Cardinals; but the Pope
maintaining his own gift, the King was afterwards reconciled to him, and he peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50008:63"/>
possessed in the Bishopricks.<note place="margin">An. 1010.</note> This Bishop was a strict observer of discipline,
and by his austere and rigorous formes wrought a great reformation in all the parts
of his Dioces, which he distributed in four Deanries, placing one in the Borders of
<hi>Atholl</hi> and <hi>Drumalbane,</hi> another in <hi>Fife, Fothrick,</hi> and <hi>Strathern,</hi> the third in <hi>Angus,</hi>
and the fourth in the parts besouth <hi>Forth.</hi> The penalties of offenders he gave to
the use of the Church where they resided, saying commonly, <hi>Oleum peccatorum non
impinguet caput meum.</hi> He was a man given much to hospitality, and withall very
careful of the Church, for he recovered to the See the lands of <hi>Fordel</hi> and <hi>Muckarsie,</hi>
with the Forest of <hi>Birnan,</hi> that had been alienated before his time, founded divers
Prebends and Chaplanries, and gave many ornaments to the Cathedral Church.
Before his death he was tormented with the Felt gravel, which he bare most patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
professing that <hi>he was glad to endure those pains as serving to wean his heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from the love of this world;</hi> and so departed this life most happily the twelfth
of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1514.</p>
                  <p>29. <hi>Andrew Stewart</hi> brother to <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> was upon his death postulated
Bishop, but it took no effect, Master <hi>Gawan Douglas</hi> brother to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi>
and Provost of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> being preferred thereto by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the
tenth. This gift was quarrelled by the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> Governour, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
called in question for his traficking with <hi>Rome</hi> without licence; whereupon he
was committed and continued prisoner a whole year. Afterwards compounding
with <hi>Andrew Stewart,</hi> to whom he gave the Churches of <hi>Alight,</hi> and <hi>Cargill,</hi> he got
peaceable possession of the See; yet the troubles that followed in the countrey,
made him forsake the same, and undertake a journey to <hi>Rome.</hi> In his way thither he
died of the plague at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Savoy</hi> house in the year 1522. A man learned, wise,
and given to all vertue and goodnesse; some monuments of his engenie he left in
<hi>Scottish</hi> meeter which are greatly esteemed, especially his translation of <hi>Virgil</hi> his
books of <hi>AEneids.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. <hi>George Creighton</hi> succeeded, a man nobly disposed, and a great house-keeper,
but in matters of his calling not very skilled. In the question of Religion (which
was in his time severely agitated) he loved to have things calmly carried, but his
counsel took little place. It was he that said to one of his Vicars, whom he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
to leave his opinions, <hi>That he thanked God that he knew neither the Old nor
the New Testaments, and yet had prospered well enough all his dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. <hi>Robert Creighton</hi> his Nephew was preferred upon his death to the See, in
whose time fell out the reformation of the Church.</p>

                  <p>2. <hi>Donortius</hi> who succeeded him, lived Bishop 42. years, and was interred with

                  <p>3. <hi>Cormachus</hi> the third Bishop of this See governed the same 39. years, and was
buried likewise with his predecessors.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Nectanus</hi> succeeded; in his time King <hi>David</hi> did translate the See from <hi>Murth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack</hi>
to <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and gave to him and his successors the lands of old <hi>Aberdene, Sclaty,
Goull, Moorecroft, Kurmundy, Mowmenlach, Clat, Talynstine, Rayne, Dawyot,</hi> and
their Churches, with divers others lands, whereby the See was greatly enriched:
this Bishop died in the year 1154. having sate 14. years at <hi>Murthlack,</hi> and 17. at
<hi>Aberdene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. After the death of <hi>Nectanus,</hi> one <hi>Edward</hi> was promoved, who was greatly
favoured by <hi>Malcolme</hi> the fourth, called the Maiden, and was thought to
have perswaded the King to continue in his single life: he was the first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
that brought the Chanons to do ordinary service in the Church of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50008:64"/>
                     <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and died in the eleventh year after his consecration.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Matthew Kinninmouth</hi> Archdeacon of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> succeeded, a man famous for
learning, and other excellent vertues. In his time began the Cathedral Church of
<hi>Aberdene</hi> to be built unto the memory of S. <hi>Machar,</hi> to whom King <hi>Malcolme</hi>
gave the lands of <hi>Tuligreg, Fetternew, Invercrowden, Banchordeneif, Balhelvy,</hi> and
the Patronages of the Churches. He sate Bishop 34. years.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Iohn</hi> Prior of <hi>Kelso</hi> was next elected Bishop; this man is greatly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for liberality to the poor, and magnificence in the buildings and ornaments of
the Church; he died the next year after his consecration.</p>
                  <p>8. One <hi>Adam</hi> was assumed in his place rather for satisfying King <hi>Williams</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
then for any good affection born to the man by the rest of the Clergy; at
first he shewed no great care in his charge, giving himselfe wholly to temporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires;
yet after King <hi>Williams</hi> death, he grew quite another man, setting himself
to amend his former negligences. He sate 21. years.</p>
                  <p>9. Upon his death the Clergy and people of <hi>Aberdene</hi> postulated <hi>Matthew</hi>
Chancellour of the kingdome, who was willing to accept the place, but <hi>Dunkeld</hi>
falling void in the mean season, King <hi>Alexander</hi> the second preferred him to
that See.</p>
                  <p>10. And <hi>Gilbert Striveling</hi> a man well born, and much esteemed for his integrity
of life, obtained the place, but he lived not many years, departing this world in the
eleventh year after his election.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Radolph</hi> Abbot of <hi>Aberbrothotk</hi> succeeded, being with an uniform consent
of the Clergy and people elected Bishop; he was brought with great difficulty to
accept the charge; a man of great prudence, and painful in his calling: for he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
through all his Dioces on foot, preaching and visiting the Churches, that he
might know their true estate; and is said never to have changed his form of living
that he used in the Cloister, and to have been more abstinent and sparing both in
diet and apparel, then he was before; he died some eight years after his consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was about the year of Christ, 1247.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Peter Ramsay,</hi> a man of good learning, was next chosen Bishop; he was a
man very kind to the Chanons, and parted many of his rents amongst them; he
sate Bishop ten years, and deceased about the seventh or eighth year of King <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the third his reign.</p>
                  <p>13. Presently after his death <hi>Richard Pottock</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man was elected, who
sate Bishop 13. years.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Hugh Benham</hi> elected by the Monks went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was there consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fourth; after he had remained there the space of a year, he
returned to <hi>Scotland,</hi> at which time there was a great contention between the
Churchmen and the people of the countrey for certain tithes, that the Priests did
exact too rigorously. The difference being submitted to him, he composed the same
in a Convention of the Clergy at <hi>Perth,</hi> wherein the King and many of the Nobles
were present, and died of a Catarrhe, being very old, in the Isle of <hi>Louchgoull,</hi> about
the year 1280.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Henry Cheyn,</hi> Nephew to the Lord <hi>Cummyn,</hi> was preferred to the See; the
troubles which in his time brake forth in the Kingdome between <hi>Bruce</hi> and
<hi>Baliol,</hi> wrought him great vexation; for whilest he took part with his Uncle against
<hi>Bruce,</hi> he was banished into <hi>England,</hi> where he lived untill the end of these warres,
and then licenced by King <hi>Robert</hi> to return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he gave himselfe to repair the Church,
and restore all things, which the licenciousnesse of warre had disordered: he died
the same year in which King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi> ended his life, that is, in the year of
Christ 1329. which was the 48. year after his consecration.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Alexander Kinninmouth</hi> Doctor of Divinity succeeded in his place, a great
lover of learning and learned men, whom out of all parts he drew to make resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with himself. In the winter season he dwelt at <hi>Murthlack,</hi> and when the
the spring opened, at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> because of the confluence of people all that time of
the year: all the summer and harvest time he remained at <hi>Fetterneir</hi> and <hi>Rain,</hi> that
he might the more commodiously discharge his office in every part of his Dioces.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50008:64"/>
The <hi>English</hi> in his time set on fire the Town of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> which burnt six dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and did much harm; his own Palace, with the whole houses of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
were thereby consumed, which was thought to have hastened his death; he
departed this life in the eleventh year of his consecration.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>William Deyn</hi> was made Bishop in his stead, the most of his time the Realme
was infested with warres, whereby he was impeded in many good purposes that he
intended, and had much adoe to keep the Clergy in obedience, for every man du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the warre, took liberty to do what they thought good; he sate Bishop the
space of ten years.</p>
                  <p>18. After him <hi>Iohn Raith</hi> Doctor of Divinity was chosen Bishop by the Monks;
he lived only six years Bishop, and was buried in the Quire of <hi>Aberdene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. King <hi>David Bruce</hi> returning from <hi>France</hi> about this time had brought with
him in company one <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> a corrupt and ambitious man, who procured the
Kings recommendation to the Chapter of <hi>Aberdene</hi> for his election. The Chanons
excused themselves, saying, <hi>The Church of</hi> Aberdene <hi>was not so scant of men as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
an unworthy person into the place. And howsoever the King in his Kingdome might
do what he pleased, they were by their oathes astricted to admit none but learned men, and
such as were approved for integrity of life: wherefore intreated the King in humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to suffer them, as they had been accustomed, to elect some wise and grave person, that
could discharge the place with credit:</hi> which after some moneths they obtained, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
choice of one <hi>Alexander Kinninmouth,</hi> who was consecrated in the Town of
<hi>Perth,</hi> the King himself being present. This man answered fully the hopes concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, and took great pains in his calling; for on the ferial dayes he taught
the Civil and Canon law, and the holy dayes he spent in preaching and prayer.
Thrice every week he fasted, contenting himself in the holy Eves with bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
He caused demolish the old Church of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> which he esteemed not so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
as was fitting for a Cathedral Church, and laid the foundation of another more
magnificent. But ere the work was advanced six cubits high, he was employed by
King <hi>Robert</hi> the second in an Ambassage to <hi>France,</hi> for renewing the old league,
which he worthily performed; shortly after his return he died, having sate Bishop
24. years.</p>
                  <p>20. <hi>Adam Conningham,</hi> a man well descended, and of great authority, was
after him elected. This Bishop is said to have been in such accompt for the his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and sincerity, that in all matters of importance propounded in Councel, his
opinion did ever prevail. His frequent imployments with the <hi>French</hi> King, as well
before, as after his preferment to the See, and the happy successe he had therein,
manifested his prudence and dexterity of wit: yet as it falleth out often in Courts,
upon some envious delations the King became jealous of him, as if he had practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with some Noblemen against the Royal succession, and pressed to reduce the
old form of election of Kings. Finding that the King had taken some impression of
the report, albeit nothing was more false, he took counsell to retire himself, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his charge at home: where he had not long staid, but he fell in a new trouble,
with a base sonne of the Kings, named <hi>Alexander,</hi> a man extremely vicious, and for
his oppressions hated of all good men. To the Bishop he bare a special grudge, because
of the liberty he had used in reproving his wickednesse; and hearing in what dislike
the Bishop was with the King, he violently possessed himself in the Bishops lands,
thrust forth his tenants, and behaved himself as Master, and Lord of all. The Bishop
complained to the King, but finding no redresse, he pronounced him excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate;
wherewith the wicked man incensed, associating a number as wickedly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
as himself, did swear to take the Bishops life, and came to <hi>Aberdene</hi> of that
intention. Whereof the Bishop getting advertisement, he went forth to meet him on
the way, and how soon he saw him, discovering his head, which was all white, (for
he was a man of great age) said, <hi>If this be it that thou seekest, I have brought it unto
thee, take thee head, life, and all.</hi> The company admiring the old mans courage,
and moved with some compassion of his white haires, perswaded <hi>Alexander</hi> not to
meddle with his blood. The report of this insolencie going to the King, he sent
for his sonne, and committing him to prison<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caused satisfaction to be given for all
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50008:65"/>
the injuries the Bishop had sustained,<note place="margin">An. 1300.</note> and surety for his indemnity thereafter.
After which he enjoyed reasenable quietnesse untill his death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in the year of Christ, 1390. having sate Bishop ten years.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Gilbert Grimlaw,</hi> a man learned, wise, and of great esteem with the Nobles
of the Kingdom, was consecrated Bishop of <hi>Aberdene</hi> the same year; he had been
Chancellour to King <hi>Robert</hi> the third a long time, which office he discharged with
great credit, and to the contentment of all the subjects: after the Kings death (the
Earle of <hi>Fife</hi> brother to the deceased King then governing the Realm) he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in an Ambassage to <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh of <hi>France,</hi> and went thither in the
company of the Earls of <hi>Buchan</hi> and <hi>Douglas,</hi> who with divers other Noblemen
were afterward unfortunately killed at the battel of <hi>Vernoil.</hi> The Bishop at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
found all things out of frame, the Governour dead, his sonne <hi>Mordach</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in his room, and the whole estate miserable by the riots and oppressions which
were used every where without punishment. This made the Bishop retire himself
and live private at home, where soon after he died of a consumption in the year
1424. his body was interred in the Quire of the Cathedral Church.</p>
                  <p>22. After his death <hi>Henry Leighton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Murray</hi> was translated to <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene,</hi>
a man learned both in the Civil and Canon law, of great experience, and
in that regard postulated Bishop by the Chanons: he stood doubtful a while whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he should condescend to the charge or not, yet was induced to consent at last,
and so came to <hi>Aberdene,</hi> where he applied himself carefully to do the charge of a
Bishop. But the Estates of the Realme meeting in a solemn convention for putting
some order to the present confusions, he was sent with some others in Commission
to <hi>England,</hi> to treat for redemption of King <hi>Iames</hi> the first, who was there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
captive. This businesse happily performed, he returned with the King, to
whom he gave great content by his services and forwardnesse in reforming pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
abuses; he advanced greatly the fabrick of the Church of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
large summes for perfecting that work; he built also the Chappel called
<hi>Saint Iohns Chappel</hi> within the Cathedral, and was therein buried himself in the
year 1441. 17. years after his translation.</p>
                  <p>23. <hi>Ingram Lindesay</hi> Doctor of the Canon law, was upon his death with the great
applause of all good men received Bishop, he was at that time very old, and by the
policie of one <hi>Alexander</hi> who aimed at his place, moved to take journey to <hi>Rome:</hi> the
man imagining that he should die in the voyage, whereof yet he was deceived. For
the Bishop sailing to <hi>Marselles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> went from thence by sea to <hi>Rome,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some moneths stay returned more healthful then before. 17 yeares he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Bishop, and ruled the affaires of the Church very wisely. A man constant in
his promises of a spare diet, but very hospitable, for he entertained great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
both of learned men and others, especially the eldest sonnes of Noblemen and
Barons in the North parts; and notwithstanding of his age, and publick employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
was ever at study when he could find any free time from those cares. A little
before his death he fell in the Kings displeasure for denying admission to some
whom the King had presented to certain Benefices, for that they were either meer
ignorants or for their years incapable. But this did not much trouble his mind, as
being no way conscious to himself of any just offence offered. He died at <hi>Aberdene</hi>
much lamented of the Citizens who loved him dearly, and buried him in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Church with great solemnity.</p>
                  <p>24. Then was <hi>Thomas Spence</hi> Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> translated to the See, a man of

<hi>France,</hi> trusted with a Commission by King <hi>Iames</hi> the second, and by his wise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
wonne such favour with <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh then reigning, as after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
great services performed to that King, he returned honoured with the place

intreaty of the Chanons, was translated hither; most of his time after he was

Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An. 1480.</note> and sometimes to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth of <hi>England.</hi> Not thelesse
mindeful of his Church he adorned the same in a most rich and sumptuous manner,
and built of new the Bishops palace, which since the burning by the <hi>English</hi> had
been wast and ruinous. Amongst other charitable works, he erected an hospital at
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> acquiring thereto divers lands, and ended his life by sicknesse the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>April</hi> 1480. his body was interred in the <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. <hi>Robert Blaicater</hi> being for the time at <hi>Rome,</hi> was by the provision of Pope
<hi>Xistus</hi> the fourth made Bishop, at whose hands also he received consecration; a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
well descended, and of good knowledge both in divine and humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
soon after he was translated to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where he died.</p>
                  <p>26. <hi>William Elphinston</hi> succeeded to <hi>Blaicater,</hi> a famous and memorable person;
he was born in the City of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and trained up in the Pedagogie of that City;
where he made such profit in his studies, that all who knew him conceived even in
his younger years great hopes of his advancement. By the advice of his Uncle <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
Elphinston</hi> he went to <hi>France,</hi> being 29. years of age, and there abode some
nine years, having purchased good reputation in the University of <hi>Paris</hi> for his skill
in the lawes, which six years together he professed, reading daily the Lectures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in a most frequent auditory. Then returning into his countrey, was preferred
first to be Official of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> afterwards made Official of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be of the Kings Councel. Some jarres falling out at that time betwixt King
<hi>Iames</hi> the third, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh of <hi>France,</hi> which was like to have dissolved
the ancient friendship betwixt the two nations, he was joyned in Commission with
the Bishop of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> and Earl of <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uchan</hi> for pacifying the same, and by a wise and
most eloquent oration brought matters so about, that the old league and amity was
renewed, and all occcasions of discord quite removed: whereupon the Bishoprick of
<hi>Rosse</hi> was at his return cast upon him, which he accepted with great difficulty. The
See of <hi>Aberdene</hi> afterwards falling void, he was translated thither, and at that time
was made Chancellour of the Kingdome; in which charge he carried himself with
that moderation and equity, as he was both loved and reverenced of all persons.
But the unhappy troubles that fell out betwixt the King and some of his Nobility,
which by no means (though he did use his uttermost diligence that way) could be
pacified, made him retire to his charge at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> where he gave himself to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
such things as he found disordered in the Church, and had doubtlesse effected
the same if he had not been called back to Court, and employed much against his
will in publick affaires.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth then entring his reign, he was by the consent of the whole
estate sent Ambassadour to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, to suite his daughter <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
in marriage for the King: But she before his coming being promised to the
Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> the businesse took no effect, yet that his travel should not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unprofitable, in his return from the Emperours Court, he reconciled the
variance, which long had continued betwixt this nation and the people of <hi>Holland,</hi>
and thereby grew in such favour with the King, that whatsoever businesse he had,
either within or without the Kingdome, the same was wholly committed to his
trust.</p>
                  <p>Neither did he in the mean while neglect to use his best means for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of learning, having built a stately Colledge in <hi>Aberdene,</hi> which for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the edifice and rich foundation was one of the rarest monuments this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
had seen. The expence he bestowed partly on that work, partly for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
materials for building of the Bridge upon <hi>Dey,</hi> with the large almes he gave
daily to the poor and religious of all sorts (not to speak of the help and relief he
made to others of his kindred) exceeded almost all credit and belief: for he was ever
observed to keep a good table, and had no Benefices in <hi>Commendam,</hi> (which was
then grown into a custome amongst Churchmen) yet upon the rents of his own
Bishoprick, he did both maintain his estate, do all those great and magnificent
works; and dying, left in treasure ten thousand pounds in gold and silver, which he
bequeathed to the Colledge, and the finishing of the bridge at <hi>Dey:</hi> that in him we
may truly see how it is not the abundance of worldly goods, but the blessing of
God that maketh rich.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:50008:66"/>What time he could spare from the publick service he spent in writing the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of his nation,<note place="margin">An. 1514.</note> and gathered in one volume all the Antiquities that could be
found thereof. The memories also of those holy men who lived in former times,
in this kingdome, he studied to preserve, committing to writing their worthy
and memorable acts, and giving order that on solemn dayes the religious should
read some part thereof in their common meetings; neither was he seen to be idle,
but alwayes in labour and striving how to benefit the publick. Nor was there any
man known to have been of more integrity of life and manners, sweet and pleasant
conversation, of a cheerful countenance, and exceeding delightful. The constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his body was healthful and strong, old age which to others is of it self a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
wrought in him no alteration either of mind or body; for being 83. yeares
old, his judgement in the weightiest matters of State was observed to be as quick,
and his memory as ripe, as when he was in the middle of his youth.</p>
                  <p>That which is supposed to have hastened his death, was the unfortunate death of
the King at <hi>Flowden;</hi> for after the report of that losse he was never perceived to
laugh, nor willingly did he hear any thing that sounded unto mirth or gladnesse,
and thereupon had resolved to live the rest of his time obscure and retired: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called by the Councel to assist some great businesse, which for the time was in
hand, he sickned in his journey towards <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the sixth day after his
coming thither, died most christianly: his body embalmed, was carried afterwards
to <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and entombed in his own Colledge before the high Altar. They
write that the day his Corps was brought forth to the burial, the pastoral staffe,
which was all of silver, and carried by <hi>Alexander Lawder</hi> a Jurist, broak in two pieces,
one part thereof falling in the grave where his body was to be laid, and that a voice
was heard to cry, <hi>Tecum Gulielme mitra sepelienda,</hi> with thee the mitre and glory
thereof is buried: 30. years he sate Bishop, and ended his course being very old in
the year 1514.</p>
                  <p>27. The Chanons assembling according to their custome to elect a Bishop in
his place, the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> a man of great power in the North, came upon them
unexpected, desiring that <hi>Alexander Gordon</hi> his Cousen, then Chanter of <hi>Murray,</hi>
might be chosen. The Chanons not daring refuse, did all give their consents. In
the mean time was one <hi>Iames Ogilvy</hi> presented thereto by the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> and
at <hi>Rome Robert Forman</hi> Dean of <hi>Glasgow</hi> took a provision thereof from Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the
tenth; yet both these did resigne their titles afterwards at the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> his
perswasion, <hi>Ogilvy</hi> having received in recompence the Abbacy of <hi>Driburgh,</hi> and
<hi>Forman</hi> yielding at the desire of <hi>Andrew Forman</hi> his brother, then Archbishop of
<hi>S. Andrews,</hi> upon promise of the next place that should fall void. Thus after some
moneths delay, <hi>Gordon</hi> was received, and consecrated Bishop: but he enjoyed the
place a short time, and was buried in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Aberdene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. <hi>Gawan Dumbar,</hi> Archdeacon of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and Master of the Rolls, a man
of many excellent parts, was after him elected Bishop; he set himself to perfect all
those works which Bishop <hi>Elphinston</hi> had begun, and were not as yet finished; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the building of the Bridge upon <hi>Dey,</hi> with the houses that he had appointed
for the several professions of Sciences in the Colledge. The Executors of Bishop
<hi>Elphinston</hi> he called to an accompt, and made them render the monies left by him
in legacy, adding thereto his own liberality, wherewith he accomplished all
these works. He founded likewise an hospital for twelve poor men, and a Preceptor
to attend them; and all the time he lived Bishop, which was 13. years, whatsoever
profit or commodity he made by the Church, he bestowed wholly upon the poor,
and such publick works, without applying a farthing either to his own use, or the
enriching of any of his kinsmen. He departed this life at S. <hi>Andrewes</hi> the ninth
of <hi>March,</hi> 1531.</p>
                  <p>29. To him succeeded <hi>William Stewart</hi> son to the Laird of <hi>Minto,</hi> a man given to
vertue, charitable to the poor, and ready to every good work; he built the Consistory
house in old <hi>Aberdene,</hi> enlarged the territory of the Colledge, and bestowed upon it
a part of the rent it now possesseth; he built likewise the Library, with two schooles,

                  <p>30. <hi>William Gordon,</hi> sonne to the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> succeeded in the place. This
man brought up in letters at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> followed his studies a long time in <hi>Paris,</hi> and
returning thence, was first Parson of <hi>Clat,</hi> and afterwards promoved to the See;
some hopes he gave at first of a vertuous man, but afterwards turned a very Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
spending all his time in drinking and whoring; he dilapidated the whole rents by
fewing the lands, and converting the victual duties in money, a great part whereof
he wasted upon his base children, and the whores their mothers; a man not worthy
to be placed in this Catalogue; he died in the year 1577.</p>

and another third part to the Abbey of <hi>Inchaffray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>William</hi> called <hi>Gulielmus de Bosco</hi> was next preferred to the See, and shortly
after created Chancellor.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Osbert,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Cambuskenneth</hi> succeeded, he died in the year 1231.</p>
                  <p>6. The sixth Bishop was <hi>Clemens,</hi> a Frier of the Dominican Order, consecrated
in the <hi>Stewe</hi> Church of <hi>Weddal,</hi> in the year 1233. This man was an excellent
Preacher, learned above many of that time, and of singular integrity of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;
he gave divers lands and rents to the Church of <hi>Culross,</hi> and restored the
Cathedral Church of <hi>Dumblane,</hi> which was decayed. <hi>Leander Bononiensis,</hi> in his
third book <hi>De viris illustribus Praedicatorum,</hi> remembreth him with a special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
The like doth <hi>Philippus Wolphius</hi> in his third book <hi>De vitis peritorum
virorum.</hi> He died in the year 1256.</p>
                  <p>7 <hi>Robert</hi> was after him elected. This is he who was sent with <hi>Richard</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Dunkeld,</hi> by the rest of the Prelates in the year 1268. to protest against the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of <hi>Ottobon</hi> the Popes Legate for the contribution imposed by him upon
the <hi>Scottish</hi> Clergy, towards the charge of the holy warre.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Alpin</hi> after him governed the See some few years.</p>
                  <p>9. Then one <hi>Nicolaus</hi> was made Bishop, he gave the halfe of the Church of
<hi>Strowan</hi> to the Abby of <hi>Inchaffray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. After him succeeded <hi>Maurice</hi> Abbot of <hi>Inchaffray,</hi> a Prelate of great
spirit, who gave great encouragement to his countreymen in that famous
battel of <hi>Bonnockburn,</hi> and was therefore chosen by King <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> to be
his Confessor after that battel: the See falling void, he was preferred to
the same.</p>
                  <p>11. One <hi>William</hi> succeeded to him.</p>
                  <p>12. Then <hi>Walter Cambuslang</hi> in the year 1363.</p>
                  <p>13. And after him was <hi>Finlaw,</hi> commonly called <hi>Dermoch,</hi> who built the bridge
of <hi>Dumblane,</hi> and died in the year 1419.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>William Stephen,</hi> one of the first Professors in the University of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
was after him preferred.</p>
                  <p>15. Upon his death <hi>Michael Ochiltrie</hi> succeeded, a wealthy Prelate, and well
esteemed; he purchased to his See a great part of the forfeited lands of <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne,</hi>
adorned the Cathedral Church with many rich ornaments, built the bridge
of <hi>Knaig</hi> at <hi>Machant,</hi> with the Church of <hi>Muthill,</hi> and did in his time divers
other good works.</p>
                  <p>16. After him succeeded <hi>Robert Lawder,</hi> who founded divers Prebendaries, and
Chanonries in the Church of <hi>Dumblane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> succeeded in the year 1471. This Bishop had a long contention
with the Abbot of <hi>Inchaffray</hi> for certain Churches claimed by the Abbot, but the
matter was afterwards pacified. He died in the year 1508. and was buried in the
Quire of the Cathedral Church.</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>Iames Chisholme</hi> obtained the Bishoprick after his death by the Popes provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and carried himself in his charge very commendably; a severe censour he was
of the corrupt manners of the Clergy, and recovered many lands and possessions,
which were sacrilegiously taken from the Church before his time. He died in the
year 1534.</p>
                  <p>19. To whom succeeded <hi>William Chisholme</hi> his brother, a wicked and vicious
man, who for hatred he bare to true religion made away all the lands of the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
and utterly spoyled the benefice.</p>

                  <head>The Bishops of CATHNES.</head>
                  <p>1. This Bishoprick was founded by <hi>Malcolme</hi> the third,<note place="margin">The succession of the Bishops of <hi>Cathnes.</hi>
                     </note> about the yeare
1066. who preferred thereto one <hi>Darrus,</hi> whom he favoured greatly. This man
lived long, and in a good reputation, and after his death was honoured for
a Saint.</p>
                  <p>2. There succeeded to him one <hi>Andrew,</hi> of whom <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> makes mention,
saying, that he came into <hi>England</hi> with <hi>VVilliam</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> in the year 1176. and
shortly after his return home departed this life.</p>
                  <p>3. To him succeeded <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Bishop that <hi>Harold</hi> the Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> and
<hi>Cathnes</hi> used most cruelly, cutting forth his tongue, and pulling out his eyes;
which King <hi>VVilliam</hi> (in whose reign it happened) punished exemplarly, for he
caused the Earl his eyes first to be pulled out, then made him to be executed by
the hands of the hangman, and all his male children to be gelded, to extinguish
their succession.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Adam</hi> another Bishop, whether his immediate successour or not, I cannot say,
was no lesse barbarously used; for in the year 1222. or much thereabout, some
wicked people suborned by the Earl of <hi>Cathnes</hi> assailed him being private at home,
and killing his chamber boy, with a Monk of <hi>Melross,</hi> that did ordinarily attend
him (for he had been Abbot of that Monastery) drew him by force into his kitchen,
and when they had scourged him with rods, set the kitchen on fire, and burnt him,
therein. King <hi>Alexander</hi> the second was at that time upon his journey towards
<hi>England,</hi> and upon notice of this cruel fact, turned back and went in haste to <hi>Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:50008:68"/>
where he put the offenders and their partakers to trial: 400. by publick sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
were executed,<note place="margin">An. 1245.</note> and all their male children gelded, that no succession should
spring from so wicked a seed. The place where their stones were cast in a heap to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
is to this day known by the name of the <hi>Stony hill.</hi> The Earl for withholding
his help, and because he did not rescue the Bishop, was forfeited. And howbeit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some little time he found means to be restored, yet did he not escape the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, being murthered by some of his own servants who conspired to kill
him; and to conceal the fact, set the house on fire, and burnt his body therein:
so was he paid home in the same measure he had used the Bishop.</p>
                  <p>5. To this <hi>Adam</hi> succeeded <hi>Gilbert</hi> the Chanon surnamed <hi>Murray,</hi> and sonne to
the Lord of <hi>Duffus,</hi> who was in great esteem for the bold and couragious answer he
made to the Popes Legate at <hi>Northampton;</hi> he built the Cathedral Church of
<hi>Cathnes</hi> upon his own charges, and lived to see the same finished, and shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the dedication died at <hi>Scravister</hi> in the year 1245. the <hi>posteri</hi> gave him the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a Saint.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>VVilliam,</hi> who succeeded, followed his steps, and did much good in his time,
he died in the year 1261.</p>
                  <p>7. Then <hi>VValter</hi> Doctor in the Canon law, who lived ten years, and ended
his dayes in the year 1271.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Archibald,</hi> a man much commended for his meek and tractable disposition,
succeeding, died in the year 1288.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Andrew</hi> a man skilled in the lawes, was preferred after his death, and lived
Bishop 13. years.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Ferquhard</hi> succeeded to him; this Bishop was a strong defender of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Church, and died in the year 1328.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>David</hi> that followed lived 20. years Bishop and departed this life, <hi>an.</hi> 1348.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Thomas Fingask</hi> was next Bishop, he died in the Chanonry of <hi>Elgin, anno</hi>

<hi>Sutherland,</hi> whom he left his Executor.</p>
                  <p>13. To him succeeded Bishop <hi>Alexander,</hi> who lived many years in that See, and
died in the year 1409.</p>
                  <p>Then these in order.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Malcolm,</hi> a zealous and devout man, who died <hi>anno</hi> 1421.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Robert Strackbock</hi> died <hi>anno</hi> 1440.</p>

                  <p>17. <hi>VVilliam Mudie</hi> died <hi>anno</hi> 1460.</p>
                  <p>18. After whom one <hi>Prosper</hi> was elected, but he resigned the place in favours
of <hi>Iohn Sinclar,</hi> sonne to the Earle of <hi>Cathnes,</hi> who was never consecrated, and so
the See remained void the space of 24. years; during which time M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Adam Gordon</hi>

                  <p>After <hi>Sinclars</hi> death succeeded <hi>Andrew Stewart</hi> Commendatory of <hi>Kelso</hi> and

it beginnes. ...</p>
                  <p>They report of him, that a Lady of good place in the countrey having lost a ring,
which her husband gave her, as she crossed the river of <hi>Cluyd,</hi> and her husband wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
jealous, as if she had bestowed the same upon one of her lovers, she did mean her
self unto him, intreating his help for the safety of her honour; and that he going to
the river after he had used his devotion willed one who was making to fish, to bring
him the first that he caught; which was done; in the mouth of that fish he found the
ring, and sending it to the Lady, she was thereby freed of her husbands suspicion.
The credit of this I believe upon the reporters; but howsoever it be, the See and
City do both of them wear in their Armes a fish with a ring in the mouth even
to this day. He was certainly a man of rare piety, and to the poor exceeding boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
lived to a great age, beyond the ordinary course of men, as in the conclusion

great, for the superiority claimed by one <hi>Roger</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> over the Bishops
of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This contention drew <hi>Angelramus</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
of the Kingdom for the time, to travel unto <hi>Rome,</hi> as was touched before;
and <hi>Herbert</hi> dying whilest he was there,</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Angelramus</hi> by an uniform consent of the Clergy and Laity was elected in
his place, and upon notice given of the election, consecrated by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> from whom he obtained an exemption to the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the
jurisdiction of the <hi>English</hi> and all others, the Apostolick See only excepted; Shortly
after his return he died.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Iocelin</hi> Abbot of <hi>Melrosse</hi> was his successour; in his time the City of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi>
was erected into a Burgh Royal; he died at <hi>Melrosse,</hi> and was interred in that
Monastery.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Eugenius</hi> was chosen after his death, but how long he lived, I read not.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Hugo</hi> Chancellour of the Kingdome succeeded, and lived but a few years.</p>
                  <p>8. After him <hi>VVilliam Malvoisin</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man was elected, and consecrated in
<hi>France</hi> by the Popes direction; he was afterward translated to S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the office of Chancellary.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Florentius,</hi> sonne to the Count of <hi>Holland,</hi> was assumed in his place, and
shortly after upon licence obtained of the Pope, he resigned the office, and died at
<hi>Rome</hi> in the year 1207.</p>
                  <p>10. And then <hi>VValter</hi> Chaplain to King <hi>William,</hi> was consecrated Bishop; he
lived in the place 27. yeares.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>VVilliam Babington</hi> Chancellor of the Kingdom, was after his death elected
Bishop. In his time, as <hi>Boeth</hi> writeth, the fabrick of the Church of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was
fully accomplished; his words are, <hi>Absolutum est ea tempestate templum Cathedrale
Glasguense, sedes profectò magnifica, cujus haud exiguam partem Gulielmus ibidem
Episcopus liberalitate sua extruxerat, nec diu operi perfecto superfuit.</hi> He died the 25.
of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1261.</p>
                  <p>12. The Chanons meeting to choose a successor, condescended upon <hi>Nicole
Moffet</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Teviot-dale,</hi> yet shortly after forthinking their election, they
procured the same to be cassed at <hi>Rome,</hi> whither he was gone to obtain Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thereupon <hi>Iohn de Chyan</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man was by the Pope provided to the
See, whom King <hi>Alexander</hi> the third admitted with great difficulty. This man is
said to have been learned, but very troublesome to the Chanons, upon whom he
laid grievous impositions. The discord betwixt him and them waxing hot, he left
the countrey, and going to <hi>France,</hi> died there in the year 1268.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Nicole Moffet</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Teviot-dale</hi> was upon his death provided to the
See, notwithstanding the opposition of the Chanons, but he lived a short time,
and died at <hi>Tannigham</hi> of the Apoplexie. He was no lesse hated of his Clergy, whom
he is said to vex with many injuries.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>William Wishart</hi> Archdeacon of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and Chancellor of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
was chosen of the Chanons in the year 1270. but S. <hi>Andrews</hi> falling void by
the death of <hi>Gamelinus,</hi> before his consecration he was postulated thereto, and so
returned to S. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Robert Wishart</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Lothian,</hi> and Cousen to the said <hi>VVilliam,</hi>
was upon his change by the Kings recommendation admitted to the place. This is
he who made that reply to King <hi>Edward,</hi> in the consultation held at <hi>Norham</hi> for
the right of the Crown, whereof we spake in the life of <hi>VVilliam Fraser</hi> Bishop of
S. <hi>Andrews;</hi> a worthy man, and a great lover of his countrey, for which he suffered
much trouble, being made prisoner and sent unto <hi>London,</hi> where he was kept some
years; afterwards obtaining liberty, he returned to his See, and therein performed
many good works: he died the 26. of <hi>November,</hi> 1316. and was buried in the
Church of <hi>Glasgow</hi> betwixt the altars of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Andrew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:50008:70"/>16. <hi>Iohn Lindesay</hi> succeeded,<note place="margin">An. 1325.</note> a man given much to the adorning of his Church;
he died the ninth of <hi>April</hi> 1325. and was buried in the Cathedrall, nigh to the Altar
of the Blessed Virgin.</p>
                  <p>17. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stephen Dundy</hi> was the same year elected Bishop, and going to <hi>Rome</hi> to
be confirmed, died by the way, not without suspicion of poison given him at a feast
made by the Friers predicant of <hi>Glasgow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. In his place was chosen <hi>Iohn Wishart,</hi> who in his return from <hi>Rome</hi> was taken
prisoner by the <hi>English,</hi> and died some few dayes after.</p>
                  <p>19. <hi>William Rae,</hi> a good and zealous man, was after him chosen by the consent of
the whole Chapter; he redeemed the possessions of the Church which his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
had alienated, built the stone bridge at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and having done many good
works, died in the year 1367.</p>
                  <p>20. After his death <hi>Walter Wardlaw</hi> succeeded; Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the sixth did
preferre him to bee Cardinal in the year 1384. and in the third year after
he died.</p>
                  <p>21. Then was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Matthew Glendouning</hi> provided to the place. In his time the
steeple which was all built of timber, was burnt by lightning, in place whereof he
intended to build one of stone, and made therefore great preparation, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by death in the year 1408.</p>
                  <p>22. His successor <hi>VVilliam Lawder</hi> finished the work; he was Chancellor of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and without the Chapters election provided by the Pope of meer autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which was never done in that See before.</p>
                  <p>23. After him <hi>Iohn Cameron</hi> was Bishop, a man given to violence and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who committing many deeds full of cruelty and covetousnesse, especially upon
his own Tenants and Vassals, made (as the fame goeth) a fearful and unhappy end; for
in the year 1446. the night before <hi>Christmas</hi> day, as he lay asleep in his house of
<hi>Lockwood</hi> some seven miles from the City of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> he seemed to hear a voice
summoning him to appear before the tribunal of <hi>Christ,</hi> and give an accompt
of his doings. Thereupon he awak't; and being greatly terrified, did call his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to bring lights and sit by him, he himself took a book in his hand, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to read; but the voice being again heard, struck all the servants with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The same voice calling the third time farre lowder, and more fearfully,
the Bishop after a heavy groane, was found dead in the bed, his tongue hanging
out of his mouth. This reported by <hi>Buchannan</hi> almost in the same words, I thought
good to remember as a notable example of Gods judgement against the crying sin
of oppression.</p>
                  <p>24. To <hi>Cameron</hi> succeeded <hi>Iames Bruce,</hi> who was translated from <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keld</hi>
to this See in the year 1446. and preferred to be Chancellour of the
Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>25. After him M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>VVilliam Turnbull</hi> (others called him <hi>David</hi>) was chosen Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
he founded the Colledge of <hi>Glasgow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. Upon his death <hi>Andrew Moorehead</hi> was elected. The hospital near the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
was his foundation.</p>
                  <p>27. To <hi>Moorehead</hi> succeeded <hi>Iohn Lang,</hi> who was Chancellour of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. He dying, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George Carmighal</hi> was promoved, but not consecrated; for
he died going to <hi>Rome</hi> for Confirmation.</p>
                  <p>29. <hi>Robert Blacader</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> was after his death translated to this
See. In his time was the See of <hi>Glasgow</hi> erected into an Archbishoprick, for
which arose a great contention betwixt <hi>Shevez</hi> Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi>
and him; which was after some treaty pacified, and <hi>Galloway, Argyle,</hi> and
<hi>Isles</hi> appointed <hi>Suffragans</hi> to <hi>Glasgow.</hi> He lived untill the yeare 1500. at
what time taking his journey toward <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he departed this life in the
way thither</p>
                  <p>30. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iames Beaton</hi> upon his death was preferred, and sate Bishop twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
two yeares, thereafter he was translated to S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> of whom you
may there read.</p>
                  <p>31. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gawan Dumbar</hi> tutour to the King upon his translation was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,

a good and learned man;<note place="margin">An. 631.</note> he was afterwards made Chancellour of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and administred the office with good commendation.</p>
                  <p>32. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iames Beaton</hi> succeeded after his death, in whose time the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
fell forth, and of him we shall have occasion afterwards to speak.</p>

and by their example in divers Townes and Parishes of the countrey the like was
done, to the great offence of the Clergy, who complaining of that boldnesse to the
Queen Regent were answered, that it was no fit time to enter into those matters,
and that she should find occasion ere it were long to put order unto them. But the
Clergy fearing delayes did forthwith call a Provincial Councel at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> where
professing to make reformation of abuses, they renewed some old Popish constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

shewed the perill in which he did cast both himself and his house by that open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from the Church, he desired him in some honest fashion to rid himself of
that defamed and perjured Apostate, who had seduced him: (This was one Mr. <hi>Iohn
Douglas,</hi> whom the Earl had taken to be his Minister) offering to provide him of
a learned and wise Preacher, for whom he would lay his soul in pawn, that he should
teach no other but true doctrine, and agreeable to the Catholick faith.<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> The Earle
answered, <q>That for peril he feared none either to himself or to his house, having
resolved to live in obedience to his Prince, and to serve God as well as he could
according to his written word: and for the defection alledged; seeing it had
pleased God to open his eyes and give him the knowledge of his truth, which he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50008:72"/>
took for a great argument of his favour, he would not relinquish or forsake it
for fear of any inconveniences. As to the man he wrote of, he said that he heard
him teach the doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> condemne idolatry, adultery, fornication, and
such like wickednesse, and that he should make him give an accompt thereof
whensoever he should be cited. But to call him defamed and perjured there was
no reason, seeing he was not declared to be such by any sentence; and if he had
in former times made any unlawful oath, he had done much better in violating
the same, then if he had observed it. Further, whereas he made offer to provide
him of some learned man, he gave him thanks, considering the necessity there was
of labourers in the Lords harvest; but he understood what his meaning in that
was, and minded not to be led with any such teachers. In end he wished him not
to begin the battel with him, whereof the event would be doubtful; for as to
himself he knew God was God, and should be God still, whatsoever mans crast
could work or devise.</q>
               </p>

out about that time to be kept at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they entreated Queen Regent to
honour the solemnity with her presence. The custome was in that time of the year to
carry the image of the Saint in procession through the town, (for they had S. <hi>Giles</hi>
to their Patron) with Drummes, Trumpets, and all sort of musical instruments;
neither was there any day kept more superstitiously then this. The Queen agreed
the rather to accompany the procession, for that some cumult was feared, which she
thought her presence would represse. But when the time of the solemnity was
come the Saint was missing, for some had stolne the image out of the place where
it was kept.<note place="margin">The procession disturbed by a tumul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

they set forward, the Regent accompanying the people, till the procession was

was no sooner gone, then some youths provided for the purpose, drawing near unto
the <hi>Fertor,</hi> and making a shew to carry it upon their shoulders, after they had walked
some few paces, and perceived by the motion they made, the image was fixed to
the <hi>Fertor,</hi> they threw all to the ground; and taking the image by the heels, dashed
the same against the stones, so as head and hands were beaten off, and the idol
wholly defaced. The people hereupon fell a crying, the Priests and Churchmen
betook them to flight, and a great stirre was in the streets. Some houres the Fray
continued, and being in end setled by the authority of the Magistrates, the whole
Clergy that were in town assembled themselves; and making the best countenance
they could, indicted a solemn meeting in the beginning of <hi>November</hi> next.</p>

his contumacie to be banished the Realme; a prohibition likewise was given to all
the subjects, that none of them should entertain or receive them in their houses.
Notthelesse the town of <hi>Dundy</hi> where he abode, forbare not to hear his Sermons,
and minister unto him all necessities. Mean while they who had combined for
working a Reformation, did send into all parts of the Realm to solicit persons to
joyn in that cause, and purchase the subscriptions of those that were willing, unto
a bond which was framed to that effect. Some moved with a zeal to Religion,
others out of a desire to change, and the greatest part longing to be relieved of the
oppressions of the Churchmen, were easily moved to consent. So when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the return of the subscriptions, that the countrey for the most part was
inclined that way, and that in force and power they were nothing inferiour to their
adversaries, they resolved to begin and make an end of the work; yet lest they
should seem to contemn authority, they concluded to present a supplication to the
Queen Regent and Councel,<note place="margin">Supplication to Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:50008:72"/>1. That their Ministers might be permitted in conceiving of publick prayers,
and the administration of the Sacraments to use the vulgar language understood
by the people.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">Petitions for reformation.</note> That the Sacrament of the Supper might be ministred in both kinds accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our Saviours institution.</p>
               <p>3. That the election of Ministers should be according to the manner used in the
primitive Church, that those who had the charge of election should enquire dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
of the life and doctrine of such as were admitted.</p>
               <p>4. That seeing by corruption of time, ignorant and scandalous persons had been
promoved to Ecclesiastical offices, they should after trial be discharged, and other
more sufficient put in their places.</p>
               <p>These Petitions were no way pleasing to the Queen Regent,<note place="margin">The Queens answer.</note> yet because the
Parliament was approaching, wherein the matrimonial Crown and naturalization
of the <hi>French</hi> were to be passed, she thought best to keep them in hope, saying, <hi>That
all they could lawfully desire, should be granted unto them; mean while they were licenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to use their prayers and service in the vulgar language, providing they did keep no
publick assemblies in</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>or</hi> Leth, <hi>for eschewing of tumults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prelates having notice of this were highly incensed, and when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
was required (for the same Petitions were presented to them) carrying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more imperiously then before, answered, that <hi>they would not depart a jot from
the decrees of Trent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A dispute of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the Clergy, and accepted by the Congregation.</note> Afterwards being a little calmed, they made offer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the cause to dispute, which by those of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> (this was the title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
commonly to the Reformers) was accepted, upon two conditions; one, that
the controversies in Religion might be decided by the Scripture; the other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was, that such of their brethren as were exiled or condemned, might assist the
dispute, and have safe conduct given them to that effect. But both the conditions
were denied; for neither would they admit any other Judge but the Canon Law
and Councel; nor would they dispense with any sentence by them pronounced.
Some of them that affected quietnesse propounded other conditions of reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">Ridiculous conditions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Petitioners.</note>
That if the Congregation would suffer the Masse to be held in the wonted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
if they would acknowledge Purgatory, confesse the invocation of Saints,
and admit prayers for the dead, they should be allowed to pray and administrate
the Sacraments in a known language. But those conditions were held so ridiculous
and absurd, as they were not vouchsafed any answer.</p>
               <p>Soon after this the Parliament being assembled,<note place="margin">Articles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the Congregation to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the Articles following were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to Queen Regent.</p>
               <p>1. That in regard the controversies in Religion, which had a long time conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
betwixt the Protestants in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, were not as yet
decided by a lawful general Councel, and that they themselves upon the same
grounds could not any longer communicate with Papists in their idolatrous religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
The humble desire of the Congregation was, that all such acts of Parliament,
as warranted Churchmen to proceed against hereticks, might be abrogated, or at
least suspended, till in a lawful general Councel the controversies depending were
determined.</p>
               <p>2. And lest it should hereby seem that they desired a liberty to professe what
they pleased, they humbly required that all such might be led before the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Judge, the Prelates and their officers being only permitted to accuse; with
this proviso, that an authentick Copy of the accusation should be delivered to the
person accused, and a competent term assigned him to answer.</p>
               <p>3. That all lawful defences should be received from persons accused of heresie,
and they allowed to accept against the witnesses according to law.</p>
               <p>4. That the party accused should have liberty to expone his own mind, and that
his Declaration might carry more faith then the deposition of whatsoever witnesses,
forasmuch as no person ought to suffer for Religion, who is not known to be obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in his wicked opinions.</p>
               <p>5. That none of their profession should be condemned for heresie, unlesse
they were first convinced by the word of God, to have erred from the faith
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50008:73"/>
which the holy Spirit witnesseth to be necessary to salvation.</p>
               <p>The Queen receiving the Articles answered in effect as before, That it was not
safe for her to utter her mind at that time;<note place="margin">Queen Regent stayeth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting of the Articles.</note> which if she should do, the spiritual Estate
would not fail to oppose her in all businesse. But how soon the publick matters
were passed, they should know what a good mind she bare unto them. Howbeit
this answer did no way content the wiser sort, yet knowing that the Articles would
not passe in an Act, if she should disassent, they resolved to surcease from presenting
them to the Estates, onely desired they might be permitted to make a Protestation,
which they did in this sort.</p>
               <p>It is not unknown to this honourable Parliament,<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station made by those that desired Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> what controversie is of late arisen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
those that will be called Prelates and Rulers of the Church, and a great number of us
the Nobility and Commonalty of this Realme, for the true worshipping of God, the duty of
Ministers, and the right administration of the holy Sacraments. And how we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to the Queen Regent, that our consciences are burthened with unprofitable ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and we compelled to endure many idolatrous abuses; that such as take upon them offices
Ecclesiastical, do perform no part of the duty which is required of true Ministers, and that
we and our brethren are most injustly oppressed by their usurped authority. As also we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to be sufficiently known to your Honours, that we were of minde this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to seek redresse of these enormities, but considering the troubles of the time do not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
such a reformation, as we by the warrant of Gods word do require, we are enforced to
delay that which of all things most earnestly we desire; and yet lest our silence should give
our adversaries occasion to think that we repent us of our former intentions, we cannot
cease to protest for remedy against that injust Tyranny, which heretofore patiently we have
sustained.</p>
               <p>Therefore first we protest, that seeing we cannot obtain just reformation according to
Gods word, that it may be lawfull to us to use our selves in matters of religion and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as we must answer unto God, untill such time as our adversaries be able to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the true Ministers of Christs Church, and purge themselves of such crimes as we
have already laid to their charge, offering our selves to prove the same, whensoever the
sacred Authority shall please to give us audience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we protest, that neither we, nor any other of the godly that please to joyn with
us in the true faith, which is grounded upon the word of God, shall incurre any danger of
life or lands, or other political paines, for not observing such acts as have passed heretofore
in favour of our adversaries, or for violating such rites as have been invented by man
without the Commandment of God.</p>
               <p>We thirdly protest, that if any tumult or uprore shall arise amongst the members of the
Realme for the diversity of religion, and if it shall chance that abuses be violently reformed,
the crime be not imputed to us, who now do most humbly seek that all things may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by order. But that whatsoever inconvenience shall happen to ensue for lack of time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
redresse, the same may be imputed to those that will not as now hearken to our petitions
for reformation.</p>
               <p>And last we protest, that these our requests proceeding from conscience do tend to no
other end, but onely to the reformation of abuses in religion; most humbly beseeching the
sacred Authority to think of us as faithful and obedient subjects, and take us in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
keeping that indifferency which becometh Gods Lieutenants to use towards those
that in his name do call for defence against cruel oppressors and blood-thirsty tyrants.</p>
               <p>These protestations made in face of Parliament,<note place="margin">The Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion refused to be inserted in the records.</note> were desired to be insert in the
books of publick records; but Queen Regent answering that she should remember
what was protested, and put a good end to all things, the desire was rejected.</p>
               <p>Yet how soon the Parliament brake up,<note place="margin">The Queens countenance changed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Congregation.</note> and all matters in it went to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
it was observed that her countenance was quite altered upon those that
favoured the Reformation, and often she was heard say, <hi>That being now freed of the
vexations which most troubled her minde, she would labour to restore the authority by some
notable example to that reverend esteem, which in the late times it had lost:</hi> whereby divers
did apprehend that a tempest was breeding, albeit the same did not break forth untill
the next spring; At which time taking up the names of all the Ministers in the
countrey, she caused summon them to appear at <hi>Striveling</hi> the tenth of <hi>May.</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:50008:73"/>
Hereupon the Earl of <hi>Glencarn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 1559.</note> and Sir <hi>Hugh Cambel</hi> Sheriffe of <hi>Aire,</hi> were sent
to enquire the reason of that citation, and to entreat her not to molest the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
unlesse they could be charged with preaching false doctrine,<note place="margin">Ministers cited to appear at <hi>Striveling.</hi>
                  </note> or behaving
themselves disorderly. The Queen in passion replied, <hi>That maugre their hearts, and
all that would take part with them, these Ministers should be banished</hi> Scotland, <hi>though
they preached as soundly as ever.</hi> S. Paul <hi>did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Noblemen marvelling what should move her to such passion,<note place="margin">Commissions directed to the Queen.</note> besought her
in humble manner to think of the promises she had made to them from time to
time. Hereat growing into a greater choler she said, <hi>That the promises of Princes
should be no further strained, then it seemed to them convenient to perform.</hi> Then said
they, <hi>if this be the conclusion which you have taken, that you will keep no promises to the
Subjects, we cannot any longer acknowledge your authority, and will henceforth renounce
all obedience to you; what inconveniences may arise of this, you may bethink your selfe.</hi>
This unexpected answer calming the Queen a little, after a few moe words, she said,
that she would think how to remedy these evils in the best and most quiet sort.</p>
               <p>The same day at night advertisement was brought to the Queen of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
begun in the town of <hi>Perth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reformation begun at <hi>Perth.</hi>
                  </note> wherewith she was much disturbed, and calling the

<hi>That he should make their bodies and goods subject, but had no power over their
mindes and consciences,</hi> she was so commoved, that she avowed to make both him
and them repent what they had done.</p>
               <p>The Diet appointed for the appearing of the Ministers at <hi>Striveling</hi> drawing nigh,
the Professors in all parts of the countrey prepared to accompany them. In the
parts of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Mernis</hi> such was the zeal of people, as none would stay at home,
all professing to go and yield confession of their faith with their Ministers.</p>
               <p>The Queen advertised of this concourse of people from all parts,<note place="margin">The Queen Regent deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the Lord of <hi>Dun</hi> to stay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of people.</note> employed <hi>Iohn
Areskin</hi> of <hi>Dun</hi> to cause them return home, promising that the Diet should desert,
and nothing to be done to the prejudice of the Ministers. This he signified by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the principals of the Congregation, advising them to dismisse the multitude.
But they suspecting (as it also came to passe) that some advantage should be taken of
the Ministers not appearing at the day, resolved to make the Commons return to
their houses. The Barons and Gentlemen staying at <hi>Perth</hi> in the mean while with
the Preachers, when the day appointed came, notwithstanding of the promises
made, the Preachers not appearing, were denounced Rebels. The Laird of <hi>Dun</hi>
offending herewith, departed from Court, and coming to <hi>Perth</hi> excused himself of
the advice he had given, declaring that they were not to expect any favour, and
that they should do wisely to provide against the worst.</p>
               <p>Whilest these things passed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> joyneth with the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Perth.</hi>

                  <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> returned from <hi>Geneva</hi> unto <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
joyning with the Congregation, did preach to them at <hi>Perth.</hi> In his Sermon he
took occasion to speak against the <hi>adoration of Images,</hi> shewed that the same tended
to God his dishonour, and that such Idols and monuments of superstition, as were
erected in Churches, ought to be pulled down, as being offensive to good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
people. The Sermon ended and the better sort gone to dinner, a Priest rather to
try mens affections, then out of any devotion, prepared to say Masse, opening a
great case, wherein was the history of divers Saints exquisitly carved. A young
boy that stood by saying, that such boldnesse was unsufferable, the Priest gave him
a blow. The boy in anger casting a stone at the Priest, happened to break one of
the pictures: whereupon stirre was presently raised, some of the common sort fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the Priest, others running to the Altar and breaking the images, so as in a
moment all was pulled down in the Church that carried any mark of idolatry.<note place="margin">The Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Perth.</hi>
                  </note> The

made spoile of all they found therein. The <hi>Franciscans</hi> had store of provision
both of victuals and houshold-stuffe: amongst the <hi>Dominicans</hi> the like wealth was
not found, yet so much there was, as might shew the profession they made of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
to be faigned and counterfeit. The <hi>Carthusians,</hi> who passed both these in
wealth, were used in like manner, yet was the Prior permitted to take with him
what he might carry of gold and silver plate. All the spoile was given to the poor,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50008:74"/>
the rich sort forbearing to meddle with any part thereof. But that which was most
admited, was the speed they made in demolishing these edifices. For the <hi>Charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi>
(a building of exceeding cost and largenesse) was not onely ruined, but the
stones and timber so quickly taken away, as in less then two dayes space a vestige
thereof was scarce remaining to be seen.<note place="margin">The Images pulled down at <hi>Couper</hi> in <hi>Fise.</hi>
                  </note> They of <hi>Cowper</hi> in <hi>Fife</hi> hearing what was

               <p>The report of these things being brought to Queen Regent, she was greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed,<note place="margin">Queen Regent intendeth to surprise <hi>Perth.</hi>

the celerity which <hi>Alexander</hi> Earle of <hi>Glencarn</hi> used, was most admired; for he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>The Noblemen employed in this treaty were known to be well affected to the

               <p>1. That both the Armies dissolving, the Towne should be left patent to the
Queen.</p>
               <p>2. That none of the Inhabitants should be molested or called in question for the

               <p>4. That all other controversies should be delayed unto the next Parliament, or

childe being brought and laid before the Queens lodging, she asked whose son he
was; answer made that he was the son of one <hi>Patrick Murray,</hi> she said that <hi>the
case was to be pitied; and the more, that it had fallen on the son, and not on the father;
but she could not help misfortune.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Articles of peace vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</note> Before three dayes passed, all the heads of the
Capitulation were broken, some of the Citizens exiled, others fined in great sums,
the present Magistrates thrust out of Office, new Rulers intruded, and foure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of souldiers left in the town for a Garrison, who were charged to permit no
other Service but that of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> which against promise she had of new
established. Some that desired matters should be more peaceably carried, told her
that the placing of a Garrison would be interpreted a breach of the Articles; she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>that the promise was to leave no</hi> French <hi>souldiers in the towne, which she had done,
for they were all Scottish men that were there:</hi> and it being replied, that all who took
wages of the <hi>French</hi> King, would be counted <hi>French</hi> souldiers: she said, <hi>that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
was not to be kept to Hereticks, and if she could make as honest an excuse after the fact
committed, she would take upon her conscience to kill and undo all that Sect.</hi> But <hi>Princes,</hi>

               <p>These speeches being divulged did procure to her much ill will. Some reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
she had to assure the towne, it being the town of all the Kingdome most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
for the assembling of forces out of all quarters, and the people by nature
bellicose, and at that time greatly inclined to those of the Congregation: but the
advantage she made of this was little or nothing to the malice she incurred by the
breach of promises. Neither did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

answered, <hi>That seeing the Queen had broken Conditions, which by warrant from her selfe

               </p>
               <p>The Noble men remained at that time in Saint <hi>Andrewes;</hi> and because they
foresaw this their answer would not be well accepted, and feared some sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

they sent to the Lords of <hi>Dun</hi> and <hi>Pittarrow,</hi> and others that favoured Religion in

                  </note> shewing great forwardness and resolutions; and
were not a little incouraged by <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> who in a Sermon made unto them at
the same time put them in minde of that he foretold at <hi>Perth,</hi> how there was no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
in Queen Regents dealing, and that conditions would not be kept, as they had
found. Therefore did he exhort them not to be any longer deluded with fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
seeing there was no peace to be hoped for at their hands, who took no regard
of Contracts and Covenants solemnly sworn. And because there would be no quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
till one of the parties were masters and strangers expulsed out of the Kingdome,
he wished them to prepare themselves, either to die as men, or to live victorious.</p>
               <p>By this exhortation the hearers were so moved,<note place="margin">Images pulled down at <hi>Crail</hi> and <hi>Austruther.</hi>
                  </note> as they fell immediately to the

abused to idolatry in the town. The like they did the next day in <hi>Austruther,</hi> and
from thence came directly to Saint <hi>Andrewes.</hi> The Bishop hearing what they had
done in the Coast-towns, and suspecting they would attempt the same reformation
in the City, came to it well accompanied, of purpose to withstand them: but after
he had tried the affections of the townsmen, and found them all inclining to the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50008:75"/>
Congregation, he went away early the next morning towards <hi>Falkland</hi> to the

               <p>The Lords taking purpose to prevent her coming,<note place="margin">The Lords of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevent her.</note> went the same night thither
accompanied with 100. horse onely, and as many foot; but such was the readiness
of men in that quarrell, as before 10. of the clock on the next day their number grew
to 3000. The Earle of <hi>Rothes</hi> and Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> brought with them many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
from <hi>Lothian;</hi> the Lairds of <hi>Calder, Ormston, Halton, Restarig</hi> and <hi>Coalston</hi>
brought only a few; for the warning they got was late, yet their presence did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incourage the rest. The towns of <hi>Dundy,</hi> Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> and <hi>Couper</hi> shewed
great resolution and courage.</p>
               <p>In the morning early the Noble men had drawn forth their Companies to the
Moore on the West side of the town,<note place="margin">The meeting at <hi>Couper</hi> moore.</note> and committed the direction of all things to
Mr. <hi>Iames Halleburton,</hi> Provost of <hi>Dundy,</hi> a man of good experience, and much
esteemed both for valour and counsell, who made choice of a plot of ground most
convenient for defence; for it lay so, as the Munition might play on all sides upon the
enemy without receiving any annoyance from them, till it should come to handy
blows. A little river ran also between the Armies, which the enemies behoved
pass before they gave the onset. The Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> with the horsemen was placed
in the vantguard, the other Lords with the Gentlemen of <hi>Angus, Mernis, Fise</hi> and
<hi>Lothian,</hi> made the battell. The townesmen of <hi>Dundy,</hi> Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> and <hi>Couper</hi>
were set in the rear, and a certain space from them were the serving men and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of the Camp appointed to stand, which made shew of an auxiliary force pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
against all accidents.</p>
               <p>In Queen Regents Army the <hi>French</hi> were commanded by <hi>Monsieur de Offell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The estate of the Queens Army.</note> and
the <hi>Scots</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Chatterault:</hi> the morning was dark, and the fields covered
with a foggy mist, which hindered the Armies that they could not see one another.
About noontide when the aire began to clear, the <hi>French</hi> sent some of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to view the numbers and order kept by the Congregation: who beholding them
from a farre, as they stood ranged in three battells, and perceiving behind them the
multitude of serving people, which they took to be a supply of <hi>French</hi> men, affirmed
at their return the numbers to be greater then in truth they were. Upon this a Post
was directed to the Queen (who was not as yet come from <hi>Falkland</hi>) to enform her
how matters went, and to shew that the Lords were much stronger then was suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and very forward to fight; as likewise that they perceived a secret muting in
their own Army, some openly professing, that they would not fight against their
friends and Countreymen for the pleasure of strangers.<note place="margin">A treaty for peace.</note> She hearing this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

by the Duke to confer with the Lords, who at first were not suffered to approach
nigh to the Army, and had answer that they knew the Queen had sent those forces
to pursue them, and if they would invade they should finde them prepared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.
But they professing all their desires to be for peace, and that they were sent
to that effect, were afterwards permitted to goe to the Lords: who told them,
<hi>that they had been so often abused with the Queen Regents promises, as they could not
trust her words any more; but if she would send back the</hi> French men <hi>that troubled the
Countrey and give surely that no violence should be used to those that professe the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50008:75"/>
craved, she could give no other but her own word, nor stood it with her honour to doe
otherwise.</hi> Thus because a present peace could not be concluded, a truce for eight
dayes was made, upon condition that the <hi>French</hi> souldiers should be transported
unto <hi>Lothian,</hi> and promise given, that <hi>before the expiring of that time some indifferent
men should be sent to Saint</hi> Andrewes, <hi>authorized with sufficient power for making a

               <p>This done the Lords of the Congregation departed leaving the fields first at the
Dukes request,<note place="margin">The town of <hi>Perth</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of their oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and returning to <hi>Corvper</hi> gave publick thanks for that the enemies

Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> where attending some days, (but in vain) the coming of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
persons who were promised to be sent thither, for concluding a finall peace,
complaints were dayly brought unto them of the oppressions used by the Lord of
<hi>Kinfawns,</hi> whom Queen Regent had placed Provost in the town of <hi>Perth.</hi> The
Earle of <hi>Argile</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames</hi> did hereupon write to the Queen, shewing how at
her speciall desire they had travelled with the Congregation then being at <hi>Perth,</hi>
and brought them to accept of the conditions propounded by her self: the breach
whereof chiefly in one point, that is, the placing of a Garrison of souldiers in the
town of <hi>Perth,</hi> was no lesse dishonourable to them who had given their promises to
the contrary, then it was grievous to the people: Therefore they desired the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
might be removed, and the town restored to the former liberty.</p>
               <p>No answer returning,<note place="margin">The Lords be siege <hi>Perth.</hi>
                  </note> the Lords resolved to expulse the Garrison by force, and
coming to <hi>Perth</hi> the 24. of <hi>Iune,</hi> they summoned the Provost, Captains and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to render, assuring them, if they held out, and that it happened any one to be
killed in the assault, all their lives should pay for it. The Provost and Captains
answered, That they had promised to keep the town for Queen Regent, and would
to the last drop of their bloud defend the same. As these things were in doing,
the Earle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> the Lord <hi>Areskin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Bormatyne,</hi> Justice Clerk,
came by direction of the Queen to perswade the Lords to delay the siege, at least
for some dayes: but they refused to defer it the space of one houre, praying them,
if they loved the safety of the besieged, to advise them to render; for if any harm
should be done in the assault, their lives should answer it. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> offending that
his intercession availed not, left them without a farewell.</p>
               <p>Then were the Provost and Captains again summoned, but they exspecting no
sudden assault, and being confident that the Queen would send relief, answered as
before; whereupon the Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> that lay on the West quarter began to batter
the walls with his munition. The men of <hi>Dundy</hi> who lay upon the East side, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the town in like manner with their peeces, which put the besieged in fear;
so as considering their own weakness, and doubting the succourse should come too
late, they demanded a <hi>Parlee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Perth</hi> yeelded upon Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</note> wherein it was agreed, that if the Queen did not send
relief within the space of 12. houres, they should depart and go forth of the town
with their weapons and ensignes displayed. Thus was the town yeilded, <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fawns</hi>
expulsed, and the Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> repossessed in his charge, and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
restored to their Liberties.</p>
               <p>The next day the Abby of <hi>Scone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Abbey of <hi>Scone</hi> demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> situate a mile above <hi>Perth,</hi> was burnt to ashes

company was killed by a shot from the house, as by no means could they be
pacified.</p>
               <p>Intelligence in the mean time coming to the Lords, that the Queen was of minde
to place a Garrison of <hi>French</hi> souldiers in <hi>Striveling</hi> to stop that passage and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Professors beyond the river of <hi>Forth</hi> from those of the South, they made
haste to prevent her, and rising at midnight came early in the morning to the town,
and immediately after their coming pulled all the Monasteries to the ground. The
Altars and Images in all the Churches within and about the town were broken and
defaced,<note place="margin">The Abbey of Cambuskehneth ruined.</note> and the Abbey of <hi>Cambuskenneth</hi> ruined and cast down. Three dayes they
abode at <hi>Striveling,</hi> and on the fourth marched towards <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> doing the like
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50008:76"/>
at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> which is in the way. The rumour of their approach, though they
were but few in number (for they passed not three hundred men in ally did so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the Queen and the companies that were with her, as with all the haste they could
make, they fled to <hi>Dumbar.</hi> The Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi> who for the time was Provost of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>

                  </note>
and took upon him the protection of the <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Gray Friers,</hi> abandoned
the charge, and left all to the spoile of the multitude, who before the arriving of
the Lords had demolished all the monasteries within the Town, and carried away
whatsoever they found in the same. It is strange to think how by so weak means in
such a disorderly way those things should have been wrought, seeing upon the least
shew of resistance the enterprisers would in all probability have lest their attempt.
But God put such a fear in the adversaries hearts, as they did flee, none pursuing.</p>
               <p>Queen Regent not knowing how to redresse these things,<note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Queen Regent.</note> gave forth a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
wherein she declared, <q>That having perceived a seditious tumult to be
raised by a part of the Lieges, who named themselves the <hi>Congregation,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of Religion had taken Armes, she by the advice of the Lords of the
Privie Councel, for satisfying every mans conscience, and pacifying the present
troubles, had made offer to call a Parliament in <hi>Ianuary</hi> next, or sooner if they
were pleased, for establishing an universal order in matters
of Religion by the
advice of the Estates, and in the mean time to suffer every man live at Liberty,
serving their conscience without any trouble, untill further order were taken.
And because much appeared to consist upon the state of the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
she in like manner had offered to permit the inhabitants to use what manner of
Religion they would during that time, to the end none might have just cause to
say, that they were forced to any thing against their mindes. But that they of the
congregation rejecting all reasonable offers, had by their actions clearly shewed,
that it is not Religion, nor any thing pertaining thereto that they seek but onely
the subversion of authority, and the usurpation of the Crowne. In testimony
whereof they daily brought <hi>English</hi> men into their houses that come with messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
unto them, and returned answers back to <hi>England,</hi> and of late had violently
possessed the Palace of <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi> and intromitted with the Irons of the <hi>Mint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi>
one of the chief things that concerned the Crown. Wherefore she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all persons belonging to the said congregation, (the inhabitants of the
Burgh excepted) to depart forth of the town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> within six houres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the charge, as likewise all that were of their society to forsake them, and
live obedient to the authority, except they would be reputed and holden tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
to the Crown, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Together with this Proclamation rumors were dispersed,<note place="margin">Rumours dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed to the prejudice of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that the Lords of the
Congregation had conspired to deprive the Queen Regent of her authority, and
to disinherit the Duke of <hi>Chattelerault,</hi> and his heirs of their succession and title to
the Crown. These rumours were believed of divers, and prevailed so farre, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that assisted the Congregation began to shrink and fall away: in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it was thought needful they should clear themselves. both by their letters to
the Queen, and open Proclamation to the people; which they did in manner
following.</p>
               <p>First in the letters directed to the Queen they said,<note place="margin">The Lords purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selve to the Queen.</note> 
                  <hi>That they had notice given them
of a Proclamation lately made, wherein they were traduced as usurpers of their Soveraigns
authority and invaders of her person, who in absence of their Soveraigns governed the
Realm, which they esteemed to proceed of a sinistrous information made by their enemies, and
was an imputation most false and odious; their intentions being no other, but to abolish ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and superstitious abuses, that did not agree with the word of God, and maintain the
true Preachers thereof from the violence of wicked men. They did therefore beseech her, to
use her authority to that effect, and for other matters she should find them as obedient as
any subjects within the Realm, whereof they promised to give testimony and assurance,
so as they might have safe accesse to her Highnesse.</hi> This was the substance of the letter
which was sent by the Lords <hi>Ruthven</hi> and <hi>Ochil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rie</hi> unto her.</p>
               <p>In the Proclamation they did call God to witnesse,<note place="margin">The Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Lords.</note> 
                  <hi>That such crimes as they were
charged with, never entered into their hearts, and that their only intention was to banish
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50008:76"/>
idolatry, and advance true Religion, and defend the Pre achers thereof, promising to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in all duty towards their Soveraign and her mother their Regent, provided they
might enjoy the liberty of their consciences.</hi> As to the intromission with the Irons of the
<hi>Minthouse,</hi> they said, <hi>That they being born Counsellors of the Realm, and sworne to procure
the prosit thereof; when they understood the subjects to be greatly hurt by the basenesse of the
money which increased the dearth of all necessary wares, they could do no lesse of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
then stay the coyning of more lay money, untill the Nobility and Councel had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
surther deliberation therein; And where it was given out, that they had spoiled the</hi>
Minthouse <hi>of great summes, in that point they did remit themselves to the Declaration of
Mr.</hi> Robert Richardson <hi>Master of the</hi> Mint, <hi>in whose hands they delivered all the gold
and silver both coined and uncoined, which there was found, &amp;c.</hi> For the Intelligence
with <hi>England</hi> nothing was replied: whereby it seemed there was some dealing that
way for expelling the <hi>French</hi> men, which they did not deny, and thought not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
as then openly to professe.</p>
               <p>The Queen taking hold of the last words of the letter sent unto her self,<note place="margin">The Lairds of <hi>Pittarrow</hi> and <hi>Cunningham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> sent to the Queen.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring

with them, did offer a safe conduct to any they pleased: whereupon the
Lairds of <hi>Pittarrow</hi> and <hi>Cunningham-head</hi> were sent in name of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to declare <hi>that their intent and purpose was no other, but that they might enjoy the
liberty of their consciences; and unable Ministers by removed from all Ecclesiastical admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration;</hi>
Christ Jesus <hi>might be truly preached, and his holy Sacraments rightly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred;
and that their Preachers might be licenced to do their offices without molestation,
untill such time as by a general Councel lawfully convened, or by a Parliament within the
Realm, the controversies of Religion should be decided. which things being granted, they
did faithfully promise in all other things dutiful obedience. Onely to be assured of sincere
dealing, they desired that the</hi> French <hi>companies which were to the countrey a burthen,
and fearful to them, might be sent home to their native countrey.</hi>
               </p>

to her daughter, and her self, their demands seemed not unreasonable. But she longed
to speak with some of their number who were of greater authority,</hi> meaning as afterwards
she uttered that her desire was, the <hi>Earl of Argyle</hi> and <hi>Lord Iames</hi> should come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her; for when she saw the <hi>Lord Ruthven</hi> and <hi>Ochil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the Laird of <hi>Pittarrow;</hi> she fell a complaining, that she was not sought in a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
manner, and that they in whom she put her most confidence, had left her in her
greatest need. In end she said, <hi>That she could not be satisfied till she spake with the Earl
of</hi> Argyle, <hi>and Lord</hi> James, <hi>for still she suspected there was some higher purpose amongst
them then religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reported to the Lords,<note place="margin">The Lords suspecting some practice, refuse to send the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> they would not by any means condescend that these
Noblemen should go unto her, doubting some practice against them; for she was
heard say, <hi>That if the means could be found out to divide these two from the rest, she was
sure to prevaile:</hi> one likewise of her chiefe attendants was said to have bragged,
that before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> next both these Noblemen should lose their heads. This
not succeeding, it was agreed that the Duke, the Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> the Lords <hi>Erskin</hi>
and <hi>Summervaile,</hi> with the Abbot of <hi>Kilwining,</hi> and Justice Clerk should meet for
the Queen, with such as the Congregation did appoint, for treating of the best means
to settle a constant and solid peace, and for the part of the Congregation were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Earles of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Glencarne,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruthven, Boyd,</hi> and <hi>Ochiltrie,</hi> the

                  </note> to the number of an hundred on each side, (as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed)
conferred together a whole day, but without any conclusion; for the
Queen seeming to yield unto the free exercise of Religion would have it provided,
that in what place she happened to come, the Ministers should cease from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the Masse only be used. The Lords answered, <hi>That this were to leave them
no Church, for when the Queen pleased, she might change the place of her residence, and
so there could not be any certain exercise of Religion, which were all alike, as to overthrow
it:</hi> In these termes they parted that night, yet the Lords named for the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50008:77"/>
unwilling to break off the conference, said, they would think more of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
and advertise what would be yeelded unto.</p>
               <p>After some deliberation,<note place="margin">The answer of the Lords to the condition proponed.</note> the Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> and <hi>Pittarrow</hi> were remitted with
this answer, <hi>That as they could not impede her to use what exercise of Religion she plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
so could they not agree that the Ministers of Christ should be silenced upon any occasion,
much lesse that the true service of God should give place to superstition and idolatry.
Wherefore they humbly requested (as often they had done) liberty to serve God according to
their consciences, and did beseech her to remove the</hi> French <hi>soulders, otherwise there could
be no firm and solid peace.</hi> The Queen hearing all, replied only that she wished there
might be peace; but to none of the points proponed made she any direct answer.
Whereupon the Noblemen resolved to bide together at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and not depart
till matters were fully composed.</p>
               <p>Newes in this time were brought of the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the second his death,<note place="margin">News of the <hi>French</hi> Kings death.</note>
which put the Lords in some better hopes, but withall made them more carelesse;
for divers, as though nothing was now to be feared, did slide away to attend their
private affaires, and they who remained expecting no invasion, lived secure, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neither watch nor ward, as if there had been no enemy to fear. The Queen on
the other side became more watchful, observing all occasions whereby she might
weaken the faction, and assure her self: So getting notice of the solitude which
was at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> she hasted thither with the companies she had. The Lords adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of her coming, grew doubtful what to do, for howsoever they might save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by flight, they saw the town by their retiring should be lost, and the Church,
which in some good fashion was then established, be utterly cast down; therefore
with the small number they had, they issued forth of the town; and putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in order, stood on the East side of <hi>Craigingate,</hi> to impede the approach of the
<hi>French.</hi> The Duke and Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> who were gone that morning to meet the
Queen, and give her the convoy, laboured to compose things, but prevailed not;
onely that day they kept the parties from falling into an open conflict.<note place="margin">The Queen prepareth to enter into <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </note> The next
day when the Queen, which lay all that night at <hi>Leith,</hi> prepared to enter into the
town by the West port, and that the Lords were advancing to stop her in the way;
the Lord <hi>Areskin,</hi> who untill that time had carried himself a neuter, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to play upon them with the Canon, unlesse they suffered the Queen to enter
peaceably, and without trouble. This it was supposed he did, to make them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the conditions of truce offered the day before, which they seeing no better
way, were content to yeeld unto The Articles were as followeth.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">The Articles of the Truce.</note> That the Congregation, and their adherents, (the inhabitants of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
only excepted) should depart forth of the town, within the space of twenty four
houres, to the end the Queen Regent and her companies may enter peaceably
in the same.</p>
               <p>2. That the Congregation should render the Palace of <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi> with all the
furnishing they found therein, redeliver the <hi>Minthouse</hi> and Printing Irons the next
morning before ten of the clock: and for observing this and the former Article,
the Lord <hi>Ruthven,</hi> and Laird of <hi>Pittarrow</hi> should enter as pledges to the Queen.</p>
               <p>3. That the Lords of the Congregation, and all the members thereof should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
obedient subjects to the King and Queens authority, and to the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
as governing in their place, observing the lawes and customes of the Realm,
as they were used before the raising of this tumult in all things, (the cause of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
excepted) wherein the order after specified, should be followed.</p>
               <p>4. That the Congregation should not trouble nor molest any Churchman by
way of deed, nor make them any impediment in the peaceable enjoying and
uplifting their rents, and that it should be lawful for them to dispone, and use their
benefices and rents, according to the lawes and customes of the Realm, untill the
tenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> next.</p>
               <p>5. That the Congregation should use no force nor violence in casting down of
Churches, religious places, or defacing the ornaments thereof, but the same should
be harmlesse at their hands, untill the tenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> next.</p>
               <p>6. That the town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> should use what Religion they pleased,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50008:77"/>
untill the said day, and none of the Subjects in other parts of the countrey
be constrained against their mindes in matters of that kind.</p>
               <p>7. That the Queen should not interpone her authority, to molest the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Congregation, nor any other their members in their bodies, lands; possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
pensions, or whatsoever other kind of goods they enjoyed; nor yet should any
spiritual or temporal Judges trouble them for the cause of religion, or other action
depending thereupon, untill the said tenth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> but that every man should
live in the mean time according to conscience.</p>
               <p>8. That no man of Warre, <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Scottish,</hi> should be put in Garison within
the town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> only it should be lawful to the souldiers to repaire thither
for doing their lawful affairs; which done, they should retire themselves to their
proper Garisons.</p>
               <p>This truce, and the heads thereof published,<note place="margin">The Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
                  </note> the Lords departed towards <hi>Striveling.</hi>
leaving <hi>Iohn Willock</hi> Minister to serve in the Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> As they
departed, the Duke and Earle of <hi>Huntley</hi> met with them at the Quarry holes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
if any part of the appointment should be violated, to joyn all their forces
for expulsing the <hi>French</hi> out of the Realm: and indeed the Queen was then more
careful nor in former times she had been, to see that no breach should be made;
howbeit many wayes she went about to reestablish the Masse, and bring the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of Religion in contempt.<note place="margin">The Queen desireth the Church of S. <hi>Giles</hi> for the exercise of Masse.</note> In <hi>Edinburgh</hi> she employed the Duke, the Earl of
<hi>Huntley,</hi> and Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi> to deal with the Magistrates and Councel of the Town,
that they would appoint some other Church then S. <hi>Giles</hi> where their Minister
might preach, reserving that Church to her use, and for the exercise of the Masse.
The Magistrates answered, <hi>That S. Giles Church had been the ordinary place of their
meeting to Sermon and other Religious Exercises, and could not be taken from them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a manifest breach of the truce; seeing by one of the Articles it was provided, that the
Preachers of the Congregation should not be molested in any thing they possessed at the
making of the appointment. Huntley</hi> replying, That the Queen meant to keep all
conditions, and desired this onely of their favour; or if they would not change the
place of their preaching,<note place="margin">The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates answer.</note> that at least they would permit Masse to be said either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or after Sermon in the Church of S. <hi>Giles:</hi> They answered, <hi>That they were in
possession of that Church, and would never consent that Idolatry should be there again
erected; or if men would do it violently, they behoved to suffer, and would use
the next remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being refused another device was invented,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Captains and souldiers trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the people in hearing the Sermon.</note> that the <hi>French</hi> Captains, with
their souldiers, should in time of Sermon and prayers keep their walkes in the
Church, and trouble the exercise so much as they could. This they thought
would enforce them to make choice of a more retired place for their Sermons, or
then irritate the people, and breed an occasion of some disorder, so as the breach of
the peace should proceed from them. The insolence was great they committed
in this kind, for they did laugh and talk so loud all the time, as the Preacher could
not be heard, yet was it patiently digested, knowing that an occasion of trouble
was only sought. In other places their behaviour was no better, for at <hi>Leth</hi> they
did cut in pieces the Pulpit erected for the Preachers, and set up the Masse, which
had been suppressed before in that town. The like did they in the Abbey Church,
forcibly abolishing the service of Common Prayers, which there was ordinarily
used. And in what place soever they came, some one disturbance or other they
wrought to the professors of the turth. Herewith a rumour was dispersed
amongst the vulgar, <hi>That it was not Religion as the Congregation pretended, but
an open rebellion they went about; and that their purpose was to disinherit their lawful
Queen, and set up Lord</hi> James <hi>her base brother in her place:</hi> which by divers was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
as truth, and wrought a great alienation of mindes from the cause.</p>
               <p>About the same time came Monsieur <hi>Crook</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman with letters
from the Queen and King <hi>Francis</hi> her husband to Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> full of exprobrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and menacings, as appeareth by the Copies here insert.</p>

raised at this time in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I was much commoved, especially when it
was said that you, to whom my dear wife, my father deceased, and my self have
given so many benefices, should be the head and principall fosterer of the same.
That you should be so forgetfull of our love, and of the duty you have at all
times professed unto the Queen, I would not believe; or if it was so as the same
commonly reporteth, I did think that you were induced by the promises and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
perswasions of others to take the fault upon you whereof they were the
cause, supposing the offence would be esteemed either none, or very small in
your person. This my conceit of you, if it be true, shall be as joyfull to me as
that which should be most joyfull, for I should with by this mean some part of
my displeasure mitigated into which you are worthily fallen, having deceived the
hope which I had of your piety towards God, and your faithfull service towards
my self. Therefore since nothing can be more acceptable to me, then to hear that
controversies are composed, and all things compacted without tumult, according
to law and good order; and since I am perswaded this may be easily done by
your credit, I thought meet to advertise you by these letters, and for the good
will I bear you, I do earnestly request that you will return to the obedience from
which you have foully fallen, that so I may see you carry another minde, then
that which your foolish actions have manifested. This will appear to be so, if
that you apply your diligence to bring those things which now are out of order
in those parts, back again to the ancient and sound form of obedience, which you
know is due to God and me. Otherwise I would have you, and all those that adhere
unto you, perswaded that ere it be long I shall take such punishment of you and
them, as your wickedness deserveth, which I have given the bearer charge to make
known unto you at more length, whom I will you to credit as my self, praying
God, my Cousin, to have you in his protection.</q>

of Gods honour and the Gospel of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> from which if he should
desist it were in effect to renounce his Lord and Saviour. Then this cause onely

this occasion. Being one day in conference with the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> (who then ruled
all things in the <hi>French</hi> Court) and falling in speech of those that professed the
reformed Religion, he did utter his minde too freely in their favours: which was so
ill taken, as it was resolved to call him in question. Of this, and other speeches that
had escaped the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine</hi> in the Court of Parliament, he was advertised,
and thereupon retired quickly from Court, and went to <hi>Geneva;</hi> there he became
acquainted with Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man (who was afterwards imployed in
many honourable Legations to <hi>Scotland</hi>) and came with him into <hi>England,</hi> where he
was much graced by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and by her perswasions induced to promise,
that at his return he should joyn himself with those that sought to expell the <hi>French</hi>
forth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and move his father so far as in him lay, to take part in that cause.
Both which he truly performed; for immediately upon his return he came to the
Noblemen at <hi>Sriveling</hi> and made offer of his assistance in the common quarrell
both of Religion and the liberty of the Countrey. Then going to visit his Father
at <hi>Hamilton</hi> he won him to their side, and reconciling some old grudges betwixt his
father and certain Noblemen, brought them all to meet together at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and
to write a common Letter to Queen Regent,<note place="margin">A letter dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Queen from the Lords.</note> which was to this effect: <q>That it

strengths committed to his trust, and not to suffer himself to be abused with the
promises and policies which they knew would be used. Hereof they did think it
needfull, as they said, to give him warning, not that they stood in doubt of his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
but that they esteemed it their duty to advertise him of the common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and to assure him, if by violence any should go about to bereave him of those

<hi>Robert Carnagie,</hi> and Mr. <hi>David Borthuick</hi> with a letter of credit to the Duke. That
which they had in credit to say was, <hi>that she wondred much at his joyning with the
Lords, or that he should have permitted the Earle of</hi> Arrane <hi>his son take that course; and
to advise him to come and stay with her at Court; or if they could not obtain that point, that
they should disswade him from taking part with them.</hi> The Duke asking what the Queen
meant to do concerning the <hi>fortification at Leth</hi> and <hi>dispatch of the</hi> French <hi>men;</hi> they
said, <hi>If all things were put in the Queen will, she would be gracious enough.</hi> Whereunto
he replayed, <hi>That both he and the rest of the Lords would most willingly serve her, so as
she would be ruled by the counsell of</hi> naturall Scottish men; <hi>but so long as she kept about
her strangers, who were a trouble and great to the Countrey, he beleeved no wise
man would give either him, or them advise to put themselves in her hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This answer reported to the Queen,<note place="margin">A Proclamation given forth by the Queen.</note> because she perceived the arriving of the
<hi>French</hi> souldiers to be generally ill taken, she gave forth a Proclamation; <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
complaining of the calumnies dispersed against her by wicked people, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that she had broken the appointment made with the Congregation at <hi>Leth,</hi>
(which she said was onely to entertain division in the Realm) by receiving of
<hi>French</hi> forces which they aggredged so far against all reason, it not being an Article
of the appointment; that albeit for every <hi>Frenchman</hi> that was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there
were a hundreth at her command, there should not a jot that was promised be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
nor the least alteration be made in any thing, if the Congregation did in
like manner faithfully keep their part. Therefore willed all good subjects not to
give eare to such informations, nor suffer themselves to be led thereby from their
due obedience, assuring them that they should ever finde with her truth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and a motherly love towards all loyall subjects.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Besides the Proclamation,<note place="margin">The Queen seeketh to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite the Lords</note> she imployed in the
Countrey some whom she especially trusted, to inform the Subjects of her good
meaning; the principalls were, Mr. <hi>Iames Balfoure</hi> Officiall of <hi>Lothian,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Thomas</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Scots</hi> sons to the Laird of <hi>Balwery,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Carnagy</hi> and
some others. Neither did she omit to deal with the specials of the Congregation,
sending Sir <hi>Iohn Bannatyne</hi> Justice Clerk to the Lord <hi>Ruthven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions used.</note> with many liberall
promises, if he would leave the faction, and Mr. <hi>Iohn Spence</hi> of <hi>Condy</hi> to Lord
<hi>Iames</hi> with a letter bearing this effect; <q>That having understood the cause of
his departing from her, to be the love he bare to Religion: Albeit she did mislike
the same, yet knowing his minde, and the mindes of other Noble men to be so far
bent that way, as there was no possiblity to reclaim them, she had now resolved
to tolerate their profession, and at their own sights, to grant such liberty as might
stand with the common policy of the Realm and their Soveraigns honour. As
for the men of Warre, and fortification at <hi>Leth</hi> so much complained of, she said,
that some had given her to understand, that it was not the advancement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which was sought, but that the same was made a pretext to overthrow the
authority of his sister, (whereof she beleeved he would never be participant) and
this was the true cause of inbringing the said forces, whereas if suspicions and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
could be removed, she would be well pleased to dimit them; for it grieved
her much to see the troubles that were in the Countrey, neither desired she any
thing more, then a perfect peace and reconciliation, wherein she requested his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
praying him to keep faith and kindness to his sister (who trusted more in
him then in any man living) and to shew her what he desired for his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50008:79"/>
and she would faithfully the same should be performed to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By such policies as these she laboured to disunite the Lords;<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Iames</hi> his Answer.</note> but the love of the
cause, and their own safeties, which they apprehended to consist in their fastnesse
and fidelity to others, kept them together. The many breaches they had also found,
begat in them such a distrust, as nothing, though never so truly meant, could be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
his answer therefore was, <q>That in the matter proponed to him he could
say nothing by himself, for they had all taken oath to have no private dealing with
her, or to make any several addresse for themselves, which for his own part he
would keep unviolate, and how soon the Noblemen were convened, he would
shew what was written unto him, and leave nothing undone, that served to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
peace in the Realm; provided the glory of God was not interessed:
neither doubted he if she were found as tractable as by her letter she professed,
but she would obtain of the rest that which might in reason content her. Further
he said, that he had communicated to her servant some things that misliked
him in her proceedings with a true heart, which he wished of God she, and
all men knew.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When as Queen Regent perceived these means could not divide them,<note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Queen, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of <hi>Leth.</hi>
                  </note> she gave
forth a new Proclamation of this tenor. <q>That whereas the Duke of <hi>Chattellerault</hi>
had directed his missives unto all the parts of the Realm, informing that the <hi>French</hi>
men lately arrived, were begun to plant in <hi>Leth</hi> for the ruine of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and that the fortification made there was a purpose devised in <hi>France</hi> to
bring the subjects under servitude, which he and his partakers could not pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
endure, she esteems it needful for the manifestation of her proceeding
since the last appointment, to make the Declaration following: First, that divers
of the Congregation, and those not of the meanest sort, had violated the said ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
in sundry heads, yet she, in hope that they would have returned to
their duties, did connive at many things, and took no notice of their doings, till
of late (having perceived by their frequent messages to, and from <hi>England,</hi> and
by the defection of many great personages from her obedience, that there was
some other purpose in hand, then the establishing of Religion) she was forced to
have her recourse to the law of nature, and as a bird that is pursued will provide a
nest for it self, and for her followers: for which cause she had made choice of the
town of <hi>Leth,</hi> as a place most convenient, being her daughters property, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
no person could lay claim; a place fortified of old, and such as made best
for her safety. Further she said, that it was not religion that they sought, but a
meer rebellion they were entred into against their Soveraigns, as appeared by
many evidences. First, by the taking of <hi>Broughtie</hi> Castle, and expulsing the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
thereof by some of the Congregation: Next, by the contempt of the offer
made by her self unto the Lord Duke, when he complained of the fortification
of <hi>Leth,</hi> that if they would cause amend the wrongs committed against the Lawes
of the Realm, she would do what in reason they could require. Thirdly, by the
charges he had sent to the free Burghs to chuse such Magistrates as they thought
would assist them in their purpose. And fourthly, by the witholding of provision,
against all humanity, from her and from her family. All which things to those
that had any eyes made more then manifest, that it was no other but a plain usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of authority they went about; the particulars whereof she had certainly
understood, it being detected unto her, that the Earl of <hi>Arrane</hi> had joyned with
the Congregation for no other end, and that the Crown was promised by them
unto him: yet she no way doubting of the subjects good affection, and that they
would when need should be, stand in defence of their Soveraigns right against all
pretenders, thought meet to give them warning of these practices, and prohibit
the Lieges to put themselves in Armes, or take part with the Duke, and his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
&amp;c.</q>
                  <note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and some Doctors of <hi>Sorbon</hi> active at <hi>Leth.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>Pellence</hi> Bishop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> (he was afterwards Archbishop of <hi>Sent,</hi> and

of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> Doctor <hi>Furmer,</hi> Doctor <hi>Brochet,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Ferretier.</hi> Monsieur
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50008:80"/>
                  <hi>le Broche</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Knight, gave them the convoy with two thousand foot. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
gave out, that they were come to dispute with the Preachers of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
The other two pretended a Legation, and sent to some of the Nobility re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
at the time in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to desire a hearing. It was answered, <hi>That they came
not as Ambassadours, but as enemies, to bragge and threaten them with Armes, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they needed not have brought so many armed souldiers in their company. If they meant
to treat with weapons in their hands, they would likewise fortify themselves, and make it seen
that they were not moved to any thing by compulsion, but guided by reason: nor would they
have them think they were sorude and ignorant, as to fall in reasoning with adversaries,
that might force them to conditions at their pleasure. Wherefore if they desired peace and
quietnesse, as was pretended, it should be fittest to dimit these for ain souldiers, and seek to
have matters composed according to reason and Justice.</hi> This answer given, there was
no more heard of the Legation, nor of the Doctors disputes.</p>
               <p>The Lords in the mean time published a Declaration answering the other late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made by Queen Regent,<note place="margin">A declaration published by the Lords.</note> wherein first they declared, <q>That as they had often
complained of the inbringing of <hi>French</hi> souldiers, and the manifold oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
done by them, so they could not but seek redresse thereof by all means, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the same tended to an open conquest of the countrey, and the laying upon
their necks an intolerable servitude; for whereas the Queen did pretend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of divers great Personages from her obedience, and the frequent messages
to, and from <hi>England,</hi> to be the cuase of their inbringing; it is well known that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the arrival of these strangers, there was no such defection, but all lived peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and obedient, according to the appointment made by her self. And for the
Messages to <hi>England,</hi> time will make manifest that the support craved was to no
other end but to maintain Religion, and suppresse idolatry; wherein they think
they have done nothing against their duties, it being lawful for them where their
own power faileth, to seek help and assistance, wheresoever they may have it. Next
touching the convenience of <hi>Leth</hi> for a place of fortification; they grant it is a
port very fit to receive strangers; but had the Queen intended no more then
her own security, <hi>Dumbar, Blackness,</hi> and other forts already built, would have
better served to that use. And where she called <hi>Leth</hi> her daughters property, they
answered that it was notoure, the summes payed to the Laird of <hi>Restalrig</hi> Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of <hi>Leth</hi> were disbursed by the inhabitants, and a large taxation given to her
self upon promise, that their town should be erected into a Burgh royal; in place
of which, some of the indwellers were expulsed from their own houses, others
robbed of their substance, and all that chused to remain there, kept in such fear
and terrour, as in effect they esteemed nothing their own. Neither was this only
done to those that professed themselves reformed, but to all the inhabitants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently;
which shew clearly, that the <hi>French</hi> did mind nothing lesse, then to
subdue the whole nation, if it lay in their power. And where it was said, that the
town of <hi>Leth</hi> was fortified of old, the same was never done without the consent of
the Nobility and Estates of the Realm, whereas the present fortification was made
expresly against their wills signifying to her in writing. Concerning the Earl
of <hi>Arrane,</hi> and their purpose to place him in authority, they took God to record,
that the same never entered into their hearts; and that neither the said Earl, nor
any pertaining unto him, did ever move them in such a matter; which if they had
done, they were not so foolish as to promise that, which afterwards they must
needs have repented. Then for the particulars adduced to qualifie their intended
rebellion, they answered, that the taking of <hi>Broughty</hi> was to prevent the danger
that might have ensued, if the <hi>French</hi> should have planted tin that place as they
had done at <hi>Leth,</hi> whereof the conjectures were not obscure. As to the Dukes
misregard of her offer, they did remit the truth of that, to the report of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
imployed by her self. Further it was said, that they had directed charges to
the free Burghs to elect Magistrates at their appetites; and truth was, that some
towns askt their advice in this businesse, and that the answer given them was, that
if they elected such as feared God, and loved equity, and justice, they could not erre
in their choice. But that she should object this, seemed strange, seeing it was
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50008:80"/>
known, that she her self did force the town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to take Magistrates of
her appointment, and against their own liking. Lastly, for the impeding of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
provisions to her and her family, they utterly denied the same; only they
had taken order to stay the furnishing of strangers (that oppressed the countrey)
with victuals, and did forthink the same was not sooner and more strictly done:
concluding, that seeing nature did oblige them to love their countrey, and the
oath they had given to be true to the Commonwealth, forced them to hazard
whatsoever God had given them in defence thereof; they being Counsellors
of the Realm by birth, could not forbear to seek that by force of Arms, which
hitherto had been denied them. Therefore required all natural <hi>Scottish</hi> men to
judge between the Queen and them, and not to abstract their just and dutiful sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from their native countrey in so needful a time, assuring them who did
otherwise, that they should be esteemed betrayers of the Kingdome into the hands
of strangers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Declaration made, the Lords assembling their forces,<note place="margin">The Lords come to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and write unto the Queen.</note> came to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
the eighteenth of <hi>October,</hi> and on the same day Queen Regent by the counsel of
the <hi>French</hi> men entered into <hi>Leth,</hi> with the Bishops of S. <hi>Andrewes, Glasgow, Dunkeld,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> and some others. The day following they sent a letter to the Queen
declaring, how they were convened to see a redresse made of the great disorders
that were in the Realm, especially to have the town of <hi>Leth</hi> made patent for the free
traffique of the subjects, and desiring her to command all the strangers and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
souldiers to depart forth of the same, and to cause the forts to be demolished
which were newly erected; otherwise they would take it for an argument, that her
meaning was to bring the Kingdome into servitude; against which mischief they
would provide by the best means they could. The messenger who carried this
letter, after he had been detained a whole day, was dismissed without answer.</p>
               <p>Mean while the rumour increasing of the Duke his usurpation of the authority,<note place="margin">The Duke purgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his son of any aspiring.</note>
he thought it necessary to make a publick purgation, as he did at the Mercat Crosse
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by sound of Trumpet, protesting both for himself and for his sonne the
Earl of <hi>Arrane,</hi> that none of them did seek any preheminence, nor meant to usurp
the authority Royal, but that they were convened with the rest of the Nobility to
maintain the cause of Religion, and liberty of their native countrey invaded by
strangers; which he desired all men to believe, and not to be carried with the false
and malicious reports of enemies, devised onely to withdraw the hearts of natural
<hi>Scottish</hi> men, from the succour they owed to their oppressed countrey.</p>
               <p>Two dayes after <hi>Robert Forman,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Herald directed to the Lords.</note> Lion Herald, was directed by Queen Regent
to the Lords with this writing. <hi>After commendations we received your lette of the date
at</hi> Edinburgh <hi>the 19. of this instant, which to us appeareth rather to have come from a
Prince to his subjects, then from subjects to those that bear the authority; for answer
whereof we have sent unto you this bearer the Lion Herald King of Armes sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
with our mind, to whom you shall give credit. At</hi> Leth <hi>the</hi> 21. October. 1559.</p>
               <p>The credit,<note place="margin">The credit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald by the Queen.</note> as the Herald related the same, was this; First, he shewed the <hi>Queen</hi>
did think it strange, <hi>there should be any other to command within the Realm besides her
daughter and her husband: in fomer times had been given just causes of suspicion, so
now she perceived clearly by the contents of the last letters, they did not acknowledge
any authority superiour to themselves in the Kingdome.</hi> Next he was desired to ask the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Chatteller ault how his doings did agree with his words and writing, whereby he
promised not only to obey the King himself, but also to keept his sonne of the Earle of</hi> Arrane
<hi>from medling with the present broyles and tumults of the countrey.</hi> Thirdly, in answer
to their letters, he was willed to say, <hi>that it never came in her minde to overthrow
the liberty and lawes of the Realme, much lesse to make a conquest of it; for to whom should
she seek the same, it being her daughter by right, and she already possessed thereof? nor
could they think her so unnatural, as to bereave her own childe of the Crown, and
acquire it to another.</hi> As to the fortification of <hi>Leth,</hi> and entertaining of strangers,
he was bidden ask if any thing in that kind was by her attempted before they did
shew themselves manifest contemners of the Authority, by surprising Townes, and
making bonds both amongst themselves, and with the ancient enemies of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50008:81"/>
and to omit other things, <hi>Could they think it lawful to them to keep an Army
at</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>for pursuing her who was their Regent, and her Councel, and that it should
not be lawful to her to entertain a few companies at</hi> Leth <hi>for her own safety? Belike they
would have her to flee from place to place, as hitherto she hath done, declining their fury.
In their whole letters was there a word sounding to obedience, any overture of peace,
or so much as an intimation of willingnesse in them to have debates composed,
and all things reduced to their former estate? They might cover it as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the pretexts of the Commonwealth, and their care of the good and quiet
thereof, but nothing lesse was meaned by them. For if they desired peace, she hath often
shewed the way unto it. Neither could they be ignorant, that the</hi> French <hi>souldiers would
long before that time have been recalled by the command of their King, if they themselves
had not been a let and hinderance thereto.</hi> Further he was required to say, <hi>that if as yet
they would live obedient to their Soveraigns, she for her own part would refuse no meanes
of concord, nor should she omit any thing that made for the good of the Commonwealth.
Neither was this her mind alone, but the mind likewise of their Soveraigns, who had sent
two chief men, one of the Church estate, and the other an honourable Knight, to signifie so
much unto them, whom they so farre despised, as they would not vouchsafe them either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
or audience,</hi> Lastly, the said Herald, as he was enjoined, did charge the Duke,
the Noblemen and others their assisters and partakers, to depart forth of the Town
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and dissolve their forces under the pain of <hi>lese Majestie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Herald having in this sort delivered his credit,<note place="margin">The Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate upon discharging the Queen of her Regency.</note> the Lords convened in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
with a number of Barons and Burgesses, whom they called to assist. In this
meeting the Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> presiding, declared how the Queen had refused their
Petitions, and that there was no expectation of the yeelding up the Town of <hi>Leth,</hi>
or dimitting the <hi>French</hi> companies by a peaceable treaty, so as now they were to
think of the next course. The reverence of authority, (which as yet was in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Queen Regent) deterred many at first from uttering their mindes, yet after
some short silence, they began to speak of discharging the Queen of her Regencie.
The motion seemed dangerous to some, as wanting example, at least for a long time:
<hi>The like,</hi> they said, <hi>had been sometimes done, but it was alwayes carried under the shew of
authority; they in whose hands the King was at that time, taking upon them in his name
to suspend the present Government. But that the Nobility and Estates without, and against
the Princes consent, should assume that power to themselves, was never heard, and would
be thought strange.</hi> Others held, that <hi>she being a Regent only, might very well be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
to use the name of the King and Queen for authorising of her proceedings, especially
when they were known to be hurtful and pernicious to the whole Kingdomes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The opinion of the Preachers required.</note> In this varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of judgements it was thought meet to take the opinion of the Preachers, and to
that effect M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Willock,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> being called, they delivered their
mindes one after another in this sort. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Willock</hi> first speaking, said,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That albeit Magistracie be Gods Ordinance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Master <hi>Willock</hi> his opinion.</note> 
                  <hi>and that they who bear rule have their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from him, yet their power is not so largely extended, but that the same is bounded,
and limited by God in his word. And albeit God had appointed Magistrates his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
on earth, honouring them with his own title, and calling them</hi> Gods, <hi>yet did he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so establish any, but for just causes they might be deprived; for even as subjects,</hi> said he,
<hi>are commanded to obey their Magistrates, so Magistrates have direction given them for
their behaviour towards those they rule; and God in his word hath defined the duties both of
the one, and the other. In deposing Princes, and those that have borne authority, God did
not alwayes use his immediate power, but sometimes he used other means, such as in his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
he thought good. As by</hi> Asa <hi>he removed</hi> Maacha <hi>his own Mother from the honour
and authority which before she did exerce: By</hi> Jehu <hi>he destroyed</hi> Joram <hi>and the whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of</hi> Achab, <hi>and by divers others he deposed from the Government, those whom he
established before by his own word.</hi> Of these ensamples he inferred, <hi>That since Queen
Regent had denied her chief duty to the subjects of the Realme, which was to minister Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
indifferently, to preserve them from the invasion of strangers, and to suffer the word
of God to be freely preached: seeing also she was a maintainer of superstition, and despised
the counsell of the Nobility, he did think they might justly deprive her from all regiment
and authority over them.</hi>

                  <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> being next desired to speak, after he had approved all which his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had said, did adde this more, <hi>That the iniquity of the Queen Regent ought not to

from giving any opinion in these matters, for they might be sure to have it
cast in their teeth, to the scandal of their profession. Neither was the opinion they
gave sound in it self, not had it any warrant in the word of God; for howbeit the
power of the Magistrates be limited, and their office prescribed by God, and that
they may likewise fall into great offences, yet it is no where permitted to subjects to

by Queen Regent; namely, the pursuing of the Barons and Burgesses of the Realm
with open hostility, no proces nor order of law being first used; nor they called and

forth of the Realm, against the advice of the Councel; The altering of the Lawes
and Customes of the Realm, especially in graces and pardons granted to the Lieges,
and the obstinate refusing of the Nobility and Barons their request, when they
sought redress of these evils) they in name and by the authority of their Soveraigns
did suspend the Commission granted to Queen Regent, discharging her of all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
untill the next Parliament that should be called by their advice, and consent.
Prohibiting likewise the officers and others serving her, under colour of the said au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to exerce their offices from henceforth, and to coyn either gold or silver
without express consent of the Councel and Nobility, conform to the lawes of the
Realm. This Act ordained to be published in all the head Burghes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
was subscribed in this manner; <hi>By us the Nobility and Commons of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants

               <p>Assoon as this Act was by found of Trumpet proclaimed,<note place="margin">The Herald dimitted, and the Act inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to the Queen by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Lords.</note> the Herald whom
they had detained two dayes, was dismissed with an answer conceived in this form:
<q>By the letters and instructions you have sent by the Herald unto us, we take up
how ill you are set against God his truth, the liberty of this our native countrey,
and the common good of all. To defend these, as in duty we are bound, we in
the name of our Soveraign Lord and Lady suspend your Commission, and all
administration publick which you thereby may pretend, as being assured that
your proceedings are direct contrary to their mindes, which we know are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the weal and common good of the countrey. And seeing you refuse us
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50008:82"/>
who are natural born subjects of the Realm to be your Counsellors, we will
no longer acknowledge you for our Regent, and lawful Magistrate, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the authority (if any you have committed unto you by our Soveraignes) is
for most just and weighty reasons suspended by us in their name, whose Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
we are by birth, in these matters chiefly, that concern the safety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And howbeit we have determined, with the hazard of our lives to set that
Town at liberty, wherein you have most injustly planted your mercenary soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and strangers, yet for the reverence we bear unto you, as being the mother
of our Queen, we earnestly beseech you to depart thence at this time, when we
constrained by publick necessity are by force of Armes to recover it. We further
request you to bring forth of the Town with your self, all that carry themselves
as Ambassadours, and are come unto the countrey, either for taking up of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
or assisting the government of publick affaires, within the space of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four houres, and to cause the Captains, Lieutenants, and souldiers (whose
blood we would gladly spare because of the old amity and friendship betwixt us
and the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> which the marriage of our Soveraign Lady to that King,
ought rather to encrease then diminish) to remove themselves within the same
space.</q> This letter was subscribed, <hi>By all the Nobility and Barons present, the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
third of</hi> October, 1559.</p>
               <p>The 25.<note place="margin">The town of <hi>Leth</hi> summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> day of the same moneth was the Town summoned, and all the <hi>Scots</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> men, of whatsoever state and degree, commanded to leave the same within
the space of 12. houres. This denied, and defiance given on both sides, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
some light skirmishings, without any great slaughter. The Lords had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to enter the Town by scalade, and were preparing ladders for that use, which
being dressed in S. <hi>Giles</hi> Church, did impede the ordinary meetings to Sermon and
Prayer, to the great offence to the Preachers, who in their Sermons did sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
that intermission of religious exercises, foretelling that <hi>the enterprise could
have no good successe, which brought with it in the beginning such a neglect of God his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>
And so indeed it proved, for upon the sudden they became so terrified, as not
only was that purpose of the scalade broken, but very nigh they were to have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
forsaken the cause. The Duke grew fearful by the falling away of some to
the Queen, the souldiers mutinied in default of their pay; they found their most
secret counsels also disclosed, and had lately intercepted letters with a servant of
<hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> as he was going to <hi>Leh,</hi> giving intelligence of all their purposes.
These things with some others more, did cast them in a great diffidence one of
another.</p>
               <p>But such as were of better courage,<note place="margin">Moneys fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they sent to borrow from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> taking counsel how to remedy those evils,
made it their first care to content the souldiers. And because there was no way to
do this, but by present money, it was devised that a collection should be made
amongst the Lords and Barons; by whom some being unprovided, others nigard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disposed, the summe could not be made up which was required. Thereupon it
was agreed that every Nobleman should give his silver plate to be coyned for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of the present necessity. But when that came to be done, the irons and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Minthouse</hi> could not be found. This failing, their only hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
was from <hi>England,</hi> and that they considered could not come in due time;
whereupon they resolved to use their private credit with Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Iames Crofts</hi> (who had the charge of the Town of <hi>Barwick</hi>) and borrow of them
some moneys.</p>
               <p>In this businesse Sir <hi>Iohn Cockburn</hi> of <hi>Ormston</hi> was employed, whose journey
was not so closely carried, but the Queen had notice both of it and his errand.
Thereupon she dealeth with the Earl of <hi>Bothwell</hi> to lie in <hi>Ormston</hi> his way,<note place="margin">The Laird of <hi>Ormston</hi> surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Bothwel,</hi> and spoiled of his money.</note> and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
him with the money at his return. The Earl had but a few dayes before sworn
solemnly to be no enemy to the Lords, and had given hopes to joyn with them,
so as no danger was suspected from him: yet not regarding his oath, he came upon
the Gentleman at unawares, and after some wounds given him took him prisoner,
and robbed him of four thousand Crowns, which he had received in loan. The ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50008:82"/>
hereof coming to the Lords, the Earl of <hi>Arrane,</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames</hi> taking some
companies of horse with them, made towards <hi>Creichton,</hi> whither <hi>Bothwel</hi> (as they
were advertised) was gone, But finding that he was escap'd they seised upon the
house,<note place="margin">The house of <hi>Creichion</hi> on taken.</note> and gave it in keeping to Captain <hi>Forbes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same day that this happened,<note place="margin">The Provost of Dundy put to flight by the souldiers at <hi>Leth.</hi>
                  </note> the Provost of <hi>Dundy</hi> with his Townesmen,
and a few mercenary souldiers, went down towards <hi>Leth</hi> carrying with them some
pieces of Artillery, which he planted on a hill near unto the Town. The <hi>French</hi>
had warning, that most of the horsemen were gone about other businesse, and
knowing the footmen to be few, made a salley upon them with some compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
The Townesmen of <hi>Dundy</hi> sustained the fight for a while, trusting to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by the souldiers, but they turned backs in the very beginning of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
the townesmen were forced to retire, keeping still their ranks, till a cry was
raised that the <hi>French</hi> were entring by <hi>Leth</hi> Winde, to cut them off from the
Town. This caused such a perturbation, as every man took the way he held best
for his safety; and in the flight (as commonly it falleth) one hindering another, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were overthrown, some ten souldiers were killed, Captain <hi>Mowak</hi> taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and Mr. <hi>Charles Geddes</hi> servant to the Master of <hi>Maxwell.</hi> The flight held to
the middest of the Canon gate, where the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and Lord <hi>Robert</hi> Abbot
of <hi>Halirudhouse</hi> turned the Chase, and pursuing the <hi>French,</hi> made them flie as fast
as they followed. This little advantage of the <hi>French</hi> made <hi>Bothwel</hi> so insolent, as
he simply refused to restore the moneys he had taken. And thus all hopes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
failing, and the souldiers refusing to serve, some not of the meanest sort, stole
away secretly, the few that remained were distracted in opinions among themselves,
and grew doubtful what to do.</p>
               <p>The fifth of <hi>November</hi> upon advertisement that the <hi>French</hi> were issued forth of

by the enemy, and cut off from the Town. For the <hi>French</hi> had divided their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
in two: one part took the way directly from <hi>Leth</hi> to <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi> the
other marched somewhat more Eastward, and nearer the Sea. The Lords who
were gone as farre as <hi>Restalrig,</hi> beholding the <hi>French</hi> to march towards <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
returned with expedition, fearing the case of the Citizens, and that they themselves
should be cut off; which in all appearance had been done, if the Laird of <hi>Grange</hi>
and <hi>Alexander Whitlaw</hi> with a few horsemen had not kept them in skirmish for a
little time. The other <hi>French</hi> companies that came by <hi>Restalrig</hi> beholding the
Lords retire, made after them, and pursued so hotly, as the Earle of <hi>Arrane,</hi> and
Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> were forced to quit their horses for safety of the foot, who were in
great disorder. Captain <hi>Alexander Halliberton,</hi> a man of good spirit, and forward in
the cause of Religion, staying behinde to hold off the <hi>French,</hi> received divers
wounds, whereof the same night he died. In this conflict there fell some 25. or 30.
men. The Master of <hi>Buchan,</hi> with the Lairds of <hi>Pitmilly, Fairnay,</hi> and some others
of smaller note were taken prisoners.</p>
               <p>A little before this time <hi>William Maitland</hi> of <hi>Lethington</hi> Secretary to the Queen,<note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh the Queen Regent.</note>
perceiving that he was hated of the <hi>French</hi> for the freedom he used in his counsel,
did secretly withdraw himself, and joyned with the Lords. He was earnest to have
them abide together, laying before them the dangers, that might ensue upon their
dissolving, but few or none consenting, conclusion was taken to leave the Town,
and after midnight to depart towards <hi>Striveling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The day after the Lords departing, the <hi>French</hi> went up to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Lords leave <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> possesse the Town.</note> and took
possession of the Town. All that professed the Religion, were compelled to flie,
and seek their refuge in other places. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Willock</hi> the Minister went unto <hi>England,</hi>

with some contagion by the Sermons preached therein) was of new hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Bishop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> with a number of Ceremonies; and such triumphing
was amongst the Popish sort, as they thought the game to be theirs. The Queen
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50008:83"/>
sent advertisement to <hi>France,</hi> requiring new forces with expedition, to make the
victory absolute. Whereupon the Marquesse <hi>D'Elbeuf,</hi> and Count <hi>Martiques</hi> a
young Nobleman were directed with some companies both of foot and horse;<note place="margin">The Queen sendeth for new forces from <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> but

the Bishop taking with him a number of <hi>French</hi> men, and assisted by the Lords
<hi>Semple, Seaton, and Rosse,</hi> marched hastily thither, recovered the Castle, (for the Lords

<hi>Scotland</hi> were once subdued by the <hi>French,</hi> entreating her aid and assistance for their

or no any supply should be granted: some maintaining that it was a thing of ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to assist the subjects of another Prince in their Rebellion, and that the same
might draw upon themselves a dangerous warre. Others holding that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged

residing at <hi>Fife,</hi> Thereupon taking their journey to <hi>Striveling,</hi> they spoyled <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgow</hi>
in the way, with the lands of <hi>Kinneil,</hi> and all that they understood belonged
to the Duke in those parts. The like pillage they made in <hi>Striveling,</hi> and passing
the Bridge they kept the side of the River, robbing all the villages, and Coast
Towns which were in their way. It was their purpose to have kept the coast still,
till they came to S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and then to have fortified the Castle, and City: but
the Earl of <hi>Arrane</hi> and Lord <hi>Iames</hi> hearing that they were past <hi>Striveling,</hi> sent some
forces under the charge of the Lord <hi>Ruthven,</hi> a Nobleman of good experience and
courage, to withstand their attempts. In his company was the Earl of <hi>Sutherland,</hi>
who was come to the Lords some dayes before, directed as he gave out by the Earl
of <hi>Huntley</hi> to make offer of his assistance; howbeit his principal Commission was

together, keeping the <hi>French</hi> souldiers (that were numbred to be 4000.) in such
work that the countrey was generally saved from spoile, and the hurt and damage
that was done, falling for the greatest part upon their friends and confederates; For
of all that were professed enemies to the <hi>French,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Grange</hi> onely had his
house blown up with Gunpowder; whereas the Laird of <hi>Weimes, Seafield, Balmaito,
Balwery, Balgony, Dury</hi> and others of the <hi>French,</hi> faction, were forced to furnish
them with cornes, cattel, and what else they stood in need of; or if the souldiers
lacked any thing, the readiest goods upon their ground were taken to provide them.
Hereof divers complaints being made to the <hi>French</hi> Captains, the poor owners were
scornfully answered, that their goods were of the Congregation; and if they made
faith that the same were their own proper goods, they were railed upon, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
cowards and unworthy niggards, that made more accompt of their goods then
of their friends. Such as professed Religion, and expected the worst, putting
their goods out of the way, or standing to their defence, were in a much better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and <hi>Grange</hi> who had his house cast down as I have said, avenged himselfe

purpose; the Captain with his souldiers retiring to a little countrey house, defended
themselves a while with their shot, and dangerously wounded <hi>David Kircaldy</hi> brother
to the Laird of <hi>Grange,</hi> and a Gentleman called <hi>Robert Hamilton,</hi> who were both at
first supposed to be slain. The <hi>French</hi> had the advantage, for they were within ditches,
and <hi>Le Batu</hi> having taken a little house, kept the gate with some Harquebuses. <hi>Grange</hi>

               </p>
               <p>7. <q>That if it should happen the <hi>French</hi> men at any time thereafter to invade or
cause the Realm of <hi>England</hi> to be invaded, they should furnish the number of

should remain in <hi>England</hi> for the space of six moneths, and be exchanged by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of new hostages, for six moneths to six moneths, or four moneths to
four moneths, at the pleasure of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the pledges alwayes being of the like

be had betwixt both the Realms for peace and concord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>10. <q>That the Duke and Nobility joyned with him being Earles and Barons
of Parliament, should subscrive and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or thirty dayes at the furthest, after the delivering of the said hostages; and
should procure, and perswade all others of the Nobility that should joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thereafter with the said Duke for the cause above specified, to subscrive
and seal the same Articles within the space of twenty dayes after their conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
upon requisition made by them of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>11. <q>That the said Duke and Nobility joyned with him, certainly understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Queens Majesty of <hi>England</hi> was moved to grant the present support
only upon respect of Princely honour and neighbourhood, for defence of the
freedom of <hi>Scotland</hi> from conquest, and not of any sinister intent; did by these
presents testifie and declare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that neither they nor any of them do mean by this
contract to withdraw their due obedience from their Soveraign Lady the Queen,
or yet to withstand the <hi>French</hi> King her husband, in any lawful thing which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to the subversion of the just and ancient liberties of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the
preservation whereof they acknowledge themselves bound to spend their goods,
lands, and lives.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This contract of the date at <hi>Berwick</hi> the 27. of <hi>February</hi> 1559. was confirmed by
the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and a Patent thereof delivered under the great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to the Duke and Nobility: the Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> did in like manner ratifie the
same by their subscriptions, at the Camp before <hi>Leth</hi> the tenth of <hi>May</hi> following.</p>
               <p>How soon the <hi>French</hi> heard that the Lords were removed from <hi>Dysert,</hi>

                  </note> they
marched forward according to their first purpose towards S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and kept the
Coast, partly because of the ships which carried their victuals, partly by reason of
a great snow which then was fallen, and made the nearest wayes unpassable. After
that they had crossed the water of <hi>Leven,</hi> and were come unto <hi>Kincraige,</hi> they espied
a fleet of ships bearing up the Firth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they did apprehend to be a supply sent
unto them; but when they saw them fall upon the ships that carried their victuals
they became doubtful, and shortly after, were assured by a boat which had spoken
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was an <hi>English</hi> Navy sent to the support of the Congregation, and
that a land Army was also prepared to come into <hi>Scotland.</hi> These newes troubled
them not a little, and made them doubtful what course to take; for to return by
<hi>Striveling</hi> was a long way, and to transport the souldiers to the other coast, there
were no vessels, so as they feared to be kept from joyning with their fellows at <hi>Leth.</hi>
Their resolution therefore was to make the longer journeys, as they did; and
setting to the way the same night, they came on the third day to <hi>Leth,</hi> having lost
divers of their company by the way.</p>

when he heard that the <hi>English</hi> forces were advancing, he sent to the Lords, and
made offer to joyn with them. A meeting to this effect was appointed at <hi>Perth,</hi>
whither he came, and staying some three dayes, departed homewards upon promise

               <p>The Noblemen resolving to fall presently to work,<note place="margin">A letter from the Lords to the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</note> did yet think to move the
Queen of new for dismissing the <hi>French</hi> companies, and to that effect they directed
a letter of this tenor. <hi>Madame, We have often before this time by letters and messages
been instant with you to remove the</hi> French <hi>souldiers out of the Realm, who now the space of
a year and more have oppressed the poor people with evils intolerable, and threaten to bring
this Kingdom under a miserable servitude. But seeing we could not prevaile by our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
requests, we were forced to mean our estate to the Queen of</hi> England <hi>our nearest neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and intreat her support for expulsing these strangers by Armes (if otherwise we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obtain it.) And now albeit she pitying our distresses hath taken us and our cause in her
protection, yet for the duty we owe unto you as the Mother of our Queen, and the desire we
have to eschew the shedding of Christian blood, we have advised once again to intreat the
dismission of these</hi> French <hi>men with their Captains and Commanders, for whose commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
transport the Queen of</hi> England <hi>will be pleased to lend her Navy, and give to others
of them a safe passage by land. If this condition shall be rejected, we take God and men to
record, that it is not malice nor hatred which moveth us to take Armes, but that we are
driven by necessity to use extreme remedies for preserving the commonwealth, and saving
our selves, our estates, and posterities from utter ruine: neither shall we for any peril that
can happen (howsoever we suffer many wrongs and indignities, and are daily in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of worse) forsake that dutiful obedience which we owe to our Queen, or yet resist the King
her husband, in any thing that shall not tend to the subversion of the ancient liberties of
this Kingdome. Therefore most gracious Queen, we beseech you again and again, to
weigh the equity of our Petition, the inconveniences of warre, and to consider how needful
it is that thus your daughters afflicted Kingdom should be put to some rest and quietnesse.
If so you do, you shall give to all nations a testimony of your moderation, and procure the
peace of the greatest part of Christendome.</hi>

to the West side of the water of <hi>Leth.</hi> more near the walls then before. The last
of <hi>April</hi> a sudden fire kindling within the Town, burned all that night, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
many houses, and consumed a great part of the souldiers provision. During
this burning, the <hi>English</hi> playing continually with the Canon upon the places
where they saw the flames rising to stop the quenching of the fire; and entring the
ditches did in the mean time measure the height of the walls to provide ladders for
the scaling which they intended.</p>
               <p>The seventh of <hi>May</hi> having resolved to give an assault,<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> thinking to scale the walls are repulsed.</note> they brought the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
a little before day towards the walls, but they proved too short, and so that
purpose failed. The <hi>English</hi> lost 160. at this enterprise: such as were affected to
the <hi>French,</hi> did hereupon take courage trusting the siege would rise, and the <hi>English</hi>
Army depart but the accident did no way dismay either the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> every
man animating another to constancie and continuance; and about the time came
letters from the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> which greatly confirmed their mindes. Thereby
he charged them not to break up the siege by any means, assuring they should not
lack men, so long as any could be had between <hi>Twede</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> (for in those bounds
he commanded as Lieutenant) and giving hopes to come in person to the Camp, he
caused his Pavilion to be set up, and sent thither his officers, and provision. Shortly
after, a fresh supply came from <hi>England</hi> of 2000. men, which made all former los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to be forgotten. The <hi>French</hi> for some dayes made divers fallies, but were ever
put to the worst; for all the hurt which fell either to <hi>Scottish</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> from that
time untill the rendring of the Town, was only the losse of two men, <hi>Robert Colvil</hi>
of <hi>Cleish</hi> Master houshold to Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> a Gentleman much commended both for
wisdom and valour, (he was wounded in the thigh by the shot of a great piece from
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50008:86"/>
the town, and died of it within two houres) and <hi>Alexander Lochart</hi> brother to the
Laird of <hi>Barre,</hi> who lying too open in the trenches was discovered by the enemy,
and shot in the head.</p>

forth in tears, she asked pardon of then all whom any way she had offended,
professing that she did forgive those who had injured her in any sort, and imbracing
all the Nobles one by one, kissing them, she took her farewell. To others of meaner
sort that stood by, she gave her hand, and so they departed. Afterwards, disposing
her self for another world, she sent for <hi>Iohn Willock</hi> the Preacher, who was then

not to be doubted, but the same happened much against her will, neither had they
fallen out at all, if affaires had been carried according to her mind. But she was to
govern by direction, and in all matters of weight must needs attend responses from
the <hi>French</hi> Court, which were the Oracles whereby all affairs at those times were
framed. This made her in matters of Religion more severe then of her own nature

a bitter and hateful spite against her, forging dishonest things, which was never

in passion, he maketh in an argument of her cruel and inhumane disposition; but
when he cometh to speak of her end he will have all her sickness, and death (though
in none of the two there was any thing extraordinary) to be the judgement of God
inflicted upon her, as if death and the ordinary visitations which bring death, were
not common to Princes as well as others. Then for her burial, because by direction
of her friends, and (as some say) at her own desire order was taken to carry her corps
to the Abbey of <hi>Rhemes</hi> in <hi>Campaigne,</hi> where her sister was Abbesse, which of all
necessity required a protraction of time, he construed the delay to be the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her inhumanity, and the want of sepulchre in this Kingdom, a prognostick
of the short continuance of her race, and the <hi>Guisian</hi> blood (as he speaks) in this
Realm. Pardon me good Reader for this digression. To detract from the same of
Princes, and miscensure their words and actions, favoureth of malice, and no way
becometh a Christian, much lesse a Minister of Christ.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the death of Queen Regent truce was taken for hearing the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
sent from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A truce taken upon the death of the Queen Regent.</note> who coming to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> entred into
consultation first amongst themselves, upon the best and easiest means to compose
the present quarrels. Then calling to them certain of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nobility, began
to treat of the sending of the <hi>French</hi> souldiers forth of the Realm. Wherein two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
occurred. One was, that the Commissioners of <hi>France</hi> did urge the retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a number of men of war in some sorts of the countrey for the King and
Queen, after peace was concluded. The other, that the companies that should be
broken, might depart unchallenged with all their baggage. The <hi>Scottish</hi> Noblemen
did oppose these desires, esteeming it unreasonable that they should be suffered to
depart before they gave satisfaction to those they had wronged; And to place
strangers in forts, they thought it could not but breed trouble, and occasion a new
warre more dangerous then the present. This contention held some dayes, at last
both parties wearying, they were brought to agree upon the conditions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Conditions of the peace.</note> That the <hi>French</hi> men of warre in the town of <hi>Leth,</hi> should be sent home
within the space of twenty dayes with bag and baggage; and for their better trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
should be furnished with ships of <hi>England,</hi> they giving pledges for the safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the same.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>Leth</hi> being rendered to the Lords of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the walls thereof should be
demolished, as likewise the fortifications at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> if so it should seem good to the
Lords after they had viewed the same; and that the King and Queen should make
no new forts within the Realm, nor augment these that were already made, nor
yet repair these that were demolished, without counsel and consent of the Estates.</p>
               <p>3. That a Garison of threescore <hi>French</hi> men should be permitted to remain in
the Castle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> and as many in the Isle of <hi>Inchkeeth,</hi> untill the Estates should
find means to maintain the said forts upon their own charges from all peril of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
invasion; the said souldiers in the mean time living obedient to the lawes of
the Realm, and taking nothing from the subjects without paiment of ready
money.</p>
               <p>4. That an Act of oblivion should be made for abolishing the memory of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and wrongs attempted or committed against the lawes of the Realm, since the
sixth day of <hi>March,</hi> 1558. untill the first of <hi>August</hi> 1560. which Act should be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in the next Parliament, and confirmed by the Queen with consent of her
husband.</p>
               <p>5. That a general peace and reconciliation should be made amongst the Lords
and subjects of the Realm, so as they who were called of the Congregation, and they
who were not of the same, should bear no quarrel to others for any thing done
since the sixth of <hi>March,</hi> 1558.</p>
               <p>6. That the King and Queen should not pursue, revenge, or suffer to be revenged,
any violence or injury that had been done since the said time, nor should deprive
or seek any colour to dispossess the subjects, or any of them, of the benefices, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50008:87"/>
and estates which they have enjoyed before, they alwayes continuing in the
due obedience of their Soveraigns. And that it might be known that the King and
Queen were not willing to keep any remembrance of the troubles past, it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
the Duke of <hi>Chattellerault,</hi> and all other Noblemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> should be
repossessed in their livings and benefices within <hi>France,</hi> after the manner that they
did enjoy the same, before the said sixth day of <hi>March;</hi> and that all capitulations
agreed upon in time past, should be observed as well for the part of their Majesties,
as the part of the Nobility and people of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. That where any Bishops, Abbots, or other Churchmen, should alledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to have received any injuries either in their persons or goods, the same should
be considered by the Estates of Parliament, and redresse made according to reason;
and in the mean time, that no man should stop them to enjoy their rents, nor do
any hurt or violence to their persons; and if any should do contrary to this Article,
he should be pursued by the Lords as a perturber of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>8. That in time coming the King and Queen should depute no strangers in the
administration of Civil and Common Justice, nor bestow the offices of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellary,
Thesaurer, Comptrollary, and the like upon others, then born subjects of
the Realm: as likewise that it should not be lawful to give the office of Thesaurary,
or Comptrollary to any Churchman or other person that is not able to administrate
the same. Further, that the Thesaurer and Comptroller appointed by them, and
instructed with sufficient commission, should do nothing in disposing of casualties
without the consent of the Councel, to the effect all things may be done for the
profit of the King and Queen: yet should it not be thought that this Article did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bind the King or Queen, but that they may give where and when they should
think expedient.</p>
               <p>9. That the Estates of the Realm should convene and hold a Parliament in the
moneth of <hi>August</hi> next, for which a Commission should be sent from the <hi>French</hi>
King, and the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the said convention should be as lawful
in all respects, as if the same had been ordained by the express Commandment of
their Majesties: providing all tumults of warre be discharged, and they who ought
by their places to be present, may come without fear.</p>
               <p>10. That for the better government of this Realm choice should be made of a
Councel which should consist of twelve worthy men of the Kingdom, of which
number the Queen should chuse seven, and the Estates five; which twelve in their
Majesties absence should take order with the affaires of Government, and without
their authority and consent nothing should be done in the administration of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
businesse. And that the said Councel should convene as oft as they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently,
but no fewer then six together; or if any matter of importance occurred,
they should all be called, or the most part of them: providing it should not be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to the King and Queen, and to the Rights of the Crown.</p>
               <p>11. That the King and Queen should neither make peace nor warre in these parts,
but by the counsel and advise of the Estates, according to the custome of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
as it was observed by their predecessors.</p>
               <p>12. That none of the Lords of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> should make convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men of warre, except in ordinary cases approved by the lawes and custome
of the Realm, nor should any of them cause men of warre strangers to come into
these parts, much lesse attempt to do any thing against the King and Queen, or
against the authority of the Councel, and other Magistrates of the Realm; and in
case any of them had occasion to take Armes, the same being first communicated to
the Councel, their Majesties likewise should be made acquainted therewith, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be done by them, that ought not to be done by good and faithful subjects,
that love the quietnesse of the Realm, and will abide in the obedience of their
Soveraigns.</p>
               <p>13. That Lord <hi>David</hi> son to the Duke of <hi>Chattellerault,</hi> detained prisoner at
<hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> should be put to liberty, and suffered to return into <hi>Scotland</hi> at
his pleasure.</p>
               <p>14. That with the <hi>French</hi> men no Artillery should be transported forth of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50008:87"/>
Realm, but those which were sent, and brought in since the decease of <hi>Francis</hi> the
first, and that all other Artillery and Munition, especially that which hath the Armes
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> should be put into the places out of which they were taken.</p>
               <p>15. That the Army of <hi>England</hi> should return home immediately after the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking
of the <hi>French,</hi> and that all the <hi>Scottish</hi> men of warre should be broken, and
licenced to depart.</p>
               <p>16. That for the Articles concerning Religion presented for the part of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and people of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which the Commissioners would not touch, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to their Majesties) it was promised that a certain number of Noblemen
should be chosen in the next Convention and Parliament to be sent to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties,
to expone unto them the things that should be thought needful for the estate
thereof; and for the Articles presently decided, they should carry with them the
ratification of the same by the Estates, and return a confirmation thereof from
their Majesties.</p>
               <p>Lastly, that the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and King of <hi>France</hi> should not hereafter
usurp the titles of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and should delete the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland</hi> out of their scutchions and whole housholdstuffe.</p>
               <p>This accord made,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> embark, and the Army of <hi>England</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth.</note> the <hi>French</hi> prepared to depart, and for returning the ships of
<hi>England</hi> that were lent to transport them, the Bishop of <hi>Amiens</hi> and <hi>Monsieur le
Broche</hi> remained hostages. On the sixteenth day of <hi>Iuly</hi> the <hi>French</hi> embarked, and
the same day did the <hi>English</hi> Army depart towards <hi>Berwick;</hi> the third day after their
parting, a solemn thanksgiving was kept in the Church of S. <hi>Giles</hi> by the Lords, and
others professing true Religion,<note place="margin">The Ministers distributed amongst the Burghs.</note> and then were the Ministers by common advice
distributed among the Burghs. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was appointed to serve at <hi>Edinburgh,
Christopher Goodman</hi> at S. <hi>Andrews, Adam Heriote</hi> at <hi>Aberdene, Iohn Row</hi> at <hi>Perth,
William Christeson</hi> at <hi>Dundy, David Ferguson</hi> at <hi>Dunfermlin, Paul Methven</hi> at <hi>Ied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>David Lindesay</hi> at <hi>Leth;</hi> besides these they did nominate for the
direction of Church affaires, some to be Superintendents, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Spotswood</hi>
for <hi>Lothian</hi> and <hi>Mers,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Winram</hi> for <hi>Fife,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Areskin</hi> of <hi>Dun</hi> for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
and <hi>Mernis,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Willock</hi> for <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Kerswel</hi> for <hi>Argyle</hi> and
<hi>Isles;</hi> with this small number was the plantation of the Church at first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.</p>
               <p>The time appointed for the Parliament approaching,<note place="margin">A Parliament, and the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof questioned.</note> warning was made to all
such as by law or ancient custome had any voice therein to be present, and at the
day the meeting was frequent; In the beginning there was great altercation, divers
holding that <hi>no Parliament could be kept, seeing their Soveraigns had sent no Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nor authorized any to represent their persons.</hi> Others (alledging that Article of
the peace whereby it was agreed, <hi>That a Parliament should be kept in the moneth of</hi>
August, <hi>and that the same should be as lawful in all respects, as if it were ordained by
the expresse commandments of their Majesties</hi>) maintained that <hi>the said Article was a
warrant sufficient for their present meeting:</hi> and this opinion by voices prevailed.
So after some eight dayes spent in these contentions, they began to treat of affairs,
but as they had no commission, so the solemnities accustomed of Crown, Scepter,
and Sword, which are in use to be carried at these times, were neglected. There
were present of the spiritual Estate, the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Bishops of
<hi>Dunkeld, Dumblane, Galloway, Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Isles;</hi> The Prior of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots
of <hi>Couper, Landors, Culross,</hi> S. <hi>Colmes Inch, Newbottle, Halirudhouse, Kinlose,
Deire,</hi> and <hi>New-Abbey,</hi> with the Priors of <hi>Coningham,</hi> and S. <hi>Mary Isle;</hi> Of the
Nobility, the Lord Duke, the Earls of <hi>Arrane, Argyle, Marshal, Cassils, Cathnes,
Athol, Glencarne, Merton,</hi> and <hi>Rothes:</hi> The Lords <hi>Ruthven, Glammis, Areskin, Boyd,
Ochiltrie, Carlile, Levingston, Ogilvy,</hi> and <hi>Somervil,</hi> with many of the inferiour
Barons;<note place="margin">The Clergy offended with the election of the Lords of the Articles.</note> and of the Commissioners of Burghs none were absent. In electing the
Lords of the Articles, the Noblemen that had the nomination of the Clergy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by such amongst them as they knew to be Popishly affected, made choice of
the Bishops of <hi>Galloway,</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> the Prior of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Abbots of <hi>Abber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brothock,
Kilwining, Lundors, Newbottle,</hi> and <hi>Culross;</hi> at which the Prelates stormed
mightily, alledging that some of them were meer Laicks, and all of them Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50008:88"/>
(for they had openly renounced popery, and joyned themselves with the
Professors of the truth) but there was no remedy, the course was changed; and
now it behoved them to take law, who formerly had given it to others.</p>
               <p>The first thing they moved in the Articles,<note place="margin">Petitions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Reformers.</note> was a supplication of the Barons,
Gentlemen, Burgesses, and other subjects concerning religion, wherein three things
were petitioned. First, <hi>that the Doctrine of the Romane Church professed and tyrannously
maintained by the Clergy should be condemned, and by Act of Parliament abolished.</hi> Some
particulars they named, such as <hi>the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, the adoration of
Christs body under the form of bread, the merit of works, Papisticall Indulgences, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
Pilgrimage, and praying to Saints departed.</hi> These they reckoned to be pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
errours, such as could not but bring damnation to the souls of those who were
therewith infected: therefore desired a punishment to be appointed for the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and maintainers of such Doctrines. Next, <hi>that a remedy should be found against
the profaning of the holy Sacraments by men of that profession, and the true Discipline of
the ancient Church revived and restored.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that the Pope of Rome his usurped au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
should be discharged, and the patrimony of the Church imployed to the sustentation
of the Ministery, the provision of Schools, and intertainment of the poore, of a long time
neglected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This last clause was not very pleasing to divers of the Nobility, who though
they liked well to have the Pope his authority and doctrine condemned, had no will
to quit the Church Patrimony, wherewith in that stirring time they had possessed
themselves. So making no answer to the last point; the Ministers were desired to
draw into severall heads the summe of the Doctrine they craved to be established,
that the same might be seen and considered by the Parliament. This accordingly
was done, and the fourth day after (which was the 17. of <hi>August</hi>) exhibited to the
Estates under this title,<note place="margin">The Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith put in form and presented.</note> [The confession of the Faith and Doctrine, believed and
professed by the Protestants of <hi>Scotland;</hi>] It is the same confession word by word
that you have registred in the first Parliament of King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth, which (that
the story may on with an uninterrupted delivery) I thought not needfull here to
insert.</p>
               <p>The Confession read in open Parliament and put to voyces, the Earle of <hi>Atholl,</hi>
the Lords <hi>Sommervill</hi> and <hi>Bothwick</hi> onely of all the temporall Estate disassented,<note place="margin">The Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on approved.</note>
saying, <hi>They would believe as their fathers before them had believed.</hi> The Popish Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
were silent, and answered nothing; whereupon the Earle <hi>Marshall</hi> brake forth
into these speeches; <hi>It is long since I carried some favour unto the truth, and was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
jealous of the Romane religion, but this day hath fully resolved me of the truth of the
one, and falshood of the other: for seeing my Lords the Bishops (who by their learning
can, and for the zeal they should have to the truth, would as I suppose gainsay any thing
repugnant unto it) say nothing against the confession we have heard, I cannot think but it
is the very truth of God, and the contrary of it false and deceiveable doctrine.</hi> Thus
was the confession of Faith approved, and by publick voices of the Estates authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
At the same time there passed three other Acts in favour of the Professors;
one for abolishing the Popes Jurisdiction and authority within the Realm;<note place="margin">The Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</note> a second
annulling all Statutes made in preceding times for maintenance of idolatry; and
a third for punishment of the sayers and hearers of Mass.</p>
               <p>With these Acts Sr. <hi>Iames Sandelands</hi> Knight of the Rhodes,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Torpichen</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> a Gentleman of
good account (who had carried himself as neuter in all these broiles) was directed
to <hi>France</hi> for obtaining a ratification of the same from the Queen and the King her
husband; and therewith was desired to clear the Noblemen and other Subjects
from imputations of disloyalty cast upon them, and to pacifie the mindes of their
Soveraignes, (whom they understood to be much exasperated) by all the good
wayes he could use. But he found his Ambassage and himself both contemned; the
<hi>Guisians</hi> (who were the onely men then in account with the King) checking him bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
at his first audience, for that he being a Knight of the holy Order, should have
taken a Commission from Rebells to sollicite a ratification of execrable Heresies:
The Gentleman did what he could to mitigate their wrath, but nothing could
avail. So was he dismissed without answer, whereof the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the

<hi>Iohn Lesley</hi> (afterwards Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi>) with letters to the Queen, intreating her to

land at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> where she should be honourably received, and find such assistance
of the Noblemen in these quarters, as at her first coming she might re-establish
the Catholick Religion: he was also desired to warn the Queen not to give ear to
the counsels of her brother, who (as they said) was of an aspiring minde, and aimed
at no less then the Government of the Realm; whom she should do wisely to cause
be detained in <hi>France,</hi> till matters at home were fully settled. The letter he carried
was subscribed by the Archbishop of Saint. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Aberdene,

how soon they heard of the death of King <hi>Francis</hi> convened at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and
after counsell taken directed Lord <hi>Iames</hi> to the Queen to perswade her in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to return: But <hi>Lesly</hi> using greater diligence came to her some dayes before him,
and finding her at <hi>Vitrie</hi> in <hi>Champaigne,</hi> (wthier she was gone to seek a secret place
for her sorrow) delivered the letters and credit he was trusted with. The Queen
hearing all, answered, that the Prelats and Noblemen by whom he was imployed,
should rest assured of her favour, willing him to advertise so much, and to attend
till she could resolve upon her return. Incontinent after <hi>Leslies</hi> coming the
Queens uncles did enter in deliberation what course was best for her to take, and
whether or not she should return to <hi>Scotland;</hi> for they conceived the passage by
Sea would be dangerous, (she not being assured of the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
And in her own Kingdome the late troubles not being fully appeased, they
considered her peril would be great,<note place="margin">The Queen resolveth to return.</note> and that she should be cast in many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
yet finding her own mind to incline that way, and hoping to have her more
subject to their counsels whilest she lived at home, then if she remained in <hi>France;</hi>
they resolved to give way to her return, and to provide a fleet for her safe transport.
Lord <hi>Iames</hi> at his coming, though he was advertised of the conclusion taken, yet
dissembling his knowledge thereof, did signify the great desire that the subjects
had to enjoy her presence, and their longing for her return, using the best reasons
he could to perswade her unto it. Hereby she was much confirmed in her purpose,
and after a day or two imparting to him her resolution, willed him to return with
diligence, and making advertisement of her journey, take care that nothing should
be attempted against the pacification made at <hi>Leth</hi> before her coming.</p>
               <p>In <hi>March</hi> following there arrived at <hi>Leth</hi> one <hi>Noalius</hi> a Senator of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi>

returned; he had audience and answer given him to this effect: <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>were no

requite them with such ingratitude, they would bring upon themselves a perpetual and
everlasting shame. And for repairing the Churchmen in their places, they said that they
did not acknowledge those whom they so styled to be Office-bearers in the Church, and
that</hi> Scotland <hi>having renounced the Pope, would maintain no longer his Priests and
vassals.</hi>

                  </note> the Earls of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Glencarn,</hi> who a little
before this time were returned from <hi>England,</hi> did relate the good acceptance they
received from the Queen, and the promises she made to assist them in the defence
of the liberties of the Kingdome, if they should stand in need at any time of her
help; which was heard with great content. They had been trusted with a more
private businesse; this was to try if the Queen might be pleased to take the Earl
of <hi>Arrane</hi> to her husband, and that way to unite the Kingdomes in a more firm
amity. But to this she did in fair terms answer, <hi>That she was not as yet wearied of the
single life, and professing her self adepted to the Noblemans good affection, said that if she
should try her kindnesse in any other matter, he should find his love not ill bestowed.</hi> The
Earl took the repulse more patiently, because of the <hi>French</hi> Kings death, and trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he should gain the favour of his own Queen, whom he greatly affected: but of

fall to be often mentioned, and serveth to the clearing of many questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which were afterward agitated in the Church; I thought meet word
by word here to insert the same, that the Reader may see what were the
grounds laid down at first for the Government of the Church, so we shall
the better decerne of the changes that followed.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The first Head of Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>SEeing that <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is he whom God the Father hath commended onely to be
heard and followed of his sheep, we judge it necessary, that his Gospel be truly
and openly preached in every Church and Assembly of this Realm, and that all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
repugning to the same be utterly suppressed as damnable to mans salvation.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Explication of the first Head.</head>
                  <p>Lest that upon this our generality ungodly men take occasion to cavill, this we
adde for explication; By <hi>preaching of the Gospel,</hi> we understand not only the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> but also the <hi>Old;</hi> to wit, the Law, the Prophets, and
Histories, in which <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is no lesse contained in figure, then we have him
now expressed in vertue; And therefore with the Apostle we affirm, that <hi>all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
inspired of God, is profitable to instruct, to reprove, and to exhort.</hi> In which
books of Old and New Testaments we affirm that all things necessary for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Church, and to make the man of God perfect, are contained and
sufficiently expressed.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>the contrary Doctrine</hi> we understand, whatsoever men by Lawes, Councels,
or Constitutions have imposed upon the consciences of men without the expresse
Commandment of Gods word; such as are the vowes of chastity, forswearing of
marriage, binding of men and women to a several and disguised apparel, to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50008:89"/>
observing of Fasting-dayes, difference of meats for conscience sake,
prayer for the dead, and keeping of Holy dayes of certain Saints, commanded by
man, such as be all these the Papists have invented, as the Feasts (so as they term
them) of the Apostles, Martyrs, Virgins; of Christmas, Circumcision, Epiphany,
Purification, and other said Feasts of our Lady: which things because in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
of God they neither have commandment, nor assurance, we judge them
utterly to be abolished from this Realm. Affirming further, that the obstinate
maintainers and teachers of such abominations ought not to escape the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Civil Magistrate.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The second head of Sacraments.</head>
                  <p>TO <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> his holy Gospel truly preached, of necessity it is that his holy
Sacraments be annexed and truly ministred as seals, and visible confirmations
of the spiritual promises contained in the words. These Sacraments are two; to
wit, Baptisme, and the holy Supper of the Lord <hi>Iesus;</hi> which are then rightly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred,
when by a lawful Minister the people before the administration of the same,
are plainly instructed and put in mind of Gods free grace and mercy offered unto
the penitent in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> when Gods promises are rehearsed, the end and use of
the Sacraments preached and declared in such a language, as the people do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;
when also to them nothing is added, and from them nothing diminished,
and in their administration all things done according to the institution of the Lord
<hi>Iesus,</hi> and practice of his holy Apostles. And albeit the order of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which
now is used in some of our Churches, is sufficient to instruct the diligent Reader
how that both these Sacraments may be rightly ministred, yet for an uniformity to
be kept, we thought good to adde this as superabundant.</p>
                  <p>In Baptisme we acknowledge nothing to be used except the element of water
only, and that the word and declaration of the promises (as we said before) ought to
precede: therefore whosoever presumeth in Baptisme to use oyle, salt, wax, spittle,
conjuration and crossing, as they accuse the institution of <hi>Christ</hi> of imperfection,
(for it was void of all these inventions) so for altering Christs perfect Ordinance
they ought to be severely punished.</p>
                  <p>The table of the Lord is then most rightly ministred, when it approacheth most
nigh to Christs own action. But plain it is that at the Supper <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> sate
with his Disciples, and therefore do we judge, that sitting at table is most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to that holy action; that Bread and Wine ought to be given, distribution of
the same made, that the Bread should be taken and eaten, and likewise that all should
drink of the Cup, with declaration what both the one and the other is. For touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the damnable errour of the Papists, who defraud the people of the Cup of the
Lords blood, their errour is so manifest, as it needeth no confutation.</p>
                  <p>That the Minister break the bread, and distribute the same to those that be next
unto him, commanding the rest every one with reverence and sobriety to break
with other, we think it neerest to <hi>Christs</hi> action and to the perfect practice of the
Apostles, as we reade in Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> During which action we think it necessary, that
some comfortable places of Scripture be read, which may bring in minde the death
of the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> and the benefit of the same: for seeing in that Action we ought
chiefly to remember the Lords death, we judge the Scriptures making mention of
the same, most apt to stir up our dull minds then, and at all times. The Ministers at
their discretion may appoint the places to be read as they think good; but what
times we think most convenient for ministration of the one and other Sacrament,
shall be declared when we come to the policy of the Church.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The third head touching the abolishing of Idolatry.</head>
                  <p>AS we require <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> to be truly preached, and his holy Sacraments right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ministred; so we can not cease to require Idolatry with all monuments and
places of the same, as Abbeys, Chappels, Monkeries, Friers, Nunneries, Chantries,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50008:90"/>
Cathedrall Churches, Chanonries, Colledges, other then presently are Parish
Churches or Schools, to be utterly suppressed in all places of this Realm; Palaces,
Mansions and dwelling houses, with their Orchards and Gardens, onely excepted.
As also we desire that no persons, of what estate or condition soever they be, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to use idolatrous service; for that wheresoever idolatry is maintained, if so
it may be suppressed, the wrath of God shall reigne both upon the blinde and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
idolaters, and those that negligently suffer the same.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Idolatrie</hi> we understand, the Masse, invocation of Saints, adoration of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and the keeping and retaining of the same; finally, all honouring of God, not
contained in his holy word.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The fourth head concerning Ministers and their lawfull Election.</head>
                  <p>IN a Church reformed or tending to reformation none ought to presume, either
to preach, or yet minister the Sacraments, untill they be called orderly to the same.
Ordinary vocation consisteth in Election, Examination and Admission; and because
the election of Ministers in Papistry hath been altogether abused, we think expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to intreat of it more largely.</p>
                  <p>It appertaineth to the people and to every severall congregation to elect their
Minister, and in case they be found negligent therein the space of fourty dayes, the
best reformed Church, to wit, the Church of the Superintendent with his councell,
may present unto them a man that they judge apt to feed the flock of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi>
who must be examined as well in life and manners, as in doctrine and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>That this may be done with more exact diligence, the persons who are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
must be commanded to appear before men of soundest judgement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in some principall town, next adjacent unto them. As they that be in <hi>Fife,

in other countries, must resort to the best reformed Cities and Towns, that is, to the
Town of the Superintendent, where first in the Schools, or failing thereof in open
assembly, and before the congregation they must give declaration of their gifts, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
and knowledge by interpreting some place of Scripture to be appointed by
the Ministery; which being ended, the person that is presented, or that offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the service of the Church, must be examined by the Ministers and Elders of
the Church openly before all that list to hear, in all the chief points that be now in
controversie betwixt us and the <hi>Papists, Anabaptists, Arrians,</hi> and other such enemies
to the Christian Religion; In which if he be sound and able to perswade by whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Doctrine, and to convince the gain-sayers, then must he be directed to the
Church and Congregation where he would serve; that there in open audience of
the flock he may preach and deliver his knowledge in the Article of Justification,
the Offices of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> the number, effect and use of the Sacraments, and
finally, the whole Religion which hereto fore hath been corrupted by Papists.</p>
                  <p>If his Doctrine be found wholsome and able to instruct the simple, and if the
Church can justly reprehend nothing in his life, doctrine or utterance; then we
judge the Church, which before was destitute, unreasonable, if they refuse him
whom the Church doth offer, and that they should be compelled by the censure
of the Councell and Church to receive the person appointed and approved by the
judgement of the Godly and Learned; unless that the same Church hath presented
a man better or as well qualified to examination, before that the foresaid triall
was taken of the person presented by the Councell of the whole Church. As for
example; the Councell of the Church presents a man unto a Church to be their
Minister, not knowing that they are otherwise provided; in the mean time the
Church hath another sufficient in their judgment for that charge, whom they present
to the learned Ministers, and next reformed Church to be examined. In this case
the presentation of the people to whom he should be appointed Pastor, must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

learned. For this is alwayes to be avoyded, that no man be intruded or thrust in
upon any congregation. But this liberty with all care must be reserved for every
severall Church, to have their voices and suffrages in election of their Ministers:
Yet we do not call that violent intrusion, when the Councell of the Church in the
fear of God, regarding only the salvation of the people, offereth unto them a man
sufficient to instruct them, whom they shall not be forced to admit before just exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,

thereof by a more sober and better conversation; but such capitall crimes
as the Civil sword ought and may punish with death by the Word of God; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that the Apostle requireth the life of Ministers to be <hi>irreprehensible,</hi> that they
may have <hi>a good testimony from those who be without,</hi> we esteem it a thing unseemly and
dangerous, that he shall have publick authority to preach to others everlasting life,
from whom the Civil Magistrate may take the life temporall for a crime publickly
committed. And if any will object, that the Prince hath pardoned his offence, and
that he hath publickly repented the same: we say, that neither doth repentance take
away the temporall punishment of the Law, nor the pardon of the Prince remove
the infamy before.</p>
                  <p>That the life and conversation of the person presented or to be elected may be
more clearly known, publick Edicts may be directed to all parts, at least to those
parts where he hath bin most conversant, as where he was educated in letters, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
since the years of his Infancy and childhood were passed. Strict command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would also be given, that if any capitall crime hath bin committed by him, the
same should be notified; and if he hath committed wilfull murther, and adultery, if
he hath bin a common fornicator, thief, drunkard, fighter, a brawler or contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
person; these Edicts ought to be published in the chief Cities, with Declaration
that such as conceal his known sins, do so far as in him lieth deceive and betray the
Church of God, and communicate with the sins of the wicked person.</p>

                  <head>Admission.</head>
                  <p>The admission of Ministers to their Offices must consist in the consent of the
people and Church whereunto they shall be appointed, and in the approbation of
the learned Ministers appointed for their examination.</p>
                  <p>We judge it expedient that the admission of Ministers be in open audience,
where some speciall Minister shall make a Sermon touching the duty and office of
Ministers, their manners, conversation and life, as also touching the obedience
which the Church oweth to their Ministers; and warning made to the Minister
that he attend carefully upon the flock over which he is placed, and walk in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God so sincerely, as the graces of the holy Spirit may be multiplyed upon
him; and in the presence of men, so soberly and uprightly, that by his exemplary
life the word which he teacheth may be confirmed. The people likewise ought to
be exhorted to reverence and honour the Minister as the <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Ambassadour</hi>
of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> obeying the Doctrine delivered by him out of the Word, even
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50008:91"/>
as they would obey God himself. For who soever heareth the Minister of <hi>Christ,</hi>
heareth himself, and whosoever receiveth him and despiseth his Ministery, rejecteth
and despiseth <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other <hi>ceremonies</hi> then the publick approbation of the people, and the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the chief Minister, that the person there presented is appointed to serve that
Church, we cannot approve; for albeit the Apostles used the <hi>Imposition of hands,</hi>
yet seeing the miracle is ceased, the using of the <hi>ceremony</hi> we judge not to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>The Minister once publickly admitted may not leave the flock at his pleasure, to
which he hath promised his fidelity and labours: not yet may the flock reject and
change him at their appetite, unless they be able to convict him of such crimes, as
deserves deposition. We mean not but that the whole Church or most part thereof
for just considerations may translate a Minister from one Church to another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet mean we that men who serve now as it were of benevolence, may not be
appointed to other places, but they being once solemnly admitted, we think they
should not change at their own pleasure.</p>
                  <p>We are not ignorant, that the rarity of learned and godly men will seem a just
reason to some, why that so strict and sharp examination should not be taken uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally;
for so it would appear that the most part of Churches shall have no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
at all. But let these men understand that the lack of able men will not excuse
us before God, if by our consent unable men be placed over the flock of <hi>Christ.</hi>
As also that amongst the Gentiles godly and learned men were as rare, as they be
now amongst us, when the Apostles gave the same rule of examining Ministers,
which we now follow.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, let them understand, that is like to have no Minister at all, and to have
an idoll in the place of a true Minister, yea in some sort it is a worse; for they that be
utterly destitute of Ministers, will make diligent search for them, but such as have
a vain shadow content themselves commonly with the same, without any further
care, and they remain deceived, thinking that they have a Minister, when in very
deed they have none: for he is not to be thought a Minister, that cannot break the
Bread of life to fainting and hungry soules; neither can the Sacraments be rightly
ministred by him, in whose mouth God hath not put the word of exhortation.</p>
                  <p>The chiefest remedy in this rarity of true Ministers, is fervent prayer unto God,
that it may please him to thrust forth faithfull laboures into this his harvest. Next,
the Councell of their authority, compell such men as have gifts and graces able
to edifie the Church of God, to bestow them where greatest necessity is known.
For no man may be permitted to live idle, nor as themselves lift, but must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to travell, where the Church and Councell shall think it most expedient.
We cannot prescribe certain rules how the Ministers should be distributed, and such
learned men as God hath already sent unto us: But of this we are assured, that it
greatly hindreth the progress of <hi>Christs</hi> Gospel within this poore Realm, that some
altogether abstract their labours from the Church, and others remain altogether in
one place, the most part of them being idle. And therefore think that the Councell
should compell all men to whom God hath given any Talent to perswade by whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Doctrine, to bestow the same, if they be called by the Church, to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Christs</hi> glory, and to the comfort to his troubled flock; and that
with consent of the Church not onely Townes may be assigned for the chiefest
workemen to remaine in, but also Provinces; that by their faithfull labours
Churches may be erected, and order established where none is at the present.</p>

                  <head>For Readers.</head>
                  <p>To the Church that cannot presently be furnished with Ministers, men must be
appointed that can distinctly read the <hi>Common-Prayers</hi> and <hi>Scriptures</hi> for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
both of themselves &amp; of the Church, untill they grow untill a greater perfection.
Because he who is now a Reader, may in process of time attain to a further degree,
and be admitted to the holy Ministery. Some we know that of long time have
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50008:91"/>
professed <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> whose honest conversation deserveth praise of all good
men, and whose knowledge might greatly help the simple and ignorant people,
notthelesse the same persons content themselves with reading; These must be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
and encouraged to take upon them the function of the Ministery. But if in
no measure they be qualified for preaching, they must abstain from administration
of the Sacraments, till they attain unto further knowledge, and such as take upon
then the office of Preachers, who shall not be found qualified therefore by the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent,
are by him to be placed Readers.</p>

                  <head>The fift head concerning the provision of Ministers, and distribution
of the rents and Possessions justly pertaining to the Church.</head>
                  <p>SCripture and Reason do both teach, that <hi>the labourer is worthy of his hire;</hi> and that
<hi>the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth forth the corne, ought not to be musled.</hi> Therefore
of necessity it is, that honest provision be made for Ministers, which we require to
be such, that they neither have occasion of solicitude, nor yet of insolency and
wantonnesse. And this provision must be made not only for their own sustentation
during their lives, but also for their wives and children after them: for it is against
godliness, reason, and equity, that the widow and children of him who did faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
serve the Church of God in his life, and for that cause was not careful in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for his family, should after his death be left comfortlesse.</p>
                  <p>It is difficil to appoint the several stipends of every Minister, because the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of necessity of all will not be alike; for some will be resident in one place, some
will be compelled to travel and change their dwelling, especially if they have charge
of divers Churches; Some will be burthened with wife and children, and one with
moe then another; some perchance will live a single life; and if equal stipends should
be appointed to all these, who are in charge so unequal, one would suffer penury,
and another have superfluity. Therefore we judge that every Minister should have
sufficient wherewith to keep an house, and be sustained honestly in all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
forth of the rents of the Church which he serveth, conform to his quality, and
the necessity of time: wherein it is thought that every Minister shall have forty bols
meal, and twenty bolls malt, with money to buy other provision to his house, and
serve his other necessities, the modification whereof is to be referred to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, which shall be made every year at the choosing of the Elders
and Deacons; providing alwayes that there be advanced to every Minister, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for a quarter of a year before-hand of all things.</p>
                  <p>To the Superintendents who travel from place to place for establishing of the
Church, a further consideration must be given; therefore we think that to each of
them should be appointed six Chalders beer, nine Chalders meal, and three Chalders
oats for provand to his horse, with 500. Marks of money, which may be augmented and diminished at the discretion of the Prince and Councel of the Realm.</p>
                  <p>The children of the Ministers must be freemen of the Cities next adjacent,
where their Fathers laboured faithfully; they must also have the priviledges of
Schooles and Bursaries in Colledges freely granted unto them, if they be found
apt for learning; or failing thereof, they must be put to some handicraft, and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
industry, whereby they may be profitable instruments in the commonwealth.
Their daughters likewise would be vertuously brought up, and honestly educated,
when they come to maturity of years, at the discretion of the Church. And this
we require not so much for our selves or any that pertaineth to us, as for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of vertue and learning, and for the profit of the posterity to come. For it is
not to be supposed, that a man will dedicate his children to serve in a calling, where
no wordly commodity is expected; and naturally men are provoked to follow
vertue, where they see honour and profit attending the same; as by the contrary,
many despise vertue when they see vertuous and godly men live unrespected; and
we should be sorty to know any to be discouraged from following the studies of
learning, whereby they may be made able to profit the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:50008:92"/>Of the stipend of the Readers we have spoken nothing, because if they can do
nothing but read, they cannot be esteemed true Ministers, and regard must be had
of their labours, but so as they may be spurred forward to vertue; therefore to a
Reader that is lately entered, we think forty Marks, more or lesse as the Parishioners
can agree, sufficient: providing that he teach the children of the Parish, which he
must do besides the reading of the Common Prayer, and the books of Old and
New Testament. If from reading he proceed to exhort and explaine the Scriptures,
then ought his stipend to be augmented, till he come to the degree of a Minister.
But if after two years service he be found unable to edify the Church by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he must be removed from that office and discharged of all stipend, that another
may be put in place, who to the Church may be more profitable.</p>
                  <p>No childe nor person within the age of one and twenty years may be admitted to
the office of a Reader, but such must be chosen and admitted by the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as for their gravity and discretion may grace the function that they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unto. These Readers who have some gift of exhortation, and have long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the course of godlinesse, we think may have 100. Marks or more, at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the Church appointed for them; yet a difference must alwayes be
kept betwixt them and the Ministers that labour in word and ministration of the
Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>Rests two sorts of people who must be provided for of that which is called <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
of the Church;</hi> to wit, the poor, and the Teachers of the youth. The poor
must be provided for in every Parish, for it is a shameful thing that they should be
so universally contemned, and despised. Not that we are Patrons to stubborne and
idle beggers, who running from place to place make a craft of begging; for
those we think must be compelled to work, or then punished by the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
But the poor widows, the fatherlesse, the impotent maimed persons, the
aged, and every one that may not work, or such persons as are fallen by occasion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
decay, ought to be provided, and have their necessities supplied by the Parish
where they were borne, or have remained for any long space.</p>

within the Dioces, being alwayes made privy at this time to the election; as well to

                  <p>Seeing men now adayes are not miraculously gifted, as in the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
for the continuance of knowledge and learning to the generations following,
especially for the profit and comfort of Christs Church; it is necessary that care
be had of the virtuous and godly education of youth: wherefore we judge that in
every Parish there should be a Schoolmaster, such a one as is able at least to teach
the Grammar, and <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, where the Town is of any reputation. But in
Landwart, where people convene to Doctrine only once in the week, then must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Reader or the Minister take care of the youth of the Parish, to instruct
them in their rudiments, especially in the Catechisme of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In every notable Town, chiefly in the Town of the Superintendent, we think
that a Colledge should be erected, wherein at least the arts of Logick and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
with the Tongues, should be taught by sufficient Masters, for whom honest
stipends must be appointed. And that provision should be made for such youths
as are poor, and cannot be brought up in letters by their friends: the commodity
whereof will be great, when the children are brought up in the presence of their
friends, by whose good attendants their necessities may be supplied, and many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
avoided, that youth commonly runneth into, when they are sent to
strange and unknown places. The exercise likewise of children in the Church, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but serve greatly to the instruction of the aged and unlearned.</p>
                  <p>The great Schools called <hi>Universities,</hi> should be replenished with those that be
apt for learning: for no father of what condition or estate soever he be, ought to use
his children after his own fantasie, especially in their youth; but all must be
compelled to bring them up in knowledge and virtue. The rich must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted,
and by the censure of the Church compelled, to dedicate their sons to the
profit of the Church and Commonwealth, training them up in godly exercises upon
their own expences, and the children of the poor must be sustained upon the

                  <head>The sixth head of the Rents and Patrimony of the Church.</head>
                  <p>TWo sorts of men, that is, the Preachers of the word, and the poor, besides the
Schools, must be sustained upon the rents of the Church; wherefore it would be
considered how, and of what the same is to raised. For to our grief we hear that some
Gentlemen are now more rigorous in exacting the tithes, and other duties paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the Church, then ever the Papists were, and so the tyranny of Priests is
turned into the tyranny of Lords or Lairds; for this we require, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Barons, Lords, Earls, and others, be content to live upon their own rents,
and suffer the Church to be restored to her right and liberty, that by her restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the poor that heretofore have been oppressed, may now receive some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and relaxation.</p>
                  <p>It is a thing most reasonable that every man have the use of his own tithes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
that he answer the Deacons and Treasurer of the Church, of that which
shall be reasonably appointed unto him, and that the uppermost cloth, the Corpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
the Clerkmail, the Pasche-offerings, Tith-ale, and other the like exactions
be discharged for ever. And because not only the Ministers, but also the poor and
Schools must be sustained upon the Tithes, we think it more expedient, that Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
and common Treasurers of the Church be appointed to receive the whole
rents appertaining thereto, then the Ministers themselves: And that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be given that no man either receive, or intromet with any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the sustentation of the foresaid persons, but such as shall be appointed
thereto by the Church.</p>
                  <p>If any shall think this prejudicial to those that possesse the tithes by vertue of
leases, we would have them know, that unjust possession is no possession before
God; and that those of whom they acquired their right, were thieves and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and had no power to alienate the Patrimony and common good of the Church:
yet do we wish recompence to be made to such as have debursed summes of money
to these unjust possessors, so that the same had not been given of late, in prejudice
of the Church, or no collusion used. For which purpose we think it expedient that
whosoever have the titles of any Church in part or whole, be warned to produce
his right, that cognition being taken thereof, a reasonable recompence may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, before the years that are to run; the profits of years past deduced, and
considered, so that the Church in end may receive her liberty and freedom.</p>
                  <p>The tithes that we think must be lifted for the use of the Church, are the tithes
of hay, hemp, lint, cheese, fish, calf, veal, lamb, wool, and all sorts of corn. But
because these will not suffice to discharge the necessaries of the Church, we think
that all things dotate to hospitality in times past, with all annual rents both to
Burgh and Land, pertaining to Priests, Chanteries, Colledges, Chaplaineries, and
Friers of all orders, to the sisters of the Seynes, and all other of that sort, be retained
to the use of the Church or Churches within the Towns or Parishes where they
were founded: likewise the whole revenues of the temporalities of Bishops, Deans,
and Archdeacons; with all rents of lands pertaining to Cathedral Churches, which
must be applied to the entertainment of Superintendents, and Universities. And
further, we think that Merchants and Craftsmen in free Burghs, who have nothing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50008:95"/>
to do with manuring the ground, ought to make some provision in their Cities
and Towns, and dwelling places for the support of the Church, and necessities
thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Ministers, and failing of them, the Readers must be restored to their Manses
and Gleibs, without which they cannot serve nor attend their flocks, and where any
Gleib exceedeth six acres of land, that which is more shall remain with the
possessor, till further order be taken.</p>
                  <p>The Deacons or Treasurers appointed to collect these rents, must be chosen year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in every Parish by the common consent of the Church, they may not distribute
any part of that which is collected, but by the command of the Ministers and Elders,
who must command any thing to be delivered but as the Church hath before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
That is, the Ministers to be first paid either quarterly, or from half
year to half year, of the summes allowed to them, the Schoolmasters, Readers, and
Hospitals, if any be.</p>
                  <p>If any extraordinary summes must be disbursed, then the Ministers, Elders, and
Deacons are to consult whether the same stands with the profit of the Church or
not; and if they do agree, they may do as best seemeth unto them. But if there be
controversie amongst themselves, the whole Church must be made privie, and the
reasons heard; their judgement with the Ministers consent shall prevail.</p>
                  <p>The Deacons shall make their Accompts to the Minister and Elders of that
which they have received, and the Elders when they are changed (which must be
every year) shall clear their accompts before such Auditors as the Church shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.
And both the Deacons and Elders being changed, shall deliver to them that
are newly elected, all summes of money, corns, or other profits resting in their
hands; the tickets whereof must be delivered to the Superintendents in their visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and by them to the great Councel of the Church, that as well the indigence,
as abundance of every Church may be known, and so a reasonable equality may be
kept through the whole Realm.</p>

                  <p>AS no Commonwealth can flourish, or long endure without good laws and sharp
execution of the same: so cannot the Church of God be purged, or yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

reproving and correcting those faults, which the Civil sword doth either neglect, or
may not panish.</p>
                  <p>Blasphemy, Adultery, Murther, Perjury, and such capital crimes fall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

law, should be taken away by the Civil sword. But Drunkennesse, Excesse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in apparel or in meat and drink, Fornication, oppression of the poor by exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
deceit in buying and selling, by wrong mete and measure, wanton words and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
living tending to slander, do properly appertain to the censure of the
Church, which in the order and cases following we judge shall be observed.</p>
                  <p>If the offence be secret and known by few, and be rather surmised then that it be

                  <p>In faults publick and hainous, such as Fornication, Drunkennesse, Fighting, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Swearing, and Execration, the offender must be called before the Minister,
Elders, and Deacons, and have his sin laid out before him; whereof if he shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
penitent, and require to be admitted to publick satisfaction, a day should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for his appearance before the whole Church, to testify the repentance
which before he professed; which if he accept, and with reverence perform, he ought
to be received again in the society of the Church: for the Church of God must not
be more rigorous, then God declareth himself to be: who witnesseth, that <hi>When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50008:96"/>
a sinner doth unfainedly repent and turn from his wickednesse, that he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
his iniquity any more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the offender be obstinate and shew no signes of repentance, he must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
with an exhortation, to consider his dangerous estate, and assured that if he
do not shew no tokens of amendment, a more severe course will be taken. If within
a certain space he manifest his repentance to the Minister, he may be presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Congregation, and received in manner aforesaid. But if he shall continue
in his impiety, then it must be signified to the congregation, that such offences are
fallen out amongst them, the committer thereof rebuked and desired to repent,
whereof as yet no tokens are given, and they requested to call unto God for touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heart of the offender (whose fault ought to be expressed, but not his name)
with remorse that he may truly and earnestly be converted.</p>
                  <p>If he notwithstanding continue in his contempt, his name must the next day of
the publick meeting be notified to the congregation, and the most discreet and
nearest of his friends or acquaintance entreated to deal with him earnestly, that
he may be brought to the knowledge of the fault, and solemn prayers made for his
conversion to God.</p>
                  <p>The third Sunday the Minister shall require, if the impenitent hath declared
any signes of his repentance; and it being found that he hath done the same, a day
shall be affixed to him for appearing before the Consistory, where if he shew
himself penitent, as well of the crime, as of his long contempt, he shall be received
upon publick satisfaction in manner before prescribed.</p>
                  <p>But if no man signifie his repentance, then the Minister by consent of the Elders
and Deacons, and at commandment of the Church, shall pronounce the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
excommunicated from God and from the society of his Church. After
which sentence no person may have any kind of conversation with him, (his wife
and family only excepted) in eating, drinking, buying, selling, saluting, or conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him, unlesse the same be licensed by the Ministery; that he finding himself
abhorred of the faithful and godly, may take occasion to repent, and so be saved.</p>
                  <p>This sentence as being the most heavy censure which can be inflicted by the
Church, ought not to be rashly used, but for great causes, and due processe of time
kept; but being pronounced, ought with all severity to be maintained, and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof made through the whole Realm, lest any should pretend ignorance of
the same.</p>
                  <p>His children begotten or born after the sentence and before his repentance, may
not be admitted to Baptisme, till either they be of age to require it, or else the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or some of his special friends members of the Church, present and offer the
childe, abhorring and damning the iniquity of his parent. If any do think it rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thus to punish the childe for the fathers offence, let them understand that the
Sacraments appertain only to the faithful and their seed; and that such as contemn
the admonitions of the Church, and obstinately continue in their iniquity, cannot
be reckoned amongst the faithful.</p>
                  <p>Murtherers, manslayers, adulterers, and committers of the like horrible
crimes, whom the Civil sword ought to punish with death, if they shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to live, shall be holden excommunicate and accursed in their fact. The
offenders being first called, and the order of the Church used against them in
the same manner, as the persons who for their obstinacy are publickly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
so the obstinate impenitent after the sentence of excommunication, and
the murtherer or adulterer shall stand in one case as concerning the judgment of the
Church, and neither of both admitted to prayers or Sacraments (howbeit they may
be present at the preaching of the Word) till first they offer themselves to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
and Elders, requesting humbly their prayers, and desiring them to intercede
with the Church for their admission to publick repentance.</p>
                  <p>Upon this humble request signification shall be given to the Church of the
same, the first day of publick preaching, and the congregation exhorted to pray unto
God, that he will perform the work which he appeareth to have begun in the heart
of the offender, by granting him unfaigned repentance of his sin, with a sense and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50008:96"/>
feeling of his mercy. Thereafter a day shall be publickly assigned unto him him to
make open confession of his crime and contempt. At which time he must appear
in presence of the congregation, and confessing the same desire mercy of God, and
intreat them to accept him in their society.</p>
                  <p>The Minister shall try diligently if he find in him an hatred and displeasure of his
impiety committed, and as he findeth, so to comfort him in the hope of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
but especially is to see that he be instructed in the knowledge of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
in the article of Justification, and offices of <hi>Christ;</hi> for it were a mocking of God
to receive him to repentance, who knoweth not wherein his remedy standeth, when
he is grieved for sin.</p>
                  <p>If he shall perceive him to be reasonably instructed, and humbly disposed, then
shall he demand of the congregation, if they be willing to receive that creature of
God, (whom Satan had before drawn in his snare) into their society, which they
yielding unto, (as justly they may not deny the same) then ought the Minister to
crave the assistance of the Churches prayers in behalf of the penitent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and prayer
ended, exhort them to receive him again in their favours, in token whereof the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and one or two of the Congregation shall take him by the hand, and embrace
him in the name of the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>This done, the Minister shall exhort him who is received to walk circumspectly
in time coming, lest Satan catch him again in his snares, advertising him how that
enemy will not cease to try all means possible for bringing him from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that he hath given to God, and his Ordinance. And after the exhortation
shall give again publick thanks to God for the conversion of that their brother,
and pray for increase and continuance of his grace to him, and the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
                  <p>Unto this discipline the whole estates of the Realm, as well the Rulers, as they
that are ruled, and the Preachers themselves, as well as the poorest within the
Church, must be subject: the Ministers especially, because they as the eye and
mouth of the Church should be most irreprehensible.</p>

                  <p>MEn of best knowledge, of purest life, and most honest conversation that can be
found in every Church, must be nominated for these offices, and their names
publickly read unto the congregation, that from amongst those some may be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
to serve as Elders and Deacons. If any be nominated, who is noted with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
infamy, he must be repelled; for it is not seemly that the servant of corruption
should have authority to judge in the Church of God: or if any man know others
that are of better qualities within the Church, then those who are nominated, the
same shall be joyned to the others, that the Church may have the choice. If the
Churches be few in number, so as Elders and Deacons cannot conveniently be
had, the same Church may be joyned to the next adjacent; for the plurality of
Churches without Ministers and order doth rather hurt, then edifie.</p>
                  <p>The election of Elders and Deacons ought to be made every year once, which
we judge most convenient to be done the first of <hi>August</hi> yearly, lest men by long
continuance in those Offices presume upon the liberty of the Church. And yet it
hurteth not, if a man be retained in office more years then one, so as he be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
yearly thereto by common and free election: Providing alwayes that the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
and Thesaurers of the Church be not compelled to receive again the same
Office for the space of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. years. How the suffrages shall be given and received, every
severall Church may take the order that seemeth best to them.</p>
                  <p>The Elders being elected must be admonished of their Office, which is to assist
the Minister in all publick affairs of the Church; to wit, in judging and discerning
of causes, in giving admonition to licentious livers, and having an eye upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and conversation of all men within their charge: for by the gravity of the Elders
the loose and dissolute manners of other men ought to be restrained and corrected.
The Elders ought also to take heed to the life, manners, diligence and study of their
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50008:97"/>
Ministers; And if he be worthy of admonition, they must admonish him; if of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
they must correct him; and if he be worthy of deposition, they with the
consent of the Church and Superintendent may depose him.</p>
                  <p>The Office of Deacons is to receive the rents, and gather the Almes of the
Church, to keep and distribute the same as they shall be appointed by the Ministery
and the Church; yet they may also assist in judgement the Minister and Elders, and
be admitted to reade in publick Assemblies, if they be called, required and found
able thereto.</p>
                  <p>The Elders and Deacons, with their wives and families, must be subject to the
same censure, that Ministers are subject unto; for they are Judges to the manners
of others, and therefore they must be sober, humble, entertainers of concord and
peace amongst neighbours; and finally, an ensample of godlyness to the rest of
the flock: whereof if the contrary appear, they must be admonished by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
or some of their brethren, if the fault be secret; but if it be open and known,
they must be openly rebuked, and the same order kept with them that is prescribed
against Ministers offending. We think it not necessary that any publick stipend
be appointed either to the Elders or Deacons, because their travell continueth but
for a year; as also because they are not so occupied with the affairs of the Church,
but that they may have leisure to attend their private business.</p>

                  <head>Of the Censure and Deposition of Ministers.</head>
                  <p>If a Minister be of a loose conversation, negligent in his study, and one that
waiteth not on his charge and flock, or one that proponeth not fruitful doctrine to
his people, he ought to be admonished by the Elders, and if he amend not, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may complain to the Ministery, till his repentance appear; but if any Minister be
deprehended of any notable crime, as whoredome, adultery, murther, man-slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
perjurie, heresie, or any such as deserveth death, or any inferre the note of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
he ought to be deposed for ever. By <hi>heresie</hi> we understand pernicious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
plainly taught, and obstinately defended against the foundation and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
grounds of Christian faith. Such a crime we judge to deserve perpetuall deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Ministery, knowing it to be a thing most dangerous to commit a flock
unto a man infected with heresie.</p>
                  <p>Some faults deserve deposition for a time; as if a Minister be deprehended drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
if he be a brawler, or fighter, an open slanderer, a defamer of his neighbours,
factious and a sower of discord; till he declare himselfe penitent, and give some
assurance of better conversation, upon which the congregation shall attend the space
of twenty dayes or longer, as they shall think expedient, before they proceed to a
new election.</p>
                  <p>Every inferiour Church should notifie by one of their Elders, and one of their
Deacons to the Superintendent, the life, manners, study and diligence of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
that the discretion of some may correct the levitie of others. Neither must
the life and manners only of their Ministers come under censure, but also of their
wives, children and family.</p>
                  <p>It must likewise be adverted, that the Minister neither live riotously nor avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously,
and a respect had how he spendeth his stipend: for if a reasonable stipend be
appointed him, he must live accordingly, because avaritiousness and solicitude of
money is no less to be damned in <hi>Christs</hi> servants, especially those who are fed at
the charge of the Church, then is excess and superfluity.</p>
                  <p>We judge it unseemly for Ministers to live in common Alehouses or Taverns;
neither must a Minister be permitted to frequent the Court, unless it be for a time
when he is either imployed by the Church, or called by the Authority to give his
counsell and judgement in any matter: Neither yet must he be one of the councel
in Civil affairs, be he never judged so apt for the purpose; but either must he cease
from the Ministery (which at his own pleasure he may not do,) or else in bearing
charge in Civil affairs, except it be to assist the Parliament when the same is called.</p>

                  <head>The ninth head concerning the Policie of the Church.</head>
                  <p>WE call the <hi>Policy of the Church</hi> the exercise of Religion in such things as may
help to bring the ignorant to knowledge, or else promove in them that are
more learned, a further growth of grace, or otherwise such things as are appointed
for keeping things in good order within the Church, whereof there be two sorts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the one utterly necessary, as that the Word may be truly preached, the Sacraments
rightly administrtd, common Prayers publickly made, children and simple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
instructed in the chief points of Religion, and offences corrected and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
These things we say are so necessary, that without the same there cannot be
any face of a visible Church.</p>
                  <p>The other sort is profitable, but not meerly necessary, as that Psalmes be sung,
and certain places of Scripture read, when there is no Sermon; or that the Church
should convene this or that day in the week to hear Sermons. Of these and the like,
we see not how a certain Order can be established: For in some Churches the
Psalmes may be conveniently sung, in other perhaps they cannot; some Churches
may convene every day, some twice or thrice in the week, and some it may be but
once: In these and the like every particular Church may appoint their own policy
themselves. Yet in great towns we think expedient, that every day there be
either Sermon or Common Prayer, with some exercise of reading the Scriptures.
The day of publick Sermon, we do not think the Common-Prayers needfull to be
used, lest we should foster the people in superstition who come to the Prayers, as
they come to the Mass, or give them occasion to think that those are no Prayers
which are conceived before and after Sermon.</p>
                  <p>In every famous town we require that one day besides the Sunday be appointed
for Sermon, during the time whereof men must abstain from all exercise of trade
and labour the servant as well as the master. In smaller towns such order must
be kept as the Churches within the same shall appoint, but the Sunday in all towns
must precisely be observed, before and after noon. Before noon the Word must
be preached, Sacraments administred, and mariage solemnized when occasion doth
offer. After noon the Catechisme must be taught, and the young children examimined
thereupon, in audience of all the people: In doing whereof the Minister
must have care to cause the people understand the questions propounded, with the
answers and doctrine, that may be collected thereof.</p>
                  <p>What order shall be kept in teaching the Catechisme, and how much thereof eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sunday shall be handled; the distinctions of the Catechisme it self, which is the
most perfect that ever was yet used in any Church, do shew. Where there is neither
Preaching, nor Catechisme upon Sundayes at afternoon, the Common-Prayers
ought to be used.</p>
                  <p>It appertaineth to every Church, to appoint the times when the Sacraments
should be ministred: Baptisme may be ministred whensoever the Word is preached,
but we think it more expedient that the same be ministred upon Sunday; and when
occasion is offered of great travell before noon, the same may be ministred in the
afternoon; upon the week dayes onely after the Sermon, partly to remove that
gross errour, which may hold that children dying without Baptisme are damned,
partly that the people may assist the ministration of the Sacrament with greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
then commonly they do.</p>
                  <p>Four times in the year we think sufficient for Administration of the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which we desire to be so distinguished that the superstitious observation of
times may be avoyded so far as may be: for it is known how superstitiously people
run unto that action upon <hi>Easter,</hi> as if time gave virtue to the Sacraments, when
as the rest of the whole year they are careless and negligent, as though it belonged
not unto them, but at that time only. Therefore we think it expedient that the
first Sunday of <hi>March</hi> yearly be kept for one day to that service: The first Sunday
of <hi>Iune</hi> for another: The first Sunday of <hi>September</hi> for the third: and the first
Sunday of <hi>December</hi> for the fourth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:50008:98"/>Albeit we deny not, but every Church for reasonable causes may change the
time, and minister the same oftner; yet we think the Sacrament of the supper ought
never to be ministred without examination preceding, chiefly of those who are
known, or suspect to be ignorant; and that none ought to be admitted to that holy
mystery, who cannot formally say the Lords Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Articles of the Belief, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the summe of the Law, and understandeth the use and vertue of that holy
Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>We also think necessary, that every Church have a Bible in English, and that the
people convene to hear the Scriptures read and interpreted, that by frequent read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and hearing the gross ignorance of the people may be removed. And we judge
it most expedient, that the Scriptures be read in order: That is, that some one
Book of the New and Old Testament be begun, and followed forth to the end.
The like we esteem of preaching, if the Minister remain for the most part at one
place. For the divagation from one place of Scripture to another, whether it be in
reading or preaching, we account not so profitable for the Church as the continuall
following of one Text.</p>
                  <p>The Masters of Families must be commanded to instruct, or cause to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
their children and servants in the Principles of Christian Religion, without
the knowledge whereof, they may not be admitted to the Table of the Lord;
wherefore we think it needfull that every year at least the Ministers take triall by
publick examination of the knowledge of every person within the Church; and
that every master and mistress present themselves, and so many of their family as
are come to mature age, before the Minister and Elders to give confession of their
Faith, rehearse the Commandements of the Law, with the Lords Prayer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what is their understanding in those things. If any shall suffer their children or
servants to remain in wilfull ignorance, the censures of the Church must be used
against them unto excommunication, and then the person referred to the Civil
Magistrate. For seeing the just man liveth by his own faith, and that <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>
justifieth by knowledge of himself, it is intolerable that any should be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to live as Members of the Church of God, and yet to continue in ignorance.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, all persons would be exhorted to exercise themselves in the Psalmes,
that when the Church conveneth, and the Psalmes be sung, they may be the more
able with common heart and voice to praise God. In private houses it were expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that the most grave and discreet person of the family should use Common-Prayers
at morning and night.</p>

                  <head>Of the exercise of Prophesying or Interpretation of the Scriptures.</head>
                  <p>It was a custome in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> at some times when they did assemble
and meet together to read a place of Scripture, whereupon one first gave his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the instruction and consolation of the Auditors; after whom another did
either confirm what the former had said, or adde that which he had omitted, or
correct and explain more properly the place, or text. Liberty was also given to
a third man to speak, if the whole truth had not been revealed by the former; and
above the number of <hi>three,</hi> it seemeth, none were allowed to speak, as we reade in
the 1 Cor. 14. 29. where we have these words; <hi>Let the Prophets speak two or three,
and let the other judge. And if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first
hold his peace: for ye may all prophesie one by one, that all may learn, and all may have
comfort. And the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets.</hi> This exercise we
think to be most necessary for the Church this day in <hi>Scotland,</hi> because thereby the
Church may have triall of the knowledge, gifts and utterance of every man within
their own body. The simple and those who have somewhat profited, shall be
incouraged to proceed in their studies, and the whole Church shall be edified, every
man that list to hear and learn, being permitted to declare his mind and knowledge
for the comfort of the rest.</p>
                  <p>But lest this exercise that is so profitable might turn into debate or strife, these
rules must be observed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:50008:98"/>1. All curious and unprofitable questions must be avoyded.</p>
                  <p>2. All interpretations that are against the Analogy of faith and against charity,
or that seem to contain an open contradiction to other manifest places of Scripture,
are to be rejected.</p>
                  <p>3. The interpreter may not take to himself the liberty of a Preacher (although
he be appointed and received a Minister) but he must keep him to his text, and not
break out by digression into Common places.</p>
                  <p>4. He may use no invectives in the exercise, unlesse it be in confuting of
heresies.</p>
                  <p>5. He must be short in his admonitions and exhortations, and spend the time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him in opening the mind of the holy Ghost in that place, shewing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
of the Text, and observing such notes as may edifie the auditor.</p>
                  <p>6. Neither he that interpreteth, or any of the Assembly ought to move any
question in open audience, which he doth not presently resolve without disputing
with another; but every man must shew his own judgement, and utter it to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Church.</p>
                  <p>7. If any be noted of curiosity, or bringing in of strange doctrines, he
must be admonished by the Ministers and Elders, after the interpretation
is ended.</p>
                  <p>8. The whole Ministers, with those that are of the assembly, ought to convene
and judge how the persons have interpreted the text, and how they have handled
and intreated the matter; during which time the person should be removed, till
every man hath given his censure. After which the persons being called in, they
should be gently admonished of their escapes, if any they have made; and then
should all questions and doubts be resolved amongst them, without any
contention.</p>
                  <p>The exercise would be kept in every town, where Schools, and repaire of learned
men are, upon a certain day of the week, which, together with the books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that they shall think most profitable to be intreated, we referre to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Ministers and Elders of the particular Church where they convene.
The Ministers to Landwart, and Readers, so as they have gift of interpretation,
lying within six miles of the Town, must assist and be present at the exercise, that
either they may learn themselves, or others may learn by them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, whosoever are esteemed to have any gifts that may edify the Church,
must be charged by the Ministers and Elders to joyn themselves with that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of interpreters, to the end the Church may know whether they be able to serve
in the vocation of the Ministery, or not. And if any be found disobedient, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to communicate their gifts with their brethren, the censures of the Church
should be used against such, providing that the consent and authority of the civil
Magistrate be interrponed thereto: for no man should be permitted to live as it
pleaseth him within the Church, but constrained to bestow their labours where it is
thought they may serve to the edification of others.</p>

and wife by reason of any former promise; but if after the years of judgement
they have embraced one another by virtue of the last consent, having ratified
the promise made by others for them in their youth, the same should be held as
married persons.</p>
                  <p>Publick inhibitions should be made, that no persons under the power and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Fathers, Tutors, and Curators, either men or women, contract marriage
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50008:99"/>
privately, and without the knowledge of those, to whom they live subject under
the power of the Church censure; for if any son or daughter be moved towards a
match, they are obliged to ask the counsel and assistance of their parents for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the same. And though the Father notwithstanding their desires, have no
other cause then the common sort of men have; to wit, lack of money, or because
they are not perhaps of such a linage and birth, as they require; yet must not the
parties make any Covenant, till the Ministery or civil Magistrate be acquainted
therewith, and interpone their request for the Parents consent; which if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obtain, finding no just cause why their marriage ought not to proceed, in that
case they sustaining the place of the Parent may consent to the parties, and admit
them to marry; for the work of God ought not to be hindered by the corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of worldly men. We call that the work of God, when two hearts, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
filthinesse before committed) are so joyned, that they are content to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the holy band of matrimony.</p>
                  <p>If any commit fornication with the woman whom he requireth in marriage,
then both of them do lose the foresaid benefit, as well of the Church, as of
the Magistrate; for neither of them ought to be intercessors for filthy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators.</p>
                  <p>The Father, or nearest friend, whose daughter being a virgin is deflowred, may by
the law of God compell the man who hath done the injury, to marry his daughter;
yet if the Father by reason of the offence will not consent to the marriage, he may in
that case require the dowry of his daughter, which if the offender be not able to
pay, he ought to be punished in his body by the Magistrate, with some other
punishment.</p>
                  <p>In a reformed Church marriage ought not to be privately used, but in open face
and presence of the Church: Also for avoyding dangers, we think it expedient that
the banes be proclaimed three Sundayes, unlesse the persons be well known, and
that no suspicion of peril can arise, and then may the Proclamation be shortned at
the discretion of the Minister. But in no ways can we admit marriage to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
used, how honourable soever the persons be, and therefore esteem Sunday
before Sermon, the most convenient time for celebration of marriage, and that it
ought not to be used upon any day else, without the consent of the Ministery.</p>
                  <p>Marriage once lawfully contracted, may not be dissolved at mans pleasure, (as
our Saviour doth witnesse) unlesse adultery be committed; which being sufficiently
proved in the presence of the civil Magistrate, the innocent party (if they require it)
ought to be declared free, and the offender put to death, as God hath commanded.
But if the life of the offender be spared, yet may not the Church be negligent in
their duty, which is to excommunicate the wicked, and pronounce the innocent
party free. And not the lesse, if the offender shew any fruits of penitency, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desire to be reconciled to the Church, he may be received to the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sacraments, and other benefits of the same.</p>
                  <p>If any shall demand, whether the offender after reconciliation may again
marry or not; we answer, that if they cannot live continent, and if the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be such, as that they fear to fall of new into the offence of God, we
cannot deny them the remedy appointed. If the party offended may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to the offender, then in no case we judge it lawful to the offender to
marry another, and the solemnization of their marriage must be of new in the fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
of the Church, but without the Proclamation of the banes. This we offer as the best
counsel that God giveth us in so doubtful a case; howbeit we judge the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
were to preferre Gods Commandment, and punish those crimes, as he
requireth, with death.</p>

                  <head>Of Burial.</head>
                  <p>Burial hath been had in estimation in all ages, to signify that the body which is
committed to the earth shall not utterly perish, but rise again in the last day; but
this we would have done without vain and superstitious rites, devised for making
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50008:99"/>
gain, and advantage; such as singing of Masses, Diriges, and all other prayers for
the dead; which custom is plainly repugnant to the Scriptures of God, for it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that they who depart in the faith of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> rest from their labours, and
so go from death to life; as on the other side, they who depart in unbelief, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see life, but the wrath of God abideth upon them. For avoiding all inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
we judge it best, that neither singing nor reading be at the burial; for albeit
these things may admonish the living to prepare themselves for death, yet supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and ignorant persons may think that some profit thereby cometh to the dead.
Herefore we think it most expedient, that the dead be accompanied to the place of
burial with some honest neighbours, without either singing or reading, and without
all kind of ceremonies formerly used: so that the bodies be committed to the
grave in such decent and seemly manner, as they who are present may be warned to
fear the judgements of God, and to hate sin which is the cause of death: yet we are
not so precise in this, but that we are content that particular Churches with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Minister, do that which they shall find most fitting, as they will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to God, and the Assembly of the universal Church within the Realm.</p>
                  <p>We are not ignorant that some require a Sermon at the burial, or else some
places of Scripture to be read for putting the living in mind that they are mortal,
and that they likewise must die; but let these men understand, that the Sermons
which are daily made, serve for that use, which if men despise, funeral Sermons shall
rather nourish superstition, then bring such persons to a right consideration of their
own estate. Further, the Ministers shall this way be for the most part occupied in
preaching funeral Sermons, or else they shall have respect of persons, preaching at
the funeral of the rich and honourable, and keeping silence, when the poor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
die; which the Minister with a good conscience cannot do, seeing there is
no respect of persons with God: And whatsoever they do to the rich, in respect of
their Ministery, the same they are bound to do to the poorest under their charge.</p>
                  <p>Churches appointed for preaching and ministration of the Sacraments, ought
not to be made places of Burial. But for that use some other convenient ground is
to be appointed, lying in the most free aire, and kept to that use only; which we
think should be well walled and fenced about.</p>

                  <p>Lest the word of God, and ministration of the Sacraments should come in
contempt through the unseemlinesse of the place, where these exercises are used;
we think it needful that the Churches where the people publickly convene, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
with expedition, and repaired in such fashion as may agree with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of the word of God, and serve to the ease and commodity of the people.
The preparation would be according to the possibility and number of Churches;
every Church having close doores, windowes of glasse, thatch or slate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the people from rain, a bell to convocate them, a pulpit, a bason for baptizing,
and a table for ministration of the Lords Supper. Where the congregation is great,
reparation must be made within the Church for the commodious receiving of
the people; and the expenses raised partly of the people, and partly of the tithes,
at the consideration of the Ministery. But because we know the sloth of men
in these businesses, and in all other affaires which redound not to their private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
strict charge would be given for the reparation aforesaid within a certain

                  <p>It hath been the policy of Satan to draw mankind into one of two extremities;
either to hold men gazing upon the visible elements, so as forgetting the end for
which they were appointed, they do ascribe unto them a saving virtue and power,
which they have not; or then to cause them despise the Ordinance of God, as though
there was no profit in the right use thereof, nor any danger in the profanation. In

time of blindnesse the holy Sacrament was gazed upon, kneeled unto, carried in

men are so bold, as without all vocation to minister the Sacraments in open Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
and some presume to do it in houses without all reverence, where there is
neither Minister nor Word preached. Our desire is that some strict punishment be
inflicted upon such abusers; which albeit we will not take upon us to prescribe, yet
we fear not to say, that both of them deserve death. For if he who falsifyeth the
seal and subscription of a King, be adjudged worthy of death, much more he that
falsifieth the seal of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> who is the Prince of all the Kings of the earth.
King <hi>Darius</hi> gave out an edict, that he who did let the reedifying of the material
Temple in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> should have some wood taken out of his house, and be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hanged thereupon; And what shall we think those do merit, who manifestly do
hinder the building of the spiritual temple, and the edifying of the souls of Gods
people, by the true preaching of the Word, and right administration of the
Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>The Papistical Priests have neither power nor authority to minister the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Christ,</hi> because in their mouths God hath not put the word of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And it is not shaving of their crowns, the crossing of their fingers, the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the dumb dogges, called the Bishops, nor the laying on of their hands, that
maketh them true Ministers; but the Spirit of God first moving the heart to enter
in the holy calling, then the nomination of the people, the examination taken by
the learned, and publick admission in manner aforesaid, are the things that make
men lawful Ministers of the Word and Sacraments. We speak of the ordinary vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in Churches reformed, and not of the extraordinary, whereby God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
sometimes to raise up men by himself for doing his work. Therefore notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the usurpation they have made in time of ignorance, inhibition would be

to all others who are not lawfully called to the holy Ministery.</p>
                  <p>This was the policy desired to be ratified; It had been framed by <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi>
partly in imitation of the reformed Churches of <hi>Germany,</hi> partly of that which he

then a dream, for it could never have taken effect. The Church men that went
before had been provident enough in these matters, and good it had been for
these that succeeded to have kept fast that, which they found established to their

which they keep ever fast, till the beast be throughly made. The multitude, that beast with

gain of, as timber, lead and bells, were put to sale. The very Sepulchres of the dead
were not spared. The Registers of the Church, and Bibliotheques cast into the
fire. In a word; all was ruined, and what had escaped in the time of the first tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
did now undergo the common calamity; which was so much the worse, that
the violences committed at this time, were coloured with the warrant of publick
authority. Some ill advised Preachers did likewise animate people in these their
barbarous proceedings, crying out, <hi>That the places where idols had been worshipped,
ought by the Law of God to be destroyed, and that the sparing of them, was the reserving
of things execrable;</hi> as if the commandement given to <hi>Israel</hi> for destroying the
places where the <hi>Canaanites</hi> did worship their false gods, had been a warrant for
them to do the like. The report also went, that <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> (whose sayings were
by many esteemed as Oracles) should in one of his Sermons say, <hi>That the sure way

Churchmen that were Popish took presently a course, to make away all the Manses,
Gleibs, Tithes, and all other rents possessed by them, to their friends and kinsmen;
and most of these that subscribed, getting into their hands the possessions of the
Church, could never be induced to part therewith, and turned greater enemies in
that point of Church Patrimony, then were the Papists, or any other whatsoever.</p>

and this I cannot have. She objects to me, that I have small experience of
the world; It is true, that years bring experience, yet I am of that age that I know
how to carry my self towards my friends, and well-willers; I will not use many
speeches unworthy of her, but let me with her good leave say, that I am a Queen
as she is, that I have as good friends, and as good a stomach as her self. But
comparisons they say are odious, therefore I will contain my self.</q>

I shall haste my journey homewards. But she perhaps will belay my way, and
so impede her own satisfaction; and it may be she desireth no satisfaction of her demands, that there may be alwayes some occasion of jarring and discord amongst
us. She casteth often in my teeth, that I am young and unadvised; and so she
might justly think me, if I should treat of matters of such importance, but as now
I will not reason that point. This I may truly say, that I never did any thing
to my sister, which I would not have done to my self. I have alwayes performed
the duty of a kinswoman unto her, but she doth either not believe it, or then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth
my friendship. Would to God I were as dear to her, as I am near of bloud,
for this were a precious sort of kindred; but God forgive them, if there be any
that stirreth up these contentions amongst us. You are her Ambassadour, let me
know what is it offendeth her, or in what word or action I have wronged her.</q>

themselves being with her of late, and messengers going daily betwixt them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she desired to know, if they did minde to keep the peace contracted, and if they
continued in that mind, that they should procure the Queen to ratifie it, at least to
advertise her, what she might look for at their own hands.</p>
               <p>This letter was speedily answered by the Councel,<note place="margin">The Councels answer.</note> with great attestations that
it came never in their mindes to break the peace contracted; for in so doing they
should make themselves infamous in the world, and sin highly against their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
Of the delay which their Queen made, and the reasons thereof, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to be ignorant. Therefore intreated her Majesty to be perswaded of them,
that next to the glory of God they would study to keep the peace inviolate, and that
there should be no blame in them, if the ratification was not made to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>

ought not to be interpreted as delayes. For first, that treaty should have been confirmed by
my husband and me, and cannot now be ratified, unlesse it be concluded in my own name

of the Articles are performed, for all preparations of warre are ceased, and the</hi> French <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> should seek to intercept her by the way: and indeed a

the Realm assembled to congratulate her return, and besides them numbers of
all sorts of people convened, as unto a joyful spectacle: for they had not seen the
face of their Soveraign for many years, and after her marriage with the <hi>French</hi> King,
had scarce any hope of a King to reside amongst them: which would most certainly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50008:102"/>
have happened, if any succession had followed of that marriage. For <hi>Scotland</hi> in
that case would have been but an accession to <hi>France</hi> the mightier Kingdome; as
<hi>Henry</hi> the seventh foretold of <hi>England</hi> (and we have seen it verified in our days)
drawing unto it the weaker and lesser Crown. That the Queen therefore was now
returned, and they delivered of the fears of redacting the Kingdom into a Province,
they did justly esteem it one of the greatest benefits that could happen unto them.
Then, when they called to mind the variablenesse of fortune, how she left a pupill
of six dayes old only by the death of the Father, was exposed as a prey to those
that were most mighty, and partly by civil seditions at home, partly by the invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of external enemies from abroad, even before she could have any sense oftrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
was forced to forsake her countrey, and relegated as it were into exile, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
hardly escaped the hands of enemies that lay in wait to intercept her, and the
violence of tempestuous and raging seas. And again when fortune began to smile
a little upon her, and she was honoured with a royal Marriage, how these joyes on
the suddain came to be changed into extreme sorrows; being first deprived of her
mother, then of her husband; a new Kingdome lost, and her ancient crown which
belonged to her by inheritance, standing in a state very uncertain: whilest I say
they called to mind these variable fortunes, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her mild inclination, and gracious demeanour toward all sorts of people, it cannot

               <p>The beginning of her government was likewise very gracious,<note place="margin">No change to be made in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and a private Masse p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dayes after her arriving in a Councel kept with the Nobility to remove the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of trouble she condescended, that no change nor alteration should be made in
the present state of Religion; only she would use her own service, as she said, apart
with her family, and have a Masse in private. This was thought by many a thing
not intolerable, considering she was the Soveraign Princesse of the Realm, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
from her youth in the <hi>Romane</hi> faith, from which there was hope, by better
instruction, and humble and courteous behaviour, she might be reclaimed; yet the
Preachers in their Sermons did publickly condemn that toleration as unlawful. And
amongst the Nobility,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> opposeth</note> the <hi>Earl of Arrane</hi> did oppose it, taking protestation that
<hi>he did neither agree to private nor publick Masse:</hi> which highly displeased the Queen,
and was thought to have alienated her affection, that before seemed much inclining
towards him.</p>
               <p>There fell out upon this an Accident,<note place="margin">A tumult in the Abbey.</note> which was like to have caused great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The Queen purposing to hear Masse the next day in her Chappel of <hi>Halirud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi>
whilest the tapers and other things required to that service were carried
through the Court, one of the common sort invading him, that bore the waxe
lights, brake them all in pieces, and if by the intervention of some more moderate
spirits the tumult had not been repressed, the rest of the furniture had been wholly
spoiled, and that day Masse disappointed. It was held a proud and insolent fact,
and condemned by many; others said that the patience of men was too farre tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted;
and some maintained that if right were done, the Priest according to Gods
law made against idolaters, ought to suffer death. But this stirre was quickly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> much against the Earl of <hi>Huntley<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> his mind, who by this occasion
thought to win credit with the Queen, and in conference with her Uncles bragged,
that if the Queen pleased to use his service, he would reduce all the North coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
to the <hi>Romane</hi> profession. But his courses being suspected, and the Quen mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
all counsels that tended unto trouble, no heed was given to his offers.</p>
               <p>The moneth following was spent in the entertainment of the <hi>French</hi> that had
accompanied the Queen homewards,<note place="margin">The Nobles that came from <hi>France</hi> with the Queen, return home.</note> they made but short stay in the countrey;
For about the middest of <hi>September,</hi> Duke <hi>d' Aumarll</hi> returned unto <hi>France</hi> by Sea,
the grand Prior, and <hi>Monsieur d' Anvile</hi> took their journey through <hi>England,</hi> the
Marquesse <hi>d' Elbeuf</hi> of all that company only remained, and abode all the Winter
with the Queen.</p>
               <p>In this mean time was <hi>William Maitland</hi> of <hi>Lethington</hi> directed to the Queen of

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50008:103"/>
letters were full of kindnesse, tending all to expresse the love and affection she bare
unto her, as to her dearest sister and kinswoman and the desire she had to continue
in true and sincere friendship with her. The letters sent by the Nobility were
to the same effect; but containing this more, <hi>That the surest way to preserve friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

and lawful heir to the Crown of</hi> England <hi>in case she should have no issue. Lethington</hi>
urging this last point strongly as he was commanded, after he had used his best per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
to that effect, was answered by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> as followeth. <hi>I did
expect another message from your Queen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> 
                  <hi>then this is which you have brought me, and do
marvel that she should forget the promise made before her coming out of</hi> France, <hi>touching
the ratification of the treaty of</hi> Leth; <hi>which was, that how soon she returned to her own
countrey, she should give me a full and resolute answer. I have long enough,</hi> said she. <hi>suffered
my self to be abused with fair speeches, and now it had been time, if she had regarded her
own honour, to have made good her promises. Lethington</hi> replied, that within a few days
after the Queen took land, he was imployed in this legation, and that she had no
leasure to deal in any publick matters, being taken up with admitting the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that came to welcome her into the Realm, and with the fetling of the estate
of Religion, which her Majesty understood to be a work of no small weight, neither
were all the Noblemen whose advice she must take in matters of that importance
come into the Court, before his parting from it. Here the Queen interrupting his
speech, said, <hi>What need is there of advice or counsel, to do that which by her subscription
and seal she is bound to perform?</hi> He answered, that no commission was given him
in that matter, nor did his Mistresse think that any accompt thereof would have
been required of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that she might justly excuse her self by the occasions
he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mentioned. Then after a few more speeches of that purpose, the Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the chief point of his legation, said, <hi>I have observed that you have often in
your discourse said, that your Queen is descended of the blood Royal of</hi> England, <hi>and that
I am obliged to love her, as being nearest to me in blood of any other, which I neither will
or can deny. Neither have I in any of my actions (as the world knoweth) attempted ought
against the safety and tranquillity of her, and her kingdom; yea they that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e most inward
with me, can witness that even when I had just cause of offence given me, by her usurpation
of the Titles and Armes of</hi> England, <hi>I could never be induced to think other, then that
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was the politick device of some enemies, to breed dissension amongst us. But howsoever
that be, I hope so long as I live, she shall not bereave me of my Kingdom, nor yet be able,
if God shall bless me with children, to impede their succession. And if it shall happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that I be taken away, she shall never find that I have prejudged the Right which she
claimeth to the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>What a right it is I have never been curious to know,
nor do I purpose to search and examine it, but will leave the same to the cognition of those
whom it concerneth. This your Queen may assuredly expect at my hands, that I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wrong her, nor her cause, if it be just, in the least point. And God I take to witness, who
heareth this our conference, that next my self, I know not any whom I would preferre to her,
or who (if the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>itors be: but alas, what power or force have these weak creatures to attempt
so great an enterprise? alwayes the matter it self is weighty, and of great importance,
which I will take time to think upon.</hi>

               <p>After some few dayes,<note place="margin">A second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Lethington.</hi>
                  </note> calling <hi>Lethington</hi> unto her, she said, <q>That it seemed
strange to her, how the Nobility at the Queens first coming should put up such
a request to her, seeing they knew there was no reparation made of former
wrongs, and to desire, <hi>saith she,</hi> that I should gratify their Queen, having received
so great an injury, without any amends made, is it not in effect as much as to
boast and threaten men if they will take such a course? I would have them think
that I am strong enough for them at home, and lack not friends abroad that will
maintain and defend my right.</q> Hereto he replied, That in his first speech he
had clearly discovered the intention of the Noblemen, how partly out of that duty,
which they owed to their Soveraign, and the defence of her honour, partly out of a
desire to confirm and assure the peace begun betwixt the two Realmes, they had
made this motion; and that the reason why they dealt so plainly with her, was not
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50008:103"/>
only the experience they had of her favour in times past, but also the respect of
their own safety. For if any should oppose the Queens right, and thereupon wars
should arise betwixt the two Kingdomes, they must needs be driven to hazard their
lives and estates. Wherefore they thought that their motion was not to be ill ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
seeing it tended to the cutting off the occasions of disagreement, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
differences by a firm and certain peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>True, <hi>saith she,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> If I had attempted any thing to the hurt of your Queens
right, they might with reason have required me to amend it. But when I am yet
in health and life to desire me to prepare mine own winding sheet, is a thing
without example, nor hath the like ever been required at the hand of any Prince:
yet I take in good part the meaning of your Lords, and am glad of the good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
they beare to their Queen, and the care they have to advance her honour.
I think it likewise wisdom in them to foresee the dangers they may run into, and
like well that they do abhorre the shedding of Christian blood, which I confesse
could not be avoided, if any faction should arise, and lay claim to the Crown.
But where, or what is that faction, or what force can they have? Alwayes lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
these things, suppose I had an inclination to satisfie their desire, think you
that I would rather gratifie your Lords herein then the Queen her self? No, I will
tell you, I have many other reasons that stay me from taking such a resolution.
First, I know what a dangerous thing it is to touch this string, and I have ever
upon great respects abstained from bringing in question the right of the Crown;
for so often hath the controversie of marriage lawful and unlawful, of legitimate
and base-born children, been agitated according as mens affections and humours
led them, that even in regard of those disceptations I have hitherto forborne to
match with any husband. Once at my Coronation I was married to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
whereof alwayes I carry this ring for a pledge, (<hi>pointing to a ring she more
on her finger</hi>) And howsoever things go, I shall be Queen of <hi>England</hi> so long as I
live; when I am dead, let them succeed who have the best right. If your Queen
hath it, I shall not wrong her in the least point, and if it belong to another, it
were not reasonable to desire me to do them an open and manifest wrong. If
there be any law, which may barre her title, it is unknown to me, for I do not
willingly think of these matters; but if there be any such, when I received the
Crown, I sware to my people that I should not change their lawes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now where you say,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for her refuse.</note> that by declaring your Queen my successor, our affection
should become more firm; I rather fear, that it should be the seed of a most bitter
hatred. For think you, that I will behold willingly the preparation of mine own
funerals? It is natural to Princes to be jealous even of the children that by Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
are to succeed them. How did <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh of <hi>France</hi> carry himself
towards <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, and he again towards <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, or King
<hi>Francis</hi> of late towards <hi>Henry</hi> who succeeded him? and is it probable, that I should
be otherwise disposed towards my Cousen, if once she shall be declared heir unto
my Crown? No, be sure I shall have the very same mind which <hi>Charles</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
shewed to <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>There is another thing which I esteem of an exceeding great weight; I know
the unconstancy of the people, how they loath alwayes the present government,
and have their eyes continually set upon the next successor: and naturally they
are moe that look, as it is said, to the Sunne rising then to the setting of the Sun.
To omit other examples, this I know by mine own experience; when my sister
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> reigned, how earnestly did a number wish to see me placed in her
Throne? what a desire had they of my advancement? if I had but given my
countenance to their practises, they would have refused no peril in bringing the
same to effect. Now it may be the same persons are not of the same mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, as children that dream that apples are given them are greatly joyed,
but in the morning when they are awaked, and find themselves deceived, they
fall a weeping; so they who loved me exceedingly when I was but called <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
and if I perhaps gave them any good countenance, thought with their selves,
that how soon I was made Queen, they should be rewarded rather according to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50008:104"/>
their own conceipt, then any service done unto me, now when they find that the
issue answereth not their expectation, some of them, it may be in hope of a better
fortune, would not dislike a change of the government. For the greatest wealth
that ever any Prince had, or can have, is not able to satisfie the unsatiable cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse
of men. And if this be our case, that the affection of our people is so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
changed, when we keep a greater moderation in our largesses, then they
think we ought, or perhaps for some other light cause they grow discontented,
what may we think shall come to passe, when seditious people have a certain suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
designed, to whom they may open their griefes, and betake themselves, if
they be in any sort displeased? In what a peril think you I should live, having so
mighty neighbour Princes to succeed me? to whose grandor look how much I shall
add by confirming her succession, so much I shall detract from mine own security.
This peril no caution can assure, nor the bonds of any lawes avert. Princes also
who live in expectation of Kingdomes, do hardly contain themselves within the
limits of right and reason: surely I my self would never think my estate assured,
if once my successor were known to the world.</q> This is the summe of that which
passed at this second audience.</p>
               <p>Not many days after getting accesse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lethingtons</hi> third audience.</note> he askt the Queen, what answer she would
give to the Nobility? she said, <hi>At this time, I have no answer to give, but that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the affection and sedulous care they have of their Soveraigns good estate, but the
matter is of such weight, as I cannot on a suddain, or directly answer it. When your
Queen shall perform her promise concerning the treaty of</hi> Leth, <hi>it will be time to require a
proof of my affection towards her; till then I cannot with safety of mine honour gratify
her in any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lethington</hi> replied, as before, that he had no Commission in that businesse, and
that in the matter of succession he had shewed more his own judgement, then the
mind of the Queen his Mistresse; for he could never think the confirmation of the
treaty of <hi>Leth,</hi> to be a thing of that importance, as for the delay or refusal of that, the
Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> and her posterity should be excluded from the succession of the
Crown of <hi>England.</hi> 
                  <q>Neither will I now, saith he, enquire by whom that treaty
was concluded; at what time, in what manner, by what authority, and for what
cause it was done; for I have no warrant to speak of these things: but this I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that albeit the Queen following her husbands direction, had ratified the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
she should have found her self thereby so farre interessed, as she would doubtless
used all means to free her self of the same. And this I say not in the Queens name,
but only to make it seem, that our Noblemen have reason to travel, that all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
and controversies may cease, and a firm and perpetual peace may be
established.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This and some other speeches interchanged amongst them touching the treaty,<note place="margin">The conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken by the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note>
moved the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to agree that the same should be revised by some
Commissioners, and corrected after this form. <hi>That the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>should
thenceforth abstain from using the</hi> English <hi>Armes, and from the titles of the Crown of</hi>
England, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>during the life of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and her posteriy. That on
the other part the Queen of</hi> England <hi>should oblige her self and the children begotten of her,
to do nothing in prejudice of the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>her succession.</hi> These were the things
acted in this legation.</p>
               <p>Now at home the Queen keeping a progresse in the countrey,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in the countrey.</note> went from <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>

<hi>Edinburgh</hi> a little before the feast of <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> at which time the Burgesses are
wont to elect their annual Magistrates, and to set down statutes for the good of the
town; amongst other acts, one was published, inhibiting that <hi>any adulterer, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50008:104"/>
                  <hi>granting liberty to all good and faithfull subjects, to repair and remain within the Burgh

               </p>
               <p>These things ministred great offence,<note place="margin">The Preachers are displeased.</note> who seeing the
Queen take more liberty then she did in the beginning, keeping her Masses more
publick, and causing them to be celebrated with a greater pomp, did mightily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
thereof in their Sermons, but profited little; for some of the Noblemen, who
had in former times shewed themselves most jealous against the toleration of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
were grown a little more cold by the flatteries of Court, and all of them emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of others greatness, were striving who should be in most favour with the
Queen.</p>
               <p>She had some while before this taken to be of her privy Councell,<note place="margin">The Queen maketh choice of a Councell.</note> the Duke of
<hi>Chattellerault,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Huntly, Argile, Atholl, Morton, Marshall, Glencarn, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosse</hi>

Bishop of <hi>Rosse; Huntly</hi> was created Chancellor, one that in matters of religion had
behaved himself very unconstantly, and to win the Queens favour was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
altogether Popish. This animated the Priests and others of that faction,
which before were quiet, and put them in some heart.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Ninian Winyet</hi> Schoolmaster at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> a man of reasonable learning,
set forth a Book of questions,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ninian Winyet</hi> a Priest exiled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> against the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith; which went currant in
the Court, and was much esteemed by them of his Profession. Being cited, and
divers conferences kept with him, to make him acknowledge his errors, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
obstinate, and was therefore sentenced by the Church; wherefore he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
the Countrey, and flying to <hi>Germany</hi> was preferred to be Abbot of the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
Monastery at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> where he lived many years. The Abbot of <hi>Corsrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi>
in the West, published about the same time another Faith. Whereunto <hi>Iohn
Knox</hi> having made a reply, and the Author in regard of his age and quality of
birth, (for he was of the house of <hi>Cassils</hi>) was thought fit to be overseen.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Court was busied in a consultation how to supply the charge
of the Queens house,<note place="margin">The thirds of Benefices granted to the Queen.</note> which the ordinary revenues of the Crown could not so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
maintain as was required. Divers being thought upon, the readiest seemed
to fall upon the Church rents, and draw somewhat from the Prelates and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Persons. To this purpose they were convened before the Councell, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long Treaty, and many perswasions used, considering with themselves, how
they subsisted merely by the Queens favour, and that by refusing a part, they
might endanger the whole, they were induced to yield the third part of their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
to be disposed of at the Queens pleasure, and assumed forth of what places her
Collectors should choose, her Majesty securing them of the two parts during their
lives, and liberating them of the Ministers, with whose maintenance they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
boasted. It carried some shew of commodity this at first, but turned to little
or nothing; the Prelates and beneficed men undervaluing their rents, and making
up a third, which did afterwards when the number of Ministers increased, scarce
suffice to their provisions.</p>
               <p>Much about this time a rumour was raised in the Court,<note place="margin">A guard of horse and foot levied to attend the Queen.</note> and went a while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled,

other the like courses familiar in the Courts of Princes,<note place="margin">He chargeth <hi>Murray</hi> with the affectation of the Crown.</note> he laboured to disgrace
him; and finding that these prevailed not, presented to the Queen a libell written
with his own hand, wherein he charged the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> with ambitious affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the royall authority. Yet the proofs he brought being weak, the Queen
made no accompt thereof. This also failing, he incited <hi>Iames Hepburn,</hi> Earl of

Duke <hi>Hamilton;</hi> who, as he said, lay waiting on the Queens death, and aimed at
no less then the Crown, and besides bare a particular enmity against himself. This
he said could not but be acceptable to the Queen, seeing that besides the naturall
hatred that all Princes have to their successors, she did bear a speciall grudge to
the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> for his love to the reformed religion, and because of some hard
speeches that fell out in a conference betwixt him and her uncle the Marquesse
<hi>d' Elbeuf.</hi>
               </p>

thereto, his next address was to the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> offering to take part with them in
cutting off the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> (whose credit with the Queen he knew they disliked)
and shewing how easie it might be done; By this means, he said, they should have
the Queen in their own hands, and be rid of him who chiefly stood in their way. The
time and place of the murther being considered upon, <hi>Bothwell</hi> and <hi>Gawin Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
Abbot of <hi>Kilwining,</hi> are said to have taken the matter in hand. The device
was to kill the Earl whilest the Queen was at hunting in the Park of <hi>Falkland,</hi> and
that performed, to carry the Queen along with them for their greater surety, and
the countenancing of the fact.</p>

and finding by the answer what advertisement he had made, perswaded the Duke
his father to send him with some Keepersto the house of <hi>Kinneill.</hi> But he making
an escape in the night came to the house of <hi>Grange</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> and sending to the Earl

being dimitted for that time, was at his next appearing clearly perceived by his
words and countenance to be taken with a phrensie, yet when he came to himself,
as he did sometimes in the beginning of the disease, he wrote to the Queen and others
so judiciously, as many thought he did only fain himself mad, to free his father of
the conspiracy. The rest he accused so constantly and with such eagerness, that in
presence of the Councell he made offer, since the accusation could not be made
out by witnesses, to try in single combat with <hi>Bothwell.</hi> But the Queen misliking
that form of triall made <hi>Bothwell</hi> to be sent to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50008:105"/>
by some whom he had suborned to cut him off in the fray. This not succeeding,<note place="margin">An. 1562.</note>
some armed men were laid to intercept him as he came from the Court at night;
for the Queen detaining him late, he was wont to go accompanied with one or two
only in most quiet manner to his lodging. But this being likewise frustrated by
advertisement given to <hi>Murray,</hi> and he having tried it to be so (for upon the notice
given him, he went and found them standing armed in the Porch of the Abby,
which was the place designed to him) delated the matter to the Queen. <hi>Huntly</hi> excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his men, said that they were some only of his company, who being to go home
that day, had put on their armes, and being stayed by some occasion till the next
morning, were there attending his coming.</p>
               <p>This excuse, albeit naught and frivolous,<note place="margin">Letters sent from beyond sea in favour of <hi>Huntly.</hi>
                  </note> was accepted for the time, which gave
many to think, that the Queens affection to her brother was not so great as it was
commonly taken to be. And it is true, that about the same time the Queen had
received letters from the Pope, the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and her uncles in <hi>France,</hi>
advising her to entertain <hi>Huntly</hi> as the man most powerfull, and best inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the advancing of the <hi>Romish</hi> religion, and to give him some hopes of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with <hi>Iohn Gordon</hi> his second son, whereby he should be made more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the purpose. Great promises were made besides of money and other
necessary supplies for war, but so alwayes, as these were made away that were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Catholick faith; of whose names a roll was sent unto her, and the Earl
of <hi>Murray</hi> placed in the first rank. But what impression these letters made in the
Queens mind, she shewed the same to her brother, and used him with no less respect
then before.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the next summer there was a great speech of the interview
of the Queens of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An interview of the two Queens moved.</note> and messengers to and fro sent to agree upon
the place, the time and manner of the meeting. The motion came from the Queen of
<hi>Scots,</hi> who, as it was thought, greatly affected the same out of a desire she had to
live in a firm peace with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and make her self known to the
subjects of that Countrey. Neither was the meeting disliked of the better sort, as
thinking it would serve, besides the preservation of the common peace, to bring
her unto a liking of the reformed religion. But they who were popishly set, fearing
greatly the conference, spake openly against it, saying, <hi>That of such interviewes there
was never seen any good fruit, and that it would not be safe for the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>to put
her self in the power of her, whose Kingdom she had claimed.</hi> Not the less, the treaty
went on, and was concluded, <hi>York</hi> condescended to be the place of meeting, the
numbers on either side agreed unto, and the time designed about the end of <hi>Iune.</hi>
But whilest all things were in readiness for the journy, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> excused
her self by letters,<note place="margin">The interview stayed.</note> desiring the interview should be put off till the next year, which

some punishment against blasphemy, against the contempt of the Word, the
profanation of the Sacraments, the violation of the Sabbaths, adultery, fornication,
and other the like vices condemned by the word of God, whereof the laws of the
Countrey did not take any hold. For actions of divorce, it was likewise desired that
they should be remitted to the judgement of the Church, or at least trusted to men
of good knowledge and conversation, and that Popish Churchmen might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from places in Session and Councell. To these Petitions exhibited in
writing, the Queen after she had perused the same, made answer, <hi>That she would do
nothing in prejudice of the religion she professed, and hoped before a year was expired to

The eighth of <hi>September</hi> the night before her setting forth, were seen in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
great inflamations and lightnings extraordinary, which continued the space
of two houres and above. It feared the common sort, who do always interpret
such accidents to be prognosticks of some trouble: But the Queen contemning
these things as casual, would not hear of altering her journey; so the first day she

Keeper <hi>Alexander Gordon</hi> refused to give her entry. Thereupon she began to suspect
some treachery. In the Townesmen she could repose no assurance, as being all vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
and dependers of <hi>Huntley;</hi> The town it self was unfenced with walls, and the
countrey all in Arms, (as she was advertised) to attend his coming. Yet disposing of
things in the best sort she could, order was given to keep a strong watch, to fortify
the passages into the town, and have ships prepared in the Road, whereunto if need
were, she might take her refuge. About midnight some spies sent from <hi>Huntley</hi>
unto the town were apprehended, who discovering his numbers and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
were made fast. And the next morning, upon a rumour that went of
her danget the Queen stood in, there flocked out of all quarters unto her num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Highlandmen, the <hi>Frasers,</hi> and <hi>Munroes</hi> chiefly, with their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and friendship.<note place="margin">The Castle beiseged and rendered.</note> The <hi>Clanchattan</hi> in <hi>Huntleys</hi> company, how soon they
knew that the enterprise was against the Queen, forsook him, and slipped

commanded to lay siege to the Castle which rendered upon the first assault.
The Captain and principal Keepers were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
but the lives of the common
souldiers spared. After some four days abode in the Castle, the Queen returned to
<hi>Aberdene,</hi> accompanied with all the Noblemen and clans of the countrey, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
came the Lady <hi>Huntley</hi> with offers of submission for her husband, but was

               <p>
                  <hi>Huntley</hi> perceiving the world thus altered,<note place="margin">

so as there was no hope of regaining her favour, betook himself to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
courses, and assembling his friends and others that would run hazard with
him, he approached to <hi>Aberdene,</hi> presuming much of the affection of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants:
At Court he had the Earl of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Lesley</hi> of <hi>Bughaine,</hi> men of
no mean power, who made him daily advertised of things that passed there, and the
small numbers that were with the Queen, willing him to take the opportunity.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50008:106"/>
Whereupon resolving to follow his enterprise before the forces of the Queen were
further increased (for charge was gone to all that could bear Armes in <hi>Lothian, Fife,
Angus, Stratherne,</hi> and <hi>Mernis,</hi> to come and attend her at <hi>Aberdene)</hi> he advanced with
some 800. in company, looking to find no resistance. And like enough the enterprise
had succeeded to his mind, but that the same morning letters were intercepted,
sent by <hi>Sutherland</hi> and <hi>Buquhaine</hi> to <hi>Huntley,</hi> which detected all their counsel. <hi>Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
upon discovery escaped: <hi>Buquhaine</hi> was pardoned upon his confession, and from
thenceforth served the Queen faithfully. <hi>Huntley</hi> advertised of these things, was
advised by his friends to turn back; yet hearing the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> was coming
against him, he made a stay resolving to fight.</p>
               <p>The place of standing he chused,<note place="margin">The battel of <hi>Corrichie.</hi>
                  </note> was naturally fenced with mosse and quagmire,

number, and few whom he might trust: for howbeit of the countrey about, divers
gathered unto him, most of them were corrupted by <hi>Huntley,</hi> as appeared when the
companies came in sight one of another, all of them in sign of treason, and that they
might be discerned by the enemy, putting a bush of heath or header in their helmets,
and how soon they came to joyn, giving back, and retiring in great disorder. The
Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> who stood a little off with an hundred in a troop, discovering the
treason called aloud to his men, that they should bend their Spears, and not suffer
those that fled to enter amongst them. So forced to take another course, they went
aside leaving him and his troop, when they had taken their standing. <hi>Huntley</hi>
imagining upon that flight and disorder the day to be his, commanded his men to
throw away their lances, and with drawn swords to run upon them, as to a slaughter.
But when they were come to the place where <hi>Murray</hi> with his company stood, they
were born back and compelled to fly as fast, as before they followed. They who
had played the Traytors seeing this, to clear themselves, turned upon <hi>Huntley,</hi> and
made all the slaughter which was committed that day.</p>

the conclusion whereof was, that punishment should be taken according to

one who by his noble behaviour had raised great expectation of himself. Abused
he was by the hopes of a royal match, and which grieved all the beholders, pitifully

censured. The severe proceeding against Papists put many in hope that the Queen
should be brought to embrace the Religion: which was further assured by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
she gave unto the Church in the Parliament kept at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the <hi>May</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,<note place="margin">A Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

wherein divers statutes passed upon their Petitions, as in the Acts of that
time may be seen. In this Parliament was the <hi>Act of oblivion</hi> (agreed unto at the

                  </note> certain of the Queens family that remained in the Palace of <hi>Halirud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi>
had a Priest attending them, who did his ordinary service in the Chappel; divers

complained of by the Preachers. The Citizens being informed that many of their
people were gone thither, one day went down, and being denied entry, forces the
gates, Some were taken and carried to prison, many escaped the back way with the
Priest himself. The uproare was great, and advertisement gone to the Queen
thereof, she was mightily incensed, avowing not to come to the Town, till
some exemplary punishment were inflicted upon the doers; yet by the mediation
of the Earls of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Glencarne</hi> she was pacified.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> only was called
before the Councel, and charged to have been the author of the sedition, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for convocating the subjects by his missive letters, whensoever he thought
meet. He answered, <hi>That he was never a Preacher of rebellion, nor loved to stirre up
tumults: contrariwise, he taught all people to obey their Magistrates and Princes in God.
As to the convocation of the subjects, he had received from the Church a command to
advertise his Brethren, when he saw a necessity of their meeting; especially, if he saw Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to be in peril: and had often craved to be exonerated of that burthen, but still was
refused.</hi> Then directing his speech to the Queen with a wonderful boldness, <hi>He
charged her in the name of the Almighty God, and as she desired to escape his heavy wrath
and indignation, to forsake that Idolatrous religion which she professed, and by her power
maintained against the statutes of the Realm.</hi> And as he was proceeding, was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> then Chancellor (fearing the Queens irritation) to hold
his peace, and go away. After which time matters were carried more peaceably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Queen and the Church, the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> alwayes interposing himself,
and propounding the Petitions of the Church unto her, as likewise returning
her answers to their satisfaction.</p>

of a milde and sweet behaviour. He had presence of the Queen in the place of

that she was perceived to bear some affection unto him. Whereupon a speech went,
that she would take him unto her husband.<note place="margin">The Queen intendeth to take him to husband.</note> And indeed, besides the love she carried
to the young Nobleman, there was great respects that led her that way. He was
descended of the Royal blood of <hi>England.</hi> And next unto her self, the apparant
heir of that Crown. If it should fall him to marry with one of the greatest families
of <hi>England,</hi> it was to be feared, that some impediment might be made to her in the

chuse unto her self a husband in <hi>England</hi> for the better conservation of the peace
contracted betwixt the kingdomes, and had of late recommended the Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>

against her. Of the Nobility at home, some opposed the Marriage under pretext of
Religion (for the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> and his son were both esteemed to be Popish.) The
Queen of <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> her Ambassadour, advised her not to
use hast in a business of that importance; and (to interpose some impediment) char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> and his son to return into <hi>England,</hi> the time being not yet
expired, contained in their licences. And universally amongst the subject, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
was agitated, <hi>Whether the Queen might chuse to her self an husband; or it were more
fitting, that the Estates of the land should appoint one unto her.</hi> Some maintaining, that
the liberty could not be denied unto her, which was granted to the meanest
subject; others excepting, that in the heirs of the Kingdom the case was different,
because they in assuring an husband to themselves, did withall appoint a King over
the people; and that it was more reason the whole people should chuse an husband
to one woman, then that one woman should elect a King to rule over the whole
people. It was objected also by some, that the marriage was unlawful, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Canon law, Lady <hi>Margaret Douglas</hi> his mother, being sister uterine to
King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth her father. But for this the Queen had provided a remedy,
having sent <hi>William Chisholin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dumblane</hi> to bring a dispensation from
<hi>Rome.</hi> And to strengthen her self at home, she restored <hi>George Gordon</hi> son to the

It grieved many to see a stranger thus advanced; <hi>Lethington</hi> chiefly was displeased for
that he found his credit this way impaired, yet being one that could put on any disguise

truth, that he was the object of divers Noblemens envy, did perswade him by all
means to work the match, and procute (if it could be) the consent of the Queen of

                  <hi>Signieur Davie</hi> (for so he was commonly called) did after this labour with all
his power to have the marriage perfected; and as he was of a politick wit, the more
to bind the young Nobleman and his friendship unto him, studied to have the same
finished before the return of the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> answer, either fearing, that her
disassent might work some delay in the match, or that the Noblemans obligation

themselves in companies on St. <hi>Leonards</hi> Crags took counsell to put their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses
in armes, to assign them Captains, and to disarm such of the townsmen as
they knew to be affected to the marriage.</p>
               <p>The Queen highly incensed at this mutiny did haste to the town,<note place="margin">The Queen cometh to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi> and the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners fly.</note> at whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heads of the faction, <hi>Andrew Slater, Alexander Clerk, Gilbert Lauder, William

of the Magistrates (so great was the Queens clemency) restored, and
themselves pardoned.</p>
               <p>The Assembly of the Church meeting at the same time in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> presented
to the Queen by their Commissioners the Petitions following;<note place="margin">An Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>1. That the Papisticall and blasphemous Masse with all Popish idolatry,<note place="margin">Petittions of the Church.</note> and the
Popes jurisdiction should be universally suppressed and abolished through the
whole Realm, not onely amongst the subjects, but in the Queens Majesties own
person and family, and such as were tried to transgress the same punished according
to the Laws.</p>
               <p>2. That the true Religion formerly received, should be professed by the Queen,
as well as by the subjects; and people of all sorts bound to resort upon the Sundayes
at least, to the prayers and preaching of Gods Word, as in former times they were
holden to hear Masse.</p>
               <p>3. That sure provision should be made for sustentation of the Ministery, as well
for the time present as for the time to come, and their livings assigned them in the
places where they served, or at least in the parts next adjacent; and that they should
not be put to crave the same at the hands of any others. That the benefices now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
or that have fallen void since the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> 1558. and such as should
happen thereafter to be void, should be disponed to persons qualified for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
upon triall and admission by the Superintendents.</p>
               <p>4. That no Bishoprick, Abbacie, Priory, Deanry, Provostry, or other benefice
having more Churches then one annexed thereto, should be disponed in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to any one man, but that the Churches thereof being dissolved, the same should
be provided to severall persons, so as every man having charge, may serve at his
own Church, according to his vocation. That Gleabs and Manses might be designed
for the residence of Ministers, as likewise the Churches repaire; and an Act made
in the next Parliament to that effect.</p>
               <p>5. That none should be permitted to have charge of Schools, Colledges, and
Universities, or to instruct the youth either privately or publickly, till they were
tried by the Superintendents in the visitation of the Churches, and after tryall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their charge.</p>
               <p>6. That all Lands founded of old to Hospitalitie should be restored, and applied
to the sustentation of the poor; and that Lands, annuall rents, or other emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
belonging sometime to the Friers of whatsoever Order, as likewise the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities,
Aultrages, Obits and other duties pertaining to Priests, be imployed to
the same use, and to the upholding of Schools in the places where they lie.</p>
               <p>7. That horrible crimes abounding in the Realm, such as idolatry, blasphemy of
Gods Name, manifest violation of the Sabbath or Lords day, witchcraft, sorcery,
and inchantment, adultery, incest, open whoredom, maintaining of brothels, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
slaughter, theft, reife and oppression, with all other detestable crimes, be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
punished, and Judges appointed in every Province for executing the
same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:50008:108"/>8. That some order should be devised for the relief of the poor labourers of the
ground, who are oppressed in their Tythes by Leases set over their heads, and they
thereby forced to take unreasonable conditions.</p>
               <p>To these petitions the Queen made Answer by writing in this sort: First she
said,<note place="margin">The Queens answer to the Petitions.</note> 
                  <hi>That where it was desired that the Masse should be suppressed and abolished aswell in
her Majesties own Person and Family, as amongst the Subjects, her Highness did answer
for her self, that she was no wayes perswaded, that there was any impiety in the Masse;
and trusted her Subjects would not press her to do against her Conscience. For not to
dissemble, but to deal plainly with them,</hi> she said, <hi>she neither might nor would forsake the
Religion wherein she had been educated, and brought up, believing the same to be the true
Religion, and grounded upon the Word of God. Besides she knew, that if she should change
her Religion, it would lose her the frienship of the King of</hi> France, <hi>and other great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
her friends and confederates, upon whose displeasure she would be loath to hazard,
knowing no friendship that might countervail theirs. Therefore desired all her loving
Subjects, who have had experience of her goodness, how she had neither in times past, nor
yet in time coming did intend to force the conscience of any person, but to permit every
one to serve God in such manner, as they are perswaded to be the best. That they
likewise would not urge her to any thing that stood not with the quietness of her
mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the establishing the Religion in the body of the Realm, she said, <hi>That
they knew the same could not be done but by the consent of the three Estates in Parliament.
And how soon the same should be convened, whatsoever the Estates did condescend unto,
her Majesty should thereto agree, assuring them in the mean while, that none should be
troubled for using themselves in Religion, according to their consciences, and so should have
no cause to fear any perill to their lives or heritages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the third and fourth Articles it was answered, <hi>That her Majesty did not think
it reasonable, that she should defraud her self of so great a part of the Patrimony of the
Crown, as to put the Patronages of benefices forth of her own hands, seeing the publick
necessities of the Crown did require a great part of the Rents to be still retained. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
her Majesty was pleased, that her own necessity being supplied, after it should be
considered, what might be a reasonable sustentation to the Ministers, a speciall assignation
should be made to them forth of the nearest and most commodious places, wherewith her
Majesty should not intermeddle, but suffer the same to come to their use.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the sustentation of the poor, her Majesty said, <hi>That her liberalitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them should be as far extended, as with reason can be required.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the rest of the Articles, <hi>Her Highness promised to do therein, as the Estates
convened in Parliament should appoint,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the midst of <hi>Iuly</hi> (the dispensation of the marriage being brought from
<hi>Rome</hi>) the Queen was espoused to the Lord <hi>Darnelie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queen married to the Lord <hi>Darnly.</hi>
                  </note> after the Popish manner in
the Chappel of <hi>Halirudhruse</hi> by the Dean of <hi>Restalrig,</hi> and the next day was he by
the sound of the Trumpet proclaimed King, and declared to be associated with her
in the Government.</p>
               <p>The discontented Lords sent forth their complaints upon this,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the discontented Lords.</note> alledging, <hi>That the
Kingdome was openly wronged, the liberties thereof oppressed, and a King imposed upon the
people without advise and consent of the Estates (a thing not practised before at any time,
and contrary to the Laws and received custom of the Countrey) Desiring therefore all good
subjects to take the matter to heart, and joyn with them in resisting these beginnings of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi>
But few or none were thereby won to shew themselves openly of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so as when the Queen with her husband went against them, they left the town
of <hi>Striveling</hi> where the first convened, and fled into <hi>Paislay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King to make himself more popular,<note place="margin">The king hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a Sermon at St. <hi>Giles.</hi>
                  </note> and take from the Lords the pretext
of Religion wherewith they coloured their designes, took purpose to go unto St.
<hi>Giles</hi> Church in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and hear Sermon. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> (either doubting his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
or favouring the faction of the Noblemen) fell upon him with a bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof;
for which being cited before the Queen and Councell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the Councell.</note> he not onely stood
to that he had spoken but added, <hi>That as the King for her pleasure had gone to Masse, and
dishonoured the Lord God, so should he in his Iustice make her the instrument of his ruine.</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:50008:109"/>
The Queen incensed with this answer, burst forth in tears: whereupon he was inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
preaching by the Councell, and silenced for some moneths. Mr. <hi>Iohn Craig</hi>
(who a little before was brought to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) because of the prohibition given
to his Colleague, refused to do any service there, which put the people in a stur,
yet upon better advice, he was moved to continue in his charge.</p>
               <p>In the end of <hi>August</hi> the King and Queen accompanied with five thousand or
thereabouts,<note place="margin">The Lords pursued by the King and Queen.</note> went to <hi>Glasgow</hi> to pursue the Lords. They removing from <hi>Paisley</hi> to
<hi>Hamilton,</hi> an Herald was sent thither to summon the Castle, which they denied to
render, giving out, that they would try the matter in battell the next day. But
the manifold distractions amongst themselves did let this resolution, and divers fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
away from their side, they went to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where supposing to finde assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the Captain of the Castle forced them by his continuall playing on the
town, to quit it. After which they tooke their course to <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> allured by the
fair promises of <hi>Iohn Maxwell</hi> Lord <hi>Hereis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A new expedition upon this was concluded, and the Lieges warned to meet at
<hi>Bigger,</hi> the 9. of <hi>October:</hi> in the mid time the King and Queen leaving the Earl of
<hi>Lenox</hi> Lieutenant in the West parts, made a Progress through <hi>Fife,</hi> to punish those
that had assisted the Lords. The Lairds of <hi>Grainge, Balcomie, Pitmillie,</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mormie,</hi>
were fugitive, some others of meaner sort taken prisoners, and the towns
of <hi>Perth, Dundie,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrewes</hi> fined in great summes. This done, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and from thence went into <hi>Dumfr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is,</hi> where the Lords had stayed
all that while: The Lord <hi>Hereis</hi> pretending to make their peace, concluded his
own,<note place="margin">The Lords flie into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> advising them to fly into <hi>England,</hi> as they did. Thither went the Duke of
<hi>Chattellerault,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Murray, Glencarne,</hi> and <hi>Rothes,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ochiltrie,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory
of <hi>Kilwinning,</hi> and divers others of good note. A few dayes they
abode in <hi>Carlile</hi> with the Earle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Lieutenant at that time in the North.
Then going to <hi>Newcastle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>England</hi> intercedeth for the Lords.</note> they sent the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> to the <hi>English</hi> Court, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

of her Privie Chamber, named <hi>Tamerorth</hi> with Letters to the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing,
that <hi>Murray</hi> and the rest might be received in favour. The Gentleman
not vouchsafing to give her husband the title of a King, nor bringing any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to him, was denied presence, and had his answer delivered him in writing,
to this effect: <hi>That Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>should do well to have no medling with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of</hi> Scotland, <hi>but leave them to their Princes discretion, seeing neither she, nor her
husband did trouble themselves with the causes of her subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke perceiving that by these means their peace would not be hastily made;<note place="margin">The Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in favor</note>
and knowing his reconcilement to be more easie, resolved to sever his cause from
the rest, and sent the Abbot of <hi>Kilwinning</hi> to entreat favour to himself and his
friends: which he easily obtained, for he was known to be nothing so guilty as the
others, and to have been craftily drawn upon that faction; so he returned into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>December</hi> following.</p>
               <p>In this moneth a generall Assembly of the Church convened again at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Church.</note>
where the answer made by the Queen to their last petitions was presented; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
unto by the same Assembly in this manner:<note place="margin">A reply to the answer of their last Petitions.</note> First they said, <hi>That it was no
small grief to the hearts of good and Christian subjects to hear, that notwithstanding the
Evangel of Christ had been so long preached in the Realm, and his mercy so plainly offered,
her Majesty should yet continue unperswaded of the truth of that Religion, which they
preached and professed, it being the same which Christ Iesus had revealed to the world,
which he commanded his Apostles to preach, and ordained to be received of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and firmly retained by them untill his second coming; A religion that had God the
Father, his onely Son Christ Iesus, and the Holy Spirit for the Authors thereof; and was
most clearly grounded upon the Doctrine and practice aswell of the Prophets, as Apostles,
which no other religion upon the face of the earth could justifie, alledge or prove. For
whatsoever assurance the Papist had or could alledge for his profession; the same the</hi>
Turk <hi>had for his</hi> Alcoran; <hi>And the</hi> Jews <hi>more probably might alledge for their rites
and traditions, whether it be antiquity of time, or consent of people, or authority of Princes,
or multitudes and number of Professors, or any the like cloakes they do pretend. Wherefore
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50008:109"/>
in the Name of the eternall God (with the reverence that became them) they required her
highness to use the means whereby she might be perswaded of the truth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 1565.</note> 
                  <hi>such as the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word of God, the ordinary mean that he hath appointed for working knowledge
and begetting faith in the hearts of his chosen ones, conference with learned men, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
with the adversaries, which they were ready to offer, when and where her Grace
should think expedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, where she could not believe any impiety to be in the Mass they made
offer <hi>to prove the whole Mass from the beginning to the ending, to be nothing else but a
mass of impietie, and that the Priest his actions, the opinion which the hearers, or rather the
gazers upon it had of the same, were blasphemous, and grosly idolatrous.</hi> And where her
Majesty said, <hi>she would not hazard the displeasure of the King of</hi> France <hi>and other Princes,
with whom she was confederated;</hi> they to the contrary did assure her, <hi>That true Religion
is the onely bond that joyneth men with God, who is the King of Kings, and hath the hearts
of all Princes in his hands, whose favour ought to be unto her more pretious, then the
favour of all the Princes on earth, and without which no friendship or confederacy could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
endure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, touching her answer to the Article for sustentation of the Ministery,
they shew, <hi>It was never their meaning, that her Majesty, or any other Patron should be
defrauded of their just rights. Onely they desired when any Benefice was void, that a
qualified person should be presented to the Superintendent of the bounds, to be tried, and
examined by him. For as the Presentation belongeth to the Patron, so doth the Collation
belong to the Church. Otherwise, were it in the Patrons power simply to present whom
they pleased, without triall or examination, there should be no order in the Church, and all
be filled with ignorance and confusion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, to that which her Majesty spake of retaining a great part of the Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in her own hands, they answered, <hi>That such doing was against the Law both of
God and Man, and could not stand with a good conscience, seeing it tendeth to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of many poor souls that by this means should be defrauded of instruction.</hi> And for the
offer she made to provide the Ministery by assignations in places most commodious,
her own necessities being first supplied, they said, <hi>That good order did require Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
first to be provided, Schools for instructing the youth maintained, the fabrick of
Churches repaired and upheld, and the poore and indigent members of Christ sustained; all
which ought to be furnished out of the Tithes, which are the proper Patrimony of the
Church. These things done, if any thing were remaining, that her Majesty and Councell
might use it as they should think expedient.</hi> In end, giving thanks to her Majesty for
the offer of assignations, they humbly desired the generall offer to be made more
particular, and that it might please her to reform the answer given to the Articles
of the Church in all the aforesaid points.</p>
               <p>After this sort did the Church insist with the Queen, but with small success; for
the provision of Ministers some small supply was obtained. But in the point of
Religion, they found no contentment. During the rest of this winter, matters were
quiet: but the next year had a foul beginning, <hi>Seigneur Davie</hi> who governed all
affairs at Court, had onely the Queens ear, being slain upon the occasion, and after
the manner you shall hear.<note place="margin">The slaughter of <hi>Signeur Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie</hi> conspired.</note> There had fallen out a little before some private discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
betwixt the King and Queen, whereupon first she caused change the order
which was kept in the Proclamations and publick Records, placing the name of her
husband after her own name, that the Royall authority might be known to belong
unto her self wholly. And after a little time upon a colour that the dispatch of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
was much hindred through the Kings absence; she had appointed in stead of
his hand, a cachet to be used in the signing of Letters, which was committed to the
custody of <hi>Seigneur Davie.</hi> This being noted, (as they are never wanting some
in Court to stirre the coals) divers tales were brought to the King of the neglect
and contempt that he was held in, and of the great respect carried to the stranger.
The vanity and arrogancy of the man himself was likewise so great, as not content
to exceed the chief of the Court, he would outbrave the King in his apparell, in his
domestick furniture, in the number and sorts of his horses, and in every thing else:
So as no speach was for the time more common and currant in the Countrey, then
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50008:110"/>
that of <hi>Davies</hi> greatness, of the credit and honour whereunto he was risen, and of
the small account that was taken of the King. This the King taking in heart, he
did open his grief unto his father, who advised him to assure the Nobility at home,
and to recall those that were banished into <hi>England;</hi> which done, he might easily
correct the insolency and aspiring pride of that base fellow.</p>
               <p>A parliament being then called to meet at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 12.<note place="margin">A Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> deserted.</note> of <hi>March,</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
sentence of forfeiture against the Earls of <hi>Murray, Glencarn, Argile, Rothes,</hi>
and other Noblemen that were fled into <hi>England,</hi> as the time of meeting drew nigh,
the Queen laboured earnestly to have the process laid against them found good; and
that matters might go to her mind, she designed <hi>Davie</hi> to exercise the office of
Chancellour in that meeting. The Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> who after <hi>Huntlies</hi> death had
supplied the place unto that time, interpreted this as a disgrace offered unto him,
dealt with the King (with whom he was grown familiar) to make him sensible of
his own contempt and misregard; and finding him apprehensive enough that way,
drew him to a meeting in the Lord <hi>Ruthvens</hi> lodging, upon pretext of visiting the
Nobleman, who lay then diseased, where breaking forth in a speech of the present
misgovernment, the blame of all was cast upon the King, as having for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of a wicked villain chased his cousins and best friends out of the Realm, and
helped to raise a base fellow to such a heighth of credit, as now himself was become
by him despised. The King that could not deny it to be his fault in a great part,
professed his readines to joyn with them for remedying those evils, and from thence
forth promised to do nothing but by the consent of the Nobility. Yet they not
esteeming it safe to trust his promises, whom they knew to be facile and somewhat
uxorious, lest afterwards he should go from that agreement, did exhibite to him a
Bond in writing, wherein they were all sworn to joyn for maintaining Religion,
reducing the Noblemen lately exiled, and making <hi>Davie</hi> out of the way. Unto
this the King did wittingly set his hand, and with him subscribed the Earl of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
the Lords <hi>Ruthven</hi> and <hi>Lindesay,</hi> for he also was present and upon the plot.</p>
               <p>The night following, because matters could not be long kept close, and needfull
it was to go presently thorough with the designe by reason of the Parliament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,<note place="margin">The slaughter of <hi>Davie.</hi>

they prepared to execute the same. <hi>Morton,</hi> whose forces were greatest
was appointed to guard the utter Court of the Palace, if perhaps any stir should be
made. For there lodged within the Earls of <hi>Huntly, Atholl, Bothwell, Sutherland</hi> and
<hi>Cathnesse,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Flemyn</hi> and <hi>Levingston,</hi> a force to have resisted any sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
attempt. The King taking the Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> with him, who was but lately
recovered of a Fever, and followed by four or five men at most, entered into the
room where the Queen sate at supper. <hi>Ruthven</hi> seeing <hi>Davie</hi> at the table, (for the
Queen was accustomed when she supped private to admit others to sit by her, and
that night the Countess of <hi>Argile,</hi> and beneath her <hi>Davie</hi> was placed) commanded
him to arise and come forth, for the place where he sate did not beseem him.</p>
               <p>The Queen starting up hastily, went between <hi>Davie</hi> and <hi>Ruthven</hi> to defend him,
and <hi>Davie</hi> clasping his hands about her middle, the King laboured to loose them,
willing her not to be afraid, for that they were come onely to take order with that
villain. Then was he dragged down the stairs to the gallery where <hi>Morton</hi> with
his company was walking. There they fell upon him, and striving who should give
the first stroak, killed him with many wounds.</p>
               <p>It was constantly reported that he had warning given him oftner then once by
<hi>Iohn Damiott</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Priest,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Damiott</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Priest willed him to be gone.</note> who was thought to have some skill in Magick, to do
his business and be gone, for that he could not make good his part; And that he
answered disdainfully, <hi>The Scots are given more to brag then to fight.</hi> Some few
dayes again before his death being warned by the same Priest to take heed of the
bastard, he replied, <hi>That whilest he lived, he should not have credit in</hi> Scotland <hi>to do
him any hurt.</hi> For he took the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> to be the man, of whom he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
to take heed. But that prediction either fulfilled, or eluded, the first stroak
was given him by <hi>George Douglas,</hi> base son to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> after whom, such
others as were in place, either serving their private malice, or desiring to be
esteemed associates in that conspiracy, inflicted every man his wound till he was
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50008:110"/>
dispatched; yet had they no commandment from the contrivers, so to kill him:
It being their purpose to have brought him to publick execution, which they knew
would have been to all the people a most grateful spectacle. And good it had been
for them so to have done, or then to have taken him in another place, and at another
time, then in the Queens presence. For besides the great peril of abortion, which her
fear might have caused; the false aspersions cast upon her fame and honour by that
occasion, were such as she could never digest, and drew on all the pitiful accidents
that afterwards ensued.<note place="margin">The Queens behaviour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Davies</hi> murther.</note> The Queen bursting forth in many tears, after a great chiding
she kept with the Lord <hi>Ruthven,</hi> sent one of her maids to enquire what was become
of <hi>Davie,</hi> who quickly returning, told that he was killed; having asked her how she
knew it, the maid answered, that she had seen him dead. Then the Queen wiping
her eyes with her handkerchief, said, <hi>No more tears; I will think upon a Revenge.</hi>
Neither was she seen after that, any more to lament.</p>
               <p>The rumour of this deed ran soon through the Town, whereupon the people
did arm, and go to the Palace. But they were pacified by the King, who calling to
them from a window, shewed that the Queen and he were well, and that they
needed not to fear, because that which was done, was done by his own command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Noblemen that lodged within the Palace, were charged to keep within
their chambers; yet the Lords <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Bothwel</hi> escaped the same night by a
window at the back of the Palace. <hi>Athol</hi> and the rest had licence to depart the next
morning. Upon Tuesday thereafter (for the slaughter was committed upon Sater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the ninth of <hi>March</hi>) the Earls of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Rothes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The exiled Lords return.</note> with these that were exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in <hi>England,</hi> returned to <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and going first to the Parliament house,
took documents, that they were ready to answer the summons of forfeiture dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
against them, and that none did insist to pursue.</p>
               <p>In this doubtful estate of things the Queen not knowing whom to trast, sent
for her brother the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and having conferred familiarly a while with
him, by his means had her servants and guards restored; for after the slaughter they
were all put from her.<note place="margin">The King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.</note> The night following she went from the Palace to <hi>Seaton,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Dumbar,</hi> taking the King with her in company; who repenting
the fact, and forsaking the other Conspirators, did openly by sound of Trumpet at
the Market Crosse of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> protest his innocency, denying, that ever he gave his
consent to any thing, but to the returning of the Lords that were banished in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Yet was the contrary known to all men, so as this served only to the undoing
of his reputation, and made him find few or no friends thereafter to aid him in his
necessity.</p>
               <p>Upon the Queens departing the Conspirators,<note place="margin">The Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators flye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> and whosoever were thought pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
thereto, fled some to <hi>England,</hi> others to the borders, and Highlands, and such
a change you should have seen as they who the night preceding did vant of the fact
as a goodly and memorable Act, affirming some truly, some falsely, that they were
present thereat, did on the morrow forswear all that before they had affirmed. The
Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> with the Lords <hi>Ruthven, Lindesay,</hi> and young <hi>Lethington,</hi> remained
at <hi>Newcastle</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> falling again in the feaver depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this life. Mr. <hi>Iames Macgill,</hi> Clerk of Register, with divers Citizens of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
that were esteemed favourers of the fact, left the Town, and lurked privately
amongst their friends.<note place="margin">Inquisition of the murtherers.</note> After some four dayes stay at <hi>Dumbar</hi> the Queen returned

to the Lord <hi>Ruthven,</hi> with Sir <hi>Henry Yair</hi> sometimes a Priest, being apprehended,
were after trial hanged, and quartered. <hi>William Harlaw</hi> and <hi>Iohn Mowbray</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> convicted, and brought to the place of execution, had their

conscious of the murther, for not appearing were denounced Rebels. The office of
the Clerk Register was conferred upon Sir <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> and a conclusion taken in
councel, that they who should be tried to have either devised, or to have been actual
committers of the said murther, should be pursued by order of Justice, and the same
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50008:111"/>
executed with all severity:<note place="margin">An. 1566.</note> but that the Commons and others that came to the
Palace accidentally, should upon their supplication be used with more clemency.
In all this proceeding there was none more earnest or forward then the King, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
whereof the hatred of the fact lay heavy upon him, nor could he ever
after this time recover his former favour with the Queen. The rest after a little
time were reconciled, <hi>Lethington</hi> by the means of <hi>Athol</hi> was first called home, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<hi>Bothwel</hi> did strongly oppose it. The Barons addressed for themselves, by means
of their friends that were in credit. <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Lindesay</hi> in the winter following
were pardoned at the request of the Earls of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Argyle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the time of the Queens lying in drew nigh,<note place="margin">The Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> made choice of for the Queen her lying in.</note> whereupon the Councel meeting
to advise upon the place where her Majesty should stay, made choice of the Castle
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as the part most commodious: and ordained the Earl of <hi>Arrane,</hi> who
was there kept prisoner, to be removed to the Castle of <hi>Hamilton</hi> with a liberty to
travel by the space of two miles about, providing he should do nothing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of his house, and enter himself unto 20. days warning in the Castles of
<hi>Edinburgh, Dumbar,</hi> and <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> or any of them; for observance whereof the
Earls of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Glencarn</hi> became sureties.</p>
               <p>The Queen at her first entrie into the Castle did feast the Nobility, and made
them all friends:<note place="margin">The Queen feasts the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen.</note> 
                  <hi>Argyle, Murray,</hi> and <hi>Athol</hi> had lodgings assigned them within the
Castle. <hi>Huntley, Bothwel,</hi> and others of the Nobility remained in the Town. The
19. of <hi>Iune,</hi> betwixt nine and ten of the clock in the evening she was brought to bed
of a son,<note place="margin">The Queen delivered of a son.</note> to the exceeding joy of the subjects, for which the Nobles and whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
assembled the next day in the Church of S. <hi>Giles,</hi> gave solemn thanks to God.
Presently was Sir <hi>Iames Melvil</hi> sent to carry the newes to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
who to congratulate her safe and happy delivery,<note place="margin">Sir Henry Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lligrew sent from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> sent Sir <hi>Henry Killigrew</hi> to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by Post. The Assembly of the Church convened the same time in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
sent the Superintendent of <hi>Lothian</hi> to testify their gladnesse for the Princes
birth,<note place="margin">The desire of the Church for the Baptisme of the Prince.</note> and to desire that he should be baptized according to the form used in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Church. To this last she gave no answer, otherwise the Superintendent and
his Commission were very graciously accepted. The Queen calling to bring the
Infant that the Superintendent might see him, he took him in his Armes, and
falling upon his knees conceived a short and pithy prayer, which was very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
heard by her; having closed his prayer, he took the babe, and willed him to
say <hi>Amen</hi> for himself; which she took in so good part, as continually afterwards she
called the Superintendent her <hi>Amen.</hi> This story told to the Prince when he came to
years of understanding, he alwayes called him his <hi>Amen;</hi> and whilest he lived, did
respect and reverence him as his Spiritual Father.</p>
               <p>The Queen waxing strong went by water to <hi>Alloway,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queen goeth to <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
                  </note> a house pertaining to the
Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> and kept private a few dayes. In that place brake out first her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
against the King her husband; for the following her thither, was not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to stay, but commanded to be gone, and when at any time after he came to
Court, his company was so loathsome unto her, as all men perceived she had no
pleasure nor content in it; such a deep indignation had possessed her mind, because
of the disgrace offered to her in the slaughter of her servant <hi>Davie,</hi> the envy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was all laid upon the King, as she could never digest it.</p>
               <p>Secretary <hi>Lethington</hi> (who by his subtle flatteries was crept again into favour)
did wickedly foster this passion,<note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> soffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties anger against the King.</note> by putting in her head a possibility to divorce from
the King, which he said was an easie work, and a thing that might be done, only by
abstracting the Popes dispensation of their marriage. And the Earl <hi>Bothwel</hi> (a man sold
to all wickednes) did likewise by himself and by his instruments (of whom Sir <hi>Iames
Balfour</hi> was the chief) take all occasions to incense her, and by exaggerating the
Kings ingratitude towards her, wrought her mind to an hatred implacable.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>October</hi> the Queen went to <hi>Iedburgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queen goeth to <hi>Ied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                  </note> to keep some Justice
Courts, where she fell dangerously sick; the King coming there to visit her, had no
countenance given him, and was forced to depart. At her return from the Borders
being in <hi>Craigmillar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Lethington</hi> renuing the purpose of divorce in the hearing of the
Earls of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Huntley,</hi> did perswade her to take some course for her separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50008:111"/>
from the King, seeing they could not live together in <hi>Scotland</hi> with security.
The Queen asking him how that could be done without some blemish to her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
he replied, that none would think ill of her part therein, she being so ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
used by him; but that all might know the murther of <hi>Davie</hi> to have been his
fact, her Majesty should do well to pardon the Lords, that were fled to <hi>England,</hi> and
call them home. Nay said the Queen, I will rather have matters to continue as they
are, till God remedie them. Yet within few days <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Lindesay</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
at the intreaty of the Earls of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Huntley,</hi> as was touched
before.</p>
               <p>Preparation was then making for the Baptisme of the Prince,<note place="margin">Preparation for the Princes Baptisme.</note> who about the end
of <hi>August</hi> had been transported to <hi>Striveling.</hi> To honour this solemnity, the <hi>Counte
de Briance,</hi> was sent Ambassadour from the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Monsieur de Croke,</hi> from
the Duke of <hi>Savey,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> from the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> who
brought with him a Font of gold weighing two stone weight, with a Bason and Ewer
for the Baptisme. At the day appointed for the solemnity, (which was the fifteenth
of <hi>December</hi>) they all convened in the Castle of <hi>Striveling.</hi> The Prince was carried
by the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour, walking betwixt two ranks of Barons and Gentlemen
that stood in the way from the Chamber to the Chappel, holding every one a proket
of wax in their hands. The Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> went next to the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador,
bearing the grear fierge of wax. The Earl of <hi>Eglington</hi> carried the Salt, the Lord
<hi>Semple</hi> the Cude, and the Lord <hi>Ross</hi> the Bason and Ewer: all these were of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
profession. In the entry of the Chappel the Prince was received by the
Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> whose Collaterals were, the Bishops of <hi>Dunkeld, Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blane,</hi>
and <hi>Ross;</hi> there followed them, the Prior of <hi>Whithern,</hi> sundry Deans and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,
with the Gentlemen of the Chappel in their several habits, and Copes.
The Countesse of <hi>Argyle</hi> by Commission from the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> did hold up
the Prince at the Font, where the Archbishop did administer the Baptisme with
all ceremonies accustomed in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, the spittle excepted, which the
Queen did inhibit. The Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> entered not in the Chappel, during the
service; and without the dores stood all the Noblemen, professors of the reformed
Religion. The rites performed, the Prince was proclaimed by his name and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.
<hi>Iames, Prince and Stewart of</hi> Scotland, <hi>Duke of</hi> Rothesay, <hi>Earl of</hi> Carrick,
<hi>Lord of the Isles, and Baron of</hi> Renfrew: then did the Musick begin, which having
continued a good space, the Prince was again conveighed to his chamber.</p>
               <p>It was night before the solemnity took end,<note place="margin">The King withheld from the solemnity.</note> for it was done in the afternoon.
The feasting and triumphal sports that followed, were kept some days with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
cost and magnificence, yet the content the people received thereby was
nothing so great, as their offence for the Kings neglect; for neither was he admitted
to be present at the Baptisme, nor suffered to come unto the feast. To some his ill
disposition was given for an excuse, others more scornfully were told that his fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
had not used the diligence they ought in preparing his apparel. Mean while
the Ambassadours had a watchword given them, not to see nor salute him. And
such of the Nobility as were known to bear him any favour, or out of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
did vouchsafe him a visit, were frowned upon by the Court. His Father
advertised of these things, sent for him to come unto <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained;
but scarce was he past a mile from <hi>Striveling,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth sick in the way to <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow.</hi>
                  </note> when a vehement pain seised
on all the parts of his body, which at his coming to <hi>Glasgow</hi> was manifestly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to proceed of poison, that treacherously had been ministred unto him: for
through all his body brake out blisters of a blewish colour, with such a dolour and
vexation in all his parts, as nothing but death was a long time expected. Yet his
youth and natural strength vanquishing the force of the poison, he began a little to
convalesce, and put his enemies to other shifts, wherein shortly after (but to their
own undoing) they prevailed.</p>

of the Church was then gathered, did greatly offend the better sort; yet nothing
grieved them so much, as a Commission granted to the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
whereby he was reponed to his ancient jurisdiction in confirming Testaments, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50008:112"/>
collation to Benefices, and other such things as were judged in the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Courts. The Assembly taking this greatly to heart, ordained a supplication to
be made to the Nobility, and Lords of secret Councel, <hi>professing Christ with them,
and who had renounced the Romane Antichrist,</hi> (I use the words of the superscription)
for impeding the said Commission, and letting it to take effect. In this supplication
they said, <q>That the causes judged in these Courts did for the most part pertain
to the true Church,<note place="margin">The Churches complaint for the same.</note> and that howsoever in hope of some good effect to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
the Church had overseen the Commission granted by the Queen in these
matters to men who for the greater number were of their own profession, they
would never be content that he whom they knew to be an enemy to <hi>Christ</hi> and
his truth, should exerce that jurisdiction, seeing under the colour thereof, he might
usurp again his own authority, and take upon him the judgement of heresie, in
which case none could be ignorant what his sentence could be; wherefore their
desire was, the Queen should be informed that this was a violation of the laws of
the Realm, and the setting up again of the <hi>Romane Antichrist,</hi> whose authority
and usurped power in an open and free Parliament had been condemned, which
her Majesty also at her first arriving into this Realm, and since that time by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Proclamations had expressely forbidden to be acknowledged; here of they
said if their honours should plainly and boldly admonish the Queen, using
that reverence which was due from Subjects, and doing nothing in a tumult,
they did perswade themselves, she would do nothing against Justice, and that
such Tyrants should not dare once to appear in Judgement. But howsoever
matters went, they humbly craved to understand their minds, and what they
would do, if it should happen such wolfes to invade the flock of Christ.</q> This
the summe of the supplication. I find not what answer it received, nor that the
Bishop made any use of his Commission; but the change it seems which shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
happened in the State, did quite frustrate the same.</p>

to the Orders of that Church. Because it will appear by the letter, in what
esteem our reformers did hold the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and how farre they were

for it, not by constraint but willingly, not as being Lords of Gods heritage, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
examples to the flock.</hi> We further desire you to meditate upon that sentence
of the Apostle, <hi>Give not offence, either to the Iewes, or to the Grecians, or to the Church
of God.</hi> In what condition ye and we both travel for the promoving of Christs
Kingdom, ye are not ignorant, therefore we are the more bold to exhort you,
to deal more wisely then to trouble the godly with such vanities. For all things
which seem lawful, edify not. If the commandment of the Authority urge the
consciences of you and our brethren, further then they can bear, we pray you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that ye are called <hi>the light of the world, and the salt of the earth.</hi> All civil
authority hath not ever the light of God shining before their eyes in their statutes
and commandments, but their affections favour too much sometimes of the
earth, and of worldly wisdome. Therefore we think that ye ought boldly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
your selves, not only to all power that dare extoll it self against God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
against all such as dare burthen the consciences of the faithful, further then
God hath burthened them in his own word.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But we must confesse our offence, in that we have entered in reasoning fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then we purposed and promised in the beginning, now therefore we return
to our former humble supplication, which is, that our brethren who amongst you
refuse these <hi>Romish</hi> ragges, may find of you who are Prelates such favour, as our
head and Master commandeth every one of his members to shew to another:
which we look to receive from your humanity, not only because ye will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
Gods Majesty in troubling of your brethren for such vain trifles, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
ye will not refuse the humble request of us your brethren and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preachers;
in whom albeit there appear no worldly Pompe, yet we suppose ye
will not so farre despise us, but that ye will esteem us in the number of those that
fight against the <hi>Romane</hi> Antichrist, and travel that the Kingdom of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
may be every where advanced. The days are evil, iniquity aboundeth, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
(alas) is waxed cold; Therefore ought we to watch the more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the hour is uncertain, when the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> shall appear; before whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e,
your brethren and we must give an account of our administration. And thus in
conclusion we once again crave favour to our brethren; which granted, ye shall
command us in the Lord things of double more importance. The Lord <hi>Iesus</hi>
rule your hearts in his true fear unto the end, and give unto you and us victory
over that conjured enemy of all true religion, the <hi>Romane Antichrist,</hi> whose woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
head Satan by all means laboureth to cure again; but to destruction shall he
and all his maintainers go by the power of our Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> to whose mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
we heartily commit you. From our General Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the

                  <p>To quiet the Ministers,<note place="margin">Assignation of Ministers stipends.</note> who were daily complaining of their lack of provision,
the Court made offer to the same Assembly of certain Assignations for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
relief, which were accepted under protestation, that the same should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50008:113"/>
their right to the tithes, nor be accompted as a satisfaction for the same. For
these they held to be the proper Patrimony of the Church, and so justly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereto, as that they ought not to be paid to any others, under whatsoever
colour, or pretext. But this protestation availed not, only it sheweth what
was the judgement of the Church in that time concerning tithes.</p>
                  <p>The Queen in <hi>Ianuary</hi> following went to visit the King who lay sick at <hi>Glasgow.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Queen visiteth the King at <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow.</hi>
                     </note>
After some complainings he made of her unkindnesse, and a little chiding they
kept for discontents passed, they did so lovingly reconcile, as the King, though he was
not as yet fully recovered, was content to be transported to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and had a
lodging prepared in a remote place of the Town,<note place="margin">He cometh to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and there is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.</hi>
                     </note> for his greater quiet, as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
But he had not stayed there a fortnight, when <hi>Bothwel</hi> having conspired
his murther, did come upon him in the night, as he lay asleep, and strangled him
with one of his cubiculars, that lay in the chamber by him. The murther commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the two corpses were carried forth at a gate in the Town wall, and laid in an
Orchard near by, and thereafter the house blown up with powder; the noise where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
did awake those that were sleeping in the furthest parts of the Town. The
Queen not gone as yet unto her rest, convened the Noblemen that lodged within the
Palace, and by their advice sent <hi>Bothwell</hi> with some others to enquire what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was, (for he was returned to his Chamber before the blowing up of the house,
having left some to fire the train, when he was past and gone away) many of all sorts
did accompany him to the place, where finding the body of the King naked only,
the upper part covered with his shirt, the rest of his apparel, and even his pantofles
near by him, each one making a several conjecture, <hi>Bothwel</hi> would have it believed,
that the violence of the powder had carried his body forth at the roof of the house
unto that place; but this was against all sense, for not a bone of his whole body was
either broken or bruised, which must needs have been after such a violent fall. Nor
could it be perceived, that either the corps or garments were once touched with the
powder. So it was manifest that his body and all were laid there by the hands of
men. <hi>Bothwel</hi> returning, shewed the Queen what a strange thing had happened, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
how it could be, and who they were committed the murther: she hearing it,
retired to a private room, and went presently to bed.</p>
                  <p>Now he had provided some to carry the newes unto the borders,<note place="margin">A rumour dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed by <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> that <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rray</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi> had murthered the King.</note> and to give out
that the Earls of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi> were the chief contrivers of the murther:
which rumour went currant in <hi>England</hi> for a while. Yet ere a long time passed, all
was laid open, and he known to have been the principal actor himself. Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were made promising large summes of money to those that would detect the
murtherers: whereunto the next night by a placard affixed on the Market Cross, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
was made, <hi>That if the money should be consigned in the hands of an indifferent
person, the murtherers should be revealed, and the delator set to his name, and justify his
accusation.</hi> No notice being taken of this offer, voices were heard in the dark of the
night, crying, that <hi>Bothwel</hi> had murthered the King, some drawing his portraict to
the life, set above it this superscription, <hi>Here is the murtherer of the King,</hi> and threw
the same into the streets. And there were some, that in all the publick places of the
Town, affixed the names of the murtherers, the principal as well as the accessaries.
For the principal they named <hi>Bothwel;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The names of the murtherers cast forth in the street.</note> as accessaries, Sir <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> and <hi>Gilbert

Sebastian, Iohn de Burdeaux,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> the brother of <hi>Davie,</hi> which last four were
of the Queens houshold. These things did so offend the Court, as neglecting the
trial of the murther, they fell to the drawers of these portraicts and the authors of
the libels. All the Painters and Writers were called for dignoscing the letters, and
draughts; when nothing could be tried, to provide for afterwards against the like
by a new edict, it was made capital to disperse libels for defaming any person in that
sort, and to have, keep, or read any such that should happen to be affixed, or cast
into the streets.</p>

the time of Parliament, as she had purposed. Particularly he desired the Earl

resignation, placing therein Sir <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> whom he especially trusted. The

<hi>My Lords, I am come hither sent by my master, my Lord of</hi> Lenox, <hi>to declare
the cause of his absence this day, and with his power as my Commission beareth. The
cause of his absence is the shortness of time, and that he could not have his friends and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to accompany him to his honour, and for the security of life, as was needfull in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the greatness of his partie. Therefore his Lordship hath commanded me to desire
a competent day, such as he may keep, and the weight of the cause requireth; otherwise,
if your Lordships will proceed at this present, I protest, that I may use the charge commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me by my Lord my master, without the offence of any man. This is, that if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who pass upon the Assise and enquest of these that are entered on pannell this day, shall
cleanse the said persons of the murther of the King, that it shall be wilfull errour, and not
ignorance, by reason it is notoriously known that these persons did commit that odious mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as my Lord my master alledgeth. And upon this my protestation, I require an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Justice by the advice of the Noblemen and Barons appointed to assist in
that judgement,<note place="margin">The persons chused upon the Jury.</note> did notwithstanding the said protestation grant process, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Noblemen chosen for the Jury were called. These were <hi>Andrew</hi> Earl of

Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Hereis, Laurence</hi> Lord <hi>Oliphant, Iohn</hi> Master of <hi>Forbes,</hi> with the Lairds
of <hi>Lochinvar, Langton, Cambusnetham, Barnbowgall,</hi> and <hi>Boyne:</hi> the Earl of <hi>Cassills</hi>
excused himself, offering the penalty, which by the Law they pay that refuse to pass
upon Assise, but could not obtain himself freed, the Queen threatning to commit
him in prison, and when he seemed nothing terrified therewith, commanding him
under pain of treason to enter and give his judgement with the rest. Thus were
they all sworn and admitted, as the manner is; After which <hi>Bothwell</hi> being charged
with the inditement, and the same denied by him, they removed forth of the Court
to consult together, and after a little time returning, by the mouth of the Earl of
<hi>Cathnes</hi> their Chancellour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bothwell</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited with a protestation of the Jury.</note> declared him acquit of the murther of the King, and of
all the points contained in the inditement, with a protestation, <hi>That seeing neither
her Majesties advocate had insisted in the pursuit, nor did</hi> Robert Cuningham, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner
for the Earl of</hi> Lenox, <hi>bring any evidence of</hi> Bothwells <hi>guiltiness, neither yet
was the inditement sworn by any person, and that they had pronounced according to their
knowledge, it should not be imputed to them as wilfull errour which they had delivered.</hi>

as his prolocutours, askt instruments upon the Juries declaration; so he
went from that Court absolved, yet the suspicions of the people were nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished.
And some indeed were of opinion, that the Judges could give no other
deliverance, nor find him guilty of the inditement as they had formed it; seeing
he was accused of a murther, committed on the 9. day of <hi>February,</hi> whereas the
King was slain upon the 10. of that moneth. But he for a further clearing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
set up a paper in the most conspicuous place of the market,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bothwell</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to try his innocency by combat.</note> bearing. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he had been acquited in a lawfull Justice court of that odious crime laid
unto his charge, yet to make his innocency the more manifest, he was ready to give
triall of the same in single combate with any man of honourable birth and quality
that would accuse him of the murther of the King. The next day in the same place,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50008:114"/>
by another writing, answer was made, that the combat should be accepted, so as a

                  <p>The 13. of <hi>April</hi> a Parliament was kept for restoring the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and others

In this Parliament the Commissioners of the Church made great instance for
ratifying the Acts concluded in favour of the true Religion, yet nothing was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
The Queen answering, that the Parliament was called for that onely busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that they should have satisfaction given them at some other time. The
Parliament being broke up, <hi>Bothwell</hi> inviting the Noblemen to supper did liberally

                        <hi>Bothwell</hi> seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the consent of the Lords to the Queens marriage.</note> and after many thanks for their kindness, fell in some speeches for the
Queens marriage, shewing the hopes he had to compass it, so as he might obtain
their consents. Some few to whom he had imparted the business before-hand,
made offer of their furtherance, the rest fearing to refuse, and suspecting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
set all their hands to a bond, which he had ready formed to that purpose.</p>
                  <p>A few dayes after,<note place="margin">He ravisheth the Queen in her return from <hi>Striveling.</hi>

and meeting the Queen on the way as he returned from <hi>Striveling,</hi> whither she had
gone to visit her son, he took her by way of rape and led her to the Castle of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar.</hi>
No men doubted but this was done by her own liking and consent, yet a
number of Noblemen convening at <hi>Striveling,</hi> lest they should seem deficient in
any sort of their duties, sent to ask whether or not she was there willingly detained?
for if she was kept against her will, they would come with an Army and set her at
liberty; She answered, <hi>That it was against her will that she was brought thither, but
that since her coming she had been used so courteously, as she would not remember any more
that injury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this rape (as afterwards came to be known) was devised to secure the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
of the King.<note place="margin">His design in committing this rape.</note> For it being held sufficient by a custome commonly received,
that in remissions granted for crimes committed, the most hainous fact being parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly

words, they were advised to pass a remission for violence offered to the Queen, and
the laying of hands upon her person, then to subjoyn, [<hi>And for all other crimes and

Judges constitute by the Queens authority, in all causes consistoriall: and in

others in the fourth degree, and no dispensation granted by the Pope for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summating

divorce: both the processes were posted, and such festination made in them, as in the
space of ten dayes they were begun and concluded.</p>

willed him to publish the banes;<note place="margin">The banes of <hi>Bothwell</hi> with the Queen asked.</note> his answer was, <hi>that he could ask no banes, especially

declare his own mind touching the marriage, and that he should not be tied by that asking
of their banes to solemnize the same.</hi> The first preaching day falling to be friday, in the
hearing of divers Noblemen, and Counsellors, he shewed what he was enjoyned to
do; <hi>That he held the marriage betwixt the Queen and</hi> Bothwell <hi>unlawfull, whereof
he would give the reasons to the parties themselves, if he might have hearing; and if this
was denied,</hi> he said, <hi>that he would either cease from proclaiming their banes, or declare the
cause of his disallowance in the hearing of all the people.</hi>
                  </p>

that the Church had in the last Assembly inhibited the marriage of persons divorced for
adultery.</hi> Next he alledged <hi>the divorce from his wife to have proceeded upon collusion
betwixt them, which appeared,</hi> as he said, <hi>by the precipitation of that sentence, and the
contract made so suddenly after his divorce with the Queen.</hi> Thirdly, he laid to his
charge, <hi>the rape of the Queen, and the suspicion of the Kings murhter; which that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
would confirm.</hi> For these reasons he most gravely admonished him <hi>to surcease and
leve that course, as he would eschiew the wrath and indgnation of Almighty God.</hi> He
desired also the Lords present, to advertise the Queen of the infamy and dishonour
that would fall upon her by that match, and to use their best means to divert her
from it.</p>
                  <p>The Sunday following,<note place="margin">His publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof to the people.</note> publickly he declared what he had spoken in Councell,
and that it seemed to him they would proceed in the marriage, what mischief soever
should ensue. <hi>For himself,</hi> he said, <hi>that he had already liberated his conscience, and yet
again would take heaven and earth to record, that he abhorred and detested that marriage
as scandalous and hatefull in the sight of the world.</hi> But <hi>seeing the great ones as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
did approve it, either by their flattery, or by their silence, he would beseech the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to pray fervently unto God, that he might be pleased to turn that which they intended
against Law, reason, and good conscience, to the comfort and benefit of the Church and
Realme.</hi> These speeches offended the Court extremely; therefore they fummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him to answer before the Councell, for passing the bounds of his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>For the bounds,</hi> said he, <hi>of my Commission, are the Word of God, good Lawes, and
naturall reason; and by all three I will make good, that this marriage, if it proceed, will
be hatefull and scandalous to all that shall hear of it.</hi> As he was proceeding in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<hi>Bothwell</hi> commanded him silence, and thus was he dimitted.</p>
                  <p>Nottheless of this opposition the marriage went on,<note place="margin">The marriage of the Queen with <hi>Bothwell</hi> celebrated.</note> and was celebrated the 15.
of <hi>May</hi> by <hi>Adam</hi> Bishop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> in the Palace of <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi> after the manner
of the reformed Church. Few of the Nobility were present, (for the greater part
did retire themselves to their houses in the Countrey) and such as remained, were
noted to carry heavy countenances; <hi>Monsieur le Crock</hi> the Ambassadour being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired
to the feast, excused himself, thinking it did not sort with the dignity of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to approve the marriage by his presence, which he heard was so universally
hated. His Master the <hi>French</hi> King, as likewise the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> had seriously
disswaded the Queen from the same by their Letters; but she led by the violence of
passion, and abused by the treacherous counsell of some about her, who sought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their own ends, would hearken to no advice given her to the contrary. Yet was
it no sooner finished, then the ill fruits thereof began to break out: for the wonted
acclamations and good wishes of the people were no more heard, when she came in
publick; and divers that had set their hands and seals to the marriage, fell now
openly to condemn it, as that which ministred too just a suspicion, that she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to the death of the King her husband.</p>

                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:50008:115"/>The Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> immediately after the murther of the King had forsaken the
Court, and lived at home, waiting some occasion to be revenged of the doers, and
now esteeming it fit to shew himself,<note place="margin">The Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens bond for preservation of the young Prince.</note> he came to <hi>Striveling,</hi> where in a meeting of
Noblemen that were desired to come thither, upon his motion a bond was made
for the preservation of the young Prince, lest <hi>Bothwell</hi> getting him in custody,
should make him away, as no man doubted he would, as well to advance his own
succession, as to cut off the innocent childe, who in all probability would one day
revenge his fathers death.</p>
                  <p>The principals of this combination, were the Earls of <hi>Argile, Atholl, Morton,

(which was naturall unto him) detected all their counsells to the Queen; and
the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> with great promises was won to the adverse party. <hi>Bothwell</hi> suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
some insurrection, advised the Queen for saving her reputation in forain
parts, to acquaint the <hi>French</hi> King and her kinsmen of the house of <hi>Guise,</hi> with her

coming solicited to enter into bond for the defence of the Queen and <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who
should on the other part be obliged to protect them in all their affairs. Some of
these being wrought to the purpose, did set their hands willingly to the bond: the

to refuse,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> refused and is licensed to goe into <hi>France.</hi>

again to begin, and the rest to follow in their order for the same space. So as during
the whole year, the Counsellours should be tied to the attendance of 3 moneths
onely. It was alwayes provided that so many of the forenamed persons as happened
to be at Court, should during their abode, notwithstanding of their severall assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
be present with the others; And that it should be lawfull for the Queen to
adjoyn at any time such as she thought worthy of that honour. The same day a
Proclamation was given out, <hi>Declaring all writings purchased from the Queen for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Papists to use the exercise of their Religion, to make no faith, her Majesty being
no way minded to violate the Act made at her first arrivall, and often since that time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

with a provision for 15. dayes according to the custome, it was publickly rumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that these forces were gathering for some other business, and that the intention
was, to have the Prince her son in her own custody, and taken out of the Earl of
<hi>Marre</hi> his hands. So as a new Declaration came forth, <q>To certify the people of
her good affection, and that she never meaned to make any novations in the
Kingdom, by altering the lawes thereof, nor do any thing in the publick affairs,
but by the advice of the Noblemen of her Councel. And for her sonne, as
she had trusted him to such a Governour as other Princes in former times
were custome to have, so her motherly care for his safety and good education
should be made apparent to all.</q> But no regard was had to these Declarations,

                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords upon their escape retired to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>

                     </note> where they expected the rest

they went to the street offering themselves to conduct the people, and to assist them
in the defence of the Town; but they found few or none willing to joyn with them,
and the peoples affections wholly inclining to the Lords. The Magistrates gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to shut the gates, but no further resistance was made; so as the Lords entering by
the gate called S. <hi>Maryport,</hi> which was easily brokeup, they made themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

received by the Keeper, (Sir <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> a man much trusted by <hi>Bothwel</hi>)
though at the same time he was treating with the Lords for delivering the Castle
into their hands.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given out by the Lords.</note> the Lords gave out a Proclamation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they declared, <q>That the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> having put violent hands in the
Queens person, warded her highnesse in the Castle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> and retaining her
in his power, had seduced her, being destitute of all counsel, to an unhonest
and unlawful marriage with himself, who was known to have been the principal
authour, deviser, and actor in the cruel murther committed upon the late
Kings person; and that he was daily gathering forces, and strengthening himself
by all means, of purpose, as appeared, to get in his hands the young Prince, that
he might murther him in the like sort, as he had done his Father: which the
Nobility of the Realm had resolved to withstand, and to deliver the Queen
out of his bondage. Therefore did they charge all and sundry the Lieges within
the Kingdom to be in readiness upon three houres warning, to assist the said
Noblemen for delivering the Queen from captivity, and bringing the said Earl
and his Complices, to underlie the trial and punishment of Law for the foresaid
murther. Commanding all such as will not joyn with the said Noblemen, to
depart forth of the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> within four hours after the publication
made, under the pain to be reputed as enemies, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Queen having escaped,<note place="margin">The Queen gathereth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> as we shew, there resorted to her from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
numbers of people, so as within few houres she had an Army about her of
4000. men and above, a force sufficient to oppose the enterprisers. The Lords on
the other side, were cast into many difficulties;<note place="margin">Difficulties amongst the Lords.</note> for the heat of the common sort of
people being quickly cooled, as ordinarily it happeneth, and the greater part of the
Nobility being either enemies, or behaving themselves as Neuters; few of them
came to offer their assistance: yea had they been never so many, lacking munition and
other necessary provisions for the besieging of forts, they saw no way to attain to
their purpose; whereupon they began to think upon dissolving their forces, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the enterprise, at least for that time. But the resolution which the Queen took,
altered their counsels, and gave them the opportunity they wished for. She partly
considing in her power and numbers, and partly animated by a sort of flatterers,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50008:116"/>
who made her believe, that the Lords would flee upon the first bruit of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
resolved to march with her Army to <hi>Leth:</hi> whereas nothing had been so much
to her advantage as a little protracting of time;<note place="margin">The Queen giveth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

longer at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> the Lords without all peradventure had retired every one to
his home. But where mutations are destined, the worst counsels seem ever the
best, and are most readily embraced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Being advanced so farre as</hi> Glaidsmoore <hi>(where she caused master her forces) a
Proclamation was made,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Glaidsmore.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>bearing,</hi> That a number of Conspirators having discovered
their latent malice, borne to her and the Duke of Orkney her husband, after they had fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in apprehending their persons at <hi>Borthwick,</hi> had made a seditious Proclamation, to
make people believe that they did seek the revenge of the murther of the King her late hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and the relieving of her self out of bondage and captivity pretending that the Duke
her husband was minded to invade the Prince her sonne; all which were false, and forged
inventions, none having better cause to revenge the Kings death then her self, if she could
know the authors thereof. And for the Duke her present husband, he had used all means to
clear his innocency, the ordinary Iustice had absolved him, and the Estates of Parliament
approved their proceedings, which they themselves that made the present i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>surrection, had
likewise allowed. As also he had offered to maintain that quarrell against any Gentleman
on earth undefamed, then which nothing more could be required. And as to her alledged
captivity, the contrary was known to the whole subjects, her marriage with him being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
contracted, and solemnised with their own consents, as their hand writs could testify.
Albeit to give their treason a fair shew, they made now a buckler of the Prince her sonne
being an infant, and in their hands; whereas their intention only was to overthrow her and
her posterity, that they might rule all things at their pleasure, and without controlment.
Seeing therefore no wilfulnesse, nor particularily, but very necessity had forced her to take
Armes for defence of her life, as her hope was to have the assistance of all her faithful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
against those unnatural rebels, so she doubted not but such as were already assembled,
would with good hearts stand to her defence, considering especially the goodness of her cause,
promising them in recompence of their valorous service the lands and possessions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
which should be distributed according to the merit of every man.</p>
                  <p>This proclaimed,<note place="margin">The Lords cast themselves in the Queens way.</note> the Army did set forward, the Queen lodging that night in
<hi>Seaton</hi> a little before midnight; word was brought to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> of the Queens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
who without long suspence made to their Armour. And at Sun rising,
putting themselves in order, they marched directly to <hi>Mussilburgh,</hi> a Village two
miles distant from <hi>Preston;</hi> there they refreshed themselves with food, and a little
rest; for the Queens Camp was not as yet stirring. About the middest of the day
the horsemen who were sent to observe when the Queens Army did advance,
brought word that they were marching.<note place="margin">The order of the Lords A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the Lairds of <hi>Drumlanrig, Tulibardin, Selfourd, Grange,</hi> and divers others of good

come at in a direct course, but to their disadvantage; wherefore they inclined a little
to the right hand, both to find a more plain way, and to get the Sun in their backs,
when they should come unto the fight. This deceived the Queen, who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
they were flying towards <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> a little Village pertaining to the Earl of
<hi>Morton,</hi> but when they were past the strait of the hill, and that she saw them making

for the good of both parties; saying, that he found the Queen peaceably inclined,

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50008:116"/>
not against the Queen, but against the murtherer of the King, whom if she would deliver
to be punished, or then put him from her company, she should find nothing more desired of
them, and all other subjects, then to continue in their dutiful obedience towards her; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
no peace could be made: Neither are we come, said he, to ask pardon for any offence
that we have done, but rather to give pardon to those that have offended.</hi> The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
perceiving this to be their resolution, and judging it reasonable which
they required, but not like to be obtained, took his leave and departed to
<hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

                  <p>During the Treaty of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour,<note place="margin">Bothwel offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to try the cause in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</note> the Queens Army keeping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the trenches, that the <hi>English</hi> of old had made, <hi>Bothwel</hi> advanced himself upon a
strong and lusty horse, appealing any one of the adverse party to single combat.
<hi>Iames Murray</hi> brother to <hi>Tulibardie</hi> (he that before had offered himself to fight, but
suppressed his name,<note place="margin">It is accepted, and the Queen inhibiteth the fight.</note> as we shewed) made answer, that he would accept the challenge.
<hi>Bothwel</hi> refusing to hazard with him, as not being his equal in honour and estate,
<hi>Willam Murray</hi> his eldest brother made offer to take his place, saying, that in wealth
he was not inferiour to <hi>Bothwel,</hi> and for antiquity of his house, and honesty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
he esteemed himself more then his equal; yet he likewise was refused,
as being a Knight only, and of a lower degree. Divers Noblemen did thereupon
offer themselves; the Lord <hi>Lindesay</hi> especially shewed a great forwardnesse, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
he might be permitted to try himself with <hi>Bothwel,</hi> which he would take as a
singular honour, and esteem it as a recompence of all his service done to the State.
Here when as <hi>Bothwel</hi> could not honestly shift the combat, the Queen interposing
her authority, did prohibit him to fight. Thereafter taking a view of the Army on
horseback, and incouraging them to battel, she found <hi>Bothwels</hi> friends and followers
very desirous to fight; but in the rest there appeared no such willingness,<note place="margin">The Queens Army unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to fight.</note> some
saying that the battel would prove dangerous to the Queen, because howsoever
Gentlemen were ready to hazard themselves, the Commons who were the greatest
number, seemed not to be so disposed, nor well affected to the cause. Others more
plainly declaring their minds, said that it were much better that <hi>Bothwel</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his own quarrel by combat, then to expose the Queen and so many Gentlemen
to peril. And there were some that counselled to delay the battel to the next day,
for that the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were said to be coming, who would greatly increase her
forces.</p>
                  <p>All these things the Queen heard impatiently, and bursting forth in many tears,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bothwel</hi> fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the Queen render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth herself to the Lords.</note>
said, they were but cowards and traitors. After which, perceiving divers of the
Army to steal away, she advised <hi>Bothwel</hi> to look to his own safety, for she could
render her self to the Noblemen. Then sending for <hi>VVilliam Kircaldy</hi> of <hi>Grange,</hi>
she talked with him a good space, and when she thought <hi>Bothwel</hi> was past all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
went with him to the Lords unto whom she spake on this manner. <hi>My Lords,
I am come unto you not out of any fear I had of my life, or yet doubting of the victory if
matters had gone to the worst, but I abhorre the shedding of Christian blood, especially
of those that are my own subjects; and will therefore yield unto you, and be ruled hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by your counsels, trusting you will respect me as your born Princesse and Queen.</hi>
They receiving her with the wonted reverence, answered dutifully at first, but
when she could not be permitted to go unto the <hi>Hamilions</hi> (whom she had a desire
to see) although she gave her promise to return, and so found her liberty restrained,
she waxed angry and fell a complaining of their ingratitude. They replyed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but taking their way towards <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> led her along with them, and
kept her that night in <hi>Craigmillar</hi> his lodging, who was then Provost of the Town.
It was night before they came thither, albeit the day was then at the full length,
because of the stayes she made by the way, either looking for some relief by the
<hi>Hamiltons,</hi> as many supposed; or not liking to be gazed on by the multitude, and
seen in the estate of a prisoner. The next day towards the evening, she was
by the direction of the Noblemen sent to be kept in the house of <hi>Lochlevin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Queen sent prisoner to <hi>Lochlevin.</hi>

him, and wherein he reserved all the letters she had written unto him at any

                  </p>
                  <p>Some two days after the Queen was committed,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Glencarn</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molisheth the Altar.</note> the Earl of <hi>Glencarne</hi> taking
with him his domesticks only, went to the Chappel of <hi>Halyrudhouse,</hi> and demolished
the Altar, breaking the pictures and defacing all the ornaments within the same.
The Preachers did commend it as a work of great piety and zeal, but the other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
were not a little displeased, for that he had done it without direction, and
before they had resolved how to deal with the Queen; neither did matters frame
with them according to their expectation, divers of the Nobility, of whose assistance
they held themselves assured, lying back, and giving no concurrence: And those
that favoured the Queen (of which number were the Earls of <hi>Argile, Huntley,</hi> and
many others who were at the same time at <hi>Hamilton,</hi>) professing open enmity, and
condemning the action ás a crime of the highest treason that could be committed.
The common people also, who a little before seemed most incensed, pitying the
Queens estate, did heavily lament the calamity wherein she was fallen. In this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of things, they resolved to write unto the Lords convened at <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
and intreat their concurrence for reordering of the estate,<note place="margin">The Lords write to the Noblemen of the Queens party.</note> and establishing of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
by a common consent; But neither would they admit the messenger, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their letters so highly did they offend with their proceedings, and so confident
they were to repair things by their own power.</p>
                  <p>The Noblemen hereupon made a motion to the Assembly of the Church,<note place="margin">The Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men made a motion to the Assembly, and the Assemblies Commission to the Lords.</note>
which was then convened at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to deal with those of the other facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and perswade them to a general meeting for matters of the Church,
wherein they hoped some good might be done, and all occasions of civil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
removed. The Assembly liking well the motion, condescended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue
their meeting unto the 20. of <hi>Iuly</hi> next, and in the mean season, to
direct letters to the Earls of <hi>Argile, Huntley, Cathnes, Rothes, Crafourd,</hi> and
<hi>Menteith;</hi> The Lords <hi>Boyd, Drummond, Hervis, Catheart, Yester, Fleming,
Levingston, Seaton, Glammis, Ochiltrie, Gray, Oliphant, Methven, Innermaith</hi>
and <hi>Sommervaile,</hi> and to the Commendators of <hi>Aberbrothock, Kilwining, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermling,</hi>

party, or then behaved themselves as Newters. To procure the greater
respect to these Letters, <hi>Iohn Knox, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohn Douglas, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohn Row,</hi> and
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohn Craig,</hi> were chosen Commissioners, and had instructions given them
to this purpose.<note place="margin">Instructions given to those that were sent from the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</note> 
                     <q>That Satan by his instruments, had of long time and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
subtile ways, laboured to hinder the progresse of true Religion within this
Realm, and that now the same was in hazard to be utterly subverted, chiefly
through the poverty of the Ministers, that ought to preach the word of life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the people, some being compelled to leave their vocation, and betake
them to civil callings, others so distracted through worldly cares, as they could
not wait upon the preaching of the word so diligently as they wished; In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
whereof the Assembly of the Church being convened at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
had thought it necessary to prorogue their meeting to the 20. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and
to intreat and admonish all persons truly professing the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> within
the Realm, as well Noblemen as Barons, and those of the other estates, to
meet and give their personal appearance at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the said day, for giving
their advice, councel and concurrence in matters then to be proponed; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for purging the Realm of Popery, the establishing of the policy of the
Church, and restoring the Patrimony thereof to the just possessors. Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50008:117"/>
those that should absent themselves at the time, due and lawful advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being made, that they should be reputed hinderers of the good work intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as dissimulate professors be esteemed unworthy of the fellowship of Christs
flock: considering chiefly that God in his mercy had offered a better occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for effecting these things, then in times past, and that he had begun
to tread downe Satan under foot.</q> This they were willed to speak,
and by all faire perswasions, to move them to keep the day and place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                  <p>The missive letters were for the most part to the same effect, but in these,
besides the provision of the Ministers, I find the <hi>poor and indigent members of
Christ</hi> also mentioned, and somewhat said concerning an <hi>union to be made
amongst the professors, and such a conjunction as might make them able to withstand
the craft and violence of their enemies.</hi> But neither did the letters nor the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
given to the Commissioners prevaile with those to whom they went, all almost
excusing themselves (some by word, others by letter) and saying, <q>That in
regard of the present division caused by the Queens imprisonment; and that
the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where they were required to meet, was straitly
kept by a part of the Nobility, and some hired souldiers, they could not
come to the place appointed without trouble and danger of their lives. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
they did assure the Church of their willingnesse to every thing, that
might serve to advance the Gospel, and further the provision of the Ministers,
for the better and more diligent attendance on their callings.</q> The Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile</hi>
did answer more particularly,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> his answer.</note> and touching the policy desired, that <hi>no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
nor alterations should be made before a generall meeting of the Estates.</hi>
In like sort the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> did by his answer promise <hi>to bold hand to the forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting
of the Policy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> his answer.</note> but with an exception, <hi>so farre as it might stand with
law.</hi> Yet had both the one and other ratified the book of Policy by their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
long before, and made no scruple either of law or custome at that time.
The Noblemen that remained at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> perceiving they could not be
drawn to a meeting, resolved to prosecute their purpose at all hazards, and
joyning with the Assembly, condescended to all the Artticles proponed for the
good of the Church, and made great promises of performance; howbeit having
once attained their ends, they did forget all, and turned adversaries to the Church
in the same things whereunto they had consented. Always the Articles agreed
unto, were as followeth.</p>
                  <p>1.<note place="margin">Articles agreed in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Church.</note> That the Acts made in the Parliament holden at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the twenty
fourth of <hi>August,</hi> 1560. touching Religion and the abolishing of the Popes
authority, should be extracted forth of the Registers, and have the force of a
publick law; and that the said Parliament in so farre as concerning Religion,
should be maintained and defended by them, as a Parliament lawful, and holden
by sufficient commission from the Queen, then being in <hi>France,</hi> and be ratified in
the first Parliament, which should happen to be kept within the Realm.</p>
                  <p>2. That untill perfect order might be taken for restoring the Patrimony of
the Church, the Act of assignation of the thirds of Benefices for the sustentation
of the Ministery, should be put in due execution.</p>
                  <p>3. That an Act of Councell made with consent of her Majesty touching the
conferring of small Benefices within the value of 300. marks to Ministers, should be
put in practice; as likewise the Act for annualls, obits, and aulterages, especially
within Burghes.</p>
                  <p>4. That in the first lawfull Parliament which should be kept, or sooner if occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might serve, the Church of Christ within this Kingdome should be fully resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto the Patrimony belonging to the same, and nothing be past in Parliament
before that and other matters of the Church were first considered and approved;
In the mean while the Noblemen, Barons and other Professors then present, did
willingly offer, and consent to reform themselves in the matter of the Church
patrimony according to the Book of God, and to put the same in practice
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50008:118"/>
for their own parts, ordaining the refusers and contraveners of the same to
be secluded from all benefits of the Church. It was further agreed, That in
the next Parliament, or otherwise at the first occasion order should be taken
for the ease of the labourers of the ground, in the payment of their Tithes,
and that the same should not be disponed to any others without their advice and
consent.</p>
                  <p>5. That none should be permitted to beare charge in Schooles, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and Universities, nor allowed publickly or privately to instruct the
youth, except such as should first be tried by the Superintendents, and Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
of the Church, who being found meet should be admitted by them to
their charges.</p>
                  <p>6. That all crimes and offences committed against the Law of God should be
severely punished, according to the Word of God, and Judges deputed for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof; or if there be no lawes as yet made, nor Judges appointed for the
punishment of such crimes, that the same should be done in the first Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>7. That seeing the horrible murther of the King her Majesties husband is a
crime most odious before God, and tending to the perpetuall shame and infamy of
the whole Realm, if the same should not be exemplary punished; the Noblemen,
Barons and other Professors should imploy their whole forces, strength and power
for the just punishment of all, and whatsoever persons that should be tried and
found guilty of the same.</p>
                  <p>8. Sith it hath pleased God to give a native Prince unto the Countrey, who in
all appearance shall become their King and Soveraign, lest he should be murthered
and wickedly taken away as his father was; the Nobility, Barons, and others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
subscriving should assist, maintain and defend the Prince against all that should
attempt to do him injury.</p>
                  <p>9. That all Kings and Princes, that in any time hereafter shall happen to reign
and have the rule of the Realm, should in their first entry, and before they be either
crowned or inaugurated, give their oath, and faithfully promise unto the true
Church of God, for maintaining and defending by all means the true Religion of
Christ, presently professed within the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>10. That the Prince should be committed to the education of some wise, godly
and grave man, to be trained up in vertue and the fear of God, that when he cometh
to years, he may discharge himself sufficiently of that place and honour whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he is called.</p>
                  <p>11. That the Nobility, Barons and others underscribing, should faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to convene themselves in armes for the rooting out of idolatry, especially the
blasphemous Mass, without exception of place or person. And likewise should
remove all idolaters, and others not admitted to the preaching of the Word, from
the bearing of any function in the Church, which may be a hinderance to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
in any sort; and in their places appoint Superintendents, Ministers, and
other needfull members of the Church. And further, should faithfully binde
themselves to reform all Schooles, Colledges and Universities throughout the
Realme; by removing all such as be of contrary profession, and beare any
charge therein, and planting faithfull teachers in their rooms, lest the youth should
be corrupted with poysonable doctrine in their lesser years, which afterwards would
not easily be removed.</p>
                  <p>These were the Articles agreed unto by a common consent,<note place="margin">The Articles subscribed.</note> ard sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the presence of the Assembly, by the Earls of <hi>Morton, Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne,</hi>

Innermaith,</hi> and <hi>Ochiltrie,</hi> and many Barons, besides the Commissioners of

                  <p>Upon the dissolving of this Assembly,<note place="margin">The Queen moved to make resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Crown.</note> the Lords <hi>Ruthven</hi> and <hi>Lindesay</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to <hi>Lochlevin</hi> to deal with the Queen for resignation of the Government in
favours of the Prince her son, and the appointing of some to be Regent who should
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50008:118"/>
have the administration of affairs during his minority. At first she took the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
grievously; answering in passion, that she could <hi>sooner renounce her life,
then her Crown:</hi> yet after some rude speeches used by the Lord <hi>Lindesay,</hi> she was
induced to put her hand to the renunciation they presented, by the perswasion
chiefly of <hi>Robert Melvil,</hi> who was sent from the Earl of <hi>Atholl</hi> and <hi>Lethington,</hi> to
advise her as she loved her life not to refuse any thing they did require. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
brought a letter from Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> the Ambassadour of <hi>England,</hi>
(who was come a few dayes before to visit her, but was denied access) to the
same effect, declaring that <hi>no resignation made in the time of her captivity, would be
of force, and in Law was null, because done out of a just fear;</hi> which having
considered with her self a while, without reading any one of the Writs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
she set her hand to the same, the tears running down in abundance
from her eyes. One of the Writs contained a renunciation of the Crown
and Royall dignity, with a Commission to invest the Prince into the Kingdome,
by the solemnities accustomed. And to that purpose a procuration was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Lords <hi>Ruthven</hi> and <hi>Lindesay</hi> for dimitting and resigning in presence
of the three Estates the Rule and Government: And to the Earls of <hi>Morton,
Atholl, Marre, Glencarne</hi> and <hi>Menteith,</hi> and to the Lords <hi>Grahame</hi> and <hi>Home,</hi> with
the Bishop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> and the Provosts of <hi>Dundie</hi> and <hi>Montross,</hi> for inaugurating
the Prince her son. The other Writ did appoint the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> Regent du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Prince his Minoritie, if at his return he should accept of the Charge. And
in case of his refuse, the Duke of <hi>Chattellerault,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Lenox, Argile,
Atholl, Morton, Glencarne,</hi> and <hi>Marre,</hi> who should joyntly govern, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrate
the publick affairs.</p>
                  <p>Both the renunciation,<note place="margin">The King crowned at <hi>Striveling.</hi>
                     </note> and Commission for government of the Realm, were
the next day published at the Market Cross of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the third day after
the Publication (which was the 29. of <hi>Iuly</hi>) was the Prince crowned, and anointed
King in the Church of <hi>Striveling</hi> by the Bishop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> assisted by two of the
Superintendents. The Sermon was made by <hi>Iohn Knox;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> and
the Lord <hi>Home</hi> took the Oath for the King, that he should maintain the Religion
received, and minister justice equally to all the subjects. The <hi>English</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
though he was in town, refused his presence to that solemnity, lest he should
seem to approve the abdication of the Queens Government. Now how soon
the news came to <hi>France</hi> (and they came in great haste) the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to return, whereof the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> getting intelligence (who
lay there Ambassadour for the Queen) he laboured earnestly to have him
detained, informing that he was the head of the faction raised against the Queen,
and that he was called home to be their leader.<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from <hi>France.</hi>
                     </note> But he had taken his leave
some houres before of the Court, and used such diligence, as they who
were sent to stay him, found that he was loosed from <hi>Diepe</hi> before their
coming.</p>
                  <p>Returning by <hi>England,</hi> he came the 11. of <hi>August</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he was
received with a wonderfull joy. Great instance was used to have him accept the
Regency; at which they said no man would grudge, he being named by the
Queen, and having given all good men experiments of his worth. Some few
dayes he desired to advise,<note place="margin">He visiteth the Queen at <hi>Lochlevin.</hi>
                     </note> in which time he visited the Queen at <hi>Lochlevin,</hi> and
sent Letters to the Noblemen; of the other faction, especially to the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile,</hi>
with whom he had kept an intire friendship of a long time, shewing in what
sort he was pressed by the Lords that maintained the Kings authority, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him by the bonds of kindred, the familiarity they had long kept, and by the
love he bare to his native Countrey, to appoint a place where he might confer with
him, and have his counsell in that business.</p>
                  <p>To the rest he wrote according to the acquaintance he had with them, and
as their place and dignity required. Of them all in common he desired that
they would be pleased to designe a place of meeting, where they might
by common advice provide for the safety of the Kingdome, which in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50008:119"/>
that troubled time could not long subsist, without some one to rule and
govern.</p>
                  <p>But finding them all to decline the meeting, and being importuned on the other
side by those of the Kings faction to undertake the charge, he resolved to accept
the same, and in a convention of Noblemen, and others of the Estates kept at

resolved to go unto the Regent, and taking with him the Lord <hi>Boyde,</hi> and

election of the Regent was not made upon any contempt, or misregard of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
who were absent, but upon necessity to keep the Realm in order, it was
agreed that a Parliament should be called for setling all affairs by advice and

consent of the Estates,<note place="margin">An. 1566.</note> and that the same should be kept at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 15. day

               <p>When the Diet appointed for Parliament came,<note place="margin">The first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of King <hi>Iames</hi> the 6.</note> it was kept with such a frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as the like was not remembred to have been seen a long time. The honours
accustomed of Crown, Scepter, and Sword, were carried by the Earls of <hi>Angus,
Huntley</hi> and <hi>Argile,</hi> and every thing done with the greatest shew of solemnity that
could be used. Beginning was made at the affairs of the Church, and divers Acts
concluded in their favours:<note place="margin">The Acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> as an Act abolishing the Pope his jurisdiction and usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

times for maintenance of idolatry, and superstition, with the ratifying of the
confession of faith, and some others, which may be seen in the first Parliament of
King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth. The matter of policie, and jurisdiction of the Church was
referred to the consideration of certain Lords delegated by the Estates; but for the
restitution of the patrimony, which was promised to be the first work of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though the Regent did what he could to have the Church possessed with the

was derived from her, and was revocable at her pleasure, so as she could not
be arraigned or brought to trial before any inferiour Judge; and when it was reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

<hi>Tallow,</hi> and two Chamberboyes of <hi>Bothwels</hi> powrie and <hi>Dalgleish</hi> were brought to
trial for the Kings murther, and found guilty by their own confessions. The
summe whereof was, that they were enticed unto that wicked fact by <hi>Bothwel,</hi> who
did assure them that most of the Noblemen within the Realm had consented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and that a contract was shewed them subscribed by the Earls of <hi>Argile, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
young <hi>Lethington</hi> and others; but whether these subscriptions were the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
own or counterfeit, they could not tell. They further said that <hi>Bothwel</hi> made
them believe that the Lords who had subscrived, would each of them have one or
two of their servants present at the murther, yet were they but eight persons in all,
besides <hi>Bothwel</hi> himself, that came unto the place: Namely, Sir <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> the
Laird of <hi>Ormeston</hi> in <hi>Teviotdale, Robert Ormeston</hi> his Cousen, one <hi>Wilson</hi>
a man of <hi>Hadington,</hi> and the four who were then to suffer. The sentence upon their
conviction was, that they should be hanged, their heads cut off, their bodies quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,

               <p>At the opening of the spring,<note place="margin">An. 1568.</note> the Regent purposing to hold justice Courts through

                  </note> and Highlands adjoyning: whilest he remained at <hi>Glasgow,</hi>
(for the first Court was there affixed) the Queen made an escape from <hi>Lochlevin,</hi> to
the great contentment of many who stood in fear of the Regents severity or, as (the
vulgar called it) cruelty. And even some that were the principal workers of her impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50008:120"/>
having changed their minds, did earnestly wish her liberty. <hi>Lethington</hi> who
hating <hi>Bothwel</hi> to the death, was enemy to the Queen for his respect, as soon as he
understood of his arresting in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and saw that he was no more to be feared,
desired greatly to have her restored, as thinking his credit and safety should that way
be most assured. Sir <hi>Iames Balfour</hi> followed alwayes his course; <hi>William Murray</hi> of
<hi>Tulibardin,</hi> though he had shewed great forwardnesse at the hill of <hi>Carberry,</hi>
where the Queen was taken, yet being Popishly set, upon some private dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
forsook the Regent, and carried with him divers of his friendship.
The <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were known to desire nothing more then her freedom. The Earls
of <hi>Argile</hi> and <hi>Huntley,</hi> howbeit they had been present at the late Parliament, and
given their assistance for establishing the Kings authority, turned their Coats, and
joyned with the rest for repossessing the Queen; and besides these many others,
some led with hopes of advancement, and some trusting to have their distressed
estates bettered by a change, longed much to have her relieved, which by this
means came to passe.</p>

remained with her in the Castle of <hi>Lochlevin,</hi> allured by her courtesies, and fair
promises, having corrupted the Keepers, although he himselfe upon suspicion,
was some days before sent forth of the Isle, got her transported, (whilest the rest
were at dinner) in a little vessel to the side of the lake, where he with the Lord
<hi>Seaton</hi> and some horsemen were attending. The first night she lodged at <hi>Nudrie</hi>
in West <hi>Lothian,</hi> and the next day was conveighed to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> whither repaired
unto her the Earls of <hi>Argile, Cassils, Eglington,</hi> and <hi>Rothes,</hi> the Lords <hi>Sommervil,
Yester, Borthwick, Levingston, Hereis, Maxwell, Sanqhuar,</hi> and <hi>Ross,</hi> with many
other Barons, and Gentlemen. The Lords meeting in Councel, the Queen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that the resignation she had made of the Crown, was extorted by fear; as
likewise the Commission granted for inaugurating the Prince her son, qualifying
the same by the testimony of <hi>Robert Melvile</hi> there present,<note place="margin">The Queens resignation decerned null.</note> and others. Thereupon
was the resignation decerned void and null, and Proclamations made in her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
name, commanding all the Lieges to meet in Armes at <hi>Hamilton</hi> for pursuing
the rebels, that had usurped the Royal authority.</p>
               <p>The news hereof brought unto <hi>Glasgow</hi> (which is only eight miles distant) where
the Regent then abode,<note place="margin">The Regent advertised of the Queens escape.</note> were scarce at first believed, but within two houres or less,
being assured, a strong alteration might have been observed in the mindes of most
that were there attending. The report of the Queens forces made divers to slide
away; others sent quietly to beg pardon for what they had done, resolving not to
enter in the cause any further, but to govern themselves as the event should lead
and direct them. And there were that made open defection, not a few, nor of the
meaner sort.<note place="margin">The Lord Boyd falleth to the Queen.</note> Amongst whom the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> was especially noted, and in the
mouthes of all men; for that being very inward with the Regent, and admitted to
his most secret counsels, when he saw matters like to turn, he withdrew himself
and went to the Queen.</p>
               <p>Yet the Regent nothing discouraged,<note place="margin">The Regent resolveth to stay at <hi>Glasgow</hi> and assemble forces.</note> and esteeming his life could not be more
honourably bestowed then in the defence of the King, albeit many did advise him
to retire unto <hi>Striveling,</hi> would not condescend to stirre, saying, <hi>That his retreat would
be interpreted a flight, and the adversaries thereby animated, and his friends disheartened.</hi>
In the mean season he sent advertisement to his friends in <hi>Mers, Lothian,</hi> and
<hi>Strivelingshire.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Glencarn</hi> and Lord <hi>Semple</hi> with the men of <hi>Lenox,</hi>
and others well affected to the cause, that lay near to the City, made haste unto his
succourse, so as in a day or two, his company increased to 4000. and above. There
was with the Queen a <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour, who had arrived a few days before, and
moved the Regent for accesse to the Queen before the escape she made; he was still
posting between <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Glasgow,</hi> rather to espie and observe things, then to
make the peace he pretended; for when he saw the Regents forces to be few, as
at first they were, and that the Queens power was much greater, he did perswade
her to take the fields, and put it to the trial of a day: which she resolved to do.
Thereupon warning given to make ready against the next morning, the Earl of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50008:121"/>
                  <hi>Argile</hi> was proclaimed Lieutenant, and conclusion taken to march with the Army
by <hi>Glasgow,</hi> towards the Castle of <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> where they pruposed to place the
Queen, and either to give battel, or draw the warre at length as they pleased: or
if the Regent (which they did not expect) should meet them in the way, to
fight him, accounting the victory certain, because of their numbers.</p>
               <p>The Regent advertised of the Queens intentions,<note place="margin">The battel of <hi>Landside, 13, May,</hi> 1568.</note> took the fields the next day
early, and stood with his companies some houres in battel, array, upon the Moore of
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> where it was believed the Queens Army should passe, but when he saw them
keep the other side of the River, he directed the horsemen to passe the Foords, the
water being then ebbed, and leading the foot along the bridge, went towards
<hi>Landside,</hi> which lay in the way to <hi>Dumbarton.</hi> This is a little Village upon the
water of <hi>Carthe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The order of the Regents Army.</note> situated at the foot of a hill towards the West; on the East and
North the ascent unto it is somewhat steep, the other parts of the hill are more
even and plain; both Armies contending who should first possesse it, that of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
prevented the other by occasion of <hi>Argiles</hi> sicknesse, who was on the suddain
taken with a fit of the Epilepsie, and so retarded the march of the Queens Army.
When they approached near and saw themselves prevented, they went to a little
opposite hill, and there ranged themselves in two battels, placing in the first their
whole strength almost; for if they should at the first encounter repulse their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the rest they made account would soon disband and take the chace. The
Regent had likewise put his troops in two battels; on the right hand were placed
the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> the Lords <hi>Home, Semple,</hi> and <hi>Lindesay,</hi> with their clients
and vassals; on the left, the Earls of <hi>Marre, Glencarn,</hi> and <hi>Menteith,</hi> with the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>Glasgow:</hi> the Harquebusiers were planted in the Village beneath, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the hedges upon the high-way. Before the joyning both sides played with their
Ordinance upon others, but the advantage was on the Regents part, the Queens
Canoniers being forced to quit their munition. His Cavalrie on the other side
being much inferiour to the Queens, was compelled to give ground: but when
they entered upon the foot, thinking to put them in disorder, the Archers from the
Regents side rained such a shower of arrowes upon them, as they could not hold
up their faces, and were forced to turn back. The left wing of the Queens Army
advancing it self in the mean while, howbeit greatly annoyed by the Harquebusiers,
that beat them in the strait on both sides, got into the plain and displayed it self.
Then did the Armies joyn and enter into a hot fight, striving in thick ranks to
maintain their places, and by force of spears to break and bear down one another;
for the space of half an hour and more, the fight continued doubtful, and so eagerly
they strove, that they whose spears were broke, stood throwing their poynards,
stones, and what came readiest to their hands, in the faces of their adversaries.
The Regents second battel perceiving that none came against them, and fearing
the other should be overlaid, (for they saw some in the last ranks recoiling) went
unto their aid, whereupon the Queens Army gave back, and so were put to rout.
The Regent and those on his side shewed great manhood, all their hopes consisting
in the victory: nor were his enemies any lesse couragious, but the advantage of the
ground were to those of his part no small help. There were not many slain on the
place, most of the slaughter being made in the chace, and unlesse the Regent had
with his presence wheresoever he came, and by sending horse into all parts, stayed
the fury of those that pursued, the victory had been much more bloody. The
Queen who stood a mile off from the battel on a litle height, perceiving the field lost,
made towards the borders.<note place="margin">The number of the slain.</note> The rest that escaped, fled the readiest way they could
find, every man to his own home. The number of the slain was about 300. many
were taken prisoners,<note place="margin">The ptisoners that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> amongst whom the most eminent the Lords of <hi>Seaton,</hi> and
<hi>Ross,</hi> the Masters of <hi>Cassils</hi> and <hi>Eglington,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton of Avendale,</hi> and the
Sheriffes of <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Linlithgow.</hi> Of the Regents side one only was slain, the
Lords <hi>Home</hi> and <hi>Ochiltrie</hi> wounded. All the rest, a few excepted that followed the
chace too farre, returned with him to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where they went first to Church,
and gave thanks to God for the victory they had obtained, almost without any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of blood. This conflict happened upon the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, of <hi>May.</hi> the eleventh day
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50008:121"/>
after her escape from <hi>Lochlevin.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour who had conceived an
assured hope of her prevailing, perceiving things fall out otherwise, took horse,
and made away to <hi>England,</hi> not once saluting the Regent, to whom, as he pretended,
he was sent. By the way he fell in the hands of some robbers, that rifled all his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
which the Laird of <hi>Drumlanrig,</hi> for the respects he carried to the title of an
Ambassadour, caused to be restored.</p>
               <p>The rest of that day the Regent bestowed in taking order with the prisoners:<note place="margin">The Castles of <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Darffan</hi> rendered to the Regent.</note>
some he freely dimitted, others upon surety, but the Principals were detained (they
especially of the Surname of <hi>Hamilton</hi>) and committed to several prisons. The
next day taking with him 500. horse, he rode unto <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and had the Castle
thereof, with the house of <hi>Draffan</hi> another strong hold, belonging to the Duke,
rendered in his hands. Such a terrour this defeat wrought, that the whole inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Cluid</hi> did relinquish and forsake their houses: upon the like fear, did the
Queen against the counsel of her best friends take Sea at <hi>Kirkcadbright,</hi> and sail
into <hi>England,</hi> landing at <hi>Wirkinton</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> near to the mouth of the river
<hi>Derwent,</hi> from which place she sent a letter to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queen flieth to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and writes to Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>
                  </note> declaring that she
was come into her Kingdome, upon hope of aid and assistance from her, request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
she might be conducted to her with all speed because of her present distresse.
<hi>Iohn Beaton</hi> one of her domesticks, was some days before sent with the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
she had received from the Queen of <hi>England</hi> for a token of kindnesse, to
signify her purpose of coming into <hi>England,</hi> if she should be further pursued by her
subjects: who did shortly return with large promises of love, and kindnesse, if she
should happen to come; But as soon as her coming was known, the directions sent
by Sir <hi>Francis Knowles,</hi> were not so loving; for by him she was desired to go unto
<hi>Carlile</hi> as a place of more safety, whither the Lieutenant of the countrey should
conduct her, and stay there till the Queen was informed of the equity of her
cause.</p>
               <p>This direction did much displease her, and then began she to see her errour,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to see her error.</note> but
seeming to take all in good part, she sent the Lord <hi>Hereis</hi> 
                  <q>to intreat the Queen
for an hearing in her own presence, where she might both clear her self, and shew
how injuriously she had been dealt with by those, whom at her intercession she
had recalled from exile; or if that could not be obtained, to crave that she might
be permitted to depart forth of <hi>England</hi> and not detained as a prisoner, seeing
she came willingly thither,</q> in confidence of her kindnesse often promised, and
confirmed as well by letters as messages. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> moved with these
speeches, said, <q>that she would send to the Regent, and desire him to stay all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
against the subjects that stood in her defence, till matters were brought
to an hearing.</q>
                  <note place="margin">A Parliament called by the Regent.</note> For the Regent at the same time had called a Parliament to the
25. of <hi>Iune,</hi> for proceeding against those that had accompanied the Queen in the
fields by course of law. They of the Queens faction were in the mean time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to hinder the meeting, and when as the Diet drew near, the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi>
with his forces met Lord <hi>Claude Hamilton</hi> at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> brought

being all guarded by the Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> and such in those quarters as maintained
the Kings authority. So being forced to return home, the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> and
other Lords not seeing how they could hinder the meeting of the Parliament, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
their companies, and returned to their own countrey.</p>
               <p>At this time came the letters promised by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>England</hi> desires the Parliament to be delayed. The R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the Regent considering that the delay of the Parliament would be constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to proceed of fear, resolved to keep the Diet. At the meeting it was long
disputed, <hi>whether all they that had taken Armes against the King, and not sued for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
should be forfeited, or if sentence should be given against a few only to terrify the
rest, and hope of favour left unto others upon their obedience?</hi> Secretary <hi>Lethington</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:50008:122"/>
who did secretly favour the other faction, maintained the calmest course to be the
best, and by the perswasions he used, wrought so as the processe against the better
sort was continued, and some of meaner note only proscribed; which was interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
even as the Regent conceived, to proceed of fear, and not of a mind to reclaim
them. The Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> only of all the Noblemen of that side reconciled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
accepting three years exile for his punishment. Some others of meaner sort
the Regent received into favour, and such as stood out he pursued by force of
Armes, making an expedition into the countries of <hi>Nidisdale, Annandale,</hi> and the
lower parts of <hi>Galloway,</hi> where he put Garisons in the Castles and strong Forts that
were judged necessary to be kept others he demolished &amp; threw to the ground; and
had in a short space (as it was thought) reduced the whole countrey to his obedience,
if he had not been stayed by other letters by the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> for the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he should have gone on in that manner,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>England</hi> writeth to the Regent.</note> whereas she had willed him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
all things till she was informed of the whole cause, sent by one of her servants

                     <hi>she would not endure the
sacred authority of Kings to be in that sort abused at the appetite of factious subjects, and
howsoever they had forgot their duties to their Soveraign, she would not neglect her
sister and neighbour Queen.</hi>
                  </q> Therefore willed him to direct certain Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to enform her how matters had passed, men that could answer the complaints
made by the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> against him and his complices, which if he failed
to do, she would restore her to her Kingdome with all the power she could
make.</p>
               <p>The Regent took it grievously, that matters determined in Parliament, should
be brought again in question, and to plead before forain Judges he held it disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable;
yet considering the adversaries he had (the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> abroad
who swayed all things in the <hi>French</hi> Court, and at home many of the Nobility)
and that if he did offend the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> his difficulties should be every way

could not agree upon the persons (the principal Noblemen refusing the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)

not be troubled with unnecessary businesse, it was ordained, <hi>That no matters should

Regent and Councel, wherein amongst other particulars it was desired, <hi>That the
persons nominated in Parliament for the matter of policy, or juridiction of the Church,
should be ordained to meet at a certain day, and place for concluding the same.</hi> This was
promised and the eighth of <hi>August</hi> appointed to that effect; but the Diet did not hold,
and so these matters continued unresolved as before. In the end of the Assembly
the Bishop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> who had been deposed from all function in the Church for

had usurped the Royal authority, and possessed himself with the whole

had pleased God to relieve her out of that prison, (wherein she was so straitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

agree and make a pacification with the said Regent, and his partakers; but they
were so farre from admitting any peaceable Treaty, as they did invade her, in

Therefore willed him and his associates to consider what hurt and danger they should draw
upon themselves, by accusing her in such a publick form, not onely with those of her own
Nation, that loved the Queen, but also with other Christian Princes, especially with her
cousins in</hi> France; <hi>and what could they answer unto the King, when he being of ripe years
should esteem that manner of doing dishonorable to himself, his mother and whole Kingdom?</hi>

                  </note> and presented their answer, conceived in the
terms following. <q>The King <hi>Henry</hi> father to their soveraign Lord the King
now reigning being horribly murthered in his bed, <hi>Iames</hi> sometimes Earl of
<hi>Bothwell,</hi> who was known to be the chief Author thereof entered in such credit
with the Queen, then their Soveraign, as within two moneths after the murther
committed, he openly attempted a rape of her person and carried her to <hi>Dumbar</hi>
Castle, where he did keep her as captive a certain space, causing a divorce to be
led betwixt him and his lawfull wife, and upon the conclusion thereof did sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
accomplish a pretended marriage with the Queea: which insolent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
together with the shamefull report that passed in all Nations of the
Kings murther, as if the whole Nobility had been alike culpable thereof, so
moved the hearts of a good number of them, as they thought nothing could be
performed more honourable to themselves in the sight of all the world, then by
punishing the said Earl who had committed the murther, to free themselves of the
vile reports spread every where; to set the Queen at liberty from the bondage of
that traitour, who had so presumptuously interprised the rape and marriage of her,
whose lawfull husband he could not be; and to preserve the innocent person of
the King, from the hands of him that had murthered his father. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they taking arms, when the said Earl came against them with forces, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his company the Queen to defend his wickednesse; they offered for spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the blood of innocent men, to decide the quarrell in a single combate,
whereof himself by Cartell, and Proclamation and sundry times made offer.
But after many shifts he in end directly refused the same, and the Queen prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his impunity to her own honour, that he might have leasure to escape, came
willingly to the Noblemen that were in Arms, and conferred with them a certain
space, after which they conveyed her to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> informing her of the true
causes, that moved them to that form of dealing, did humbly intreat her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to suffer the said Earl and others, the King her husbands murtherers, to be
punished according to the laws; and the ptetended marriage, wherein she was
rashly entered to be dissolved, as well for her own honour, as for the safety of her
son, and quietnesse of the Realm and Subjects. But having received no other
answer but rigerous threats against the Noblemen, and she avouching to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
upon all those that had shown themselves in that cause; they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by necessity to sequestrate her person for a season from the company of <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
and the keeping of any intelligence with him, untill punishment might be
taken of him as murtherer of the King her husband. In the mean time, she finding
her self wearied with the troubles of government, and perceiving by things that
had passed before that time betwixt her and the people, that neither could she
well allow of their doings, nor they like of her forms, upon these and other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
she voluntarily resigned her Kingdome, and transferred the same unto her
son, appointing the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> (who was at that time absent forth of the
Realme) to be Regent during her sonnes minority; and in case of the said
Earles decease, or not acceptance of the said Office, divers other Noblemen,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50008:124"/>
whose names are expressed in the Commissions signed by her self, and sealed
with the seals of the Kingdom. The King hereupon, being duely, rightly and
orderly crowned and anointed, and the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> after his return lawfully
placed and admitted Regent, all those things were ratified and confirmed by the
three Estates of Parliament, most of these that had withdrawn themselves from
his authority being present and giving their consent to the same: Notthelesfe,
when as matters were thus established, and the Kings authority univer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ally obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without contradiction, certain persons envying the publick quietnesse, had by
their subtile practices first brought the Queen out of <hi>Lochlevin,</hi> and afterwards
by open force against their promised fidelity gone about to subvert the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
received, wherein as they were proceeding, it pleased God to disappoint
their interprise, and give unto the King and those who stood for his authority, a
notable victory unpon the 13. day of <hi>May</hi> last. Wherefore their desire was, that the
King and the Regent might peaceably rule and govern the subjects according to
the authority they had received of God, and that the same might be conserved and
established against the factions of turbulent subjects.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Commissioners of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> having seen this answer made a long
and particular reply to all the points thereof, wherein adhering to their former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,<note place="margin">The Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> reply.</note>
first they said, <q>That the pretext of taking arms against the Queen,
because <hi>Bothwell</hi> (the authour of her husbands murther) was in such favour with
her, could not warrant their rebellion, fith it never was made known to the
Queen that he was the murtherer. But to the contrary, <hi>Bothwell</hi> being indited,
and orderly summoned to underly the triall of Law, he was by the judgement of
his Peers absolved, and the same absolution ratified by the authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the principalls that now accuse him and had withdrawn themselves
from her Majesties obedience, were present, and not onely consented to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
but solicited the Queen to take him to her husband, as the man most
worthy to bear rule of any other in all the Realm, giving their bonds to defend
him against all that should pursue him for the said crime, as their subscriptions
would testifie. And so neither before the marriage with <hi>Bothwell,</hi> nor after did
they or any of them (which had been the dutie of true subjects) so much as in
words utter their dislike of it, or advertise her Majesty of the suspicions that were
taken of him, untill they had drawn the keeper of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and
the Provost of the town to their faction. Then secretly putting themselves
in arms, they suddenly under silence of night invironed the Castle of <hi>Borthwick</hi>
where her Majesty remained, and after she had escaped to <hi>Dumbar,</hi> levied an
army under pretence to defend the Queen, wherewith invading her person
in the way berwixt <hi>Dumbar</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they did take her Majesty ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And where they alledge that her Majesty preferring the impunity of <hi>Bothwell</hi> to
her own honour, made him to be conveighed safely away, <q>The same was most
untrue, for they themselves sent the Laird of <hi>Grange</hi> to her Majesty, desiring her
to cause <hi>Bothwell</hi> passe out of the fields, as suspected of the Kings murther, till the
same might be tried, and that she would go with them and follow the counsell
of the Nobility, which if she would do, they would honour, serve and obey her
as their Princess and Soveraign: whereunto her Majesty for the love she bare
unto her subjects, and to avoid the effusion of Christian blood, did willingly
assent. In verification whereof, the said Laird of <hi>Grange</hi> took the Earl of <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
at the same time by the hand, and willed him to depart, giving his word
that no man should pursue him. So as nothing is more clear, then that he passed
away by their own consents; for if they had been minded against him only, would
they not have pursued him so long as he was in the Countrey, for he remained
a great space after that in his own house, and might more easily have been taken
there, then upon the Seas, where they in a coloured manner did pursue him?
Hereby, <hi>said they,</hi> may all men of found judgement perceive that they cared not
what became of him, if so they might advance their own ambitious purposes
and designes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:50008:124"/>
                  <q>Thirdly, where she is charged to have used them with threats and menacings,
that, <hi>they said,</hi> was not to be thought strange, considering their undutiful beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and the rude and vile usage her Majesty suffered by them. For when the
Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> at her highnesse first coming to them, had reverently, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
him, said, Madame, here is the place where your grace should be, and we
will honour and serve you as truly, as ever the Nobility of the Realm did any of
your progenitors in former times, ratifying thereby the promise made by the
Laird <hi>Grange</hi> in their names to her Majesty, and that she trusting their speeches
had gone with him to <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> they first lodging her in a simple Burgesse house,
and contrary to their promises did most rudely intreat her: whereupon she sent
<hi>Lethington</hi> her Secretary, and made offer unto them that for any thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they or any of the subjects were offended, she was content the same should be
reformed by the Nobility, and the Estates of the Realm, her Highnesse being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and permitted to answer for her self: yet would they not hearken once to the
motion, but in the night secretly and against her will carried her to <hi>Lochivin,</hi> and
put her in prison.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to that they say, that she wearied with the molestations of government did
make a voluntary resignation of the Kingdom in favours of the Prince her sonne,
appointing the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> his Regent during his minority, <q>The falshood
thereof did, <hi>as they said,</hi> many ways appear. For first, her Majesty is neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
by age, nor weakned by sicknesse, but (praised be God) both in mind and
body able to discharge the most weighty affairs. As also the truth is, that the
Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> the Lairds of <hi>Tullibardin</hi> and <hi>Lethington</hi> (who were of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel)
sent <hi>Robert Melvil</hi> with a ring and some other tokens to her Majesty, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
her to subscrive the letters of resignation, and what else should be presented
unto her to save her own life, and avoid the death which was assuredly prepared
for her, if she should happen to refuse the same, and at the same time the said
Gentleman did bring unto her Majesty a letter written by Sir <hi>Nicholas Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi>
Ambassadour of <hi>England,</hi> requesting her Highnesse to set her hand to
whatsoever they should desire of her. To whom her Majesty answered, that she
would follow his counsel, praying him to declare to her dearest sister the Queen
of <hi>England,</hi> how she was used by her subjects, and that the resignation of the
Crown made by her was extorted by fear, which her Highnesse doubted not, but
the said <hi>Nicholas</hi> performed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Further it is notorious, that the Lord <hi>Lindesay</hi> at the presenting of the letters of
resignation unto her Majesty, did menace to put her in close prison, if she refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to put her hand to the same, adding, that in that case, worse would shortly
follow; and that her Highnesse never looked what was in the writings presented,
but signed the same with many tears, protesting that if ever she should recover
her liberty, she would disavow that, which he compelled her at that time to do.
And to testify that the said resignation was made against her will, the Laird of
<hi>Lochlevin</hi> who was then her Keeper, refused to subscrive it as witnesse, and did
obtain a Testificat under her Majesties own hand, declaring that he refused to be
present at the said resignation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither can that renuciation be sustained by any reason, considering that no
portion of Revenue was reserved for her to live upon, neither was her liberty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or any security given her of her life. All which weighed in the ballance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
will to men of indifferent judgement make manifest that the alledged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
so unlawfully procured, can never prejudge her Majesty in her Royal
estate: especially considering that at her first escape out of prison she did revoke
the same, and in the presence of a great part of the Nobility at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
oath declared, that what she had done was by compulsion, and upon just
cause of her life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the Coronation of her Highnesse son, they said, <q>that the same was most
unorderly done, because there being in the Realm above an hundred Earls, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Lords having voice in Parliament, (of whom the greatest part at least
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50008:125"/>
ought to have consented thereto, it being an Action of such consequence) four
Earls and six Lords (the same that were present at her apprehension) with one
Bishop, and two or three Abbots and Priors, were only assisting; and of the same
number, some did put in a protestation, that nothing then done should prejudge
the Queen or her successor, by reason she was at that time a captive. Nor can any
man think that if the dimission had been willingly made her Highnesse, she
would ever have nominated the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> Regent, there being many others
more lawful, and that have better right thereto then he; of whom some have
been governours of the Realm in former times, and during her Majesties minority
had worthily exerced that place.</q>

               <p>It is to as little purpose that they object of the Parliament, and the ratification
made therein; <q>Seeing the principalls of the Nobility disassented, and put
in their protestations both to the Lords of the Articles, and in the open Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against their proceedings, affirming that they would never agree to any
thing that might hurt the Queens Majesties person, her Crown and Royall estate
further then her Highnesse self being at liberty would freely approve. Lastly,
where they would have it seen that the authority established by them was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
obeyed in the Realm, and all things well and justly administred; both these
are alike untrue: for a great part of the Nobility have never acknowledged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
authority then that of the Queen, keeping and holding their Courts in her
Majesties name. And for the administration of affairs, it is apparent that
wickedness did never reign more, and with lesse controlment in the Realm, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
bloodshed, with theft and robbery every where abounding; policy destroyed,
Churches thrown down, honourable families ruinated, and true men bereft of
their goods, for satisfying the souldiers hired by them, to maintain the Regents u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
government, the like whereof hath not been seen, nor heard for many ages
before. In regard whereof, they in behalf of the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
did earnestly request the support and assistance of the Queen of <hi>England</hi>
her cousin, for restoring her to her Crown, and suppressing the rebels that had
attempted against her.</q>

               <p>The <hi>English</hi> Commmissioners having perused the writings of both sides,<note place="margin">The Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> desire the Regent to give better reasons.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that as yet they were not satisfied with any thing the Regent had shewed,
requiring him to produce some better, and more sound reasons, for the severity
they had used against their Soveraign, otherwise they could not but think she had
been too hardly dealt with, and report so much to the Queen their Mistresse. The
Regent, (who disliked nothing more then to be drawn into the accusation of the
Queen his sister) answered that he could not be more particular till he should be
assured, that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> would undertake the protection of the young
King, and relinquish the cause of his Mother. The Commissioners replying, that
they had no warrant to promise any such thing, he besought them to try the Queens
mind, that her pleasure being known he might sooner resolve what to do. Letters
hereupon was sent to the Queen, who willed the Regent to direct some one, or moe
of his side to Court, for her better information. To this effect Secretary <hi>Lething<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Iames Macgill</hi> Clerk of the Rolls were sent thither, with whom the
Queen having conferred a little time, she gave order to recall her Commissioners,
and advertise the Regent himself to come unto her. At his coming the Queen laid
to his charge the proceeding against his sister the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> saying, that <hi>she
did not see, how he and the rest of his faction could well be excused, and that unlesse matters
were better cleard on their parts, she could not deny the help and assistance that was required
at her hands.</hi> The Regent according to the condition proposed at <hi>York,</hi> answered, <hi>That
if she would take upon her the defence of the King, they should be more particular in their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for rejecting the Queens authority, and clear every thing they should speak sufficiently;
otherwise to accuse his sister, and Queen, would be held odious in the judgement of all men.</hi>

dispersing such lies, and using all means else for stirring up tumult, then Sir <hi>Iames

like as all the while he remained in <hi>England,</hi> he did ever keep intelligence
with the Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi> and others the Queens agents, and was one of the chief
plotters of the match intended betwixt her and the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> which came
shortly after to be detected. The Regent, who was not ignorant of these secret
workings, did finde there was a necessity of his returning home, to prevent the
commotions that were breeding before they grew into a greater ripeness: and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

resolved to do it, but with a protestation which he presented in writing to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
at <hi>Westminster</hi> the 28. of <hi>November</hi> in this form.</p>
               <p>Albeit our whole proceedings from the beginning of our interprise directed onely for the
punishment of the King murther,<note place="margin">A Declaration presented in writing by the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

abominable fact, may let the world see how unwilling we have been to touch the Queen
our Soveraign Lords Mother in honour, or to publish unto strangers matters tending to
her infamy, yet shall it not be amisse upon the present occasion, to shew briefly what hath
been, and still is our meaning therein: Such and so great was our devotion toward her,
as well for private affection, whereby every one of us was led to wish her well, as for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
respects, that rather then we would blemish her honour with the foreknowledge of that
detestable murther, we choosed to wink at the shrewd reports of the world, and let our selves
to be blasoned as rebels and traitours to our native Prince; which had been easie for us to
have wiped away with the uttering of a few words, if the desire we had to save her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
bad not made us content that the world should still live in doubt of the justice
of our quarrell, and speak every one as their affections were inclined. So when we were
urged by the Queens Majesty of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Kings Ambassadours to give
a reason why we detained our Queen at <hi>Lochleven,</hi> we gave no other answer, but that
her affection was so excessively towards <hi>Bothwell</hi> the committer of that odious murther,
that she being at liberty it would not be possible to punish him, and that it behooved us for
a season to sequestrate her person, till he might be apprehend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d and punished. In what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
this dealing brought us, we have no need to shew. From <hi>France</hi> we had nothing to
expect but open Hostility, and by keeping up the chief causes of her rejection, we had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to fear, that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> should call our proceeding in doubt, and so leave
us destitute of her Majesties aid, at whose hands we look principally to receive comfort in
time of danger. This course nottheless we should still have kept, if the importunity of our
adversaries had not forced us to take another way: For remembring what a person she is
whom we are brought to accuse, the Mother of our King and soveraign Lord, a Lady to
whom in particular the greatest part of us are so farre obliged for benefits received, that
if with the perpetuall exile of any one, or of a number of us, forth of our Native Countrey,
we could redeem her honour without the danger of the King and whole Estate, we would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
banish our selves to that end. And therefore ere we dip further in the matter
which to this boure we have shunned, we solemnly protest, that it is not any delight we take
in accusing her, but a necessity that is laid upon us to purge our selves, that drawes us unto
it. For if our adversaries would rested content with our former answer, which they know
to be true, no further would we needed. But against our hearts in defence of our just
cause they compelled us to utter the things, which we wish were buried in perpetuall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion.
So if our doing seem hatefull to any, let these bear the blame, who force us to answer,
which they know we may, and in the end must give. One thing onely we desire, that they
who have brought us to this necessitie may be present and hear what is said, that if we
speak any untruth, they may refute the same, for even in point of greatest moment we will
use their own testimonie.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50008:126"/>
This being communicated with the Agents of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen they answered,
<q>That they did not force them to any accusations, and if they did utter untruths,
or calumniate the Queen in any sort,<note place="margin">The answer of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
                     </note> they would not patiently hear it. That all
their desires were to have their Queen restored to her Kingdome from which by
force of armes she was expulsed, or if it should please the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to
hear any more of that matter, they requested that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> might be
sent for, and permitted to speak for her self.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mean while by a new Patent there were joyned to the other Commissioners,
<hi>Bacon</hi> keeper of the great Seal, the Earls of <hi>Arundell</hi> and <hi>Leicester,</hi> with the Lord
Admirall and Sir <hi>William</hi> Cecill, and a time assigned to the Regent for producing
the reasons for the Queens rejecting. When the day was come, he presented the
confessions of some that were executed for the Kings murther; the Statutes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ratifying her resignation of the Crown, and her sons Coronation subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by divers of her own party; certain amatory verses, and epistles written to
<hi>Bothwell</hi> (as they said) with her own hand; three severall contracts of marriage
betwixt her and <hi>Bothwell,</hi> with a number of presumptuous likelyhoods and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
to make it appear that she was privy to the murther <hi>Bothwell</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>The Queen of <hi>England</hi> having seen and perused all these stood doubtfull what
to do,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>England</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to cary her self in the business.</note> for albeit she was content to have some blot rubbed upon the Queen of
<hi>Stots,</hi> as many supposed; yet the pity of her misfortune made her sometimes to
think of composing matters betwixt her and her subjects. The terms besides
wherein she stood with the <hi>French</hi> King, who was dayly by his Ambassadours so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting
the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> liberty, made her uncertain what course to take; for if
she should simply deny his request, it would be esteemed a breach of friendship, and
to yield to his desire she thought it scarce safe for her own estate. Therefore keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a middle course she resolved to suspend her Declaration unto another time,
and willed the Regent seeing he could make no longer stay, to leave some of his
company to answer the criminations, which possibly his adversaries would charge
him with after he was gone. But he replying said, <hi>That he was not so desirous to
return home, but he would willingly stay to hear what they could alledge against him. Nor
was he ignorant of the rumours they had dispresed, and what they had spoken to some of
the Councell and to the</hi> French <hi>Ambassadour, which were more convenient to be told,
whilest he was himself in place and might make answer, then to bely and calumniate him in
his absence: wherefore he did humbly intreat her to cause them utter the things plainly that
they muttered in secret. Hereupon were the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>Commissioners called, and
it being inquired, Whether they had any thing to object against the Regent, which might
argue his guiltiness of the Kings murther;</hi> they answered, <hi>That when the Queen their
Mistress should bid them accuse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queens Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners purge the Regent of the Kings mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 
                  <hi>they would do it, but for the present they had nothing to
say.</hi> The Regent replied, <hi>That if the Queen or any other would accuse him, he should
ever be ready to give an account of his actions, and neither decline place nor time, but in
the mean while till she should intend her accusation, it was reason they should declare if they
themselves had any thing to lay unto his charge.</hi> After divers subterfuges, in end they
professed that they knew nothing which might make him or any of his associates
suspected of the murther.</p>
               <p>The Regent now at the point to depart,<note place="margin">The Duke of Chattellerault claimeth the Regency.</note> a new let was made by the Duke of

               <p>This he said, was the Law and practice of all Nations, and a custome perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

uncle to King <hi>Iames</hi> the first, with that of his son Duke <hi>Murdack</hi> after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
death; the government of <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> in the minority of King
<hi>Iames</hi> the fifth, and his own Regency in the nonage of the present Queen. Contrary
to which custom, a few Rebels (as he complained) had most injuriously to his disgrace,
and (which was most unsufferable) to the contempt of the lawfull blood, preferred
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50008:126"/>
one base born, unto the supreme dignitie; which honour if it should be restored
to him, the Civill troubles he said would cease, and the Queen without any tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
be ressored to her content: Whereupon he requested the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi>
favour, and that by her authority the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> might be caused cease from his
usurped Government.</p>
               <p>To this in behalf of the Regent it was replied,<note place="margin">A reply to the Dukes peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <q>That the Dukes Petition was
most injust, and contrary to the custome, and Lawes of the Countrey, which
provided that at such times as the Crown should fall in the hands of Minors, one
or more of the most sage and powerfull in the Estates should be elected for the
administration of affairs unto the Kings ripe age. This course, they said, the <hi>Scots</hi>
had constantly kept the last six hundreth years, and thereby secured the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and transmitted the same free and safe to their posterity; As for instance,
after the death of King <hi>Robert Bruce, Thomas Randolph</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> was elected
Governour; upon his death, <hi>Duncan</hi> Earl of <hi>Marre:</hi> after him <hi>Andrew Murray,</hi>
and then <hi>Robert Stewart;</hi> who were all chosen Regents one after another. In the
minority of King <hi>Iames</hi> the second, Sir <hi>Alexander Levingston</hi> was elected, a man
neither of bloud of the King, nor a Nobleman of degree, but for his worth, and
wisedome preferred. In like sort King <hi>Iames</hi> the Third, had four Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
appointed to him by the Estates, none of them for any respect of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And for the examples adduced of Duke <hi>Murdack,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi>
they made nothing to the purpose. The last of the two in the minority of King
<hi>Iames</hi> the fifth, being called to the government by the Nobility, and confirmed
therein by the Estates. And to shew that in his election no respect was had to
neerness of bloud, his elder brother <hi>Alexander</hi> was then alive, who would not
have been passed, if propinquity or kindred had carried the sway. How Duke
<hi>Murdack</hi> and his father before him came to govern, it was well known: King
<hi>Robert</hi> the third waxing infirm and unable to rule by himself, did substitute his
brother (called <hi>Robert</hi> likewise) his Lieutenant in the Kingdome, commending
his tow sons <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> to his care. But the kindness he shewed to them
was, that the elder of the two was starved to death in the Palace of <hi>Falkland,</hi> and
the younger forced fly for his life, he being detained prisoner in <hi>England:</hi> After
the fathers death, the uncle usurped still the place wherewith he was possessed,
and at his dying left the same to <hi>Murdack</hi> his son. As to that he speaks of his
own Regiment, they said, he had done more wisely not to have mentioned it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
his preferment proceeded rather of hatred born to the Cardinall, who
had supposed a false testament, then of any favour carried to himself: And that
being possessed in the place, he sold both it and the young Queen to the <hi>French,</hi>
which had bred a great deal of trouble. And granting the custome had been
such as he pratends, will any man in reason judge it safe to commit the tuition of
an innocent child to him, whose family hath entertained so long enmity with
that of which the King is descended, and will ever be waiting and wishing the
death of his Pupill? none will think it.</q> This was the substance of the reply
which when the Queen of <hi>England</hi> heard, she directed certain of the Councell
to shew the Duke that he was not to look for any help from her in that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and to prohibite his journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> till the Regent was parted and
gone home.</p>
               <p>About the same time there were letters of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> intercepted,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> letters intercepted.</note> sent
to the Noblemen of her party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein she complained, <hi>That the Queen
of</hi> England <hi>had not kept promise unto her, yet desired them to be of good heart, because she
was assured of aid by some other means, and hoped to be with them in a short time.</hi> These
letters sent from <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Regent, he delivered to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
who from thenceforth was much estranged from the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> as well for that
she charged her with breach of promise, as because it appeared she leaned to some
others besides her self.</p>
               <p>The Regent presently after took his journey homewards,<note place="margin">The Regent returneth to <hi>Scotland.</hi>

that had happened betwixt the Queen their native Soveraign, and a part
of her subjects, which he wished to be removed in some quiet and peaceable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
and that the Estates convening might (after they had considered the ground
and beginning of these troubles, which he conceived to be the murther of the
Queens late husband) with one consent agree upon soem reasonable course to
be followed for redresse thereof, and of the evils which thence had proceeded,
whereunto he and all the Nobility continuing in the obedience of the Queen their
Soveraign, should be found pliable; which he did not write, <hi>as he said,</hi> because
of the Proclamations made by the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> to convene people in <hi>Glasgow</hi>
the tenth of <hi>March:</hi> for since these troubles began he was not in the countrey,
and if all <hi>Scotland</hi> were gathered, he would trust for his own and his predecessors
good deserving to find such favour, as if the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> would invade him
and his friends, he should not be assisted by any of them to do him wrong. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desired them in Gods behalfe (<hi>so the letter beareth)</hi> to make his minde
and intention known to the people, or if they did not think his desires and offers

                  </note> he answered, <hi>that he was drawn against his will to make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

               </p>
               <p>The Earls of <hi>Argile</hi> and <hi>Huntley,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A treaty with Argile and Huntley.</note> who were at the same time making their own
appointment, had a day assigned them at S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> whither <hi>Argile</hi> came first, and
with him the difficulty was not great, because in the last tumults he had carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
more moderately then others; wherefore of him no more was craved but that he
should swear obedience to the King and Authority in time coming, as he did. The
busines with <hi>Huntley</hi> was greater, for he during the Regents absence had usurped the
Royal power, placing Lieutenants in the countreys of <hi>Angus, Mernis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Strathern,</hi> &amp;
committed great spoils upon the subjects in those parts. Therfore when as divers of
the Councel did advise to put all things past in oblivion, it was by others opposed,
<hi>That the example of such impunity would prove hurtful: for when they that had continued
in the Kings obedience, and sustained losse in their goods, should perceive the Rebels after a
manner rewarded, and no regard taken of their losses, they would undoubtedly grudge; and if
troubles should afterwards arise, be more slack to do service; yea granting there were no such
inconvenience to be feared, yet neither the Regent, nor yet the King himself, could by law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the robbing of another mans goods, unless restitution was made of that which was spoiled.</hi>
And whereas some did object his greatnes, and that his lying out, might cause great
unquietnes; <hi>It was an idle fear; for was not his Father a man of greater wealth and wisdom
easily brought under foot, when he set himself against the Authority? And shall he who hath
not as yet repaired the calamities of his house, be able to withstand the forces of a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
It is more foolish, they say, that he will seek to some for ain Prince, and so endanger the
countrey; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

then may serve to their own commodity. To accept him in favour,</hi> they said, <hi>was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
albeit he gave satisfaction to the subjects whom he had wronged.</hi> This opinion
prevailing, it was concluded, that after trial of the complaints, he should satisfy
those that he had wronged, at sight of the Councel.</p>
               <p>But then arose another question,<note place="margin">Huntky remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon some conditions.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether all that had assisted him in these last trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
should be comprised in his remission; and power given him to compone with them,
for satisfying such as complained; or that they should be severally called, and every man
fined as be should be tried to have offended?</hi> They who thought the Earl too rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
used in the point of satisfaction, held that to be the smallest favour
which could be done to him, to remit his followers to himself. But to the contrary
it was answered, <hi>That in civil warres nothing was so much to be looked unto, as the
weakening and dissolving of factions, which is the most easily wrought, when the Prince
reserves to himself the power of pardon and punishment.</hi> It was further said, <hi>that a seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
examination was necessary, because all had not offended alike, and that no man was
so unfit to take that trial, as the Earl himself, because in all probablity they should have
most favour at his hand, who had been most forward in his service, and so the least guilty
should bear the heaviest punishment.</hi> Upon these considerations it was thought meet
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50008:128"/>
to convene his followers severally, remitting his domesticks only to be used by
him at his pleasure. And thus was he received into grace; which done, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

at <hi>Elgin,</hi> with letters from both the Queens, and some others written by his private
friends in the <hi>English</hi> Court; The Queen of <hi>England</hi> in her letters made offer of
three conditions in behalf of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> requiring one of the three to be
accepted. These were, <hi>That she should either be absolutely restored to her Royal digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or be associated in the government with her sonne, and in all letters and publick acts
honoured with the title of a Queen, the administration of affaires continuing in the Regents
hands, till the King should be 17. years of age; or if none of these could be granted, that
she might be permitted to return unto her countrey, and live a private life, having honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
means appointed for her entertainment.</hi> The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> desired, <hi>that Iudges
should be appointed for cognoscing the lawfulnes of her marriage with</hi> Bothwel, <hi>and if the
same was found contracted against the lawes, it might be declared null, and she made free to
marry where she pleased.</hi>

in that matter, and to do it with such expedition and good affection, as it might
not appear either to the Queen his sister, or others who had interest in the business,
that his consent was extorted, and not willingly given. To this effect he advised him
to send the Laird of <hi>Lethington</hi> to <hi>England</hi> with speed, as the wisest and most sufficient
man he could chuse, who would provide for him &amp; the rest that had assisted him, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially

he would not have written so peremptorily unto him.</hi> Then concluded with these words,

               </p>
               <p>This letter was accompanied with another from Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> to <hi>Lethington,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A letter from, Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> to <hi>Lethington.</hi>
                  </note>
wherein he shewed, that according to his advice he had written to the Regent
<hi>with a great zeal, and care of his well doing</hi> (these were the words he used) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
he should hasten his coming to Court for that businesse, the same
being as yet concealed from the Queen, till he as the fittest Minister might propone
the same in behalf of the Regent, and Nobility of <hi>Scotland;</hi> whereunto he held it
assured the Queen would assent, as preferring her own surety, the tranquillity of
her Kingdom, and conservation of her people, before any device, that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the inconsiderate passions of whomsoever. And that he might be the
more incouraged, he did inform him particularly of the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and the approbation of the Earls of <hi>Arundel, Pembrook, Leicester, Bedford,
Shrewsbury,</hi> and the rest of the wisest, noblest, ablest and mightiest of that Realm.
And it was truth that he wrote of their consenting, howbeit with a condition, <hi>so that
the Queen of</hi> England <hi>was not against it:</hi> yea, beside these divers well affected both
to Religion and State, did wish the purpose a good successe; for perceiving no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
in the Queen of <hi>England</hi> her self to take a husband, they feared the Queen
of <hi>Scots,</hi> who was her undoubted heir, by matching with some forain Prince, might
endanger both Religion and State; and therefore desired the marriage with the
Duke might take effect, he being a Nobleman of <hi>England,</hi> beloved of the people,
and educated in the Protestant Religion: for by this match, as they made account,
if it should happen the young King to die, the two Kingdomes might be united in
a Prince of the <hi>English</hi> Nation; or if he lived unto a ripe age, he might be married
with the Dukes youngest daughter, who was near of the same age, and that way the
two Crowns be made one. But these devices proved idle and vain, as we shall hear.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50008:128"/>
The Regent for answering these letters, did appoint a meeting of the Estates
at <hi>Perth</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> thereafter. At which time an Assembly of the Church was also
kept in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Convention of Estates at Perth.</note> and from it Commissioners directed to the Convention, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the Petitions made the year preceding, that as yet had received no answer.
And further, to desire, <q>that a portion of the tithes might be allotted for susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the poor; the labourers of the ground permitted to gather the tithes
of their proper corns, paying for the same a reasonable duty; and that the thirds
of Benefices being really separated from the two other parts, the Collectors of
the Church might peaceably intromet therewith, for the more ready paiment
of Ministers according to their assignations.</q> But these Petitions, in regard of
the more weighty businesse, were deferred to another time.</p>
               <p>And the Convention falling to consider the letters sent from <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Letters sent, from the two Queens.</note> did
hardly accord upon an answer, Beginning with that of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> they
judged the <hi>first condition</hi> so derogatory to the Kings authority, as they did simply
reject it. The <hi>second</hi> of Association, was held dangerous, and <hi>third</hi> onely thought
reasonable and meet to be accepted. But when they came to speak of the Queen
of <hi>Scots</hi> desires, the contention was great; they that stood for the Kings authority,
taking exception first, of her imperious form of writing, and that she did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them, as though she were their absolute Queen; then at the desire it self they
excepted, not holding it safe to condescend unto the same before the Queen of
<hi>England</hi> should be acquainted therewith: for they conceived some other thing to
be lurking under that purpose of divorce then was openly pretended. Such as
affected the Queen, and were privy to the marriage intended with <hi>Northfolk,</hi> excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the form of writing, and laying the blame upon her Secretaries, made offer to
procure new letters in what tearms they pleased, so as judges were named to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the divorce; and when they saw this not to be regarded, in a chasing mood
they said, <hi>That it was strange to think, how that they not many moneths passed seemed
to desire nothing more then the Queenes separation from</hi> Bothwell, <hi>should now when
it was offered decline the same.</hi> It was answered again in heat, <hi>That if the Queen
was so earnest in the Divorce, she might write to the King of</hi> Denmark, <hi>and
desire him to doe justice upon</hi> Bothwell, <hi>for the murther of the King her husband.
That done, the divorce would not be needfull, and she freed to marry where and when she
pleased.</hi>

did signifie to the Queen of <hi>England</hi> the business made about the divorce
and what was done concerning it; but she not seeming to regard the matter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that she was not satisfied with the answer of the convention, and desired
they should think better of the conditions proposed. The truth was that she held not
the Gentleman of sufficient quality to deal in such business; for otherwise she was
not ignorant of the cause, wherefore the divorce was sought, and had warned <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk
to take heed on what pillow he laid his head;</hi> yea, she took so ill the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>
carriage in that matter; as shortly after she caused her to be removed to <hi>Coventry</hi>
more within the Countrey, and gave her in custody to <hi>George Talbot</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>

where in effect the same answer that of before, was given to the Propositions made
by the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> and here with <hi>Robert Pitcarne</hi> Abbot of <hi>Dunfermline,</hi> a
man of good sufficiency was directed, who was willed to say, for the point of asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<hi>That the same could not be granted, as tending to the utter overthrow of the Kings
authority, and the indangering of his person. For besides that the participation of a
Crown was obnoxious to many perils, there could be no equality of Government betwixt
an infant King, and a woman of mature age, who would finde a thousand wayes being
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50008:129"/>
once possessed with a part of the rule, to draw the whole unto her self. And if it should fall
that she matched with some forrain Prince, or other great Personage who must needs be
partner with her in the Government, the danger would be so much the greater.</hi> These
and the like reasons he was willed to use for the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> satisfaction.
But before his coming to Court, the face of things was quite changed. The Duke
of <hi>Northfolk</hi> committed to the Tower, and the Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> put in the keeping of
the Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> After which brake shortly forth that rebellion in the North
part of <hi>England,</hi> whereof <hi>Thomas Piercie</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Charles Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>
Earl of <hi>Westmerland</hi> were the heads. A rebellion, that in the beginning cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
great stirre, and put the Queen of <hi>England</hi> in such fears, as once she resolved to
send the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> by Sea to the Regent, but the sudden dispersing of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
altered that resolution.</p>
               <p>The two Earles fleeing into <hi>Scotland,</hi>

was he might use his intercession. Being at <hi>Striveling</hi> in Councell, Captain <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

presented a warrant for receiving the prisoner in his keeping: the Gentleman taking
no suspicion, obeyed, for he knew no man to be more inward with the Regent
then was <hi>Grange.</hi> And he indeed unto that time did carry the reputation of
an honest man; nor was any one thought more sure and fast then he was. But
from thenceforth he became hated of all good men and was in no esteem, as having
abused his credit, and deceived the Regent, to whom he was many wayes obliged.
For besides other benefits, he had preferred him before all his own friends, to be
keeper of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The next day being sent for to come to the
Regent, he refused. Nottheless, the next day following (so carefull the Regent
was to reclaim the man) he went himself to the Castle, and conferred a good space
with him, accepting the excuse he made, and contenting himself with a promise to
exhibite <hi>Lethington,</hi> when he should be called to his triall.</p>
               <p>After which keeping his journey to the borders,<note place="margin">The Regent makes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to the borders.</note> which he had intended he went
by the <hi>Mers,</hi> and as he was accustomed tooke up his lodging in the Castle of
<hi>Home.</hi> But there he was coldly received, the Lord of the place having changed
his party, and taken himself to the contrary faction. From thence he went to <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viotdale,</hi>
and though he was advised by his friends, because of his small company, to
return, and deferre his journey to another time, he would needs go on, and had
great obedience shewed in all the parts to whom he came.</p>
               <p>All the time of this expedition he had warning given him dayly of some pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
against his life,<note place="margin">He is inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of practices against his life</note> wherein <hi>Grange</hi> was ever named as one of the principalls.
But he not trusting these informations, sent the copies of all his advertisements to

Soon after the Regents return from the borders, the Abbot of <hi>Dunfermline</hi>
came home from <hi>England,</hi> shewing that the Queen had taken in good part the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

did offer his service: This man had been imprisoned some time, and being in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his life, redeemed the same by making over a parcell of land in <hi>Lothian</hi> called
<hi>Woodhously</hi> that came to him by his wife, to Sir <hi>Iames Ballenden</hi> Justice Clerk:
How soon he was let at liberty, he sought to be repossessed to his own, and not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a way to recover it (for the Justice Clerk would not part therewith) he made
his quarrell to the Regent, who was most innocent, and had restored him both to
life and liberty. The great promises made him by the faction, with his private
discontent, did so confirm his mind, as he ceased not till he put to execution the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
he had conceived against him; and having failed the occasion which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
at <hi>Glasgow</hi> and <hi>Striveling,</hi> he followed the Regent to <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> where
lurking privately in the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> his lodging, the next day, as the
Regent did pass that way, he killed him with the shot of a bullet, that entering a
little beneath the navell, and piercing the bowels, did strike dead the horse of a
Gentleman who was riding on his other side.<note place="margin">The Regent killed by the shot of a bulbullet.</note> The Regent had warning given
him the same morning, that one did ly in wait for his life, and had the house de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
where the man did lurk, but giving small ear unto it, answered, that <hi>his life
was in the hands of God, which he was ready to yield at his good pleasure.</hi> Onely he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to pass out of the Town by the same gate at which he entered, and to turn
on the back of the Town, unto the way that led to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> whither he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
But when he had taken horse, either that he would not seem fearfull, or
then hindered by the throng of horsemen that attended, and thinking to ride quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the house that was suspected, he changed his resolution: but the throng there
working him the like impediment, the murtherer had the occasion to execute his
treachery.</p>
               <p>How soon the Regent perceived himself stricken, he lighted from his horse, and
returned on foot to his lodging: The Chirurgeon at the first inspection of his
wound did affirm it not to be deadly, yet after a few houres his pain increasing he

his clemency, having spared that miscreant whose life he might justly have taken:</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that <hi>they should never make him forthink any good he had done in his life.</hi>
Thereafter giving order for his private affairs, he seriously commended the care of
the young King to such of the Nobility as were present, and died a little before
midnight. This fell out the 23. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1569. being Saturday.</p>
               <p>The murtherer escaping by the Postern-gate of the garden came the same night
to the town of <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The murtherer escapeth.</note> where at first he was welcomed with many gratulations,
and made much of; yet shortly after to decline the envy of the fact which they

Whether this was so or not, I leave it upon the credit of the Writer.</p>
               <p>The death of the Regent was by all good men greatly lamented,<note place="margin">The death of the Regent greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</note> especially by
the Commons, who loved him as their father whilest he lived, and now mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
grievously at his death. The great things he had wrought in his life, (have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the space of one yeare and a little more, quieted the State, which he
found broken, and disordered) made his very enemies speake of him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his death with praise and commendation. Above all his virtues, which
were not a few, he shined in Piety towards God, ordering himself and
his Family in such sort, as it did more resemble a Church, then a Court.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50008:130"/>
For therein besides the exercise of devotion, which he never omitted, there was
no wickedness to be seen, nay, not an unseemly or wanton word to be heard. A
man truly good and worthy to be ranked amongst the best Governours that this
Kingdome hath enjoyed, and therefore to this day honoured with the Title of <hi>The
good Regent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There fell out the next day after his death a thing which I thought was not to be
passed;<note place="margin">A prediction of Iohn Knox.</note> He was killed on the Saturday, and died (as I have said) a little before
midnight. The word of his death coming to <hi>Edenburgh, Thomas Maitland</hi> a youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
brother of <hi>Lethinton</hi> (this is he whom <hi>Buchannan</hi> makes his Collocutor in the
Dialogue <hi>De jure Regni)</hi> knowing what esteem <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> made of the Regent, and
loving none of the two, caused a writing to be laid in the Pulpit where <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>
was that day to preach to this sense, and almost in the same words. <hi>Take up the
man whom you accounted another God, and consider the end whereto his ambition hath
brought him. Iohn Knox</hi> finding the paper, and taking it to be a memoriall for
recommending some sick persons in his Prayers, after he had read the same, laid it
by, nothing as it seemed commoved therewith, yet in the end of the Sermon, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to regrate the loss that the Church and Common-wealth had received by the
death of the Regent, and shewing how God did often for the sins of the people take
away good Rulers and Governours; <hi>I perceive,</hi> said he, <hi>albeit this be an accident,
we should all take to heart; There be some that rejoyce in this wicked fact, making it the
subject of their mirth, amongst whom there is one, that hath caused a writing to be cast in
this place, insulting upon that which is all good mens sorrow. This wicked man whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he be, shall not goe unpunished, and shall die where none shall be to lament him.</hi> The
Gentleman was himself present at Sermon, and being come to the lodging, asked
his sister who was also there, if she did not think <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was raving to speak so
of the man he knew not? But she weeping, said, that <hi>she was sory he had not followed
her counsell,</hi> for she had disswaded him from that doing. <hi>None of this mans denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations,</hi>
said she, <hi>are wont to prove idle, but have their own effect.</hi> Shortly after, the
troubles of the Countrey increasing, the Gentleman betook himself to travel, and
passing into <hi>Italy,</hi> died there, having no known person to attend him. This I
thought not unworthy of record being informed thereof by the Gentlemans si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to whom these speeches were uttered, and who was privy to the whole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for an advertisement to all persons, not to make a light account of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of Gods servants: The Gentleman was otherwise a youth of great hopes,
learned and courteous, but miscarried with affection, and not to be excused in this
that he took pleasure in the fall of him, whom he judged an enemy; a thing inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and abhorred of the very heathen.</p>

Ambassadour was no sooner come,<note place="margin">The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours speech in Councell.</note> but he had hearing given him by the Councel,
to whom after he had spoken a few words concerning her Majesties good affection
to the Realm in general, and in her name commending to their care the preservation
of Religion, the safety of the young King, and the punishment of the late murther; he
did much aggravate the insolence of the borderers, and the spoil they had made in
<hi>England,</hi> saying, <q>That his Mistresse knew sufficiently that these things were not
done by publick allowance, and therefore meant not to make quarrel to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but take her self to the actors, whom if they by themselves could not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
her Majesty would either joyn her power to theirs, or if they thought meet,
send an Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which without doing harm to any good subject,
should only punish the committers of that insolence.</q>

               <p>The Councel returning many thanks to the Queen for her kind Ambassage, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused

then be given to his propositions, and therefore besought him to have patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the first of <hi>May,</hi> at which time the Estates of the Realm were to meet, by whom
her Majesty should receive all satisfaction. The Estates convening at the day,
<hi>William Douglas</hi> of <hi>Lochlevin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Laird of Lochlevin ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth a revenge of the Regents murther.</note> brother uterine to the late Regent, preferred a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Councel for some course to be taken in the revenge of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
murther, considering he was taken away in the defence of the common cause
of the Realm, and not upon any private quarrel. The Petition was held rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
by all that were present, every one consenting to the pursuit, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the murtherer, and his complices. But in the manner they agreed not,
some advising that not the murtherer only, but all who were suspected to have had
a hand in the treachery, should be called to underlie the ordinary trial of law, at a
certain day. Others esteeming such a form of processe unnecessary with them, who
had already taken Arms to maintain the fact, and that the best course were, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
with all hostility, both these that were delated of the recent crime, and such as
had been forfeited in the Parliament preceding. Many inclined to the last course,
yet because it was opposed by divers of special note,<note place="margin">The delay ill taken of the people.</note> there was nothing conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the businesse; which was generally ill taken of the people, who construed
the delay to proceed of some private favour carried to the enemies, and to be done
of purpose, that either with time the hatred of the murther might be lessened, or
the adversaries might have leisure to make themselves more strong.</p>
               <p>The Assembly of the Church, in the mean while (which was then convened at
<hi>Edenburgh</hi>) to declare in what detestation they had the murther committed, did
ordain the murtherer to be excommunicated in all the chief Burghs of the Realm,
and whosoever afterwards happened to be convicted thereof, to be used in the
same manner. In this Assembly, divers constitutions were made for discipline, and
amongst others an Act for the publick inauguration of Ministers, at their entry,
whereunto the revolt of some Preachers gave occasion, that forsaking the Pulpit,
took them to the pleading of causes before the Lords of Session. It was then also
condescended, that forth of the thirds, five thousand merks should be yearly
paid for the furnishing of the Kings house, and the Church burthened with no
further duty.</p>
               <p>Some few days after,<note place="margin">The principals of the Queens faction writ to the Earl of <hi>Morton.</hi>
                  </note> the principals of the Queens faction being convened at

for to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> they would not come. This letter (as he was desired) he
communicated with the Secretary, who was after the Regents death come forth of
the Castle, and by the Earl of <hi>Atholl</hi> brought again unto the Councell, having first
purged himself of the accusation laid against him, and promised to submit himself
unto the most severe triall that could be taken;<note place="margin">Lethington of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth himself to a trial.</note> his advice to the Earl <hi>Morton</hi> was,
that the Noblemen should all be brought to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which for those of the

of that faction, shewing that they had no cause to fear, being in forces superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the others, and having the Lord of <hi>Grange</hi> on their side, (for he had then
plainly declared himself for the Queen) who was both Provost of the Town, and
commanded the Castle.<note place="margin">A meeting at Edenburgh of the Noblemen of both parties in March.</note> Thus about the midst of <hi>March</hi> the Earls of <hi>Huntley, Atholl,</hi>

Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Boyde,</hi> came as far as unto <hi>Linlithgow,</hi>
but by occasioned of a tumult raised amongst some souldiers, they were forced to
disperse their companies, and return home to their dwellings. Within a few dayes
the Earls of <hi>Marre</hi> and <hi>Glencarne</hi> came likewise to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> after whose coming,
the Lords of both factions meeting to confer, did think fit to continue all things
till the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> was advertised, whose authority was great in those times. And
when it was known that he was gone back from <hi>Linlithgow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to perswade his return; but he would not consent. They write the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
should have privily disswaded him, as one who loved to keep all things loose;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50008:131"/>
but I do not see what advantage he could expect that way, and think rather that as
his estate then stood, he did earnestly desire to have matters accorded. The true
cause of <hi>Argiles</hi> declining that conference seems to have been the averseness of his
brother and others of his friendship, who refused to follow him in that quarrel, and
carried a constant affection to the maintaining of the Kings authority.</p>
               <p>When as the other Noblemen perceived that <hi>Argile</hi> would not come,<note place="margin">They delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon the choice of a Regent.</note> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to treat of the choice of a Regent, in place of him who was taken away. Here
first they fell to question their own power and authority, which some maintained
to be sufficient because of the Patent the Queen had given at first, for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of affairs in her sons minority; in which seven Noblemen were named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the late Regent, and that of this number, they might choose as they said any
one. Others reasoned that no respect ought to be had to that Patent, the same
being expired by the creation of the last Regent, for which only at the time it was
granted. The more moderate gave their opinon, that all proceeding in that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
should be delayed till the convention of the Estates in <hi>May</hi> next. This was
likewise opposed by a number, that esteemed the protracting of time dangerous;
and thought that it concerned the Noblemen who had first assisted the Coronation
of the King, and continued firm in his obedience, to nominate a Regent, that would
be careful of the young King his preservation, and of the quiet and tranquillity of
the Realm. But this opinion, as tending to the fostering of discord, was rejected,
So that meeting dissolved, without any certain conclusion.</p>
               <p>At the same time one <hi>Monsieur Verack</hi> Cubiculare to the <hi>French</hi> King landed at

                  </note> bringing letters to the Noblemen of the Queens faction, full of thanks
for the constant affection they had shewed in maintaining the cause, and promises of
present succours. This did so animate them, as in a frequent meeting kept the
first of <hi>April</hi> at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A meeting at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> of the Noblemen that stood for the Queen.</note> they began to discover the intention which before they
had concealed, of making war upon <hi>England;</hi> for this, as they judged, would serve
to oblierate the late Regents murther. And to give the more authority to their
proceedings, they took purpose to remove to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> using all means to draw
the Town to be of their party, which they thought would be easily obtained by
reason of <hi>Grange</hi> his Commandment, and if they should once compasse this, they
put no doubt to draw the rest of the countrey their way in a short time. But first
they resolved to advertise the Town of their coming, and to intreat their favour.
The Magistrates answered, <hi>That their gates should be patent to all that professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
subjects to the King, but they would neither receive the</hi> English <hi>Rebels</hi> (meaning
the Earl of <hi>Westmerland,</hi> and Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> who were in company with the Lords) <hi>nor
the</hi> Hamiltons, <hi>and others suspected of the Regents murther, nor yet to permit any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
to be made, derogatory to the Kings authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These conditions seemed to them hard, yet hoping by conversation to winne the
people to their side, they came forward. The next day after their coming to the
Town,<note place="margin">They give out a Proclamation.</note> they gave out a Proclamation, <q>Declaring their good affection towards
the maintenance of true Religion, their Soveraign, the liberty of the countrey, and
the setling of the present divisions, which must, as they said, unlesse timous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
were provided, bring the Realm to utter destruction. They desired
therefore all men to know, that they had esteemed the enterprise taken by some
Noblemen against the Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> for revenging the murther of the King,
and setting of the Queen at liberty, both good and honourable, whereunto they
would have given their assistance, if the same had been duly required. And for
the things that had intervened, which they did forbear to mention, lest they
should irritate the minds of any, their desire was the same might be in a familiar
and friendly conference calmly debated, and a peaceable course taken for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the differences. Mean while because they understood, that some unquiet
spirits gave out, that their present convening was for the subversion of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
presently professed, as they could not but give notice to all the subjects, that
they who were now assembled, were for the most part the first and chiefest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
in advancing Religion, and had still continued in professing the same,
with a resolution to spend their lands and lives in maintenance thereof: So they
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50008:131"/>
desired to have it know, that their meeting at that time did only proceed from
a desire they had to see a perfect union, and agreement established in the Realm,
for which they were ready to meet with those of the Nobility, that differed
from them in judgement, and condescend (after the ground of the differences
was ript up) upon such overtures as should be found agreeable to the setting
forth of God his honour, the strengthening of the Royal succession, the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the young Prince, the entertaining of peace with forain Nations, and
the setling of accord amongst the Noblemen, and other subjects. This they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be their sole intention, and rather then the same should not take the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
effect, they were content to yield unto any conditions that should be thought
reasonable; under protestation, that if this their godly and honest purpose for the
reunion of the State was neglected, and despised, the inconvenients that ensued
might be imputed to the refusers, and the Noblemen presently convened, be
discharged thereof before God, and man.</q> This was the substance of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
in the end whereof the lieges were charged to concurre with them in
forthsetting that godly purpose, and a prohibition made under great pains, to joyn
with any others that should attempt under the cloak of whatsoever authority, to
hinder the same.</p>
               <p>But neither did this declaration,<note place="margin">They deal wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at the same time, prevail with the other Noblemen to bring them to this meeting,
for still they excused themselves by the Convention appointed in <hi>May,</hi> 
                  <q>which
they said there was no necessity to prevent; or if any extraordinary occasion did
require it, the same being signified to the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> who lay at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi>
upon his advertisement they should be ready to meet.</q> So finding their hopes this
way disappointed, by advice of the Secretary (whose directions only they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
they took purpose to deal with the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> apart. To this effect the Earl
of <hi>Athol,</hi> the Prior of <hi>Coldinghame</hi> brother to the Secretary, and the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> were
selected to confer with the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> and Abbot of <hi>Dunfermlin,</hi> but they could
come to no agreement. For the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> (of whom they had conceived
some hope) would not hearken to any conditions, except they did acknowledge
the King for their Soveraign. Hereupon they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ell to other counsels, and first
to have the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> at their direction, they craved the keys of the gates
to be delivered; which being refused, they resolved to contribute moneys for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of souldiers, and to draw so many of their friends and followers thither, as with
help of the Castle might command the Town.<note place="margin">An Army cometh to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> under conduct of the Earl of <hi>Sussex.</hi>
                  </note> But as they were about these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
advertisement was brought of an Army come to <hi>Berwick,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> which troubled all these projects. To remain in <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
they held it not safe, yet lest it should be thought that they left the Town for fear,
the Magistrates were privately desired to intreat them to depart,<note place="margin">The Lords forsake <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> upon the report.</note> lest the <hi>English</hi>

the Town, by whom they had been very courteously used, they went to <hi>Linlith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow,</hi>
and abode there the rest of that moneth. Before their parting, they gave a
warrant to the Laird of <hi>Grange</hi> for fortifying the Castle, and dimitting the Lords
<hi>Home</hi> and <hi>Hereis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They give warrant for fortifying the Castle.</note> who had been committed by the late Regent. The Duke of

               <p>About the end of <hi>April</hi> the Army of <hi>England</hi> entring into <hi>Teviotdale,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Army of England enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Scotland.</note> burnt the

and divers houses belonging to the <hi>Kers</hi> and <hi>Scots.</hi> And in their return to <hi>Berwick</hi>
besieged the Castle of <hi>Home,</hi> which was rendred by the Keepers to Sir <hi>William
Drury,</hi> at the Lord <hi>Home</hi> his direction, for he reposed much in his friendship. The
Lord <hi>Scroop</hi> at the same time invading the West borders, made a great spoil upon
the <hi>Iohnstons</hi> and others who had accompanied <hi>Bacleugh</hi> in his incursion. The

of the <hi>English,</hi> and suspecting they had some other intentions then the spoiling of

answer.<note place="margin">The Lords desire a Truce from the Earl of <hi>Sussex</hi> which he refused.</note> The Earl opening the letters that were directed to the Queen (for

               <p>The Estates perceiving there would be no agreement,<note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the Estates.</note> gave forth a Proclamation
to this effect; <q>First, <hi>they said,</hi> that it was not unknown to all the subjects in what a
happy state the Realm stood under the government of the late Regent, and what
calamities it was fallen into by his death, divers Lords and other subjects conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with them, having presumed to erect another authority under the name of
the Queen his Majesties mother. But as such treasonable attempts had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
taken in hand, and as often through Gods favour disappointed, to the shame
and ignominy of the enterprisers, so they wished all men should understand, what
sort of people they were that had massed themselves together in the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Conspirators they ranked in three orders, the principles, <hi>they said,</hi> were
the authours of the cruel murthers of the King his father,<note place="margin">The Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators ranked in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> and Regent; Others
were manifestly purjured, as having bound themselves by their oathes and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
to defend the King his authority which now they impugned: A
third sort were such as had servile minos, and without regard to conscience, or
honour did follow those to whom they had addicted themselves: All which did
pretend the maintenance of true Religion, the liberty of the Countrie, and the
preservation of peace both abroad and at home. But with what probability, any
man of judgement might consider; for neither could he, who was known
to have been a persecutor of the truth, and now carried the chief sway amongst
them (meaning the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi>) be thought a maintainer of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
nor could they be esteemed favourers of their Country, and the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereof, who without any just provocation had invaded the neighbour Realm
of <hi>England,</hi> and publickly entertained the Queens Rebells, professing enemies
to God and Religion. As to the care they professed of the Kings preservation,
any man might conjecture how he should be preserved by them, who exiled his
Grandfather, murthered his father, did wickedly counsell his mother, led her on
courses, that had brought her to shame and dishonour, and now at last had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
cut off his Uncle and Regent, by suborning a mischant to kill him trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously.
It is like, <hi>said they,</hi> that they will be content to live subjects to a King dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
of that house, which they have so long a time persecuted and will they not
fear, if God shall bring him to perfection of years, that he will be avenged of his
fathers and uncles murther? Neither can any be ignorant what the hope of a
Kingdome will work in ambitious spirits, especially when they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a possibility to succeed unto the present possession. And these are the
men, <hi>said they,</hi> who seek to rule and command under the name of her whom they
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50008:132"/>
have undone by their wicked practices. Of this they thought fit to advertise the
subjects, and to inhibit them from giving any assistance to the said conspirators
under pain of death. Such as of simplicity or ignorance had joyned with them,
they commanded to separate and return to their houses within the space of 24.
houres, promising in that case impunity and pardon for their by-past defection,
those onely excepted, who were suspect of the foresaid murthers, and had
resset the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> Rebells, and violated the publick peace betwixt
the two Realms.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Proclamation was indited with much passion,<note place="margin">All prepare for Warre.</note> and matters now reduced to
these termes, that each side prepared to maintain their quarrell with the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  </hi> to <hi>France</hi> to inform
how matters went, and to further the supply promised.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> was sent to <hi>Flanders</hi> to intreat the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> (at that time
Governour of the <hi>Neatherlands</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>) for some aid of moneys
and men,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> sent to <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </note> and to impede the traffique of the <hi>Scottish</hi> rebells (so they termed them
that acknowledged the Kings authority) in those parts. For the point of traffick, the
Duke excused himself, saying, <hi>That he could not inhibit the same, it being against the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the</hi> Low-countreys, <hi>but in other things he would do his best to further the Queen
of</hi> Scots <hi>cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Like as shortly after he sent Mr. <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> Parson of <hi>Dumbar</hi> (who lay Agent

Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> in the mean while, who could not be idle wheresoever he was, and had
a great desire to approve himself by some service to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
his habit, went into the United Provinces, and dealt with <hi>Scottish</hi> Captains
and Under officers to make them leave the service of the Estates, and follow the
King of <hi>Spain;</hi> which being detected, he was apprehended, and by sentence of
the Councell of Warre condemned to ride the Canon, yet by some help he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
and fled to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who sent him home loaden with promises,
and rewarded with some little present for himselfe, because of his good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>The Lords on the other side who stood for the Kings authority,<note place="margin">The Lords who stood for the King, send to <hi>Sussex</hi> for supply.</note> sent to the
Earl of <hi>Sussex</hi> intreating the assistance of his forces, or some part thereof, because
of the common danger; and to move him the more, they advertised that the Earl of
<hi>Westmerland</hi> and other <hi>English</hi> Rebels were with the Lords convened at <hi>Linlithgow</hi>
in Armes, with intention, as it seemed, to work some mischief, which had need for
the good of both Realms to be prevented, which they doubted not (so the letters
bear) having his assistance to do, and to put them off the fields; whereas if supply
were not sent in time, and that matters should happen to be put to a day amongst
themselves, the issue might prove dangerous. Answer was made, that <hi>the forces
should be sent upon sufficient hostages for their surety, during their remaining in</hi> Scotland:
Withall he craved, <hi>that the</hi> English <hi>Rebels whom the Lords had in their hands, and such
others as should happen to be apprehended, might be delivered to him, as the Queens
Lieutenant, and left to her Majesties disposition.</hi> For the hastages, it was condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the chief Noblemen should deliver some of their friends to remain in
<hi>England</hi> during the abode of the <hi>English</hi> forces, and their safe return assured, the
chance and fortune of Warre only excepted, which should be common and alike
both to the <hi>Scots</hi> and them. But touching the delivery of the <hi>English</hi> Rebells, the
Lords intreated that the same might be continued unto the return of her Majesties
answer to the instructions sent by the Abbot of <hi>Dunfermlin,</hi> who was upon his
journey, and had warrant from them to satisfie her Majesty in that point. To this
the Earl consented, providing the Noblemen would give their bonds for the safe
custody of the Rebels, and the performance of that which her Majesty, and the
Ambassadour should agree unto.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The Laird of <hi>Grange,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Lethington,</hi> who as yet made a show to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
peace, laboured by their letters to keep back the <hi>English</hi> forces, offering what
satisfaction the Earl of <hi>Sussex</hi> in name of her Majesty would require. That the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50008:133"/>
Earl answered, <hi>that if the Lords of</hi> Linlithgow <hi>would disannull the Proclamation of the
Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>authority, and discharge all capitulations for aid out of</hi> France, <hi>and all
other parts beyond the Sea, remitting the present dissension to the hearing and ordering of the
Queen his Mistress, and oblieging themselves by their subscriptions to stand at her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
determination, he should stay his forces and detain them with himself, till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
new direction from her Majesty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though these answers did in no wayes please them,<note place="margin">Sir William <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

gave hopes, that after conference with the Lords at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> he should receive
all satisfaction. But he smelling their intentions, after he had received the bonds
and pledges from the Noblemen of the Kings party, sent Sir <hi>William Drury</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Berwick</hi> with a thousand foot, and three hundreth horsmen into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
How soon the Lords that were convened at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> heard of their coming,
and that the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> was in their company, they departed towards <hi>Glasgow</hi>
and besieged the Castle, purposing to raze it, lest it should be usefull to the Earl
of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who was now returned from <hi>England.</hi> But the house was so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by a few young men (they passed not 24. in all) that the siege, after it had
continued the space of five or six dayes, brake up upon the rumour of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and the <hi>English</hi> forces their approaching: The Duke of <hi>Chattellerault</hi> went
with the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> into his Countrey, the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and the rest into
the North.</p>
               <p>The Noblemen assisted with the <hi>English</hi> forces coming to <hi>Glasgow</hi> after a short
stay marched to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and laid siege to the Castle,<note place="margin">The Castle of <hi>Hamilton</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> which at the sight of the
Ordinance that was brought thither for the battery was yielded to the <hi>English</hi> by
<hi>Andrew Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Meryton</hi> Captain, upon promise to have their lives spared.
The Castle was set on fire and pitifully defaced, as also the Dukes palace within
the town of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and divers other houses in <hi>Cliddisdale.</hi> In their return to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh</hi>
they destroyed the houses and lands pertaining to the Lords <hi>Flemyn</hi> and
<hi>Levingston,</hi> with the Dukes lodging in the town of <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> the houses of <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neill
Powdowy, Peill</hi> of <hi>Levingston,</hi> and others that appertained to the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> in
that shire. This done, the <hi>English</hi> forces returned to <hi>Berwick,</hi> and were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
thither by the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> who received again the hostages that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilest these things were a doing at home, the Abbot of <hi>Dunfermlin</hi> was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

                  </note> His instructions from the Noblemen of the Kings

                     <hi>First,</hi> to shew the Queen that by the delay of her Majesties Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the cause of the Kings Mother,<note place="margin">His instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> all these commotions had been raised,
and therefore to intreat her Majesty plainly to declare her self, and take upon her
the protection of the young King. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to inform her of the difficulties
they had in electing of a Regent, and crave her opinion therein. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to shew
what a necessity there was of intreating some forces of foot and horse, till the
present troubles were pacified: and in regard of the publick burthens to request
her for moneys to maintain 300 horse, and 700. foot, which was esteemed suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for repressing the adversaries power. <hi>Lastly,</hi> concerning the Rebells of
<hi>England</hi> who were in hands, to give her Majesty assurance that they should be
safely kept, and to beseech her Highnes if she would have them delivered, that
some respect might be had to their credit, and mercy shewed so far as could stand
with her Majesties safety, and the quiet of the Realm. For the other Rebells
that were as yet in the Countrey he was desired to promise in their name all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
for their apprehension; and if it should happen them to be taken, that
they should be committed in sure custody, till her Majesties pleasure was
known.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These things proponed to the Queen she answered,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queens answer to the instructions.</note> That having heard nothing
from the Lords, since the late Regents death, and being dayly importuned by forain Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours,
she had yielded to a new hearing of the controversies betwixt them and their
Queen, and that she intended to have a meeting of the Commissioners of both parties ere
it was long; Therefore desired them to cease from using further hostility, and not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
the Election of a Regent, the delay whereof would work them no prejudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:50008:133"/>
This answer reported to the Lords did trouble them exceedingly; from the one
part they saw a necessity of accommodating themselves and their proceedings to
the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> pleasure,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> made Lieutenant of the Countrey.</note> and on the other, they did find a great hurt by the
want of a Regent: That adverse faction having thereby taken occasion to erect
another Authority, and divers of their own partakers falling back from their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
forwardness, as not knowing on whom they should depend. After long consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
this expedient was taken; That a Lieutenant should be appointed for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
time, with full authority to administrate all affairs; and notice sent to the
Queen of <hi>England</hi> of the necessity they stood in of a Regent, and that there was no
other way to keep the subjects in obedience. Choice accordingly was made of
the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> grandfather to the King, and a Commission of Lieutenandry
given him to indure to the 11. of <hi>Iuly</hi> next; at which time, the Estates were warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to meet for the election of a Regent. Letters were also directed to the Queen
of <hi>England,</hi> requesting her advice in the choice, and an answer to the other Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
moved by the Abbot of <hi>Dunfermlin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Lords that stood for the King.</note> 
                  <hi>who was put in hope that</hi> Westmerland <hi>and the other Rebells of</hi>
England <hi>entertained by the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>faction, should be delivered unto her,
had shewed her self very favourable unto them, but hearing that they were escaped,
she made answer as followes:</hi> That she did kindly accept the good will of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
testified by their seeking her advice in the choice of a Regent, being a matter of such
importance, and so nearly touching the estate of their King and Realm. That her minde
once was, they should do best to continue the election for a time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but now considering the
disorders that were raised, and possibly thereafter might arise, if some person was not pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in that charge, she did allow their resolution. And seeing the abilities of men for that
place were best known to themselves, she should be satisfied with their choice whatsoever it
was. Howbeit out of the care she had of the young King she would not dissemble her opinion,
which was that the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> her cousin, whom as she was informed, they had made
Lieutenant of the Realm, would be more carefull of his safety then any other. But in any
case desired them, not to think that in so doing she did prescribe them any choice, but left it
free to themselves to do what was fittest. Further, she desired them to rest assured, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the reports dispersed by their adversaries, that she had neither yielded, nor
would yield to the alteration of the state of their King and Government, unlesse she did see
a more just and clear reason then had yet appeared. For howbeit she condescended to hear
what the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> would say, &amp; offer as well for her own assurance, as for the good of
that Realm, (a thing w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in honor she could not refuse) yet not knowing what the same would
be, she meant not to break the order of Law and Iustice, either to the advancing or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging
of her cause. Therefore finding the Realm governed by a King, and him inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by Coronation and other solemnities requisite, as also generally received by the three
Estates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she minded not to do any act that might breed alteration in the Estate, or make a
confusion of governments. But as she had found, so to suffer the same continue, and net
permit any change therein so far as she might impede the same, except by some eminent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
she should be induced to alter her opinion. In end she desired them beware that neither by
misconceiving her good meaning towards them, nor by the insolent brags of their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
they should take any course that might hinder or weaken their cause, and make her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
for their good ineffectual.</p>

served, and made defection. The rest were pardoned, upon surety not to carry arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the present authority. This expedition ended the Regent returned to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the the Moneth of <hi>August</hi> by letters from <hi>Denmark</hi> it was advertised,<note place="margin">An Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi>
                  </note> that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Iohn Clerk</hi> who had served the King there in his warres with <hi>Sweden,</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
by the suggestion of some countreymen that laboured for <hi>Bothwels</hi> liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Whereupon Mr. <hi>Thomas Buchannan</hi> brother to Mr. <hi>George Buchannan</hi> the
Kings Tutor, was sent in Ambassage to <hi>Denmark,</hi> to require that <hi>Bothwel</hi> might be
delivered and sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the effect justice might be done upon him, or
then that he might be judged there, for the detestable murther committed upon the
person of the Kings father, and receive his due punishment. This had before
that time been often desired, but was delayed by divers occasions; and now the
report of <hi>Bothwels</hi> greater liberty and that he had been permitted to accuse colonel
<hi>Clerk,</hi> a Gentleman well esteemed, &amp; of good reputation for his service done both at
home and in parts abroad; the Regent and Councel took occasion to put that King
in remembrance of their former requests; and if any doubt was made in those parts
of <hi>Bothwels</hi> guiltiness, they offered to clear the same by evident probation; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
intreated him by the communion of blood and nigh kindred betwixt him
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50008:134"/>
and the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he would not suffer such a nefarious person to escape.
In the same letters they requested, that the Colonel might be set at liberty, and
restored to the Kings wonted favour, or then be licenced to return into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
where there was present use for his service. This Ambassage was not without
fruit, and put <hi>Bothwel</hi> out of all credit, so as desperate of liberty, he turned mad,
and ended his wicked life some years after, (as before was touched) most miserably.</p>
               <p>All things now went ill with the Queens saction,<note place="margin">An Abstinence agreed unto.</note> neither saw they a way to subsist,
but by labouring an Abstinence, which the Secretary earnestly went about, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
so farre with the two Liegers of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> as they brought the Queen
of <hi>England</hi> to a new Treaty with the <hi>Scots</hi> Queen, and to hearken unto some over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which she did make both for the Queens assurance, and for the setling of
a perfect peace betwixt her and her son, and those that stood in his obedience.
This moved the Regent, he did greatly oppose it; yet the Queen of <hi>England</hi> would
needs have him agree to the Abstinence for the space of two moneths, in which it
was thought the Treaty should take an end. Great dispute there was about the
tenour and form of the Abstinence, which at last was accorded in these terms.
<q>That the Regent should oblige himself and his partakers to cease from Arms,
and not to molest any that pretended obedience to the Kings mother, during
the space of two moneths, which should be understood to begin the third day of
<hi>September,</hi> providing that no innovation should be made in the government,
and all things continue in the same estate wherein they were at the death of the
late Regent: As also that the ordinary administration of the Law and Justice
in Parliament, Session, and other Courts, with the punishment of thieves and
trespassers, might proceed in the mean time by law or force in the Kings name,
and under his authority, without any opposition.</q> This granted, by a second
letter the Queen of <hi>England</hi> signified,<note place="margin">A Treaty with the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <q>That she had appointed Sir <hi>William Cecill</hi>
her principal Secretary, and Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay</hi> Chancellour of the Exchequer,
to repair to the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and learn what offers she would make for her
Majesties surety, and the not disturbing the Realms, if she should be put to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
In which treaty she minded not to neglect the surety of the young King,
and the estate of the Nobility adhering to him, whereof she would be no lesse
careful, then of what concerned her self most. But in regard that treaty could
take no good effect, if the Regent and the Nobility on his side should do any thing
to the prejudice of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> and her party, she desired that no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be kept during the time of the treaty; or if it had taken beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the receipt of the letter, that nothing should passe therein, which might give
her cause to complain. And for the Abstinence taken unto the third of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
seeing there was no likelihood, the treaty should take an end in so short a
time, he was further desired to prorogue the same for other two moneths.</q>
The letter dated at <hi>Windsor</hi> the seventh of <hi>October,</hi> was brought to the Regent the
thirteenth, some two days after the Parliament was begun.</p>
               <p>This treaty did much perplex the Regent, for albeit he was advertised before,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  </note> of
the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> condescending to hear what the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen would say
in her own cause, yet he did not expect any such suddain dealing, or that it should
have begun without his knowledge. But making the best construction of all
things, he answered, <hi>That the Parliament had taken a beginning before her Majesties
letters came to his hand, and for the reverence he did carry to her, he had abstained from
all proceeding in any matters, only his office of Regiment was confirmed, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
adjourned unto the moneth of</hi> January, <hi>before which time he hoped the fruit of
that treaty would appear.</hi> For the prorogation of the Abstinence, <hi>he had declared
at the first how hurtful the same was to the King his affairs, and that there was no true
meaning in the adverse party, ad did manifestly appear by the arresting of the ships, and
goods of the Scottish Merchants, professing the King his obedience, in the Kingdome of</hi>
France, <hi>and other divers insolencies practised at home, since the granting thereof. That
howsoever he was perswaded, her Majesty had not a mind under colour of the Abstinence
to ruine the young King, and those that stood in defence of his authority, yet they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
more hurt thereby then they could have done, if open hostility had been professed.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50008:135"/>
Therefore he desired that before he was urged with a further cessation, the ships and goods
stayed in</hi> France, <hi>might be set free, the injuries committed at home repaired, and all things
innovated in the Government since the late Regents death, disannulled by Proclamation:
which things performed, he should willingly obey her Majesties desire.</hi> Upon this last
part of the letter, many debates arose amongst the parties, and divers particulars
on either side were exhibited in writing to the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> for verifying a breach
of the Abstinence against others. That which I find most insisted upon, was the
denouncing of Secretary <hi>Lethington</hi> Rebell,<note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and loses his office.</note> who being cited to appear at a certain
day before the Regent and Councel, was for his contumacy sentenced to lose his
office, and have his goods consiscated. The Regent challenged of this point made
answer, <hi>That the Secretary could claim no benefit by the Abstinence, seeing he was the
Kings subject, and stood to the defence of the Kings cause, both in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland,
<hi>professing himself as much displeased with the Proclamation of the Queens authority, as
any man else. And howbeit of late he had accompanied the contrary faction, yet he never
declined his subjection to the King. That being required to attend his office he had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
whereupon the same was justly taken from him; and for the confiscation complained,
if he would yet declare on what side he was, he should be reasonably used.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Secretary who had often changed his party,<note place="margin">The Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</note> finding that now he must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himself on the one side, or the other, sent to the Earl of <hi>Sussex</hi> this answer,
<q>That he did think it strange the Regent should enquire on which side he was,
seeing his speeches, writings and actions had declared the same. Always now
he would plainly professe, that he was not of the Lord Regents side, nor would
he acknowledge him for Regent. That he was of that side, which would perform
their duties to the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to her son, so as neither of them should
have cause to find fault with him that he was of that side which wished to either
of them the place, which in reason and justice they ought to possesse; and that he
was of that side which requested the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to enter into good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with the Queen, whereby <hi>Scotland</hi> might be brought in an union, and she
restored to her liberty and Realm. He confessed, that he did not allow of the
proclaiming of the Queens authority, nor of the Parliament indited by those of
he part, because he foresaw the same would impede the Treaty betwixt the two
Queens, and might do hurt many ways, and hinder the good he was about to do.
But that would not inser an allowance of their doings. And this, <hi>he said</hi> might
give the Regent to understand on what side he was.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This answer neither expressing a reason of his falling away from the Kings obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
nor discovering plainly, as was desired, of what side he should be esteemed,
being delivered to the Regent, received this reply;<note place="margin">The Regents Reply.</note> 
                  <q>That it was no marvel, he
should not acknowledge him for Regent, having deserved so ill at his hands, and
being attainted of the soul and cruel murther of his son, the Kings father. That
his Declaration did not satisfy that which was demanded: for where he made a
shew to observe a duty both to the Queen and to her son, and would have it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that he was about the effecting of great matters; the duties he had done to
either of them were well enough known, neither could any man look for
any good to proceed from him. Therefore howsoever he had against his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and subscription declined from the Kings party, he must still be subject
to answer such particulars as should be laid against him in the Kings name. And
seeing it was neither her Majesties meaning, that any person guilty of the Kings
murther should enjoy benefit by the Abstinence, he that was challenged thereof
in the late Regents time, and had in Councel offered himself to the severest trial
that could be taken could not complain of the breach of Abstinence, for any thing
done, or intended against him. But that neither this particular, nor any other
should be an occasion to dissolove that Treaty begun, he said, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the notes of all injuries alledged on either side should be delivered in writing
to the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> and the trial or redresse thereof continued, till it should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
what effect the Treaty brought forth.</q> The prorogation of the Abstinence
in the mean time, as was desired by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> was yielded unto, and
subscrived the fourth of <hi>November</hi> with this provision, <hi>That the goods and the ships
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50008:135"/>
of the Scottish Merchants arrested at that time in</hi> France <hi>should be released, and
no stay made of such as should happen to repair thither, during the time of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence.</hi>

                     </item>
                     <item>5. That she should not joyn in marriage with any <hi>English</hi> man without the

               </p>
               <p>Now albeit divers of these Articles were misliked by the Lords of her faction,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>William Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> his letters to the Regent.</note>
yet conceiving thereby some hope of her restitution, they dispersed certain copies in
the countrey, to encourage those that professed her obedience, holding back such of
the Articles as seemed most hard, trusting to obtain a mitigation thereof in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
And she indeed, I mean the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen, shewed her self pleased withall,
onely she remitted the full answer to her Commissioners that should come from
<hi>Scotland.</hi> The rumour of the Accord held good a few days, and amused the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and other Noblemen not a little, till a letter directed by Sir <hi>William Cecil</hi>
from <hi>Chattesworth</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> where the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> then lay, did otherwise
inform, which was to this effect: <q>That he was put upon that imployment much
against his heart, and yet had not dealt therein but with a great regard of the safety
of the young King and whole Estate: And that all he had done touching <hi>Scottish</hi>
affairs, was under protestation, that it should be in the power of those whom the
Queen and Regent should send in Commission, to change, diminish or augment
the Articles at their pleasures. Therefore did he advise the Regent, to send a
Nobleman with some other well learned and practised in the affairs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
to deal in these matters; taking care, that the persons he choosed were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and firm, and such as would not be wonne from him, nor from the cause.</q>
This Letter of the date the thirteenth of <hi>October,</hi> 1570. written in so friendly and
familiar a manner (for therein he named some whom the Regent had lately imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
of whom he willed him to beware) gave him to understand, that matters were
not so farre gone, as his adversary did bragge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:50008:136"/>
After a few dayes the Earl of <hi>Sussex</hi> advertised the Regent <q>that the Lords of
the other faction had made choice of certain Commissioners to attend the treaty
begun betwixt their Queen and the Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Sussex</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement to the Regent.</note> desiring that no trouble
nor molestation should be made to them and their train in that journey; as also
to send some speciall persons instructed with Commission from the King, and the
Nobility of his side, to give their best advice for the surety of the King and his
dependants, if matters should happen to be accorded. And if it fell out otherwise,
to consider what should be the most sure course for continuance of amity betwixt
the two Realms, the preservation of the young King, the reducing of the subjects
to his obedience, and the defence of the Isle against forain invasions. These Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
he desired to be sent with expedition, for that her Majesty longed to
have an end of the business, and could not grow to any resolution, till she had
conferred with them, and understood their minds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This he did by direction from the Queen his Mistris as he wrote,<note place="margin">His particular advice.</note> howbeit he
himself had thought of some particulars that he held convenient to be thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but for the Kings security, and theirs, if his mother should be set at liberty,
wherein he prayed him familiarly to shew what was his opinion. As first, <hi>if she
should happen to be restored to her Crown, and the King to be made to dimit the authority,
it might be upon condition that in case of her death, or the breach of the present agreement,
he might reenter to the kingdome without any Solemnities to be used.</hi> Next, <hi>that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of both parties might be provided to her by the Queen of</hi> England <hi>for avoyding all
sorts of practises.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that the young King should be educated in the Realm of</hi>
England <hi>under the custody of such persons, as the Nobility of his party should appoint,
which would be the greatest sure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y for those that depended on him, and tie his mother to the
performance of the Articles.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>that a new Act of Parliament should be made for
the establishing of true Religion, and oblivion of all injuries committed on either side.</hi>
Fifthly, <hi>that the Queen should give some principall men of her side Hostages to remain
in</hi> England <hi>for fulfilling the heads of the agreement.</hi> Lastly, <hi>he advised the Regent to
send with the Commissioners that should be imployed in that errand a writing signed and
scaled by all the Noblemen of the Kings party, to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w who they were that stood on that side.
Because besides the credit it would bring to the cause, the same would be to good purpose,
howsoever matters went. For if the Treaty should break off, it would be seen who would
maintain and defend the King; Or if otherwise an accord were made, it would be known
for what persons the Queen of</hi> England <hi>was to provide a surety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether these Propositions were made (as he gave out) of his own head,<note place="margin">The Regents answer.</note> or
which would rather appear, that he was set on by the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to try the
Regent and Nobilities mind, he answered very advisedly, and beginning at the
last, he said, <q>That he held his opinion good touching the sealing of a writing by
the Nobility of the Kings party, whose number would not be found so great as
he wished, because there were divers Neuters that adhered to no side, and many
that desired to keep things loose, some for impunity of crimes whereof they
were suspected, and others hoping to better their condition in an unquiet time;
yet he trusted to obtain the subscriptions of a sufficient number who had sincerely
continued in the profession of true Religion and his Majesties obedience, and
from their hearts abhorred the murtherers of the King his sonne, and the late
Regent. For the other points he said, that he could not give his private opinion
in matters so important, by reason of his oath made at the acceptation of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to have no dealing in matters of that kind without the knowledge of
the Nobility and Councell. And touching the Commissioners which the
Queen required to be sent, there should be diligence used therein, how soon they
understood of what quality the others were, that the Lords of the Queens party
did choose. Neither should any molestation be made to them in their journy, so as
their names, the number of their train, and the way they minded to take were
notified; For otherwise as he said, the King and Estate might receive hurt, and
some that were culpable of those odious murthers steal away privately in their
company. Mean while he shewed, that till Commissioners might be chosen by
the advice of the Noblemen then absent, the Councell had appointed the Abbot
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50008:136"/>
of <hi>Dunfermlin</hi> Ambassadour to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and given him such instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
as they held needfull for the time, by whom she should be more fully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
of their minds in all matters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>About the midst of <hi>November</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Dunfermlin</hi> (then made Secretary)
went into <hi>England.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Abbot of <hi>Dunfermlin</hi> made Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> He was desired to shew the Queen <q>How it was the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of all the good subjects in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that she would never forget the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
care she had professed to have of the innocent person of their young King;
nor yet be unmindfull of the Noblemen and others professing his obedience, who
had studied to maintain peace betwixt the two Realms ever since her Majesties
entry to the Crown; and that they being required as well by letters from her
Lieutenant in the North, as by her Ambassadour resident amongst them, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
some speciall persons towards her for communicating such things as they
thought requisite for the surely of their King and themselves, although they had
resolved upon a number sufficient for that Legation, yet they deferred to send
away till they should understand who were nominated for the Lords of the other
party, to the end they might equall them in birth and quality; That in the
mean time lest they should be thought more negligent then became them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of such importance, they had laid upon him the charge, to come and signifie to
her Majesty the opinion that was held in <hi>Scotland</hi> of the Articles framed at <hi>Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesworth,</hi>
which the adversaries gave out to have been craved by her Majesty, and
esteemed a sufficient security for the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi> And if he did find her
Majesty inclining thereto, then to remember her with what a person she had to
do; a Princess by birth, in Religion Popish, one that professed her self a captive, and
as joyned with an husband, (suppose in a most unlawfull conjunction) and that any
one of these would serve for a colour to undo whatsoever thing she agreed unto at
the present; for her Majesty could not be ignorant, how after her escape out of
<hi>Lochleven,</hi> she revoked the dimission of the Crown, made in favours of her son,
(though the same was done for good respects) upon a pretext of fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and that
she did the same being a Captive. As likewise she knew the Papists Maxime of
not keeping faith to Hereticks, which would serve her for a subterfuge to break
all Covenants when she saw her time; and that to dimit her upon any surety,
would prove no less dangerous to her Majesties own estate then to <hi>Scotland,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the claim she had made in former times to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and
the attempts of her Rebels at home, not yet well extinct, upon the same grounds.
In regard whereof there was nothing could assure the quiet of both Realmes in

dishonourable, the just causes and occasions being published and made manifest
to the world. As to the power of forain Princes whereof they boasted, the
same was not much to be feared, so long as her person was kept sure; And if war
for that cause should be denounced, the perill should be less, then if she were set
at liberty, and restored to the Crown; for so she should have her forces and
friendship ready to joyne with other Princes in all their quarrells, against which
no Hostages could serve for assurance.</q>

them, and reasoned thereupon with her Councell, returned this Answer, <hi>That she

men of credit to be directed unto</hi> England, <hi>that an end might be put to that business; for
as to the restitution of the Queen, seeing it appeared they had reason to oppose it, she would
not have the Regent or those of his party to think that she intended to wrong them in any
sort; for if they should make it appear that nothing was done by them but according to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
she would side with them and maintain their quarrell. And otherwise if they were not
able to justifie their cause by such evident reasons as might satisfie her Majesty in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and make her answer the world in honour, she would nevertheless for that naturall
love she bare to the King her near kinsman, and the good will she carried to the Noblemen

a great part of the time appointed in the last prorogation of the Abstinence was already
spent, she desired the same to be prorogated unto March next, and would desire them to
agree thereto, in regard they that stood for the Queen had condescended to the same, and as
much more time as she should think fitting.</hi> This answer of the date at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court

the town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> about the same time. One of his servants called <hi>Iames Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
being imprisoned by the Magistrates for a slaughter committed by his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he in the evening whilest all men were at supper, made the Garrison of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to issue forth, and break open the prison doors, playing all the while upon the
town with the Canon, to tertifie the inhabitants from making resistance. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to appear and presently brake out in open rebellion, fortifying the Castle, and
conducing a number of souldiers, who did afterwards greatly annoy the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</p>
               <p>The Nobility notwithstanding did keep the meeting, and made choice of the

to <hi>May</hi> thereafter. How soon these Commissioners were come to <hi>London,</hi>
The Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> and <hi>Sussex,</hi> the Lord Keeper, the Chamberlain, Sir <hi>William
Cecill</hi> Secretary (then made Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi>) Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis
Knolls</hi> were appointed to confer with them; These meeting in the Secretaries
chamber at Court, after salutations and some generall speeches, the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi>
said, <q>That they were desired to come into <hi>England</hi> upon occasion of a Treaty begun
betwixt the two Queens, and that her Majesty did now expect to receive from
them such evident reasons for their proceedings against their Queen as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
she might both satisfie her self, and with honour answer to the world for
that which she did: Or if they could not be able so to do, that matters might be
composed in the best sort for their safeties, which her Majesty would by all means
procure.</q> The Commissioners answered, that <hi>they had before that time impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the truth of all things to her Majesty, which they thought might satisfie to clear them
from the crimes objected; yet if she stood doubtfull in any point, the same should be cleared,
and their doings justified by most evident reasons.</hi> Nothing further was said at that
time, but all continued to the next day. And then having again met, the Earl of
<hi>Morton</hi> made a long discourse of the reasons and grounds of their proceedings, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
the objections which he thought could be made against what he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
His discourse ended, they were desired to put their reasons in writing, which
was with some difficulty yielded unto, and under condition, that <hi>if the reasons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
by them did not content her Majesty, the writing should be redelivered, and no Copy
taken thereof; Otherwise, if her Majesty did like and allow them, they were content the
same should be put in Record, if so it pleased her Higness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last of <hi>February</hi> (for albeit the 20. of that moneth they came to <hi>London</hi>)
they presented a number of Reasons for justifying the deposition of their Queen,<note place="margin">Reasons justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Queen of Scots deposition.</note>
and cited many Lawes both Civill, Canon, and Municipall, which they backt
with examples drawn forth of <hi>Scottish</hi> Histories, and with the opinions of divers
famous Divines. The Queen of <hi>England</hi> having considered their reasons, was not a
little displeased both with the bitter speeches, and with the liberty they had used in
depressing the authority of Princes, and thereupon told them, <q>That she was in
no sort satisfied with their reasons, willing them to go unto the second head, and
devise what they thought meetest for the safety of their King and themselves. <hi>But
said, they refusing,</hi> that they had no Commission to speak of any thing that might
derogate from the Kings authority; and if such a Commission had been given
them, they would not have accepted it.</q>

In these terms matters continued some days till the Commissioners for the King
of <hi>Scots</hi> suting to be dimitted, were sent for to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where the Queen had a long
speech tending all to declare what a good will she had carried to the young King,
and to those that professed his obedience, and wondering they should be so wilful,
and not to deliberate of such things as served to their own safety. The Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
answering, that they believed the reasons produced would have satisfied her
Majesty touching their proceedings, which (as they esteemed) were sufficient to
prove, that they had done nothing but according to justice: <hi>Yet I</hi> (saith the Queen)
<hi>am not satisfied neither with your reasons, nor lawes, nor examples; nor am I ignorant of
the lawes my self, having spent divers years in the study thereof. If ye your selves will
not</hi> (saith she) <hi>propone any thing for your own sureties, yet I would have you hear what
my Councel is able to say in that matter, and I hope it shall content you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They answered, that <hi>their respect to her Majesty was greater, then to refuse any good
advice which she and her good Councel should give them, but that they had no power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to any thing that might inferre an alteration of the present state, or diminish the
Kings authority.</hi>

               <p>The next day the Articles following were given them,<note place="margin">Articles propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> and they desired to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the same, and set down their Answer in writing.</p>
               <p>1. That in regard her son had been crowned King by vertue of her dimission,
and his Coronation ratified by the three Estates of Parliament, and that since that
time a great number of the subjects had professed obedience to him, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
which was to be interpreted in the best part, as done out of duty, and not out
of any ill mind towards their Queen, the obedience so yielded to the King and his
Regents, should be allowed from the time of the dimission of the Crown made by
her, unto the resumption of the same: And all manner of Acts done since that time
in the administration of justice, and for government of the State, should be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
good and lawful, or at least reviewed, and confirmed in the next Parliament
after consideration taken of the same by twelve Lords, whereof six should be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the Queen and her Commissioners, and the other six by the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for the Kings part.</p>
               <p>2. That all Statutes and Ordinances made concerning matters of Religion, and
the Ministers thereof, since the same time, should be observed by all the subjects of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and no pardon nor dispensation granted in time coming to any person
not observing the same, without consent of the said twelve Lords.</p>
               <p>3. That all Processes, Sentences, and Judgements given either in causes civil
or criminal since the said time, wherein the order of the laws of the Realm had
been observed, should remain in force, and only such sentences as had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
either in the name of the King or Queen against any person for not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or acknowledging either of their Titles, be rescinded; the sentences alwayes
pronounced against the Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> or any others, for the murther of the
Queens husband, standing good and valid.</p>
               <p>4. That all Ecclesiastical benefices and temporal offices, which have usually
continued in the person of any during term of life, should remain with the same
persons that held them at the time of the Queens dimission; such excepted, as may
be proved to have consented to the murther of her husband, or that have left them
upon recompence, and with their own consents: In which cases the present pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors
should enjoy the same, unlesse they were uncapable, and declared by the
twelve Lords to be such.</p>
               <p>5. That all strengths, Castles, and houses appertaining to the Crown should
be restored to the possession of those who held them at the time of the Queens
dimission, except they had parted therewith upon agreement. In which case the
Queen with consent of the said twelve Lords, or the most part of the Councel
should dispose thereof.</p>
               <p>6. That the Jewels, Plate, Moveables, and implements of houses belonging
to the Queen at the time of her dimission, should be restored, provided the moneys
which any had laid out for the same, were repayed: And for such as had
been put away by the direction of the Regents, or Councel, that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50008:138"/>
should be made by the Queen to the party according to the just value.</p>
               <p>7. That a law should be established in Parliament for oblivion and remission of
all things done since that time, after the same manner that was done in the year
1563. providing not the lesse, that the Comptroller, Thesaurer, and other recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Crown revenues, should give an accompt to the Queen of all summes
of money or other profits which had not been expended <hi>bona fide,</hi> for the affairs of
the Realm, or by order and warrant from the Regent, and others trusted with those
affairs; Neither should the remission be extended to any that had taken by force
any houses, Castles, lands, or heritages belonging to others, but restitution should
be made thereof to the party dispossessed, or to his heirs, till the same by order of
law be justly determined. In like manner concerning goods moveable taken away
from the Owners against their wills, and being yet in their own nature extant, that
restitution should be made thereof. And because many doubts might arise upon this
Article, the same should be determined by the foresaid twelve Lords, or otherwise
as was devised for the execution of the Act made <hi>Anno</hi> 1563.</p>
               <p>8. That for the more quiet government of the Realm, there should be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Privy Councel, which should consist of twelve Lords spiritual and temporal,
besides the other ordinary officers that do usually attend. And that the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
should be established with the like provisions that were made at the return of the
Queen out of <hi>France, Anno</hi> 1561. So many as were then Counsellors, and yet
alive, being counted of that number; and that the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> because he was
most bound by nature to take care of the King, should be one of the Councel, and
have place therein according to his degree.</p>
               <p>9. That for the greater safety of the Kings person, he should be brought into the
Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and there governed by such Noblemen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as depend
of him, so as he may be ever ready to be restored to the Crown, if the Queen his
Mother break the Covenants agreed betwixt her and the Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. That for his entertainment he should not only have the revenues which the
Princes of <hi>Scotland</hi> in former times possessed, but also the Rents and Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
sometime to the Earl of <hi>Bothwel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. And last, that a convenient number of Hostages, being all Noblemen, and
of those who have adhered to the Queen, and solicited her delivery, should enter in
<hi>England</hi> to remain there for assurance of observing the conditions made both to the
King of <hi>Scots</hi> and the subjects under his obedience, and to the Queen of <hi>England</hi>
for the peace and quiet of her dominions; And that the said Hostages should be
entered in <hi>England</hi> before the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> shall be put to liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These Articles delivered to them were answered the next day, as followeth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answer to the foresaid Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note>
We have seen and considered the note of the Heads which we received from your Lordships
for pacifying the controversies between the Queen our Soveraigns mother, and the King
her Son, and his Subjects, touching the Title of the Crown of Scotland, if it be found, that
her dimission either was, or may be lawfully revoked by her; And therewithall having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
perused our Commission and Instructions to know how far we might enter in
Treaty upon the same Heads for satisfaction of the Queens Majesty, and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
to whom the hearing of the cause is committed; We find our selves no ways able, nor
sufficiently authorised to enter into any treaty or conference touching the King our Soveraign
his Crown, the abdication or diminution of the same, or yet the removing of his person from
the place where he abideth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as we confesse our selves his Highnesse subjects, and have all
our power and Commission from him, to treat in his name, in matters tending to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of true Religion, his honour and estate, and for the continuance of amity betwixt
the two Realms: So we cannot presume to abuse our Commission in any thing that may
prejudge him, wherein we trust your Lordships shall allow and approve us.</p>
               <p>At the same time,<note place="margin">Propositions made to the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> some others were appointed to conferre with those of his Mothers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
And to them it was proposed, that for the security of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
and the Noblemen that followed the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Chatteller ault,</hi>
with the Earls of <hi>Huntley, Argile,</hi> the Lord <hi>Home,</hi> and any other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
they pleased to name, should be delivered as pledges, and the Castles of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50008:138"/>
                  <hi>Dumbar,</hi> and <hi>Home,</hi> be put in the hands of <hi>English</hi> men, to be kept for three
years. The answer they gave, was, that she who of her own motive committed
her self to the protection of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Answer.</note> would most willingly give her
satisfaction in all things which conveniently might be done; but to deliver those
great men, and the Fortresses required, was no other thing but to spoil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
the distressed Queen of the succour of her most faithful friends, and the
strength of those places; yet if in all other points they did agree, they made offer,
that two Earls (one whereof should be of the number nominated) and two Lords
should enter as Hostages, and remain in <hi>England</hi> for the space of two years; but for
the Holds and Castles, they could not, because of the League with <hi>France,</hi> put
them in the hands of <hi>English</hi> men, unlesse others were put also in the hands of the
<hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queen of <hi>England</hi> perceiving that there were on both sides great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
sent for the Kings Commissioners,<note place="margin">The Treaty continued to a more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time.</note> and told them, how she had considered,
that the Articles proponed, could not be resolved but in a Parliament, and therefore
leaving the Treaty for a time, seeing she understood there was a meeting of the
Estates appointed in <hi>May</hi> next, she held it meetest they should return, and in that
meeting condescend upon an equal number of both parties, that should have power
to compose matters; The Abstinence in the mean time being renewed, in hope
that all differences should be taken away, and matters peaceably agreed. This she
would cause signify to the Agents of their Queen, and doubted not, but they
would assent thereto; yet when it was moved unto them, they refused to agree
to any delay, till they should know what was her own mind. Hereupon the Kings
Commissioners were commanded to stay till her Answer should be returned.</p>
               <p>In this time the Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> and the Lord <hi>Levingston</hi> trusting to speed
better by conference with the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> and the Lord <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingston,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with the Earl of Morton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and the rest. sent to desire a meeting
of them, which was yielded unto, provided the Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> came not in their
company; for him they would not admit, as being the Kings Rebel. Having
met, they talked kindly one to another. But that the Queen should be restored to
her authority, in no condition (though divers were proponed) could be admitted;
which when she heard, and that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> had taken a course to delay
things, she grew into a great choler, and inhibited her Commissioners to treat any
more. This reported to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> she sent for the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>
and his Associates, and told him, that their Queen took in evil part the motion she
had made; And <hi>seeing it is so,</hi> saith she, <hi>I will not detain you longer, ye shall go home,
and if afterwards she be brought to agree to this course, as I hope she shall, I have no doubt
but you will for your parts do that which is fitting.</hi> Thus were they dimitted.</p>
               <p>Whilest these things were doing in <hi>England,</hi> the factions at home, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the Abstinence, were not idle, but taking their advantage of others.

that the Castle of <hi>Dunbarton</hi> was negligently kept, and might easily be

<hi>Home,</hi> and Captain <hi>Ramsey</hi> to give the attempt; Ladders and other necessaries
for scaling being prepared, they went thither in the night, conducted by a fellow
that had served in the house, and as then had quit his service upon a private dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.
A little before day carrying the ladders with the least noise they could
make, they placed the same in the most commodious part for ascent, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of sundry difficulties that happened, got up in the end to the top of the
Rock: There having a wall of stone likewise to climbe, Captain <hi>Alexander Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi>
by a ladder which they drew up after them, was the first that entered, and for a
short space defended himself against three watchmen that assailed him. <hi>Crawford</hi>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50008:139"/>
tumult, fled to the neather <hi>Balze</hi> (so they call the part by which they descend to
the river) and escaped in a little Boat. The souldiers and other servants yielding,
were spared, and freely dimitted. Within the Castle were the Archbishop of
S. <hi>Andrews, Monsieur Veras</hi> the <hi>French</hi> man, the Lady <hi>Fleming, Iohn Fleming</hi> of
<hi>Boghall, Alexander Levingston,</hi> sonne to the Lord <hi>Levingston,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Hall</hi> an
<hi>English</hi> man, who were all made prisoners. The next morning the Regent came
thither, (for he was lying at <hi>Glasgow</hi>) and using the Lady honourably, suffered
her to depart with her plate, jewels, and all that appertained either to her or to
her husband. <hi>Veras</hi> was sent to be kept at S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and permitted afterwards
to depart. The <hi>English</hi> man <hi>Hall</hi> was delivered to the Marshal of <hi>Berwick. Bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi>

His death, especially for the manner of it, did greatly incense his friends, and disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of divers, who wished a greater respect to have been carried to his age and place.
But the suspicion of his guiltinesse in the murthers of the King and Regent, made
him of the common sort lesse regrated. It is said, that being questioned of the
Regents murther, he answered, <hi>That he might have stayed the same, and was sorry he
did it not.</hi> But when he was charged with the Kings death, he denied the same. Yet a
Priest called <hi>Thomas Robinson</hi> that was brought before him, affirmed that one <hi>Iohn
Hamilton</hi> (commonly called <hi>Black Iohn</hi>) had confessed to him on his death-bed,
that he was present by his direction at the murther. Whereunto he replied, <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Priest, he ought not to reveale Confessions; and that no mans Confession could make
him guilty.</hi> But for none of those points was he condemned, nor the ordinary form of

under command, did plant in the steeple of S. <hi>Giles</hi> some souldiers, and transport all
the Armour and Munition which was kept in the Town-house to the Castle; After
a few days the Duke of <hi>Chattellerault,</hi> came thither, with the Earls of <hi>Argile</hi> and
<hi>Huntley,</hi> the Lords <hi>Hereis, Boyd</hi> and divers others, to stay the holding of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which had been adjourned to the fourteenth of <hi>May.</hi> At their coming they
compelled the Clerks and Keepers of the Register to deliver the books of Councel
and Parliament, and seised on every thing, which they thought might hinder the
States to convene. The Ministers were commanded in their publick prayers to
make mention of the Queen their Soveraign Princesse; which they resused. <hi>Iohn
Knox</hi> withdrew himself, and retired to S. <hi>Andrews, Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi>
preaching in his place.</p>
               <p>The Regent on the other side with the Nobility that adhered to the King,<note place="margin">The Regent resolveth to hold the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</note> came
into <hi>Leth</hi> with a resolution to hold the Parliament, whatsoever should follow; and
because it would be a difficil work to recover the town, conclusion was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to keep the Parliament in that part of the Canon gate which is subject
to the townes jurisdiction: the Lawyers having resolved, that in what part
soever of the towne the Estates should convene, their meeting would be
found lawful. Thus on Munday the fourteenth of <hi>May,</hi> which was the Diet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
the Parliament according to the custome was fenced in a house with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the gates, yet within the liberties of the town. The Saterday preceding the
Regent had by advice of the Councel sent some men of warre to possesse that
part of the town, who were assisted by certain Noblemen voluntiers that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the service. And notwithstanding the continual playing of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
upon that part from the Castle, both that day and all the time the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
sate, not a man (a thing most strange) of the Regents side was either

hurt or killed,<note place="margin">An. 1571.</note> there were cited to the Parliament young <hi>Lethington,</hi> his brother
Mr. <hi>Iohn Maitland,</hi> Prior of <hi>Coldingham, Gawan Hamilton,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Kilwining,</hi>
with his eldest son, and a base son of the late Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Persons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited in this Parliament.</note> who were
all declared culpable of treason. Young <hi>Lethington</hi> because of his foreknowledge
and counsel given to King <hi>Henry</hi> his murther, the rest for their rebellion against
the King and his Regents. As in such a troubled time the Parliament was very
frequent, for of the Nobility were present, the Earls of <hi>Morton, Marre, Glencarn,
Crawford,</hi> (who some moneths before had forsaken the Queens faction, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
himself to the King) <hi>Buchan</hi> and <hi>Menteith,</hi> the Lord <hi>Keith</hi> and <hi>Graham,</hi> as
proxies for their Fathers; the Earls of <hi>Marshal</hi> and <hi>Montrosse,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Linde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,
Ruthven, Glamis, Zeister, Methven, Ochiltrie, Cathcart,</hi> two Bishops, nine Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots
and Priors, with twenty Commissioners of Burghs. The forfeiture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
the Estates took counsel to dissolve, because the danger was great, and
prorogued the Parliament to the third of <hi>August,</hi> appointing the same to meet at
<hi>Striveling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A new Civil warre did then break up,<note place="margin">The civil war renewed.</note> which kept the Realm in trouble the
space of two years very nigh, and was exherced with great enmity on all sides.
You should have seen fathers against their sons, sons against their fathers, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fighting against brother, nigh kinsmen and others allied together, as enemies
seeking one the destruction of another. Every man as his affection led him, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the one or other party, one professing to be the Kings men, another the
Queens. The very young ones scarce taught to speak had these words in their
mouthes, and were sometimes observed to divide and have their childish conflicts
in that quarrel. But the condition of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was of all parts of the countrey
the most distressed, they that were of quiet disposition and greatest substance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced to forsake their houses; which were partly by the souldiers, partly by
other necessitous people, (who made their profit of the present calamities) rifled
and abused. The nineteenth day of <hi>May</hi> the Regent and other Noblemen lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Canon gate, went to <hi>Leth,</hi> and the next day in the afternoon took their
journey towards <hi>Striveling,</hi> where the ordinary Judges of Session were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to sit for ministring justice to the Leiges. As they were taking horse,<note place="margin">The Regent goeth to Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> the
forces within <hi>Edinburgh</hi> issued forth making shew to sight, yet still they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under guard of the Castle. The Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> parting from the Regent at
<hi>Corstorphin,</hi> had the foot souldiers left with him to withstand the enemy, if he
should make any suddain attempt. Nor did there many days passe when the Earl
of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and Lord <hi>Claud Hamilton</hi> with their forces enterprised the burning of
<hi>Dalkeith. Morton,</hi> who remained there, being forewarned of their coming,<note place="margin">A conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Morton</hi> and the Lords at Edinburgh.</note> took
the fields, and entertained a long fight with them, though in number he was far
inferiour; divers on either side were killed, 25. of the Earl of <hi>Mortons</hi> men taken
prisoners, and of the adverse party Captain <hi>Hackerston.</hi> Neither had the conflict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
so soon, if they had not been separated by an accident that happened in the
time. The Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> and Lord <hi>Claud</hi> had carried with them a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of powder, wherewith the souldiers striving to furnish themselves, and one of
the matches falling amongst the powder, it took fire, and with a terrible noise
overthrew all that stood by, Captain <hi>Iames Melvil</hi> and number of his company
were thereby killed in the place, many died a few days after of the hurt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at that time.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> by this invasion being taught to look unto himself, did hire

(who a few days before was come from <hi>France</hi> with a supply of money and Arms)
and Capt. <hi>Cullen</hi> a man well skilled in sea affairs, to lie in wait for their landing. But
the purpose being detected to the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> he came upon them at <hi>Leth</hi> as they
were taking Boat, so unexpected, as 16. of the number were taken prisoners, which
served to redeem certain of Captain <hi>Weymes</hi> company, that were the next day taken
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50008:140"/>
at sea, for he himself with the greatest part arrived safely at <hi>Leth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Regent having advertised the Queen of <hi>England</hi> of those troubles, and by
the common danger of both the Realms,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>England</hi> send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Drury,</hi> to try the estate of things.</note> intreated that she should no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
a neuter, she sent Sir <hi>William Drury</hi> Marshal of <hi>Berwick</hi> to try the estate of
things, the power that the Regent had, and the means whereby the Castle
of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> might be recovered; and perceiving by the information returned,
that without her assistance neither could that strength be regained, nor the waged
souldiers be kept long together; because as yet she held it not fit to declare her self
for the King, she began of new to treat with both parties for a surceasance of arms,
and that the town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> might be freed of the souldiers, &amp; left patent for the
Court of Justice, the Captain of the Castle having in the mean time a convenient
revenue (for guarding the house) allowed unto him. But this turned to no effect,
for the conditions for the surceasance required, could not be agreed unto by either
side, for the Regent would have the town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> put in the estate, wherein it
was at the going of the Commissioners to the Court of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ianuary</hi> prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and <hi>Grange</hi> to content him self with such an ordinary garrison as other Keepers
of the Castle were accustomed to entertain. The other faction was content to
leave the town patent, but so, that neither the Regent, nor the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>
should come unto it: And for the surety of the Castle, they would have <hi>Grange</hi>
to retain 150. souldiers, besides the ordinary guard, who should lodge in that part
of the town, which was nearest unto the same.</p>
               <p>The conditions of either side rejected,<note place="margin">The Lords on the Queens party hold a Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </note> they of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> not to be wanting of the
authority of a Parliament, kept a publick meeting in the town-house the twelfth
day of <hi>Iune</hi> (to which day they had indicted a Parliament) where a supplication
was presented in name of the Queen bearing, <q>That it was not unknown how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of her rebellious subjects having imprisoned her person in the Tower of
<hi>Lochlevin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A supplication presented in name of the Queen.</note> did hereafter constrain her to make a dimission of the Crown in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of her son, which by the advice of Mr. <hi>Iohn Spence</hi> of <hi>Condy</hi> her Advocate
she had lawfully revoked; albeit otherwise the same could not subsist, being
done without the consent and advice of the Estates, and upon a narrative of her
inability and weakness, which any of mean judgement may consider to be a meer
forgery, seeing her weaknesse to govern cannot be esteemed so great, as is the
weaknesse of an insant lying in the cradle, neither can he who hath the present
administration of affairs, compare with her in any for aptness and ability to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.
Therefore was it desired that the Nobility and Estates there convened,
after they had examined the grounds of the said dimission, and found them in
reason naught, should discern the same to be null in all time coming.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The supplication once or twice read,<note place="margin">The Queens resignation of the Crown discerned null.</note> it was pronounced as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<hi>The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, with the Commissioners of Burghs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
assembled, being ripely advised with the supplication presented, have by authority of
Parliament ordained the said pretended dimission, renunciation, and overgiving of
the Crown by the Queen, consequently the Coronation of her son, the usurped government
of his Regents, and all that hath followed thereupon, to have been from the beginning
null and of no force nor effect, for the reasons contained in the said supplication, and other
considerations notour, to the whole Estates. And therefore commands all the subjects to
acknowledge the Queen for their only Soveraign, notwithstanding the said dimission,
and as it had never been in</hi> rerum naturâ. Herewith to conciliate the favour of the
Church and people, by another statute they ordained, <hi>That none should innovate, alter
or pervert the form of Religion, and ministration of Sacraments, presently professed and
established within the Realm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that the same should have free course, without any let or
impediment to be made thereto.</hi> And therewithall the Superintendents, Ministers, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horters,
and Readers in Churches, were commanded in their publick service to pray
for the Queen as their only Soveraign, the Prince her son, the Councel, Nobility,
and whole body of the Commonwealth. These statutes they caused to be proclaimed
at the Market Crosse the day following, which was the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Iune.</hi>

               <p>Sir <hi>William Drury</hi> finding his labours unprofitable, and preparing to depart, the
Lords of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> would needs of courtesie bring him on the way. The Earl of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50008:140"/>
                  <hi>Morton</hi> who lay then at <hi>Leth</hi> pained with a Cholick, hearing that they were in the
the fields, and taking it to be done for ostentation of their power: arose from his
bed, and putting his men in order, marched to <hi>Restalrig,</hi> which way they were to
passe. Sir <hi>William Drury</hi> perceiving the companies of <hi>Leth</hi> in the way, and sorry
that his Convoy should have given the occasion, travelled between them, and by
his perswasions made them both to retire. But then the question fell, who should
first retire, and for this Sir <hi>William</hi> proponed that he should stand between the
companies, and upon a sign to be given by him. both should turn at one instant.
The Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> accepted the condition,<note place="margin">A conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> and the Lords at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </note> lest he should offend the Gentleman
who had taken such pains amongst them; the others refused, giving forth great

aloud, <hi>On, on, we shall see who keeps the fields last,</hi> and therewith gave so hard a charge.

Watergate, where by reason of the skant and narrow passage many were killed and
trod to death,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Home</hi> taken prisoner.</note> but the number of prisoner were greater, for there were 150. taken,
amongst whom were the Lord <hi>Home,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Iames Cullen;</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Kilwining</hi>
was killed, a Gentleman of good worth, and greatly lamented; for he was of all that
faction esteemed most moderate. There died some 50. in all, most of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
souldiers, and of mean accompt. On <hi>Mortons</hi> side Captain <hi>Weymis</hi> with one
only souldier was slain, this conflict happened on Satturday the 28. of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1571.</p>
               <p>Advertisement hereof sent to the Regent,<note place="margin">The Regent returneth to <hi>Leth.</hi>
                  </note> he came the next day to <hi>Leth,</hi> where
first, order was taken with the prisoners, and the Lord <hi>Home</hi> sent to <hi>Tantallan.</hi> But he
stayed not long there, for the Lord of <hi>Drumlanrig</hi> being intercepted by Sir <hi>David
Spence</hi> of <hi>Wormston,</hi> as he was making homewards, an exchange was made of the Lord
<hi>Home</hi> with him. Captain <hi>Cullen,</hi> a man infamous, and who in the last wars had used
great cruelty, was hanged on a Gibbet. The rest upon promise not to serve against
the King were dimitted. Resolution then was taken for the Regents abode at <hi>Leth,</hi>
and the countreys attendance upon him by quarters, to keep the adversaries busied,
and hinder the victualling of the town. During which time, no day passed without
one conflict or other, wherein sometimes the Regent, and sometimes the Queens
party had the better; at this time upon a report carried to the Laird of <hi>Grange,</hi> that
he was commonly called by those of <hi>Leth, the Traytor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The combat offered by <hi>Grange</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and thereafter by himself decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> he sent a Trumpet to appeal
any one of their side to combat, that should dare to affirm so much. The Laird
of <hi>Garleys</hi> offering to maintain it, time and place were appointed for the sight, and
when all were expecting the issue of it, <hi>Grange</hi> excused himself by the publick
charge he bare, saying, <hi>that it was not thought convenient he should hazard the cause in
his own person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding of this great heat amongst the parties,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>England</hi> insis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for peace.</note> the Queen of <hi>England</hi>
ceased not to mediate an accord, and by a letter to the Marshal dated the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> willed him to move them of new for an abstinence, offering to send persons
of authority and credit to the borders, who should travel to agree them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all differences as well concerning the title of the Crown, as other private
matters; and because it was given her to understand, that both parties had indicted
Parliaments to <hi>August</hi> next, she desired that no proceeding should be made therein;
either by making of lawes, or by denouncing any persons forfeited, and that only
they should authorize certain persons to meet with her Commissioners for consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the best means to conclude a solid peace. There was also a letter of safe
conduct sent for any one, that <hi>Grange</hi> would direct unto <hi>England</hi> (for this he had
desired) <hi>Lethington</hi> excepted, and those that were suspected of the late Kings mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But whether this exception gave the cause, or the daily incouragements sent
by the <hi>French,</hi> none was directed thither.</p>
               <p>The Regent by his answer of the 27. excused the not yielding to the <hi>abstinence,</hi>
which he said,<note place="margin">The Regent excuseth his refuse of the Abstinence.</note> 
                  <hi>without evident prejudice to the Kings cause, could not be granted so long
as Edinburgh was detained.</hi> For other points he answered, <hi>That by himself, without
the consent of the Nobility and Estates he could say nothing, but at their meeting in</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,
<hi>her Majesty should receive all reasonable satisfaction.</hi> The adversary party in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50008:141"/>
the mean time, nothing relenting of their course, did keep a form of Parliament at
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 22. <hi>August,</hi> and though they were but five persons in all present,
that had any voice in the State,<note place="margin">A Parliament kept at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> by the Lords.</note> to wit, two Bishops and three Noblemen, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

arisen amongst the subjects by occasion of the late troubles, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
a League offensive and defensive betwixt the two Realms. Of all that
did the Regent give notice to the Queen, beseeching her not to presse them with
any thing that might seem to call the Kings authority in question. But before these
letters came to her hands, he was killed as ye shall hear.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Claud Hamilton</hi> having intelligence given him of the security wherein the
Regent and Nobility lived at <hi>Striveling,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An enterprise of the Lord claud <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                  </note> and how as in a time of setled peace, they did
not so much as keep a watch by night, took resolution to invade them, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
greatly incouraged by Cap. <hi>George Bell</hi> (a man born in <hi>Striveling,</hi> &amp; one that knew
all the passages &amp; streets) who made offerto put him &amp; the company he should bring
with him safely in the town. This he communicated to the Earl of <hi>Huntley, Walter
Scot</hi> of <hi>Bacleugh,</hi> and <hi>David Spence</hi> of <hi>Wormeston,</hi> who were all content to joyn in the
enterprise. The second of <hi>September,</hi> they went from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> a little before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting,
accompanied with 200. horse and 300. foot, and lest their journey should be
suspected they made the rumour go, that they went towards <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> to compose a
discord fallen out betwixt the town and the Laird of <hi>Fernherst.</hi> To ease the footmen
they had taken all the horses which came the day before to the Market, and as many
as they could otherwise purchase by the way; and so marching with a wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
(for by the wayall their discourse was, whom they would kill, and whom they
would save) they came about the dawning of the day to the town, &amp; found all things
so quiet, as not a dog was heard to open his mouth &amp; bark: whereupon having plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the souldiers in the most commodious parts of the town, &amp; injoyned them to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
no person to come unto the street, they went to the Noblemens lodgings, which
were designed unto them, and found there little or no resistance. The Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>
defended the lodging wherein he was some little time, but fire being put to the
house he rendered to the Laird of <hi>Bacleugh.</hi> The Regent was taken with lesse ado,
his servants making no defence. In like sort were the Earls of <hi>Glencarn</hi> and <hi>Eglinton</hi>
made prisoners with divers others. The Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> hearing the noyse, issued
forth of the Castle with 16. persons only, and entering the back of his new
lodging which was not then finished, played with Muskets upon the street, so
as he forced them to quit the same. The townesmen and others upon this taking
courage, gathered together, and put the enemy to flight, pursuing them so hotly,
as they were constrained to quit their prisoners, and some to render themselves to
those they were leading captive. The Regent who was <hi>Wormestons</hi> prisoner (for to
him he had rendered) being carried a little without the Port, when they saw the
rescue coming, was shot by Captain <hi>Calder,</hi> and with the same bullet <hi>wormeston</hi>
(who did what he could to save the Regent) was stricken dead.</p>
               <p>The death of this Gentleman was much regrated of both factions,<note place="margin">The number of the slain on both sides.</note> for that he
was for manly courage, and other vertues as well of body as mind, inferiour to
none of his time. There fell at this time on the Regents side some 24. amongst
whom the most eminent were <hi>George Ruthven,</hi> brother to the Lord <hi>Ruthven,</hi> and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50008:141"/>
                  <hi>Alexander Stewart</hi> of <hi>Garleis.</hi> Of the other side, as many were slain, and divers taken
prisoners; amongst whom were the two Captains <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Cawder,</hi> who were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
as Traytors. The Lord <hi>Claud</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and the rest esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and had all been taken, if there had been horses to pursue them; But the
Borderers that followed <hi>Bacleugh,</hi> men accustomed with such practises, had emptied
the stables at the first entry into the town. It was certainly a bold enterprise,
whereof we will not find many the like in story. So few men leaving their strength
to take so long a journey, and enter upon a town full of enemies (for there were in it
500. able and resolute men at least, besides the inhabitants) was a great audacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and then to get in their hands the chief of their adversaries, whereby they
were once in a possibility to have returned absolute victors; yea when the course
altered, to have saved themselves with so little losse, which held strange, and made
the enterprise to be counted no lesse fortunate, then it was bold and venturous.</p>
               <p>It was also observed,<note place="margin">An ominous speech of the King, being yet a child.</note> and is worth the reporting, that the young King who was
brought from the Castle to the Parliament house at their first sitting, after a short
speech w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they had put in his mouth, espying in the table-cloth, or as others have said,
in the top of the house, a little hole, cried out, that <hi>there was a hole in the Parliament.</hi>
An ominous speech, and so interpreted by some that were present, which the event
made the more remarkable; for before the Parliament was at an end, a great hole
was made in it, by the death of him that began the same. The Regent though the
wound was mortal, did not light from his horse till he came to the Castle. By the
way when his friends did incourage him, he still answered, <hi>If the babe be well</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King) <hi>all is well;</hi> and being laid in bed and his wound dressed, after they had
told him that his bowels were cut, calling the Nobility he spake unto them a few
words to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am now my Lords to leave you,</hi>

                  <hi>at God his good pleasure, and to go into a world where
is rest and peace. Ye know it was not my ambition, but your choice that brought me to the
charge I have this while sustained, which I undertook the more willingly, that I was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of your assistance in the defence of the infant King, whose protection by nature and
duty I could not refuse. And now being able to do no more, I must commend him
to the Almighty God, and to your care, intreating you to continue in the defence of his
cause, (wherein I do assure you in Gods name of the victory) and make choice of some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
person, fearing God and affectionate to the King, to succeed unto my place. And I
must likewise commend unto your favour my servants, who never have received benefit
at my hands, and desire you to remember my love to my wife</hi> Meg, (so he was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to call her) <hi>whom I beseech God to comfort.</hi> This said, he took leave of them
all one by one, requesting them to assist him with their prayers, in which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
continued some houres, and so most devoutly ended his life. A man he was
of noble qualities, tried with both fortunes, and if he had injoyed a longer and
more peaceable time, he had doubtlesse made the Kingdom happy by his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>It is time that we return to the Church,<note place="margin">An Assembly of the Church at <hi>Striveling.</hi>
                  </note> and consider what the estate thereof
was amidst the civil dissensions. In the countreys where the Queens faction ruled
the Ministers in their prayers did always recommend the Queen as Soveraign,
serving the affection of those that commanded in the bounds, albeit the assembly
of the Church had otherwise appointed. <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> as we shewed, had left the town
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and was gone to S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> where he had strong opposition made
him by Mr. <hi>Archibald,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Hamiltons</hi> professors of Philosophy in the new
Colledge, who stood fast to the Queens cause and drew many of the Students after
them. This, together with the grief he conceived of the present troubles, did cast
him in a sicknesse, whereof he never perfectly recovered. And at this time hearing
that the Assembly of the Church was met at <hi>Striveling,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> his letter to the Assembly.</note> he sent unto them
a letter, which I thought worthy to be here insert; it was, as followeth.
<hi>Because the daily decay of natural strength doth threaten me with a certain and suddain
departing from the misery of this life, I exhort you brethren, yea in the fear of God I
charge you to take heed to your selves, and the flock over which God hath placed you Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.
What your behaviour should be, I am not now, nor have I need, as I think, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50008:142"/>
but to charge you to be faithful, I dare not forget. And unfaithful ye shall be counted
before the Lord Iesus, if with your consent, directly or indirectly, you suffer unworthy men
to be thrust into the ministery of the Church, under whatsoever pretext. Remember the
Iudge before whom we must give account, and flee this as ye would eschew hell fire. This
will be a hard battel I grant, but there is a second will be harder, that is, to withstand the
mercilesse devourers of the Church patrimony. If men will spoil, let them do it to their
own peril and condemnation, but communicate not ye with their sinnes, of what estate soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they be, neither by consent nor silence, but with publick protestation make known to the
world that ye are innocent of such robbery, and that ye will seek redresse thereof at the hands
of God and man. God give you wisdom, strength and courage in so good a cause, and me
an happy end.</hi> From S. <hi>Andrews</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>August,</hi> 1571.</p>
               <p>In this meeting the Churchmen began to think somewhat more seriously
of the policy of the Church then before:<note place="margin">A consultation for setling the policy of the Church.</note> for the first draught being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liked universally among themselves, nor approved by the Councel, they saw
it needful to agree upon a certain form of government, that might continue. Unto
this time the Church had been governed by <hi>Superintendents</hi> and <hi>Commissioners</hi> of
countreys, as they were then named. The <hi>Commissioners</hi> were alterable, and were
either changed,<note place="margin">The power of the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents.</note> or had their Commissions renued in every Assembly. The <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents</hi>
held their office during life, and their power was Episcopal, for they did
elect and ordain Ministers, they presided in Synods, and directed all Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
neither was any excommunication pronounced without their warrant. They
assigned the stipends of Ministers, directing the Collectors (who were then chosen
by the General Assembly) to distribute the thirds of Benefices amongst them, as
they thought convenient. If any surplusage was found in the accounts, the same
was given by their appointment to the supply of the publick state; and in such
respect were they with all men, as notwithstanding the dissensions that were in
the countrey, no exception was taken at their proceedings by any of the parties,
but all concurred to the maintenance of Religion, and in the treaties of peace
made, that was ever one of the Articles: Such a reverence was in those times car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the Church, the very form of government purchasing them respect. But
the Church considering that things could not long continue in that estate, the
Superintendents being grown in years, and most of them serving upon their own
charges, which burthen it was not to be hoped, others when they were gone would
undergo, thought meet to intercede with the Regent and Estates, for establishing
a sure and constant order in providing men to those places, when they should fall
void, and setling a competent moyen for their entertainment. To this effect
Commission was given to the Superintendents of <hi>Lothian, Fife,</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> and
with them were joyned Mr. <hi>David Lindesay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners named to deal with he Regent and Estate.</note> Mr. <hi>Andrew Hay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Row,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>George Hay.</hi> These were appointed to attend the Parliament, and deal with the
Regent and Estates, that some course might be taken in that businesse. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
death and the troubles which thereupon issued, made all to be continued for
that time.</p>
               <p>The Regents funerals performed with such solemnity as the time would suffer,
and his corps interred in the Chappel of the Castle of <hi>Striveling,</hi> the next care was
for using a Governour in his place. <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> (who was then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Kings obedience) <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> being
put in lites,<note place="margin">The Earl of Marre elected Regent.</note> the voices went with the Earl of <hi>Marre.</hi> The fifth of <hi>September</hi> the
election was made, after which the Parliament went on: wherein besides the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Regencie, certain other Acts passed in favours of those that should
happen to be slain in defence of the King his authority. And the Regent bending
all his thoughts to the besieging of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> brought an Army thither about the
midst of <hi>October,</hi> with nine pieces of Artillery taken forth of the Castle of <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
Having battered the walls of the town on the South-side, but to small pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
because of the Rampiers and ditches which the defendants had cast up within;
he retired himself and his Army to <hi>Leth.</hi> The rest of the winter was spent in
light skirmishes, wherein none of the parties did suffer any great losse. They in
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> had the advantage; for the Castle being situated in an high place, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50008:142"/>
having a long prospect into all the parts about, gave them warning by a certain
sign when their enemies did issue forth, so as seldom they came to handy stroakes:
once only it happened that in an Ambush laid by them of <hi>Leth,</hi> two Captains,
<hi>Hackerton</hi> and <hi>Michel,</hi> who served the Lords in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with 60. of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
were taken prisoners. This made them of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> more circumspect in
their outgoing ever after that time.</p>
               <p>In the North parts <hi>Adam Gordon</hi> (who was Deputy for his brother the Earl of
<hi>Huntley</hi>) did keep a great stirre,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam Gordon</hi> deputy for <hi>Huntley</hi> in the North.</note> and under colour of the Queens authority commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
divers oppressions, especially upon the <hi>Forbesses. Arthur Forbes</hi> brother to the
Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> (commonly called <hi>Black Arthur</hi>) a man both of wisdom and courage,
had from the beginning of the civil warres, allways allowed the Kings party, and
was at that time labouring to pacifie quarrels amongst those of his name, (for they
were striving one with another) that they might be the more able to withstand
their enemies. In end he prevailed so far, as he brought his friends to condescend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a time and place of meeting, for taking up their controversies, and building them
together in a sure friendship.<note place="margin">A conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Adam Gordon</hi> and the <hi>Forbesses.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Adam Gordon</hi> smelling his purpose, and fearing the
consequence of it, used many policies to keep them still divided: but when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the meeting would keep, he resolved to come unto the place, and one way
or other to impede the agreement. At his coming he found them treating upon
matters, and standing in two companies a good space one from another, and as if
he had been ignorant of the purpose, sent to enquire wherefore they made such
Convocations. They answered, that they were doing some private affairs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he had no interess. And being commanded to separate and return to their houses,
they refused: whereupon he invaded them, and falling on that part where <hi>Arthur
Forbes</hi> stood, in the very joyning killed him. The rest seeing him fall, took the
flight, and in the chase many were slain; they reckon 120. to have died at that time.
Not long after he sent to summon the house of <hi>Tavoy</hi> pertaining to <hi>Alexander For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes.</hi>
The Lady refusing to yield without direction from her husband, he put fire
unto it, and burnt her therein, with children and servants, being 27. persons in all.
This inhumane and barbarous cruelty made his name odious, and stayned all
his former doings; otherwise he was held both active and fortunate in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> having escaped in the conflict came to the Regent,<note place="margin">A supply gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Regent to the Lord <hi>Forbes.</hi>
                  </note> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
for a present supply: he had granted to him 200. footmen under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of two Captains, <hi>Chisholm</hi> and <hi>Wedderburn,</hi> with letters to the Noblemen of
the countrey that lay adjacent, to assist. <hi>Forbes,</hi> gathering his friends, and thinking
himself strong enough with the supply he had obtained, made out to search and
pursue his enemies. <hi>Adam Gordon</hi> lay then at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and being advertised that
the <hi>Forbesses</hi> were drawing near to the City,<note place="margin">Another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betwixt the <hi>Gordons</hi> and <hi>Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>besses.</hi>
                  </note> he went forth to meet them. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
at the beginning was sharp and furious; but the <hi>Forbesses</hi> were young men
for the greatest part, of small experience, and not under command; and the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
not being well seconded by them, after they had fought a while, gave over
and yielded. The slaughter was not great, for the conflict happened in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which helpt many to escape: Captain <hi>Chisholm</hi> with most of his company, and
some 15. of the name of <hi>Forbes</hi> were killed; the Master of <hi>Forbes</hi> and some others
were taken prisoners.</p>
               <p>This good successe of the Queens party in the North, gave hearts to all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and now they began every where to take new courage. In the South the
Lairds of <hi>Fernherst</hi> and <hi>Bacleugh</hi> did affail <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> a little town, but very constant in
maintaining the Kings authority. Lord <hi>Claud Hamilton</hi> belyed <hi>Paslay.</hi> The Castle
of <hi>Braughtie</hi> on the river of <hi>Tay</hi> was surprised by ... <hi>Seaton</hi> of <hi>Perbroath,</hi>
and in divers other parts troubles were raised of purpose to divide the Regents
forces, and to withdraw him from <hi>Leth,</hi> that the town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> which was
then in some scarcity of victuals, might be relieved.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> an assembly of the Church convened at <hi>Leth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Assembly of the Church at Leth.</note> where
after great instance made with the Regent and Councel, for setling the policy of

and Mr. <hi>Iohn Craig</hi> one of the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> These twelve convening
after divers meetings, and long deliberation, grew to the conclusions following.
<list>
                     <item>1. That the Archbishopricks and Bishopricks presently void,<note place="margin">Articles agreed unto by the Councel and Church.</note> should be disponed
to the most qualified of the Ministery.</item>
                     <item>2. That the spiritual jurisdiction should be exerced by the Bishops in their
Dioces.</item>
                     <item>3. That all Abbots, Priors, and other inferiour Prelates, who should happen to
be presented to Benefices, should be tried by the Bishop or Superintendent
of the bounds concerning their qualification and aptnesse to give voice for
the Church in Parliament, and upon their collation be admitted to the
Benefice, and not otherwise.</item>
                     <item>4. That so the Bishopricks presently void, or that should happen hereafter to
fall, the King and the Regent should recommend fit and qualified persons,
and their elections to be made by the Chapters of the Cathedral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
And forasmuch as divers of the Chapters Churches were possessed
by men, provided before his Majesties Coronation, who bare no office in
the Church, a particular nomination should be made of Ministers in every
Dioces, to supply their rooms untill the Benefices should fall void.</item>
                     <item>5. That all Benefices of Cure under Prelacies, should be disponed to actual Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and to no others.</item>
                     <item>6. That the Ministers should receive Ordination from the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and where no Bishop was as yet placed, from the Superintendent of the
bounds.</item>
                     <item>7. That the Bishops and Superintendents at the Ordination of Ministers should
exact of them an oath for acknowledging his Majesties authority, and for
obedience to their Ordinary in all things lawful, according to the form
then condescended.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Order also was taken for disposing of Provestries, Colledge charges, and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanries,
and divers other particulars most profitable for the Church, as in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
extant may be seen, which were all ordained to stand in force untill the Kings
majority, or till the Estates of the Realm should otherwise appoint.</p>
               <p>In <hi>August</hi> thereafter,<note place="margin">An Assembly of the Church at <hi>Perth.</hi>
                  </note> the Assembly of the Church meeting again at <hi>Perth,</hi> report
was made of these conclusions, and exception taken by some at the titles of <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,
Dean, Archdeacon, Chancellor,</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> as being Popish and offensive to
the ears of good Christians; whereupon it was declared, that by using these titles
they meant not to allow of Popish superstition in any sort, wishing the same to be
changed in others not so scandalous. As the name of <hi>Bishop</hi> to be hereafter used
for <hi>Archbishop,</hi> the <hi>Chapter</hi> to be called <hi>The Bishops assembly,</hi> the <hi>Dean</hi> to be called
<hi>The Moderator of the said assembly;</hi> And for the titles of <hi>Archdeacon, Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
Abbot,</hi> and <hi>Prior,</hi> that some should be appointed to consider how farre these
functions did extend, and give their opinion for the interchange thereof with others
more agreeable to the Word, and the policy of the best reformed Churches, report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their opinions at the next Assembly. But I do not find that any such report
was made; like it is the wiser sort esteemed there was no cause to stumble at ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
where the office was thought necessary and lawful. A protestation always
was made, that <hi>they received these Articles for an interim, till a more perfect order
might be obtained at the King his Regent, and the Nobilities hands.</hi> According to these
conclusions Mr. <hi>Iohn Douglas</hi> Provost of the New Colledge of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> was
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50008:143"/>
provided to the Archbishoprick of that See, Mr. <hi>Iames Boyd</hi> to the Archbishoprick
of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iames Paton</hi> to the Bishoprick of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Andrew Ghram:</hi>
to the Bishoprick of <hi>Dumblane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the end of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> sent to assist the town of <hi>Iedburgh.</hi>
                  </note> the Regent advertised of the peril wherein the town
of <hi>Iedburgh</hi> stood, and of the great preparation, that <hi>Fernherst</hi> and <hi>Bacleugh</hi> made
to surprise it, (for they had besides their own forces drawn all the people of <hi>Esk,
Ewis,</hi> and <hi>Liddesdale,</hi> to joyn with them in hope of spoil, and from the <hi>English</hi> Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
divers that were given to robbery to the number of 3000. and above) sent
the Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> with some forces to defend them. Before his coming, <hi>Walter
Ker</hi> of <hi>Cesford</hi> a man of good worth, who had ever assisted the Kings party, was
joyned with them. Their enemies notthelesse esteeming themselves strong enough
by reason of their numbers, went forwards with an assurance of victory. The
Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> having notice given him by the way of their diet, and the time they
had appointed to invade the town, did use the more speed, and came in sight
thereof just as the enemies appeared. They fearing to be inclosed betwixt the town,
(who shewed themselves in the fields ready to fight) and the forces the Lord <hi>Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
brought with him, did presently retire and give back. <hi>Fernherst</hi> and <hi>Bacleugh</hi>
went to <hi>Hawick,</hi> and were followed the next day by the Lord <hi>Ruthven,</hi> who came
upon them so unlooked for, as they were cast into a great fear. The principals that
had horses fled away, the rest betook them to a little bush of wood, where being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed
on all sides, they yielded at discretion: the prisoners were many, of whom
some few were retained as pledges, and the rest dimitted upon promise to enter
themselves at a certain day. The rest of the winter and all the next spring was
spent in light skirmishes, with small losse on either side, for they of the Queens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
did seldom come to the open fields, or if they shewed themselves at any time,
upon the first onset, they took the flight, and retired to the town.</p>
               <p>Whilest matters did thus proceed in the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> quarrel at home,<note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>question for the Queens marriage with <hi>Norfolk.</hi>

the Duke was committed to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and being arraigned at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
Hall the 16. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> was convicted of Treason and condemned to die, yet
was the execution delayed to the <hi>Iune</hi> after. The Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> called also in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
defended himself by the priviledges of his Ambassage, saying, <hi>That he had
done nothing but what his place and duty tied him unto, for procuring the liberty of his

and was at the time accepted.</hi> When it was replied, <hi>that the priviledges of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
could not protect them, who did offend against the Majesty of the Princes
they were sent unto, and that they were not to be reputed other then enemies, who practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

but perceiving the adversaries of his Princess countenanced, and her out of all
hope of liberty he could not abandon his Soveraign in her affliction, but do his best to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
her freedom. And that it would never be found that the priviledges of Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
were violated,</hi> via juris, <hi>by course of law, but only</hi> via facti, <hi>by way of fact, which
seldom had a good success.</hi> After long altercation he was sent to the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and
from thence brought and imprisoned in the Tower,<note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Ely.</hi>

solicited both the Pope and King of</hi> Spain, <hi>for restoring her unto her Kingdom, which was
no prejudice to the Q. of</hi> England, <hi>that she had received godly and consolatory letters from

given, nor interchange of prisoners made, but all that were taken on either side,

who thought the troubles would not hastily cease, if a greater severity were not
used towards them who withstood the Kings authority. But whose device soever
it was, it proved exceeding hateful. The common sort taking it to have come of
<hi>Morton,</hi> called the warres of that time <hi>the Douglasses warres.</hi> This form of doing
continued from the 16. of <hi>April</hi> to the 8. of <hi>Iune,</hi> at which time both parties wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

<list>
                     <item>1. That the Regent,<note place="margin">The Anicles of Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

them in the present troubles, should faithfully promise during the said space,
to abstain from all hostility.</item>
                     <item>2. That before expiring of the said Abstinence, the Nobility and Estates should
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50008:144"/>
convene and advise upon the best means to establish a final peace, and if any
difficulty should arise in the said treaty, which amongst themselves could
not be composed, that the same should be remitted to the determination of
the most Christian King and Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. That the town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> should be set at liberty, and made patent to all
the subjects, and no place thereof be withholden, or fortified with Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
the Castle only excepted, which before these troubles arose, was
accustomed to be kept and guarded with souldiers.</item>
                     <item>4. That all the subjects of whatsoever quality and condition they were, should
freely converse together without trouble or molestation, to be offered
them by word or deed, excepting such as should be found guilty of the
murther of the King his Father and Regents. The thieves and broken men
of the Borders and Highlands with the disturbers of the publick peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Realms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> none of which should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
in the present Abstinence, but remitted to the trial and censure
of the Common law, and wheresoever they might be apprehended,
presented.</item>
                     <item>5. And last, because there were divers persons, who in the time of these troubles
had possessed themselves in other mens lands, and the tenth whereof in that
season were to be collected; To the effect no impediment should be made
to the peace intended, it was agreed that the corns and fruits growing upon
the said lands, should be gathered and put in Granges, or stalked upon the
fields, and not applied to any private use, before the expiring of the
Abstinence.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>These Articles were published the first day of <hi>August,</hi> both at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and
<hi>Leth,</hi> and the same day the Duke with the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> and their followers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> leaving the town free, and patent, as was agreed. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of peace joyed not a little the good subjects, for which publick thanks were
given in all the churches, and solemn prayers made for the continuance, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
thereof. At this time or much about the same, the Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who had been kept a long time at <hi>Lochlevin,</hi> was delivered by the Earl of
<hi>Morton</hi> to the Lord <hi>Hunsden</hi> Governour of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and shortly after beheaded at
<hi>York.</hi> Hereat many did offend, esteeming the fact dishonourable, and a discredit
to the whole nation: others did excuse it by the necessity of the time, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
that the publick affairs might receive, if the Queen of <hi>England</hi> should
be in any sort displeased. But so much the worse it was taken, that as the rumour
went, <hi>Morton</hi> received for his delivery in <hi>England</hi> a great summe of money, and so
the Nobleman thought rather to be sold, then delivered.</p>
               <p>The next day after the publication of the Abstinence, the Regent and Nobility
adhering to the King did enter into <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the Ambassadours after
thanks given them for their pains they had taken were courteously dimitted; It was
the 27 of <hi>September,</hi> some three days only before the expiring of the Abstinence,
that the Noblemen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>id meet (as was appointed) to consult upon the means of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
peace. Whereupon it was first agreed that the Abstinence should be prorogued
unto <hi>Ianuary</hi> next, after that, falling to treat of the businesse it self, they agreed in
many points, and even then had made a final accord, if the Laird of <hi>Grange</hi> had not
marred the same with his petitions; These were as followeth.
<list>
                     <item>1. He craved a discharge to himself, and all that were in the Castle of all things,
which they or any of them had committed since the beginning of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and that all Acts, Decrees, and Sentences pronounced against them,
either in Parliament. secret Councel, or before the Justice general, and
his Deputies might be declared null, and of no effect.</item>
                     <item>2. That they should be repossessed in their rooms, heritages, and possessions,
without any challenge to be made thereafter of the same by whatsoever
person or persons.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:50008:145"/>3. That the heirs of the Lord <hi>Fleming,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Wormeston,</hi> and others who
were slain in the Queens cause, might enter to their heritage and rooms, as
though they had never been forfeited.</item>
                     <item>4. That the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> should be consigned in the hands of the Earl of
<hi>Rothes,</hi> with the whole furnishing, munition and rent belonging there to the
Captain, making an account of the Jewels, and other goods which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with the house. As also restoring all the goods of the people of
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> that were put in his custody, which he was content to do, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
freely discharged of all, and secured by Act of Parliament.</item>
                     <item>5. That the Castle of <hi>Blacknes</hi> should be put in the keeping of some one of
their side, and the rents appertaining thereto, assigned for the entertainment
of a Garrison within the same.</item>
                     <item>6. In respect of the great debt he had contracted in these warres he craved the
summ of twenty thousand merks to be given him for satisfying his creditors.</item>
                     <item>7. That the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> should resign the superiority of the lands of <hi>Grange,</hi>
and other lands annexed thereto, to be holden of the Crown in all time
coming.</item>
                     <item>And lastly, that the Lords within the Castle might be licenced to go into
the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> or any other countrey they pleased forth of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and that the Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> should be surety for the accomplishment
the whole premises.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>These Articles being presented to the Regent and Councel,<note place="margin">The Regent and Councel do answer to the Articles.</note> were for the first
three judged reasonable; but to commit any places of strength to others then those
who had constantly adhered to the King, they esteemed it not safe, and to give him
any recompence, that was known to be the author of the last troubles, they said it
would be a matter of ill ensample. For the licence craved to those of the Castle
to goe out of the countrey, they held the petition very suspicious, and could not
think there was a sound meaning in them that had moved the same: yet was it not
thought meet to answer him by a simple denial at that time, but rather to keep him
in hope, and appoint a new diet for pursuing the treaty begun. Thus by consent the
Abstinence was prorogued, and the last of <hi>Octob.</hi> assigned for a new meeting at <hi>Perth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The delay grieved the Regent exceedingly,<note place="margin">The Regent dieth at <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
                  </note> and (as it was supposed) partly for
this, and partly for the crossings he found in the publick affairs he contracted a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whereof he died at <hi>Striveling</hi> the eighth of <hi>October.</hi> The adversary faction
flattering themselves in their own conceits made the like construction of his death,
which they had made of the other Regents that proceeded: saying, that <hi>it was an
evident sign of Gods displeasure with the present courses, and that none of those who
joyned in the enterprise against the Queen could prosper better.</hi> But to measure Gods
love or hatred by these outward accidents, is folly; seeing they fall out alike to all
both good and wicked: and for this Nobleman howsoever he was taken away to
the countrey untimely, he died happily for himself, and well reported of all. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his dying,<note place="margin">He commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the care of the Kings p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> he commended the care of the Kings person in most earnest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to his Lady, and to <hi>Alexander Ereskin</hi> his brother appointing him keeper of
the Castle till his son should be grown up, and be of a perfectage, and giving most
wise directions both for the one and the other, ended his days in great quietness and
in the assurance of that better life.</p>

departed this life. The Reader will pardon me, if here I make a little digression
to shew what a man this was both in his life and death, the rather because some
malicious and wicked spirits have studied by many forged lies to deprave his fame,
only out of hatred of true Religion, whereof he was a zealous promover. He was
born in <hi>Gifford</hi> within <hi>Lothian,</hi> of a mean but honest parentage, and being put to
school, made such profit in his studies under that famous Doctor Mr. <hi>Iohn Major,</hi>
as he was held worthy to enter into orders before the years allowed. By reading the
ancients, especially the works of S. <hi>Austen,</hi> he was brought to the knowledge of the
truth, and for the profession thereof endured many troubles, as well in the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50008:145"/>
life, as after his death. Having happily escaped these dangers, he went into
<hi>England,</hi> and became a Preacher of the Gospel, making his chief abode in the towns
of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Newcastle.</hi> In the beginning of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> persecution, he fled in
the company of some other Ministers to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and served with them in an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Congregation, which was there gathered, untill the year 1559. at which time he
was called home by the Noblemen that enterprised the Reformation, and how
soon the Church got liberty, placed Minister at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> in this charge he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to his last, for the civil troubles which forced him to leave the town, ceased
no sooner then he returned to the place. But his body grown infirm, and his voyce
so weak, as people could not hear him, teaching in the ordinary place, he made
choice of another more commodious within the town, reading to his audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the history of the Passion, in which he said, <hi>It was his desire to finish and close his
Ministery.</hi> Thus he continued preaching, though with much weaknesse, two
moneths and more after his return, and knowing that he was not to remain a long
time with them, he was instant with the Councel of the town to provide themselves
of a worthy Parson to succeed in his place.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Iames Lawson</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Minister at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </note> Mr. <hi>Iames Lawson,</hi> who at that time
professed Philosophy in the Colledge of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> being commended for a good
Preacher, Commissioners were directed from the Superintendent of <hi>Lothian,</hi> the
Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> himself, to desire him to accept the
charge. To the letter that the Commissioners carried, after he had set his hand, he
added this Postscript, <hi>Accelcra, mifrater, alioqui serò venies,</hi> make haste brother,
otherwise you come too late: meaning that if he made any stay, he should
find him dead, and gone. These last words moved Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> to take journey the
more quickly; when he was come to the town, and had preached once or twice to
the good liking of the people, order was taken by the Superintendent for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and the Diet appointed, at which <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> himself would be present,
and teach, though he could scarcewalk on foot to the chaire. At no time was he
heard to speak with greater power, and more content to the hearers, and in the end of
his Sermon, calling God to witness that he had walked in a good conscience amongst
them, not seeking to please men, nor serving either his own or other mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but in all sincerity and truth, preached the Gospel of Christ, with most grave and
pithy words he exhorted them to stand fast in the faith they had received: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conceived a zealous prayer for the continuance of Gods blessings upon them,
and the multiplying of his spirit upon the Preacher, who was then to be admitted,
he gave them his last farewell. The people did convey him to his lodging, and could
not be drawn from it, so loth they were to part with him, and he the same day in
the afternoon, by sicknesse was forced to take bed.</p>

                  </note> (which was not long) he was much visited by all sorts of
persons, to whom he spake most comfortably, amongst others to the Earl of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
that came to see him, he was heard say, <hi>My Lord, God hath given you many blessings,
he hath given you wisdom, riches, many good and great friends, and is now to preferre you
to the government of the Realm. In his name I charge you, that you use these blessings
aright, and better in time to come, nor ye have done in times past. In all your actions seek
first the glory of God, the furtherance of his Gospel, the maintenance of his Church and
Ministery, and next be careful of the King, to procure his good and the welfare of the Realm.
If ye shall do this, God will be with you and honour you; if otherwise ye shall do it not, he
shall deprive you of all these benefits, and your end shall be shame and ignominy.</hi> These
speeches the Earl nine years after, at the time of his execution, called to mind,
saying, that <hi>he had found them to be true, and him therein a Prophet.</hi>

approaching for which I have long thirsted; wherein I shall be relieved of all cares, and be
with my Saviour Christ for ever. And now God is my witnesse whom I have served with my
spirit in the Gospel of his Son that I have taught nothing but the true and solid doctrine of
the Gospel, and that the end I proponed in all my preaching was, to instruct the ignorant, to
confirm the weak, to comfort the consciences of those who were humbled under the sense of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50008:146"/>
their sinnes, and bear down with the threatenings of Gods judgements such as were prou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and rebellious. I am not ignorant that many have blamed, and yet do blame my too great
rigour and severity, but God knowes, that in my heart I never hated the persons of those
against whom I thundered Gods judgements. I did only hate their sinnes, and laboured at
all my power to gain them to Christ. That I forbear none of whatsoever condition, I did
it out of the fear of my God, who had placed me in the function of the Ministery, and I knew
would bring me to an account. Now brethren for your selves I have no more to say, but
to warn you, that you take heed to the flock, over whom God hath placed you overseers, and
whom he hath redeemed by the blood of his only begotten sonne. And you,</hi> Mr. Lawson,
<hi>fight a good fight, do the work of the Lord with courage, and with a willing mind, and
God from above blesse you and the Church, whereof you have the charge. Against it, so

heavily.</p>
               <p>The next day he gave order for making his Coffin,<note place="margin">He giveth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for making his Coffin.</note> wherein his body should be
laid, and was that day (as through all the time of his sicknesse) much in prayer, ever
crying, <hi>Come Lord Iesu, sweet Iesus in thy hands I commend my spirit.</hi> Being asked by
those that attended him, if his pains were great, he answered, that <hi>he did not esteem
that a pain, which would be to him the end of all trouble, and beginning of eternal joyes.</hi>
Oftentimes after some deep meditations, he burst forth in these words: <hi>O serve the
Lord in fear, and death shall not be terrible to you. Blessed is the death of those, that have
part in the death of Iesus.</hi> The evening which was to him the last of this wretched
life, having slept some houres together, but with great unquietness (for he was heard
to send forth many sighs and groanes) <hi>Robert Campbell Knize cleaugh,</hi> and <hi>Iohn
Iohnston</hi> (called of <hi>Elphinston</hi>) which two gave diligent attendance upon him, askt
after he awaked, how he did find himself, and what it was that made him in his
sleep mourn so heartily? to whom he answered, <hi>In my life I have often been assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Satan, and many times he hath cast in my teeth my sins to bring me into despair,
yet God gave me to overcome all his temptations; and now that subtle Serpent, who never
ceaseth to tempt, hath taken another course, and seeks to perswade me; that my labours in
the Ministery, and the fidclity I have shewed in that service, hath merited heaven and
immortality. But blessed be God who brought to my mind these Scriptures:</hi> What hast
thou, that thou hast not received? <hi>and,</hi> Not I, but the grace of God in me. <hi>With
which he is gone away ashamed, and shall no more return, and now I am sure my battel is
at an end, and that without pain of body or trouble of spirit I shall shortly change this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and miserable life, with that happy and immortal life, which shall never have end.</hi>
The prayers which ordinarily were read in the house being ended, it was inquired,
if he heard them; he answered, <hi>Would to God you had heard them with such an ear and
heart, as I have done:</hi> adding, <hi>Lord Iesu receive my spirit.</hi> After which words,
without any motion of hands or feet, as one falling asleep, rather then dying, he
ended his life. He was certainly a man indued with rare gifts, and a chief instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that God used for the work of those times. Many good men have disliked
some of his opinions, as touching the authority of Princes, and the form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which he laboured to have established in the Church: yet was he farre
from those dotages wherein some that would have been thought his followers, did
afterwards fall; for never was any man more observant of Church authority then
he, always urging the obedience of Ministers to their Superintendents, for which
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50008:146"/>
he caused divers acts to be made in the Assemblies of the Church, and shewed him
self severe to the transgressors. In these things howsoever it may be he was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried,
we must remember that the best men have their errours,<note place="margin">The History given forth in his name was not of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting.</note> and never esteem
of any man above that which is sitting. As to <hi>the history of the Church,</hi> ascribed
commonly to him, the same was not his work, but his name supposed to gain it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
for besides the scurril discourses we find in it more fitting a Comedian on a
stage, then a Divine or Minister, such as Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> was, and the spiteful malice that
Authour expresseth against the Queen Regent; speaking of one of our Martyrs, he
remitteth the Reader to a further declaration of his sufferings to the Acts and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Martyrs set sorth by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man, which came not to light
some ten or twelve years after Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> his death. A greater injury could not be
done to the fame of that worthy man, then to father upon him the ridiculous toyes
and malicious detractions contained in that book. But this shall serve for his clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that particular. He died the 27. of <hi>November</hi> in the 67. year of his age, and
had his body interred in the Churc-yard of S. <hi>Giles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the end of this moneth the Estates convening to elect a Regent made choice
of the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> elected Regent.</note> as the man in that time of greatest courage and counsel.
The oath accustomed being ministred unto him, because through the last Regents
death, the meeting appointed at <hi>Perth</hi> had failed: First, a conclusion was taken for
calling a Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 26. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> next the custody of the King
and Castle of <hi>Striveling,</hi> was confirmed to <hi>Alexander Areskin,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi>
being then under age, and he enjoyned to receive none within the house that was
known to be Popishly affected, or of the Queens faction; for others it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that an Earl accompanied with two servants only, a Baron with one, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
persons them alone (but all unarmed) should have accesse permitted, when
their occasions required.<note place="margin">Rules given to the Regent for his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> To the Regent himself it was injoyned, <q>That if any
place or office should fall voyd, he should prefer none thereto but such as was
sound in Religion, and for other qualities apt and worthy. That during his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie,
he should grant no respits, nor remissions for hainous crimes. That he
should not transport the King forth of the Castle of <hi>Striveling,</hi> without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Councel. That he should grant no favour to the murtherers of the
Kings Father and Regents. That he should neither enter into league with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers,
nor denounce warre without the consent of the Estates. And that he
should be careful to entertain the amity contracted with the Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
The Estates on the other part did promise to assist him with all their power against
the Kings enemies, and to joyn with him in the reformation of whatsoever abuses
crept in by occasion of the late troubles, without offending at the execution of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
upon their nearest and dearest friend. Order was also taken for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his house, the setling of a resident Councel, and the advancing of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the Crown to the best profit. And these were the things done in that
meeting.</p>
               <p>Soon after came Sir <hi>Henry Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligrew</hi> Ambassadour from <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sir Henry Killigrew sent from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> partly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the content which the Queen had received in the choice of the Earl of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
to be Regent, and partly to renew the Abstinence which was then near the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring.
Herein he prevailed so farre with the Duke and <hi>Huntley,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A treaty of peace.</note> as they were
brought not only to prorogate the Abstinence, but also to name certain Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who should meet for them at <hi>Perth,</hi> with such as the Regent by advice of the
Councel should nominate,<note place="margin">The Laird of <hi>Grange</hi> refuseth to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the treaty.</note> for concluding a perfect peace. The Laird of <hi>Grange,</hi>
and those that remained with him in the Castle, refusing to be comprehended in
that treaty, went on in victualling and fortifying the house; for impeding whereof,
the Regent did levie some companies of souldiers to inclose the Castle, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the time of Parliament was approaching, he caused erect Bulwarks in divers
places of the street, to secure the people at their meetings to Sermon, and the Judges
that convened to the ministration of Justice. <hi>Grange</hi> finding himself thus pent up,
did by a Proclamation from the Castle wall, command all the Queens subjects to
depart forth of the town within the space of 24. hours.</p>
               <p>The time expired, he made the Cannon thunder upon the town to the great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50008:147"/>
of the Inhabitants, yet there was no great hurt done that way; which when
he perceived, he hired one of his souldiers to set fire in the night time to some hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
under the wall,<note place="margin">He molesteth the town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and fireth the houses.</note> which destroyed a number of tenements: for a strong Western
wind blowing in the time, the fire did so rage, as from S. <hi>Magdalens</hi> Chappel West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
all was consumed, none daring to put hand to quench the fire, because of the
Canon that played still on the part where they saw any concurse of people. This
made him extremely hated, and even they that otherwise wished him well, were
greatly offended with this doing.</p>
               <p>The Parliament notthelesse kept,<note place="margin">A Parliament kept at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                  </note> and thre in divers Acts were mode partly for
maintaining the Kings authority, partly for preservation of true Religion, which
causes were held in those days so conjoyned, as the enemies of the one, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
esteemed enemies to the other. Therefore was it then enacted, That <hi>none should
be reputed loyal and faithful subjects to the King, or his authority, but be punished as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
who made not profession of true Religion. And that all such as made profession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and yet withstood the Kings authority, should be admonished by their teachers, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their offence, and return to his Majesties obedience; and if they refused, that
they should be excommunicated, and cut of from the society of the Church, as putrid and
corrupted members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament breaking up, the Regent by advice of the Councel directed to
the meeting at <hi>Perth,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> then created Chancellour, the Earl of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trosse,</hi>
the Abbot of <hi>Dunfermlin</hi> Secretary, the Lords <hi>Ruthven, Boyd,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn
Ballenden</hi> Justice Clerk.<note place="margin">The pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concluded at <hi>Perth.</hi>
                  </note> There met with them the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and Lord <hi>Iohn
Hamilton,</hi> Commendatory of <hi>Aberbrothock,</hi> authorised by the rest that maintained
the Queens authority. The <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour assisting them, after some days
conference, they were brought to agree upon these Articles.</p>
               <p>1. That all persons comprehended in the present pacification should acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and professe the true Religion established and professed within the Realm,
and maintain the Preachers and professours thereof, against all opposers, specially
against the confederates of the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and Lord <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> with their friends and
followers, should submit themselves to the King, and to the government of the Earl
of <hi>Morton</hi> his Regent and his successours in the same, acknowledging themselves
the Kings subjects by their oaths and subscriptions.</p>
               <p>3. That they should confesse all things done by them, under colour of any
other authority, since the time of his Majesties Coronation, to have been unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and of no force nor effect.</p>
               <p>4. That an Act of Parliament should be made with all their consents, ordaining
that none of the subjects should assist, fortify, supply, or shew any favour, directly,
nor indirectly, to those who should happen to practise against the religion presently
professed, the Kings person, his authority, or Regent. And if they should be tried
to do any thing to the contrary, the remissions granted to them, with all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of the pacification, should be null, and they pursued for their offences past,
as if they had never obtained pardon for the same.</p>
               <p>5. That all persons professing his Highnesse obedience, who had been disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
during the late troubles, should be reponed to their houses, lands, livings, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and whatsoever goods belonging to them, if so the same were extant in the
hands of the intrometters, horses and armour only excepted.</p>
               <p>6. That the Master of <hi>Forbes, Iames Glen</hi> of <hi>Barre,</hi> and all other persons should
be set at liberty, as likewise the bonds given by the Lord <hi>Semple</hi> and others for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of prisoners, or for paiment of any ransomes, be discharged.</p>
               <p>7. That the Earl or <hi>Huntley</hi> and Lord <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> should dimit, and cause
all souldiers hired or maintained by them, or any of their party to be forthwith
dimitted.</p>
               <p>8. That all processes of forfeiture which had been led, especially the sentences gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
against the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> Lord <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> and Lord <hi>Claud</hi> his brother,
<hi>William</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdene, Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Galloway, Adam Gordon</hi> of <hi>Awchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down,</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:50008:147"/>
and the rest of their friendship, for any crimes or offences done in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cause; against the King and his authority, since the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> 1567. or
for any other cause, contained in the summons of forfeiture raised against them,
should be declared null, and of no force, without any other special declaration.
And that the foresaid persons should have liberty given them, to reduce the said for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures
as they should please.</p>
               <p>9. That all persons then returning, or who should return to the Kings obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and for any crime committed in the said common cause since the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
had been dispossessed of their lands, heritages, Benefices, Pensions, heritable
offices, and other profits whatsoever, whether the same had proceeded upon senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of forfeiture or barratry, or any other way, should be effectually restored, and
be rehabiliated to their blouds and honours; to the end they might enjoy the same
as freely as if the said troubles had never happened.</p>
               <p>10. That all actions, crimes, and transgressions committed by them and their sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
since the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> 1567. (incest, witchcraft, and theft excepted) should
be freely remitted, so as the same did not extend to the murther of the first and
second Regents, which are matters of such importance, as the Regent now in place
would not meddle with. And yet in respect of the present pacification, if the same
be moved to the Queen of <hi>England</hi> by the Commitrees thereof; whatsoever she
should advise to be done therein, should be confirmed in Parliament, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
under the hand of the Clerk of the Rolles, be as sufficient, as if the same
were passed the great Seal. And if any of them should crave a pardon for other
crimes committed before the said 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, the same (upon notice given of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and crimes) should be granted; the murtherer of the Kings father, fire raising,
theft, and the resset of theft, with incest, and witchcraft, being excepted.</p>
               <p>11. That all civill decrees given since the said 15. of <hi>Iune,</hi> wherewith the said
persons or any of them do find themselves grieved, should be reviewed by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Judges that pronounced the same, and the parties upon their supplications
be heard to propone any lawful defence, which they might have used in the time of
the deduction of the proces: providing the supplications be presented, and their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
exhibited within six moneths after the date of these Articles.</p>
               <p>12. That all persons comprehended in the pacification, after publication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
should indifferently be received in all parts of the Realm, as his Majesties good
subjects; and that nothing done, or that hath occurred during the troubles, should
be esteemed a cause of deadly feud and enmity, nor admitted as an exception, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against Judge, party, or witnesses.</p>
               <p>13. That the heirs and successours of persons forfeited, and now departed this
life, who are comprehended in this pacification, should be restored to their lands
and possessions: and that it should be lawful for them to enter thereto by Breves,
as if their fathers and predecessors had never been forfeited, and had died at the
Kings peace; specially the heirs of <hi>Iohn</hi> sometime Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrewes,
Gawan</hi> Commendator of <hi>Kilwining, Andrew Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Cocknow,</hi> and Captain
<hi>Iames Cullen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto these Articles some other particulars were added which were all confirmed
by the oathes,<note place="margin">A time given to those of the Castle to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> and subscriptions of the Commissioners and Noblemen, in presence
of the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour, and a time given to <hi>Grange</hi> and those of the Castle, to
accept or refuse the benefit of the peace. But that none excepted in the former
Abstinence, nor any at that time forth of the Realm should think themselves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
therein; it was declared, that the benefit of the present pacification,
should not be extended to them. This was done to exclude the Archbishop of
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> and Bishop of <hi>Rosse,</hi> Ambassadours for the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen, the one in
<hi>France,</hi> and the other in <hi>England,</hi> against whom the sentence of Barratry had been
pronounced.</p>
               <p>About this time Sir <hi>Iames Kirkaldy</hi> brother to <hi>Grange,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sir Iames Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaldy returneth from France.</note> who had been directed to

rent of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queens Dowry, but finding the house inclosed, and that there
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50008:148"/>
was no safe accesse thereto, he went to <hi>Blackness,</hi> which then professed to hold for
the Queen. The Captain had betrayed the same, as we shewed before, to the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons,</hi>
and now turning his coat to make his peace with the Regent,<note place="margin">He takes land <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> Captain to the Regent.</note> he offered to
put in his hand both the man and the money. The bargain made, the money was
given to the Regent, and <hi>Kirkaldy</hi> detained as prisoner. A few days after, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
going abroad to do some businesse, <hi>Kirkaldy</hi> enticed the souldiers by great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to joyn with him, and lay hands upon the Captains brother, and a few Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
left to attend him: which they following their Captains ensample, were
easily induced to do. Thus the house was possessed in <hi>Kirkaldies</hi> name, and he of a
prisoner turned to be chief commander. But he did not long enjoy this place, for
his wife being come thither to visit him, when she was the next morrow to depart,
desired the convoy of some souldiers for a mile or two, fearing as she pretended to
be robbed by Captain <hi>Lambie,</hi> who lay with a company at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> not far from
thence: and as he, to save her, went forth himself to bring her on a part of the way,
suspecting no treachery, he was in his return intercepted by <hi>Lambie,</hi> and carried
first to <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> then to <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> where he was kept some days, and afterwards
dimitted. In this sort did fortune sport her self with that Gentleman, changing his
condition up and down three several times, within the space of a few dayes.</p>
               <p>Peace now made with the chief Noblemen of the Queens faction,<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour travelleth to make <hi>Grange</hi> accept peace, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth.</note> it was suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that <hi>Grange</hi> and his partakers would likewise be moved to embrace it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Ambassadour taking with him the subscribed Articles, went to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
and shewing how things had passed, used many perswasions to make them
content to be comprehended therein. But they would not, affirming the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be shameful, and so far to the prejudice of their Queen, as till they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by her self, and by the <hi>French</hi> King, they should never admit them. After
the Ambassadour had ceased to treat with them, the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and Lord <hi>Boyd</hi>
travelled to the same effect, representing the danger and inevitable ruine they
should fall into, if they did not yield in time. But they scorned these threats,
thinking the strength they were in, impregnable, and looking still for some suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
from <hi>France</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> or if that should fail, they made no doubt
to obtain their peace at easier conditions, then the Noblemen had accepted.</p>

records of the Kingdom there reserved, should be all delivered to the
Regent, within three days after the house was recovered, and the rest of
the spoil distributed amongst the souldiers.</item>
                     <item>3. That so far as might be, the persons within the Castle should be reserved to
the trial of law, wherein the Regent should proceed by the advice of the
Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. That the Regent should provide the <hi>English</hi> forces with victuals, and all
other things necessary during the siege, as likewise assist them with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
power of horse and foot.</item>
                     <item>5. That recompence should be given at the Generals sight to the wives and

               <p>The next day the Castle was summoned,<note place="margin">The Castle summoned.</note> and offer made of their lives if they
should yield before the planting of the Canon; but the Captain in stead of answer,
set upon the highest Tower,<note place="margin">The Captain answereth by a token of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> his ensign for a token of defiance. Then the Pioneers
were put to work, and begun to cast trenches, and raise mounts for planting the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.
The besieged made all the hinderance they could, playing with their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
upon the workmen, and killing divers ere the mounts were brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
How soon they were erected, (being five in all, and entituled by the
names of their several Commanders) the Artillery was planted,<note place="margin">The Castle made assaulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> 31. pieces in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
more and lesse. All things prepared, and the Parliament finished, which the
Regent had called to the last of <hi>April,</hi> for ratifying the Articles of pacification, the
battery began the 17. of <hi>May,</hi> on the 27. the Castle was made assaultable, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
having made great breaches in the fore and back walls; and the Tower called
<hi>Davids Tower,</hi> being also demolished. The 26 early in the morning the assault
was given in two places: at the West part where the ascent was most difficult, the
assailers were repulsed, after an obstinate sight that continued 3. hours, and 24. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
killed; on the East side the blockhouse called <hi>the Spurre,</hi> was taken with less
resistance,<note place="margin">A truce taken, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain willing to yield upon conditions.</note> which put the defendants in fear, and made them demand a parle. This
granted, a truce was taken for the space of two days, in which time the <hi>English</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
used many perswasions to the Captain to make him render the house; neither
was he then unwilling, so as the lives and honours of these within might be saved:
but the Regent would give no condition, and have him simply to yield. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
seeing nothing but extremity, resolved to stand to his utmost defence: yet
when he came back to the house, he found them all within divided, and the greater
part so discouraged, as they refused to undergo the hazard of a second assault;
which forced him to other counsels, and so following <hi>Lethingtons</hi> advice, upon the
29.<note place="margin">The Castle rendered to the <hi>English</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> of <hi>May,</hi> being let down by a rope over the wall, he and <hi>Piltadrow</hi> his Constable
did yield themselves and the house to the <hi>English</hi> General in the name of his Queen,
whose discretion (misknowing the Regent) they were willing to abide. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
made them to be attended to his lodging, whither all that were of any note
in the Castle were brought. Thereafter they were commitred to several places,
most of them transported to <hi>Leth,</hi> and some detained in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> till the Queen of
<hi>England</hi> should signify her will concerning them; the Ladies and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were licenced to depart, as likewise the private souldiers, and others of
meaner sort.</p>
               <p>It was thought that the Queen in regard of the render made to her Lieutenant,
would take a favourable course with them, and save their lives: but she gave dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to put them all in the Regents hands to be used as he thought meet; which
when <hi>Lethington</hi> heard, either despairing of life, or not willing to injoy it by the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50008:149"/>
mercy of an enemy, he died at <hi>Leth</hi> so suddenly, as he was thought to have made
himself away by poison. A man he was of deep wit, great experience, and one
whose counsels were held in that time for Oracles;<note place="margin">Lethington di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at Leth.</note> but variable, and unconstant,
turning and changing from one faction to another, as he thought it to make for his
standing. This did greatly diminish his reputation, and failed him at last: which
should warn all Counsellours to direct their courses by the lines of piety, and true
wisdom; without which, the most politick prudence will prove nothing but folly
in the end. His brother Mr. <hi>Iohn Maitelan,</hi> who came afterwards to great honours,
had his life spared, and was imprisoned in <hi>Tentallon, George Creichton</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Dunkeld</hi> was sent to <hi>Blackness,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Home</hi> detained in the Castle, which

brother Sir <hi>Iames Kirkaldy,</hi> and two Goldsmiths, <hi>Iames Mosman,</hi> and <hi>Iames Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi>
were publickly hanged in the Mercat street of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Such was the end
of Sir <hi>William Kirkaldy</hi> of <hi>Grange,</hi> a man full of valour and courage, who had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
done good service to his countrey against the <hi>French,</hi> and purchased by that
means great honour. But seeking ambitiously to raise his fortunes, and hearkening
to perverse counsel, he did break his faith to the Regent, who had put him in trust,
and thereby lost all his former esteem, and drew upon himself these troubles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he perished. His part was foul in the death of the Cardinal, and for it, when he
was in his best estate, many did foredeem, that he should not escape some misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Yet herein he was happy, that at his death he expressed a great sorrow for
his sins, and departed this life with a constant and comfortable assurance of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
at the hands of God.</p>

<hi>Ross</hi> (who had followed her businesse as Ambassadour in <hi>England</hi>) being at the

to <hi>France;</hi> for he feared the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and Lord <hi>Henry Howard,</hi>
brother to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> whom he had touched in his examination.
When he came to <hi>France,</hi> to mitigate the anger they had conceived, he published
an Apology for the depositions he had made, and whilest he lived, ceased not to
do the duty of a faithful subject, and servant to the Queen; soliciting both the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and Pope, the <hi>French</hi> King, and other Catholick Princes in her behalf; who
gave many good words, but performed nothing. <q>So little are the promises of
strangers to be trusted, and so uncertain their help to Princes, that are once fallen
from their Estates.</q>
                  <note place="margin">The Regents expedition to the borders.</note> At home the Regent applying himself to reform the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
caused by the late warre, begun with the borders, who had broken out into
all sorts of riot, and committed many insolencies both on the <hi>Scottish</hi> and <hi>English</hi>
side. Thither he went himself in person, where meeting with the <hi>English</hi> Wardens,
he took order for redresse of by-past wrongs. And to secure the peace of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
caused all the <hi>Clannes</hi> to deliver pledges for the keeping of good order, and
made choice of the fittest and most active persons to rule and oversee those parts:
Sir <hi>Iames Home</hi> of <hi>Cauldinknowes</hi> was made guardian of the East Marches; the Lord
<hi>Maxwel</hi> of the West, and Sir <hi>Iohn Carnichal</hi> of the Middle, who by the diligence
and strict jastice they observed resetters and entertainers of thieves, reduced the
countrey to such quietness, as none was heard to complain either of theft or
robbery.</p>
               <p>The next care he took was to order the revenues of the Crown,<note place="margin">His care for the Kings hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and rents.</note> and recover
such lands as had been alienated from it, or in any sort usurped; the jewels impigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the Queen, he relieved by paiment of the moneys, for which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.
He caused repair all the Kings houses, especially the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
and furnished the same with munition, and other necessaries: and by these doings
did purchase to himself both love and reverence, with the opinion of a most wise
and prudent Governour.</p>
               <p>Yet was it not long before he had lost all his good opinion,<note place="margin">He falleth out with the Church.</note> by the courses he took
to enrich himself. Breaking first upon the Church, he subtilly drew out of their
hands the thirds of Benefices, offering more sure and ready paiment to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50008:149"/>
then was made by their Collectors, and promising to make the stipend of
every Minister local, and payable in the Parish where he served. To induce them
the more willingly to this, promise was made, that if they should find themselves
in any sort hurt or prejudged, they should be reponed to their right and possession,
whensoever they did require the same.</p>
               <p>But no sooner was he possessed of the thirds,<note place="margin">Two, three or four Churches appointed to one Minister.</note> then the course he took for provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Ministers, was to appoint two, three, and four Churches in some places, to
one Minister (who was tied to preach in them by turns) and to place in every Parish
a Reader, that in the Ministers absence might read prayers, who had allowed him a
poor stipend of 20. or 40. pounds <hi>Scots.</hi> As to the Ministers, they were put in a
much worse case for their stipends then before; for when the Superintendents did
assign the same, the Ministers could come boldly unto them, and make their poor
estate known, and were sure to receive some comfort and relief at their hands; but
now they are forced to give attendance at Court, begging their assignation and
precepts for paiment, or as their necessities grew, seeking augmentation, which sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
they obtained; or if any petty thing was granted, the same was dearly
bought with the losse both of their time and means.<note place="margin">The Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paiment of their means.</note> The Superintendents were no
better used, the means allowed to them for their service being withholden, and
when they complained, they were answered, that <hi>their office was no more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
Bishops being placed in the Dioces, and the Ecclesiastical jurisdiction belonging
to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things lost him the Church,<note place="margin">The Church desired to be restored to the thirds, but is denied.</note> which then growing sensible of their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
in denuding themselves of the thirds, craved to be reponed according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
But herein divers shifts were made, and after sundry delayes, it was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told them, <hi>That seeing the surplus of the thirds belonged to the King, it was fitter the
Regent and Councell should modify the stipends of Ministers, then that the Church should
have the appointment or designation of a superplus.</hi> They not able to help themselves,<note place="margin">An. 1574.</note>
did in the next Assembly take order that the Ministers, who were appointed to
serve more Churches then one, should take the charge of that only at which they
resided, helping the rest as they might, without neglect of their own charge. And
because the placing of Bishops was taken for a pretext to withhold the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents
means, the Bishops were inhibited to execute any part of the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
jurisdiction within the bounds where the Superintendents served, without
their consent and approbation. This crossing of one anothers proceedings, did set
the Church and Regent so far asunder, that whilest he continued in office, there
was no sound liking amongst them.</p>
               <p>The discontents of the countrey were so great by the <hi>Iustice Aires</hi> (as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them) that went through the countrey,<note place="margin">The Countrey vexed with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice Courts.</note> and were exerced with much rigour,
people of all sorts being forced to compone, and redeem themselves from trouble
by paiment of moneys imposed. The Merchants called in question for the transport
of coyn, were fined in great summes, and warded in the Castle of <hi>Blackness,</hi> till
they gave satisfaction. Nor left he any means unassayed, that served to bring in
moneys to his Coffers: which drew upon him a great deal of hatred and envy.</p>
               <p>I find at this time a motion made for compiling a body of our Law,<note place="margin">A motion for compiling a body of our Law.</note> and making

foreseen of the equity and issue they might expect of their controversies. This was
entertained a while, and of good men much desired, as a thing beneficial to the
countrey, and like to have cut off the occasion of many pleas. But it sorted to
no effect, by the subtle dealing of those that made their gain of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

and a more particular discovery expected by him of the form, and manner of

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50008:150"/>
the purpose to him,<note place="margin">An. 1575.</note> and shewed him the subscriptions of the Earls of <hi>Argile,
Huntley,</hi> Secretary <hi>Leithington,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> testifying their consents to
that wicked fact. Nottheless the Regent, to the offence of many, did suffer the
said <hi>Balfour</hi> to enjoy the benefit of the pacification, and passed an Act thereof in
open Councel. Whether the subscriptions of <hi>Argile</hi> and <hi>Huntley</hi> were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
or not, it was uncertain, but of the other two it was easily believed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men universally hated. <hi>Argile</hi> died in <hi>September</hi> following, in whose place the
Lord <hi>Glamis</hi> was created Chancellour.</p>
               <p>In the same moneth <hi>Adam Heriot</hi> Minister at <hi>Aberdene</hi> departed this life,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam Heriot</hi> Minister at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> his death and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</note> a man
worthy to be remembred. He was sometime a Frier of the Order of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and
lived in the Abbey of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> an eloquent Preacher, and well seen in Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Divinity. Queen Regent coming on a time to the City, and hearing him
preach, was taken with such an opinion of his learning and integrity, that in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
with some Noblemen upon the Article of <hi>reall presence,</hi> she made offer
to stand to <hi>Heriots</hi> determination. Warning of this being given, and he required
to deliver his mind upon that subject in a Sermon which the Queen intended to
hear, he did so prevaricate, as all that were present, did offend and depart unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Being sharply rebuked for this by some that loved him, he fell in a great
trouble of mind, and found no rest, till he did openly renounce Popery, and joyn
himself with those of the Congregation. Afterwards when Order was taken for
the distribution of Ministers amongst the Burgs, he was nominated for the City of
<hi>Aberdene</hi> (in which there lived divers addicted to the <hi>Romane</hi> profession) as one that
was learned in Scholastick Divinity, and for his moderation apt to reclaim men
from their errors. Neither did he fail the hope conceived of him, for by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in teaching Schools, and Church, he did gain all that people to the profession
of the truth; 14. years he laboured among them, and in end was forced by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to quit his charge. He died of the Apoplexy the 28. of <hi>August,</hi> in the 60. year
of his age, greatly beloved of the Citizens for his humane and courteous conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and of the poorer sort much lamented, to whom he was in his life very
beneficial.</p>
               <p>The next summer there fell out an accident which was like to have caused
great trouble, and divided the two Kingdoms.<note place="margin">A conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English.</hi>

fell out that a <hi>Bill</hi> (so they used to speak) was filed upon an <hi>English,</hi> for which <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michael</hi>
according to the law of the Borders, required him to be delivered, till satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
was made. Sir <hi>Iohn Forrester</hi> either wearied with the multitude of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or desiring to shift the matter, answered that enough was done that day, and
at the next meeting the complainer should have satisfaction. <hi>Carmichael</hi> urging a
present performance, they fell foul in words; which made the companies that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
draw their weapons. A great tumult there was, and at first the <hi>Scots</hi> being
inferiour in number to the <hi>English,</hi> gave back. But as they were fleeing, they met
with a company of <hi>Iedburgh</hi> men, who were come to attend the Warden. This
giving them new courage, they turned upon the <hi>English,</hi> and made them flee. The
chase held the space of two miles. Sir <hi>George Heron,</hi> Warden of <hi>Tindale</hi> and <hi>Rhedes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
with 24. <hi>English</hi> was killed, the Warden himself, <hi>Francis Russel</hi> son to the Earl
of <hi>Bedford, Cuthbert Collinwood, Iames Ogle, Henry Fenwick,</hi> and many others of
good note were taken prisoners. When the Regent heard it, he was sore displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
knowing the Queen of <hi>England</hi> would be much offended; whereupon he sent
for the prisoners, and using them with all courtesy, excused what was done, and
permitted them to return home. And the Queen indeed at the first report was
much incensed, and thereupon sent Mr. <hi>Killigrew</hi> to the Regent, to require the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of <hi>Carmichael,</hi> which divers of the Councel withstood. Yet such was the

Presbyterial discipline of <hi>Geneva:</hi> and having insinuated himself into the favour of

               <p>This his discourse was applauded by many,<note place="margin">Some brethren selected to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre upon the question.</note> and some brethren set apart to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and conferre upon the question proponed. For the one part Mr. <hi>David Linde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi>
Mr. <hi>George Hay,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Row</hi> were nominated: These three sustained
the lawfulness of Episcopal function in the Church. For the other part Mr. <hi>Iames
Lawson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Craig,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> were chosed to impugne the
same. After divers meetings, and long disceptation amongst themselves, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
their opinions to the Assembly in writing, as followeth.
<list>
                     <item>1. First that they did not hold it expedient to answer the questions proponed,
for the present. But if any Bishop was chosen that had not qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by the word of God, he should be tried by the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</item>

                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:50008:151"/>
2. That they judged the name of a Bishop, to be common to all Mininisters that
had the charge of a particular flock. And that by the word of God his chief
function consisted in the preaching of the word, the ministration of the
Sacraments, and exercise of Ecclesiastical discipline, with consent of
his Elders.</item>
                     <item>3. That from among the Ministers some one might be chosen, to oversee and
visit such reasonable bounds, besides his own flock, as the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
should appoint.</item>
                     <item>4. That the Minister so elected, might in those bounds appoint Preachers, with
the advice of the Ministers of that Province, and the consent of the flock
which they should be admitted.</item>
                     <item>And fiftly, that he might suspend Ministers from the exercise of their office
upon reasonable causes, with the consent of the Ministers of the bounds.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>There were present in this Assembly,<note place="margin">The Bishops present in the Assembly.</note> the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the Bishop of
<hi>Dunkeld, Galloway, Brichen, Dumblane,</hi> and <hi>Isles,</hi> with the Superintendents of
<hi>Lothian,</hi> and <hi>Angus;</hi> all of them interessed in that business. Yet neither were they
called to the conference, nor doth it appear by the Register of those proceedings,
that they did so much as open their mouthes in defence of their office and calling.
What respect soever it was, that made them keep so quiet; whether, as I have heard,
that they expected those motions should have been dashed by the Regent, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that they affected the praise of humility: it was no wisdom in them to have
given a way to such novelties, and have suffered the lawfulnesse of their vocation to
be thus drawn in question.<note place="margin">Another As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Church.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the next Assembly I find the same matter moved of new, and put to voices,
but with a little change of the question, which was thus formed. <hi>Whether Bishops as
they were then in</hi> Scotland, <hi>had their function warranted by the word of God?</hi> The
Assembly without giving a direct answer, after long reasoning, did for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part (so the records bear) approve the opinions presented in the last meeting,
with this addition, <hi>That the Bishops should take themselves to the service of some one
Church within their Dioces, and condescend upon the particular flocks, whereof they would
accept the charge.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Regents motion to the Assembly.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Regent hearing how the Church had proceeded, and taking ill the deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mr. <hi>Iames Patton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> who was in the former Assembly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
for dilapidation of his benefice; sent to require of them, whether they would
stand to the policy agreed unto at <hi>Leth;</hi> and if not, to desire them to settle upon
some form of government, at which they would abide. The Assembly taking the
advantage of this proposition, answered, that they were to think of that business,
and should with all diligence set down a constant form of Church policy, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the same to be allowed by the Councel. To this effect they nominated Mr.

should be thought to have transgressed his oath, and be challenged for altering a member of

convened and made choice of him, which did so irritate the Church, as in the next

Mr. <hi>Iames Lawson,</hi> and <hi>David Ferguson</hi> to call him before them, and prohibit him to

               <p>A form of Church policy was in the mean time drawn up and presented to the

the Church; intreating his Grace to receive the Articles presented, and if any of them
did seem not agreeable to reason, to vouchsafe audience to the brethren, whom they had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

though he did not like the purpose they were about, gave them a better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
then in former times, and named certain of the Councel to conferre with
them, and make report of the heads whereupon they agreed. But the conference was
not well begun, when it brake off by occasion of troubles that arose</p>
               <p>The discontents in the countrey were great and daily increasing by the Regents
severe proceedings. One against <hi>Adam whitford</hi> of <hi>Milneton</hi> did open the mouths
of many men against him.<note place="margin">The discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents great in the countrey.</note> This Gentleman was accused as one set on by <hi>Iohn</hi>
Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Aberbrothock,</hi> and Lord <hi>Claud</hi> his brother to have killed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
The suspicion did arise of some rash and boasting speeches,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Semple</hi> and <hi>Adam Whitford</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents death.</note> uttered by <hi>Iohn
Semple</hi> of <hi>Biltrees,</hi> out of his spleen against the Regent for an action intended against
him concerning some lands belonging to the Crown, which had been given by the
Queen to <hi>Mary Levingston</hi> his wife, one of her Maids of honour. His words were
the more taken hold of, because he was <hi>Milnetons</hi> Uncle, and upon offer of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was brought to confession; upon which also he was arraigned and condemned
to death, and the Scaffold prepared for the execution; but was pardoned, which
did manifest that which before was suspected, that by under-hand promise of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
he was induced to this confession. The same means were tried with <hi>Milneton</hi>
to have furnished evidence against these Noblemen for their forfeiture, which was
the chief end of this trial But he upon his Uncles confession being put to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
valuing more his honour nor his safety, endured it with such resolution, shewed
both by his words and countenance, as was in all mens opinion taken for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted

                  </gap>rded:
But the Regent much blamed for such rigorous proceeding against him upon a
false or faint-hearted mans confession extorted by fear, or drawn from him by
other base respects; wherefore he was detested of his nearest kinsmen, as the other
was honoured in all mens estimation for his courage and constancy. Amongst other
proecsses he had intended for helping the revenues of the Crown, one was for the
recovery of a parcel of ground, which the Queen had gifted to <hi>Mary Levingston</hi>
one of her maids. The Gentlewomans husband called <hi>Iohn Semple,</hi> made the best
defence he could, and fearing the Regents rigour, had burst forth in some passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
speeches, avowing, that <hi>if he did lose the lands, he should lose his life also.</hi> This
reported to the Regent, brought him to be suspected of some plot, for a speech was
given out that Lord <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> and his brother Lord <hi>Claud</hi> were discontented
with some of the Regents proceedings, and had instigated this Gentleman with his
Nephew <hi>Adam Whitford</hi> of <hi>Milton,</hi> to kill him as he went down the street towards
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50008:152"/>
the Palace with an Harquebuse.<note place="margin">An. 1577.</note> 
                  <hi>Semple</hi> called in question for this, and his other
rash speeches, upon representation of the torture confessed all, for he was a fearful
man and of no courage. <hi>Milton</hi> being apprehended in the Isle of <hi>Bute,</hi> and brought
to his examination, denied that any such motion had been made to him, and being
put to the torture, indured the same patiently, not confessing any thing. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and the resolution he shewd both in words and countenance, made the
others confession not to be credited, every one interpreting the same to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
of weaknes, and want of courage. The Gentlemans case was much pitied,
and the mouths of many opened against the Regent for using such rigour, only
upon the confession of a fearful and faint-hearted man: but the troubles we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
did arise by another occasion.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> and <hi>Athol</hi> at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> a notorious thief, who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
many robberies, was apprehended by the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> who minding to
put him to a trial, was inhibited by the Councel, and charges directed against him
for exhibition of the man. The fellow being presented after he had stayed a while
in prison, was upon <hi>Argiles</hi> desire set at liberty, and falling to his accustomed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations,
committed divers insolencies in the bounds of <hi>Atholl.</hi> The Earl to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
this wrong done to his people, prepared to invade <hi>Argile,</hi> and he making to
defend his countrey, all those parts were in an uproar. This reported to the Regent,
a messenger of Armes was sent to discharge those convocations, and cite them both
before the Councel; but they disobeyed, and by the mediation of friends were
shortly after reconciled.</p>
               <p>This trouble was no sooner pacified then upon an injury done by the <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donald</hi>

intreated that he might be permitted to remain with his Majesty till the Nobility
should meet for trial of his complaint. The Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> came some two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">

to whom the King did communicate <hi>Argiles</hi> complaint, craving his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in the business. And he as thought he had known nothing of the matter, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that the Noblemans petition seemed reasonable, and that his Majesty
could not take a better course, then call the Nobility, and by their advice
take order for preventing the troubles that might arise by their dissensions.
The King liking the advice, commanded letters to be written for all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
in the countrey to meet at <hi>Striveling</hi> the tenth day of <hi>March:</hi> yet the
advertisement went only (the two Earls having the direction of the letters) to
those that were their own friends, and enemies to the Regent. Amongst others,
the Lords <hi>Maxwel</hi> and <hi>Ogilvy</hi> were invited to come; of whom the first had
been lately dispatched from his office of Wardanrie in the West Marches, and

with <hi>Athol</hi> to disturb the common peace: desiring to know his Majesties

his Majesty was pleased to take it in his own hands, so will he now most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
resign the same, so as a substantial course were taken for the preservation of
his Highness person, the ordering of his Majesties house, and the dispensing of the
revenues of the Crown.</q> Herewith he recommended the keeping of the peace
contracted with <hi>England,</hi> because of the danger that a warre might bring, not only
to the Realm, but also to his Highness title, and right of succession in that Kingdom.
And having recounted the services done by himself, from his Majesties birth unto
that present; specially his assistance at the Kings Coronation; the danger whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he exposed himself and his friends in <hi>Lanside</hi> field, and at the siege of

he found in great trouble; the redeeming of the jewels and moveables
pertaining to the Cown, and the restoring of the royal Patrimony to some reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

of what he had done in his office, and a discharge of his intromissions by the Estates
of Parliament.</p>

him to take hold of the offer of dimission made by the Regent, and accept
the government in his own person, after which he might deliberate upon such
things, as the Regent had moved. Some were of opinion that the King should
write to the Regent, and require of him a dimission; but the greater part
misliking delays did reckon it more sure, to do that which was meant at once,
and not to protract time with a communing, such as that manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
would necessarily breed; The King liking best the perswasions that were
given him to reign, (a thing natural to Princes) resolution was taken to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Regent of his authority, and publish the Kings acceptation of the
government.</p>
               <p>This conclusion was the same day imparted to the Regent,<note place="margin">A Commission from the King to the Regent.</note> who thereupon sent
the Laird of <hi>Whittingham</hi> to desire the King before any innovation was made, to
reconcile those of the Nobility that were in variance with others; thinking this way
to hold off the publication intended at least for some days. But it availed nothing,
for immediately were the Chancellour and Lord <hi>Hereis</hi> sent with this Commission
to him in writing: <hi>That his Majesty considering the dislike which many had of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the apparent troubles to fail upon the Realm, had by the advice of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
determined to accept the rule in his own person; and because delay of time might
breed some further grudge, and inconvenience, he did therefore require him to send his
Declaration in writ with all speed, for testifying his obedience and allowance of what was
done, and to abstain from all further administration or exercise of the office of Regency.
As concerning his desires, for the surety of his Majesties person, the ordering of his house,
and revenues of the Crown, with preservation of the peace with</hi> England, <hi>and the setling of
the Borders and Highlands, his Highnes should omit nothing that lay in his power to do for
effecting the same, and therein would follow the counsel, which he and the rest of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
should give unto him; and for the discharge of his administration, he should have
all granted, which with reason he could require, the form whereof his Majesty did will him
to draw up, that he might deliberate with his Councel what was fit to be done therein, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50008:153"/>
him that he should be well and graciously used.</hi> With this Commission they did
likewise carry a letter written by the King himself in very loving terms, declaring,
that <hi>because he saw no other way to maintain concord amongst his subjects, he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the government in his own hands, and that he was confident to have the defects of
his age and experience supplied by his Nobility, especially by himself, whom he would ever
love, and acknowledge as his trusty Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him by the whole Estates of the Kingdome, at the pleasure of his enemies. For it
is sufficiently known,</hi> said he, <hi>that the King is a childe, and that these motions
have not proceeded from himself. Now when he hath assumed the government, and
ye left the place intrusted to you, shall he not be governed by those that are about
him, whom you know to be your enemies? But ye perhaps do promise ease and safety
to your self in a private life: as if you might descend without any danger, from
the place which ye have held. Wise men have observed that between highest, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
there is not a mean; and it feares me you have wronged your self in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the rest you shall never find. If you had kept your place, they should have seen
the faces of men, and not carried things thus at their pleasure; but having forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
your self, there is nothing left to your friends, but to lament your misfortune;
and God grant that this be the worst of things.</hi> This said, he went aside, and
burst forth in tears. The Regent (whom we will no more call so) excused his
doing, by the instance that the King made for his dimission, saying, that his
refuse would have made a great commotion in the Realm; yet did he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his errour, and in his secret thoughts, which he covered so well as he
could, blamed his own rash and precipitate yielding. But there being no place
left to resile,<note place="margin">The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Regents di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the King.</note> the next best he thought was to secure himself, and his friends,
by discharge of all things, that might be laid to him or them, during his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration;
and therein he employed the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> and the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
whom he did constitute his procurators to compeir before the King,
and make dimission of his office, with such solemnities as by law were
requisite.</p>
               <p>This done, the discharge was given him in most ample form. Therein after
a general approbation of his service, he was declared not to be accusable of
any manner of crime,<note place="margin">The Regents discharge of his administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of whatsoever greatnesse or weight, without exception,
that might be alledged to have been committed by him in times past: which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
was ordained to be as valid, and sufficient in all respects, as if the
highest crime that could or might be imputed to any person, had been specially
expressed in the same. He was also exonerated of all summes of money, rents,
and profits, as well of property, as casualty intrometted with by him or his
factours and servants, since his acceptation of the Regiment (the jewels of the
Crown, the furniture of his Majesties house, Munition and Artillery onely
excepted.) A provision was adjected, <hi>That the present discharge should not prejudge
the King and his successours in the revocation or reduction of whatsoever infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offments,
given of the property, during his Highness minority<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, or of whatsoever lands,
Lordships, offices, or dignities, fallen in his Majesties hands by forfeiture, recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
bastardy, or by any other right, and priviledge of the Crown.</hi> In all other
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50008:153"/>
points the discharge was ordained to stand firm and sure for him, his heirs, and
successors, and the same never to be revoked, or any thing attempted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
and for his greater assurance, the same was promised to be confirmed by
the Estates of Parliament in their first convention and meeting. The Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and others of the Estates then present with the King, did likewise bind
themselves, their heirs and successours, to see all the foresaid points truly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
under the pain of five hundred thousand pound. So as nothing was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which he could devise for his securing. Yet in all this he found no assurance:
to teach men, that it is not to be had in any worldly thing, but to be sought of
God alone. All men are compelled to acknowledge so much in the end, though
often too late; which was the case of this Nobleman, as we shall hear. But bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
late, as the saying is, then never.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE King was not yet twelve years compleat, when in the
manner ye have heard they moved him to assume the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mortons</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are still practising against him.</note>
yet did he shew more judgement in his very
beginning, then could be expected from one of his years.
The Earl of <hi>Mortons</hi> enemies, not satisfied with his displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
were still casting how to bring him into the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
And first shewing, that there was a necessity of the
Kings residing at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where was the place of Justice;
they desired he should be charged to render the Castle. Then informed that
he had amassed a great treasure in the time of his Regiment, they moved the King
to require of him some moneys, for supporting the charges whereunto he would
be put at his first entry. They did further talk of the Mint-house, and the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
he reaped thereby. And to denude him of all power, they desired the state of
the borders to be looked unto, and the office of Lieutenandry which the Earl of
<hi>Angus</hi> his Nephew had in those parts, discharged. To one or other of these they
conceived he should be unwilling, and so they should find some matter against him.</p>
               <p>But the King refusing to use him with charges,<note place="margin">The King his calm proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with <hi>Morton.</hi>
                  </note> took a more moderate course,
and sent the Chancellour and Thesaurer to feel his mind in those things. He lay then
at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and having heard their propositions, howbeit he knew those motions
did proceed from his adversaries, and was not ignorant what they intended, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
calmly, <hi>That the jewels and moveables appertaining to the Crown, being received
of his hand, and he and his deputies discharged, the Castle should be rendered most willingly.</hi>
But for the advancing of moneys he excused himself, saying, <hi>that was not unknown,
how he had received his office in a time full of trouble, and when the countrey was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled
in a civil warre, the burthen whereof he sustained upon his private Charge; and
that since the troubles ceased, he had payed a great many debts, repaired his Majesties
houses and Castles, and put them in a better case, then for many years before they had been:
That the entertainment of his Majesties house, and maintaining of his own as Regent, was
a matter of no small charge; which the ordinary revenues of the Crown would hardly do:
yet when his Majesty should be of perfect age, and his honourable occasions did require it, he
should not be wanting according to his ability, and bestow all his means for his Majesties ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
Concerning the Mint-house, he said, <hi>that he had kept it in the best order he could,
and having now no more charge of it, he wished the King to do therewith as he thought best.</hi>
For the affairs of the border, <hi>that he had moved the Earl of</hi> Angus <hi>to undertake that
service for the quietnesse of the countrey, but seeing he had no lands in those quarters, and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50008:154"/>
that the offices of Wardenrie might suffice to hold those parts in order,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 1578.</note> 
                  <hi>he would advise the
King to dispose them to the most sufficient that could be found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Noblemen returning with these answers,<note place="margin">A pitiful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</note> the King did rest well satisfied.
But a pitiful accident that fell out in the time, gave an hinderance to these business.
The Chancellour going to the Castle to make his report to the King, as he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his lodging, did encounter the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> in the street, called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<hi>the Schoolhouse wynd.</hi> There had been an old grudge bewixt the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
whereupon the Noblemen passed by others without salutations; the street
being narrow, and the companies of each side great, when they were almost parted,
two base fellowes fell a strugling for the way, and by thrusting one at another raised
a tumult,<note place="margin">The Chancellour killed in a tumult.</note> in the very beginning whereof, the Chancellour was killed with the shot of
a Pistol. It was certainly known, that the Noblemen did purpose no harm to
others, for <hi>Crawford</hi> did call to his followers to give way to the Chancellour, as he
on the other side called to give way to the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> yet by this unhappy
accident were the old dissensions that had long slept revived; and a fresh enmity rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
which turned to the great hurt of both. The death of the Chancellour was much
lamented, falling out in the time when the King and countrey stood in most need
of his service. He had carried himself with much commendation in his place, and
acquired a great authority: most careful was he to have peace conserved both in
the countrey and Church, and laboured much to have the question of Church
policy setled; upon which subject, he interchanged divers letters with <hi>Theodore Beze.</hi>
Some have blamed him of too great curiosity in that matter, but his intention
certainly was pious and commendable.</p>
               <p>Upon his death the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> was preferred to be Chancellour;<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> created Chancellour.</note> at which the
Church did mightily offend; as likewise of the admission of the Earls of <hi>Cathnes,</hi>
and <hi>Eglinton,</hi> with the Lord <hi>Ogilvy</hi> upon the Councel, who were all thought to be
Popishly inclined. This being meaned to the King, was in some sort satisfied by
their promises, and subscriptions to the Articles of religion; yet the suspicions of
their unsoundness still continued. And now began they who longed for the change
of <hi>Mortons</hi> government, to repent the alteration that was made; for howsoever he
did not favour the novations in Church policy urged by some Ministers, he kept
a severe hand over Papists, permitting none to enjoy and publick office, who was
not sincerely affected to the truth.</p>
               <p>The first of <hi>April</hi> the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was delivered to the Lords <hi>Ruthven</hi>
and <hi>Lindesay,</hi> who were appointed by the King to receive the house,<note place="margin">The Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Earl of <hi>Marre.</hi>
                  </note> and a discharge
given to the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> of the jewels, munition, and moveables within the same.
And the same day <hi>Iohn Seaton</hi> of <hi>Touch,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Cunningham</hi> of <hi>Drumwhassil</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the keys in name of <hi>Alexander Areskin</hi> Uncle to the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> upon a
warrant directed to them for that effect. The Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> resolving to live pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and to have no more medling in publick affairs, retired to <hi>Lochlevin,</hi> where he
stayed not long, being recalled to Court by this occasion. The friends of the
house of <hi>Marre,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Castle of <hi>Striveling</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised by the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> his friends.</note> of whom the principals were the Abbots of <hi>Driburgh</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buskenneth,</hi>
out of some jealousie they conceived of <hi>Alexander Areskin</hi> his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and a fear that the young Nobleman who was then grown to some years, might
be prejudged of his right in keeping the Castle; practised secretly to exclude him,
and entring one morning with a number of his followers, seised upon the keeper
of the gate, took the keys from him by force, and putting him and his men forth,
placed others in their rooms, whom they caused swear fidelity to the Earl of
<hi>Marre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How soon the Councel (which then remained at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) was advertised of
this change,<note place="margin">The Councel goeth to <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy.</note> they prepared to go to <hi>Striveling,</hi> and for their greater security were
furnished with some companies of men by the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but by letters
from the King they were stayed. In these letters the King shewed that it was a
private dissension only that had happened betwixt the friends of the house of <hi>Marre,</hi>
which he would have peaceably composed, and therefore desired them to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him after a day or two in quiet and sober manner, and assist the reconcilement.
They obeyed, and coming to <hi>Striveling,</hi> in a frequent Councel kept the third of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50008:155"/>
                  <hi>May,</hi> the controversy was in these termes composed: <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Marre <hi>being
new come to a reasonable age, he should attend the Kings person, and have the custody of
the Castle of</hi> Striveling, <hi>and that the Master his Uncle should remain Captain of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>and when he came to Court have his table kept as before, and enjoy the
place of a Gentleman of his Majesties chamber.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conditions prescrived to the Earl of <hi>Marre.</hi>
                  </note> The conditions prescrived to the Earl
of <hi>Marre</hi> were, <hi>That he should guard the Castle, attend the Kings person therein, and not
remove him to any place whatsoever without the knowledge and consent of the Councel.
That he should not receive any within the house, whom he knew not to be well affected to
the King; admitting an Earl with two only in train, a Lord with one, and Gentleman single;
that Mr.</hi> George Buchannan <hi>and Mr.</hi> Peter Young <hi>should continue his instructers, and
no others be admitted without the Councels consent, nor any religious exercise kept within
the Castle, but that which the Parliament had approved.</hi> For the observing of these
Articles, the Earls of <hi>Athol, Angus, Argile,</hi> and <hi>Montross,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Ruthven</hi>
and <hi>Lindesay,</hi> became sureties. For the Master his Uncle, and his fidelity in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with the jewels, munition, and other moveables, the
Earls of <hi>Athol, Argile, Montross,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> gave their bond and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
Some days after this broile, the Captain his eldest son (called <hi>Alexander</hi>)
a youth of great hopes, departed this life, as it was thought, of a grief he conceived
for the indignity done to his Father.</p>
               <p>This agreement being made,<note place="margin">A Convention at <hi>Striveling.</hi>
                  </note> and the Lords being then to return to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
the King did signify unto them, that because the Parliament was indicted to the
tenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> he would before that time call a number of every estate together, for
the preparing of matters; and that all emulations laid aside, they might concurre
and joyn their counsels for the publick good of the Realm. The Diet for this
meeting he appointed at <hi>Striveling</hi> the tenth of <hi>Iune.</hi> the Convention at the
time was frequent; of the Clergy, eight Bishops, and as many Abbots were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
of the Nobility nine Earls, and eleven Lords, and divers Commissioners of
Burghs.<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> cometh to <hi>Striveling.</hi>
                  </note> The Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> at the Kings earnest intreaty came also thither, and at
his coming was admitted upon the Councel, having the precedency allowed him,
with the consent of the rest, because of the Regency he had a long time sustained.</p>
               <p>In the first meeting the King after he had given thanks to the whole number
for the readinesse they had shewed to convene in that place,<note place="margin">The Kings motion to the Lords and the rest of the Estates.</note> proponed two things.
One was touching the Parliament, and the place where it should hold. The other
concerned an Ambassage, which he intended to send into <hi>England.</hi> For the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
he said, that <hi>he longed to see a meeting of the Estates, and would have the time to
which it was called precisely observed, wishing them all to addr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sse themselves thereto in
time, and to come in a peaceable manner, as men disposed to do good, and seeking the
common profit of their countrey.</hi> And for <hi>the place, seeing his own presence was necessary,
and that he could not conveniently remove from</hi> Striveling, <hi>he desired the Parliament to
be fenced at</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>at the day appointed, and then prorogated some four or five days,
and brought to</hi> Striveling. For the <hi>Ambassage,</hi> he gave divers reasons, <hi>First, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
assumed the government in his own hands, he was bound in courtesie to visit the
Queen of</hi> England, <hi>and give her thanks for the kindnesse he had received of her in his
minority. Next, that the disorder lately fallen out in the borders,</hi> (for about that time
some borderers had entred into <hi>England</hi> and committed great robberies) <hi>laid a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
upon him, to clear the countrey of that fact, and make offer of redresse. Thirdly,
that he had a private business, which touched him nearly, his Grandmother the Lady</hi> Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox
<hi>being newly deceased, and he being her only heir; it concerned him,</hi> he said, <hi>to inquire
what her last will was, and to see that no prejudice was done to him in his succession to the
lands she possessed in</hi> England. <hi>Lastly, if they did think meet</hi> (but this he remitted to
their wisdomes) <hi>he shewed that he could like well to have a motion made of a more strict
league betwixt the two Realms, during the Queens life and his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It grieved the ordinary Counsellours much,<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the change of the place of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that the place of Parliament should
be changed, who therefore laboured to disswade the King from it; but perceiving
him resolved that way, they gave their consents, though most unwillingly. When
they came to speak of the Ambassage to <hi>England,</hi> they acknowledged the necessity
thereof; but took exception at the league, pretending the ancient league with
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50008:155"/>
                  <hi>France.</hi> It was replied, <hi>That the case of things was much altered from that in former
times; that</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland <hi>had now the same enemies because of their common
profession, so as for their own safety it was needful they should joyn together in strict friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
and that the league with</hi> England <hi>might be so contracted, as the old amity with</hi>
France <hi>should remain inviolate.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Ambassage to the Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> The King further declared, <hi>that he did not mean to
give power to his Ambassadour for concluding a league, wherein he would do nothing
rashly, nor without the advice of the Estates; only be desired, the same should be moved,
and upon the report of the Queens liking thereof, that the conditions of the league should be
well and gravely advised.</hi> After long reasoning, the matter being put unto voices, it
was by plurality agreed, that the same should be made one of the Ambassadours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions;
against which, the Earls of <hi>Argile, Montross,</hi> and <hi>Cathnes,</hi> the Lords <hi>Linde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi>
and <hi>Innermaith,</hi> with the Commendatary of <hi>Deir</hi> took publick protestation.</p>
               <p>These things bred a new heart-burning amongst the Noblemen,<note place="margin">Jealousies among the Noblemen:</note> for they took
<hi>Morton</hi> to be deviser of all, and that he was craftily drawing back the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of affairs unto himself, which albeit they dissembled for the present, brake
forth after a few days in an open dissension. The Citizens of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were much
offended with the Kings remaining in <hi>Striveling,</hi> and the remove of the Parliament
from their town; and as it happeneth in such times of discontent, rumors were
dispersed that the King was detained captive, and was shortly to be sent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the ancient league with <hi>France</hi> dissolved.<note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the false ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors dispersed.</note> This being in the mouthes of
all men and talked of not in corners, but in open and publick meetings, a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
was given out the sixth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 
                  <q>Declaring the falshood of those rumors,
and that the same were raised by some seditious spirits that could not live quiet,
under any sort of government; for as to the Kings detention, it was known to
be most false, and that it was his own choice to remain at <hi>Striveling,</hi> attended by
those, whom the Councel by common consent had appointed for the safe custody
of his person; And for the Parliament, which they said, was to treat of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of peace with their old confederates, and to make up new leagues with
others, there was no such matter; it being his Majesties only purpose to have
such things intreated in that meeting, as might tend to the advancement of Gods
honour, the safety of his Royal person, and the establishment of good laws
for the quietnesse of the Realm. Whereof if any made doubt, they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
at their coming to the Parliament, which was now approaching. Therefore
were all good subjects advertised, not to believe those seditious reports, nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselves to be led by such wicked suggestions into rebellion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This declaration prevailed little with the most part,<note place="margin">The Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> protest against the holding of the Parliament.</note> for the mindes of men were
much exasperated. And the time of Parliament come, the Lords that remained at
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> took counsel not to go thither, but to send of their number one or two
to protest against the lawfulnesse of it. The Earl of <hi>Montross,</hi> and Lord <hi>Lindesay</hi>
were chosen to that purpose, who coming to <hi>Striveling,</hi> shew the King the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
excuse, and declared all they had in Commission to say; wishing his Majesty
to prorogate the Parliament unto a better time, and make choice of a fitter place.
But he resolved by the counsel of those that were present, to go on, and coming the
next day, which was the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> to the great Hall, where the Estates were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
to meet, he made a short speech touching the liberty of Parliaments, and
the necessity he had to keep one at that time, and in that place, assuring all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who had any thing to move, or propone, that they should have free accesse, and
receive satisfaction according to Justice.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mantross</hi> and <hi>Lindesay</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to keep their lodgings for using the protestation.</note> After the King had closed his speech,
the Earl of <hi>Montross</hi> and Lord <hi>Lindesay</hi> arose, and in the name of the Councel, and
others of the Nobility adhering to them, protested against the lawfulnesse of the
Parliament, in so far as it was kept within the Castle, whither they could not safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repair, the same being in the enemies power. The King offended with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
commanded them to keep their lodgings, and not to depart forth of
<hi>Striveling</hi> without his licence: which the Lord <hi>Lindesay</hi> obeyed; but <hi>Montross</hi> the
next day early in the morning went away, and returned to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where it was
given out, that he had brought from the King a secret direction to the Lords, to
convene the subjects in Arms, and liberate him out of <hi>Mortons</hi> hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:50008:156"/>
Thereupon a Declaration was published, <q>bearing that his Majesty having
assumed the government in his own person, because of the enormities committed

injuriously displace the Captain, and put his family and servants to the gates: Of
which seditious enterprise, although he did pretend ignorance, yet the progresse of
his actions continually since that time, did shew that he was the chief plotter of
that businesse; for after his coming to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out his wicked and violent designes he had of late presumed to levie souldiers at
the Kings cost and charge, intending thereby to maintain his usurped authority,
and oppresse his Majesties obedient and lawful subjects. In consideration of
which abuses, and lest notorious presumptions should by their continual patience
grow to a further height, they had resolved, laying aside all difficulties, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the violences practised by him under the title of the Kings authority, and
to hazard their goods, lives, and lands for the delivery of his Majesties person
out of his thraldom; protesting that the inconveniences which should ensue upon
the present troubles, should not be imputed to them, in as much as they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
unto it for their own just and necessary defence, the restitution of their native
Prince to liberty, and the delivering of the Church and Commonwealth from
the Tyranny of such as have ever sought, and still do seek the ruin and overthrow
of both.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This declaration published,<note place="margin">Proclamations to follow the King or his Lieutenant.</note> all parts of the Realm were in a commotion: Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were levied on either side, Horse and Foot; and Proclamations sent to
the Sheriffdomes of <hi>Edinburgh, Hadington, Linlithgow, Clackmannan, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress,
Perth, Fife, Forfar, Lanark, Dumbarton,</hi> and to the Bailiaries of <hi>Kyle,</hi> and <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi>
to prepare themselves with victuals for 15. days, and be in readinesse to
follow the King or his Lieutenants upon six hours warning, as they should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
Herewith a Commission of Lieutenandry was given to the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi>
for convocating the subjects, and pursuing the rebels who had usurped the Kings
authority with all sort of rigour:<note place="margin">The Lords charged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

of <hi>Athol</hi> and <hi>Argile</hi> to depart forth of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> within the space of 24. houres,
and return to the places of their dwelling, under the pain of treason; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates

within their Town, and not to suffer any armed men to enter in the same, except
such as should have direction from his Majesty.<note place="margin">The Provost of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> committed.</note> Which when the Provost (<hi>Archibald

               </p>
               <p>The Parliament in this mean time went on,<note place="margin">A Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for dissolving the forces convened at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </note> and all things proceeded therein as
in a time of most secure peace. Upon their dissolving, when it was told the King that
the Lords were gathering forces, and that they gave out the same to be done by
warrant from him, he commanded by a new Proclamation, <hi>all that were assembled
in Armes, to separate and return to their dwellings within the space of six houres, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
pardon to such as obeyed.</hi> And lest any should be deceived with the rumours
of his captivity, and secret warrants from himself, he again declared, <hi>That it was his
own desire to remain at</hi> Striveling <hi>and be served by the Earl of</hi> Marre, <hi>with whom he
knew his surety was greater, then if he should be at the devotion of those that caused the
present troubles, whose meanings towards him could be no better then it had been in times
past.</hi> For the <hi>Warrants</hi> they pretended, <hi>he called God to witnesse, that they had neither
word nor writ from him; therefore willed all his good subjects to live quiet, and not to
be misled by such false informations.</hi>

agreement, and by his intreaties, and the proponing of honourable conditions did
keep them from joyning. In which time one <hi>Tait</hi> a follower of <hi>Cesford,</hi> who
as then was of the Lords party, came forth in a bravery, and called to the opposite
horsemen, asking if any among them had courage to break a lance for his Mistress;
he was answered by one <hi>Iohnston</hi> servant to the Master of <hi>Glammis,</hi> and his chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
accepted. The place chosen was a little plain at the river of <hi>Carron:</hi> on both
sides whereof the horsemen stood spectators. At the first encounter <hi>Tait</hi> having
his body pierced through, fell from his horse, and presently died. This was taken
by those of <hi>Mortons</hi> side to be a presage of victory. But by the Ambassadours tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails

quieting the borders, and not against the Lords convened at <hi>Falkirk,</hi> or

                     <item>2. That the proceedings of the Lords and other partakers with the Chancellour

Noblemen.</item>
                     <item>4. That all the Noblemen, Barons, and other Gentlemen, who pleased to come

to name the four Noblemen, whose advice he and the rest would use in that treaty.

                  <hi>That neither he nor</hi> Argile <hi>could agree to meet

Herewith he desired three things to be granted; <hi>One was, that licence might

Thirdly, that none should be called in question for their absence upon the late Proclamations,

               <p>This answer communicated to the King,<note place="margin">The King of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the petition.</note> did highly offend him. First, that
they should usurp the appointing of the time and place of meeting, which was left
in his power: next, that they would presume to send a message into <hi>England,</hi> they
being his subjects, and neither acquaint him with the person nor the message. For
the other Petitions he judged them impertinent, and more fit to be proponed at the
meeting of the Noblemen; wherefore in a letter sent by Mr. <hi>William Areskin</hi> to the
Chancellour, he shewed that since they had delayed to nominate the four Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
he himself would make choice of four of them, whose names they had given
to the Ambassadour; to wit, the Lords <hi>Lindesay, Ogilvy, Innermeath,</hi> and <hi>Hereis;</hi>
to whom he would joyn the Earls of <hi>Rothes</hi> and <hi>Buchan,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Ruthven</hi>

if they should refuse, he would notifie to the Queen of <hi>England</hi> and other
Christian Princes, the care he had taken to perform all things, as they had been
lately accorded.</p>
               <p>To this letter no answer was given but that they should advise with their friends,<note place="margin">The Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cited to appear at <hi>Striveling.</hi>

the Noblemen to meet at <hi>Striveling</hi> the 20. of <hi>September,</hi> warning all the
subjects, whom that businesse concerned to addresse themselves thither against the
day. At the day none of them appeared, and the more careful the King was to
have peace made, the more they seemed to draw back, protracting time upon fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous

<hi>Ye do all understand what an earnest desire I have that you should joyn in friendship one
with another, which cannot be more contentment to me then it is benefit to your selves; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I have many occasions given me to fall from that desire, yet I abide in the same
mind, and shall wish you to lay aside your needless jealousies and suspicions. For as to me I
will sindy to be indifferent, and bestow my favours unpartially, and never repose my self
upon any one so much as to deny others the regard which is due to them. Ye that are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
have a special interest in me, and unlesse there be a correspondence of wills and
mindes amongst you, I shall never find that concurrence that ought to be for mine honour
and the good of the Commonwealth. It is not long since, at your own desires I accepted the
government of the Realm, being perswaded by you that this was the only way to cease all
grudges, but now that I see them increased, it repents me to have yielded to your desires, and
intangled my self in such businesse. What should let you to be reconciled, and become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
friends, I know not: if there by any grief or offence that hath exasperated your minds,
will ye shew it? I am here with the advice of my Lords to remove it, and see satisfaction
made, by those that have done the wrong. I hope you do not carry mindes irreconcilcable;

they were required to set down in writing the injuries, and unkindness whereof
they complained, that satisfaction might be made at the sight of the King, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
whom he had named. Hereupon the Chancellour and <hi>Argile</hi> presented
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50008:157"/>
their grievances in some short Articles, bearing the unkindnesse they had received
from the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> in the time of his Regiment. Whereunto he answered, first
generally, that what he did in that time was done by order of law, and that they
themselves had allowed his proceedings, and were sureties for ratifying the same
in Parliament. Then replying more particularly to every Article, he gave the King
and other Noblemen full satisfaction, and made it seen, that on the part of the other
Lords, there was a great mistaking: for what he did he could not leave undone,
without a manifest violation of justice. <q>Yet for himself, he said, although he had
been ill rewarded by them for his pains taken in the publick service, and received
more unkindnesse at their hands, then he had deserved, he would freely remit
all at the Kings desire.</q>

a Commission to divers of their number to meet and conferre with the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners

Parliament. How these affairs went, and what effect the Commission took, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the great businesse, that afterwards was made about the same, is necessary
to be known; wherefore I thought meet to set down the form of policy, as it was

                  <p>FIrst,<note place="margin">1. Agreed.</note> the Church of God is sometimes largely taken for all them that professe
the Evangel of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and so it is a company and fellowship, not only
of the godly, but also hypocrites, professing outwardly one true Religion.</p>
                  <p>2.<note place="margin">2. Agreed.</note> At other times it is taken for the elect only, and the godly; and sometimes
for them that exercise the spiritual function amongst the congregation of them that
professe the truth.</p>
                  <p>3.<note place="margin">3. Agreed that the Church is sometimes taken for them that exercise the spiritual function in particular congregations.</note> The Church in this last sense hath a certain power granted
by God, according to which it useth a proper jurisdiction and
government, exercised to the comfort of the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>4.<note place="margin">4. Continued to further reasoning, and when it is said this power sheweth from God to his Church, whether this should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the whole Church, or of the office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, and wheither it sheweth mediately, or immediately.</note> This power Ecclesiastical is an authority granted by God
the Father, through the mediation of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> unto his
Church gathered, and having the ground in the word of
God, to be put in execution by them, unto whom the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
government of the Church by lawfull calling is committed.</p>
                  <p>5.<note place="margin">5. Referred to further reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> The policy of the Church flowing from this power is an order or form of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
government, which is exerced by the members appointed thereto by the word
of God; and therefore is given immediately to the Office-bearer, by whom it is
exercised to the weal of the whole body.</p>
                  <p>6.<note place="margin">6. The last words of the Article are thought not necessary, and therefore to be delete.</note> This power is diversly used, for sometime it is severally
exercised (chiefly by the teachers) sometime conjunctly by
mutual consent of them that bare office and charge, after the
form of judgement; the former is called <hi>potestas Ordinis,</hi> the
other <hi>potestas Iurisdictionis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7.<note place="margin">7. Agreed.</note> These two kinds of power have both one ground, one final cause, but are
different in the form and manner of execution, as is evident by the speech of our
Saviour in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of S. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8.<note place="margin">8. Agreed.</note> This power and policy is different and distinct in the own nature, from that
power and policy, which is called the Civil power; and appertains to the civil
government of the Commonwealth, albeit they be both of God, and tend to
one end, if they be rightly used, that is, to advance the glory of God, and to have
godly and good subjects.</p>

9.<note place="margin">9. Say in stead hereof, For this power is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, not having-deleting the other words.</note> For this power Ecclesiastical floweth from God immediately, and the
mediator <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and is spiritual, not having a temporal head in the
earth, but only <hi>Christ,</hi> the onely spiritual King, and Governour of the
Church.</p>
                  <p>10.<note place="margin">10. Agreed.</note> It is a title falsely usurped by Antichrist to call himself the head of the
Church, and ought not to be attributed to Angel or to man, of what estate soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he be, saving to Christ the head, and only Monarch of the Church.</p>
                  <p>11.<note place="margin">11. Agreed.</note> Therefore this power and policy of the Church should lean upon the Word
immediately, as the only ground thereof, and should be taken from the pure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Scriptures, hearing the voice of <hi>Christ</hi> the onely spiritual King, and
being ruled by his lawes.</p>
                  <p>12.<note place="margin">12. Agreed changing these word, they should not be called Lords over their flock.</note> It is proper to Kings, Princes, and Magistrates, to be called Lords and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minators
over their subjects, whom they govern civilly; but it is proper to <hi>Christ</hi>
only to be called Lord and Master in the spiritual government of the Church, and
all others that bear office therein, ought not to usurp dominion, nor be called
Lords, but Ministers Disciples, and servants: for it is proper to <hi>Christs</hi> office to
command, and rule his Church universally, and every particular Church, through
his Spirit and Word, by the ministery of men.</p>
                  <p>13.<note place="margin">13.

state are subject to the Magistrate civilly: so ought
the person of the Magistrate be subject to the Church spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and in Ecclesiastical government.</p>
                  <p>14.<note place="margin">14. Referred to further reasoning, when the order of Bishops shall be discussed.</note> And the exercise of both these jurisdictions cannot
stand in one person ordinarily.</p>
                  <p>15.<note place="margin">15. Referred till they come to the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the power.</note> The Civil power is called the power of the Sword, the
other power, the power of the Keys.</p>
                  <p>16.<note place="margin">16. Agreed as the words are conceived.</note> The Civil power should command the spiritual to exercise and to do their
office according to the word of God; the spiritual rulers should require the Christian
Magistrate to minister Justice, and punish vice, and to maintain the liberty of the
Church, and quietnesse within their bounds.</p>

testimony of a good conscience, hath the lawful approbation of men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

any of the offices of the Church contrary to the will of the congregation to whom

God and his Church, after that he is well tried, and found qualified.</p>

                  <p>14.<note place="margin">14. Agreed.</note> These should take the names and titles only (lest they be exalted and pussed

which they rule by the word of God, and over which they watch;
in respect whereof sometime they are called Pastors, because they feed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;
sometime <hi>Episcopi</hi> or Bishops, because they watch over their flock;
sometime Ministers, by reason of their service and office; sometime also Presbyters

ought to be admonished, and in case of disobedience excommunicated.</p>

which if he do, after admonition not obeyed, let the censures of the Church strike

6. To the Pastor belongeth the preaching of the word of God, in season and
out of season, publickly and privately, always to edify and discharge his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as God hath prescribed. And unto them only appertains the ministration of
the Sacraments; for both these are appointed by the word of God as means to
teach us, the one by the ear, and the other by the eys and other senses, that by both
knowledge may be conveighed to the mind.</p>
                  <p>7.<note place="margin">7. Agreed.</note> By the same reason it pertains to Pastors to pray for the people, and namely
for the flock committed to their charge, and to blesse them in the name of God,
who will not suffer the blessings of his faithful servants to be frustrate.</p>
                  <p>8.<note place="margin">8. Agreed.</note> He ought also to watch over the manners of his flock, that he may the better
apply his doctrine to them, in reprehending the dissolute, and exhorting the godly,
to continue in the fear of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>9.<note place="margin">9. Agreed, that the Minister of the Word may pronounce the sentence of excommunication, after lawful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</note> It appertains to the Minister, after lawful proceeding of

upon any person, according to the power of the keyes
granted to the Church.</p>
                  <p>10.<note place="margin">10. Agreed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent orders concerning marriage.</note> It belongs to him likewise after lawful proceeding in the matter by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership,
to solemnize marriage betwixt those that are contracted, and to pronounce
the blessing of the Lord upon them that enter in that bond, in the fear of God. And
generally, all publick denunciations that are made in the Church before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation

                  <p>1.<note place="margin">This whole Chapter refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to further reasoning.</note> ONe of the two ordinary and perpetual functions that labour in the Word,
is the office of Doctor, who may also be called Prophet, Bishop, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Catechiser, that is, the teacher of the Catechisme, and rudiments of the
Religion.</p>
                  <p>2. His office is to open up the mind of the Spirit of God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
simply, without such application as the Minister uses, to the end that the
faithful may be instructed in sound doctrine, the purity of the Gospel taught, and
not corrupted through ignorant or evil opinions.</p>
                  <p>3. He is different from the Pastor, not onely in name, but in diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of gifts; for to the Doctor is given the gift of knowledge, to open
up by simple teaching the mysteries of faith; to the Pastor the gift of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to apply the same by exhortation to the manners of the flock, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
craves.</p>
                  <p>4. Under the name and office of Doctor, we comprehend also the order in
Schooles, Colledges, and Universities, which have from time to time been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
maintained, as well amongst Jewes, and Christians, as among profane
nations.</p>
                  <p>5. The Doctor being an Elder, should assist the Pastor in the government of
the Church, and concurre with the Elders his brethren in all Assemblies, by reason
the interpretation of the Word, which is only judged in matters Ecclesiastical, is
committed to his charge.</p>
                  <p>6. But to preach unto the people, to minister the Sacraments, and celebrate
Marriages, pertains not to the Doctor, unlesse he be otherwise called ordinarily;
yet may the Pastor teach in Schooles, as he who hath the gift of knowledge often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
which the example of <hi>Polycarpus</hi> and others testify.</p>

as was amongst the <hi>Levites</hi> under the Law, in serving the Temple.</p>

be according to the bounds and necessity of the people.</p>
                  <p>5.<note place="margin">5. Referred.</note> It is not necessary, that all Elders be teachers of the word, albeit chiefly they

                  <p>2. The office of Deacon so taken, is an ordinary and perpetual function in the
Church; of what properties and duties they ought to be that are called thereto, we
remit to the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>3. The Deacon ought to be called and elected as the rest of the spiritual officers,
and their office and power is to receive and distribute the whole Ecclesiastical goods

                  <head>CHAP. 9. Of the Patrimony of the Church, and distribution thereof.</head>
                  <p>1. By the Patrimony of the Church, we understand whatsoever thing hath
been at any time before, or shall be hereafter given, or by universal consent
or custome of countries professing christian Religion applied to the publick use, and
utility of the Church.</p>
                  <p>2. So that under the Patrimony of the Church we comprehend all things given
or to be given to the Church and service of God, as lands, buildings, possessions,
annual rents, and the like, wherewith the Church is endowed, either by donations,
foundations, mortifications, or any other lawful titles of Kings, Princes, or any
other persons inferiour to them, together with the continual oblations of the
faithful.</p>
                  <p>3. We comprehend also all such things, as by lawes, customes, or use of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
hath been applied to use, and utility of the Church: of which sort are tithes,
Manses, gleibs, and the like; which by the common and municipal lawes, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
custome are possessed by the Church.</p>
                  <p>4. To take any part of this Patrimony by unlawful means, and convert to the
particular and prophane use of any person, we hold a detestable sacriledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God.</p>
                  <p>5. The goods Eccclesiastical ought to be collected and distributed by Deacons,
as the word of God appoints, that they who bear office in the Church, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for without care, or solicitude.</p>
                  <p>6. In the Apostolick Church the Deacons were appointed to collect and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute,
whatsoever was collected of the faithful, to the necessity of the Saints, so as
none amongst them did want.</p>
                  <p>7. These collections were not only of that which was gathered by way of Alms,
as some suppose, but of other goods moveable and unmoveable, of lands, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions;
the price whereof was brought and laid at the Apostles feet.</p>
                  <p>8. This office continued in the Deacons hands, who intromitted with the whole
goods of the Church, till the estate thereof was corrupted by Antichrist, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Canons bear witnesse.</p>
                  <p>9. The same Canons make mention of a fourfold distribution of the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Church, whereof one part was applied to the Pastor, or for his
sustentation and hospitality; another to the Elders and Deacons, and the whole
Clergy; the third to the poor, sick persons, and strangers; and the fourth to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the edifice of the Church, and other affairs specially extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>10. We adde hereunto the Schooles, and Schoolmasters, who ought and may
well be sustained of the same goods, and are comprehended under the Clergy; To
whom we joyn Clerks of Assemblies, as well particular as general, Procurators of
the Church affairs, takers up of Psalmes, and other officers of the Church, who
are necessary.</p>

at least ought to be maintained and defended, against all those that would procure
the hurt thereof.</p>
                  <p>2. So it pertains to the office of a christian Magistrate, to fortify and assist the
godly proceedings of the Church, and namely to see that the publick estate and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50008:162"/>
ministery thereof be maintained, and sustained, as appertains to the word of God.</p>
                  <p>3. To see that the Church be not invaded, or hurt by false teachers, and hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
nor the roomes thereof occupied by dumb dogs or idle bellies.</p>
                  <p>4. To assist and maintain the discipline of the Church, and punish them civilly,
that will not obey their censures, without confounding the one jurisdiction with
the other.</p>
                  <p>5. To see that sufficient provision be made for the Ministery, Schools, and poor,
and if they have not sufficient to await upon their charges, to supply their indigence

spoiled thereof; and not to suffer the Patrimony of the Church to be applied to
profane and unlawful uses, or to be devoured by idle bellies, and such as have no
lawful function in the Church, to the hurt of the Ministery, Schools, poor, and other
godly uses, upon which the same ought to be bestowed.</p>
                  <p>7. To make laws and constitutions agreeable to Gods word for the advancement
of the Church, and policy thereof; without usurping any thing that pertains not to
the Civil sword, but belongs to the offices meerly Ecclesiastical; as the ministery of
the Word, Sacraments, or using the Ecclesiastical discipline, and spiritual execution
thereof, or any part of the spiritual keys, which the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> gave to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and their true successours.</p>
                  <p>8. And although Kings and Princes that be godly, sometime by their own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
when Churches are corrupted, and all things out of order, do place Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and restore the true service of God, after the ensample of some godly Kings
of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and divers godly Emperours and Kings also, in the dayes of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament:
yet where the ministery of the Church is once well constitute, and they
that are placed, do their office faithfully; all godly Princes and Magistrates ought
to hear and obey their voice, and reverence the Majesty of God speaking by them.</p>

God hath granted by preaching of the Word, and the true ministration of the
Sacraments within this Realm; so it is to provide that all abuses, which as yet
remain in the Church, be removed and taken away.</p>

serve not nor have any function in the reformed Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> as Abbots,

elected in time of our Soveraigns mother, when things were out of order; It is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
thing that divers of them having no function in the Church, should be Judges in
deposing Ministers from their places. Wherefore they would be either discharged
to meddle with Ecclesiastical matters, or it would be limited to them in what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they might judge, and not hurt the liberty of the Church.</p>
                  <p>31. They also that before were of the Ecclesiastical estate in the Popes Church,<note place="margin">21. Answered before.</note>
or that are admitted of new to the Papistical titles, and now tolerated by the laws
of the Realm, to possesse the two parts of their Ecclesiastical rents, ought not to
have any further liberty, but to intromet with the portion granted and assigned
unto them for their life times, and not under the abused titles; which they carry to
dispone the Church rents, setting in fewes and leases the same at their pleasure,
to the great hurt of the poor labourers that dwell upon the Church lands, and the
prejudice of the Church, contrary to good conscience and all order.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. 12. Special heads craved to be reformed.</head>
                  <p>1. WHatsoever hath been spoken of Church offices, the several power of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-bearers,
their conjunct powers, and last of the Patrimony of the
Church, we understand it to be the right reformation which God requires, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
something would be touched in particular, concerning the estate of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and that which we crave presently to be reformed in the same, we have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
them in the heads following.</p>
                  <p>2.<note place="margin">2. Agreed.</note> Seeing the whole countrey is divided in Provinces, and these Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Parishes, as well to Landwart, and in Townes, in every Parish, and
reasonable congregation there would be placed one or mo Pastors, and no Pastor
or Minister be burthened with the charge of more Churches then are allenarly.</p>
                  <p>3.<note place="margin">3. Agreed.</note> And because it will be thought hard to find out Ministers to all the parish
Churches of the Realm, we think by the advice of such as the Prince or Church
may appoint, Parishes in small villages, or to Landwart may be united, and the
principal or most commodious Church, at which the Minister resides, repaired suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently;
the rest that are not found necessary, being suffered to decay, and the
Church-yards reserved for burial places. As also where the congregation is too
large, the same would be divided.</p>
                  <p>4.<note place="margin">4. Agreed.</note> Doctors would be appointed in Universities, Colledges, and other places
needful for opening the Scriptures, and teaching the Rudiments of Religion, who
would also be sufficiently provided.</p>
                  <p>5.<note place="margin">5. Differred untill joyning of Churches.</note> As to Elders there would be in every congregation one or mo appointed for
censuring of manners, but not an Assembly of Elders, except in Towns, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
places, where men of judgement and ability may be had. And these to have
a common Eldership placed amongst them, to treat of all things that concern the
congregations, of whom they have the oversight.</p>
                  <p>6.<note place="margin">6. Agreed as depending on the former.</note> And as there ought men to be appointed for the dividing or uniting of pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
as need and commodity requires; so by the general Church with the consent
of the Prince, some that fear God, and know the estate of the countreys, would be
chosen to designe the places, where particular eldership should convene; taking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the Dioces, as they were divided of old, and of the estate of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
and Provinces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:50008:163"/>
7.<note place="margin">7. Passed over in the Article of Provincial Assemblies.</note> Likewise concerning Provincial and Synodal Assemblies consideration
would be taken, how many, and in what places they should convene; how often
the same must be referred to the liberty of the general Church.</p>
                  <p>8.<note place="margin">8. Agreed as before.</note> The National Assemblies called commonly the general, ought to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in their liberty, and have their own place, with power to the Church to
appoint times and places of meeting. And all men, as well Magistrates as subjects,
be subject to their judgement in causes Ecclesiastical, without reclamation or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
to any Judge, Civil or Ecclesiastical.</p>
                  <p>9.<note place="margin">9. Agreed to the general.</note> The liberty of electing persons to Ecclesiastical functions, observed without
interruption, so long as the Church was not corrupted by Antichrist, we desire to
be restored, and retained within this Realm; So as none be intruded upon any
congregation, either by the Prince or any other inferiour person, without lawful
election, and the assent of the people, over whom the person is placed, according
to the practise of the Apostolick and primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>10.<note place="margin">10. Referred.</note> And because this order cannot stand with Patronages, and presentation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
used in the Popes Church, we desire all those that truly fear God, to consider,
that Patronages and Benefices have no ground in the word of God, but is contrary
to the same, and to the liberty of election of Pastors, and ought not now to have
place in the light of reformation. And therefore whosoever will embrace the
light of Gods word, and desires the Kingdome of his Son <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
would also embrace, and receive the policy which the word of God craves,
otherwise it is in vain that they have professed the same.</p>
                  <p>11.<note place="margin">11. To be sought of the Parliament.</note> Notwithstanding for other patronages of Benefices not having <hi>Curam ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum,</hi>
such as Chaplanries, Prebendaries, founded upon temporal lands, annuals
or such like, they may be reserved to the ancient Patrones, and be disponed by them
to Scholars, Bursers, when they fall voyd, as they are required by Act of
Parliament.</p>
                  <p>12.<note place="margin">12. Referred to the head of Deacons.</note> As to the Church rents in general, we desire that order be maintained and
admitted, which may stand with the sincerity of Gods word and practise of the
Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the purest times thereof: That is, that the whole patrimony of
the Church (the small Patronages before mentioned being excepted) may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in four portions, one thereof to be assigned to the Pastor, for his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and keeping hospitality; another to the Elders, Deacons, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Church, as Clerks of Assemblies, takers up of Psalmes, Bedles, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Church, so farre as they are necessary, joyning therewith the Doctors of
Schooles, for help of the old foundations, where need requires; the third portion to
be bestowed upon the poor members of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the fourth upon the reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Churches, and other extraordinary charges, that are profitable to the
Church and Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>13. We desire therefore the Ecclesiastical goods to be uplifted and faithfully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
by the Deacons, to whose office the collection and distribution belongeth,
that the poor may be answered of their portion, the Ministers not distracted from
their callings, and the rest of the Thesaury of the Church, bestowed upon the
right uses.</p>
                  <p>14. If these Deacons be elected with such qualities, as Gods word requires there
is no fear to be taken of their abuse; yet because this vocation appears to be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to many, let them be obliged as they were of old in an yearly account to the
Pastors and Eldership. And if the Church and the Prince think expedient, let surety
be found for their fidelity, and that the Church rents shall no way be dilapidated.</p>
                  <p>15. And to the effect this order may take place, all other intromettors with the
Church rents, Collectors general or special, whether by the appointment of the
Prince, or otherwise, must be discharged of further intromission, and suffer the
Church rents, hereafter to be wholly intrometted with by the Deacons, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the uses before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>16. And also to the effect that the Ecclesiastical rents may suffice these uses, we
desire all alienations by fewis, or leases of the rents of the Church, as well lands, as
tithes, in diminution of the old rentals to be reduced and annulled, and the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50008:164"/>
of the Church fully restored. As likewise that in time coming the tithes be set
to none but to the labourers of the ground, as was agreed, and subscrived by the
Nobility, or then not set at all.</p>

               <div n="13" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. 13. The conclusion shewing the utility that shall flow
from this reformation to all Estates.</head>
                  <p>1. SEeing the end of this spiritual government and policy is, that God may be
glorified, the Kingdom of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> advanced, and they who are of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
body live peaceably, keeping a good conscience, we do boldly affirm that and
all who have true respect to these ends, will even for conscience cause gladly agree,
conform themselves to this order, advancing the same so far as lies in them; that their
conscience being set at rest, they may be replenished with spiritual gladnes in giving
full obedience to Gods word, and refusing all corruption contrary to the same.</p>
                  <p>Next this Realm shall become an ensample and pattern of good and godly order
to other Nations, Countreys, and Churches, professing the same Religion; that as
they have praised God for our continuing in the sincerity of the Word without all
errours; so they may have the like occasion when we shall conform our selves to that
discipline, policy, and good order, which the same Word and purity of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
craves at our hands; otherwise that fearful sentence may be justly said to us,
<hi>That servant that knoweth the Masters will and doth it not, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Moreover, if we have any pity or respect of the poor members of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
who greatly increase and multiply amongst us, we will not suffer them to be longer
defrauded of that part of the patrimony of the Church, that justly belongeth to
them. And by this order, if it be duly put in execution, the burthen of the poor shall
be taken off the countrey, and the streets cleansed of their cryings, and murmurings,
so as we shall not be any more a scandal to other Nations, as we have hitherto been.</p>
                  <p>4. Besides, it shall be a great ease and commodity to the whole Commons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
them of the building and repairing of their Churches, Bridges, and other like
publick works; It shall be a relief to the labourers of the ground in paiment of their
tithes, and all other things, wherein they have hitherto been rigorously used by them
that were falsely called Churchmen, and their Tasksmen, Factours, Chamberlains,
and Extortioners.</p>
                  <p>5. Finally to the Kings Majesty and Estate this profit shall redound, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Church being sufficiently provided, according to the foresaid distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the <hi>Superplus</hi> may be liberally bestowed for the supporting the Princes estate,
and the affairs of the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>6. So to conclude all, being willing to apply themselves to this order, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
suffering themselves to be ruled according thereto, the Princes and Magistrates
not exempted, and they that are placed in the Ecclesiastical estate, ruling and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
rightly; God shall be glorified, the Church edified, and the bounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
enlarged, <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> and his kingdome advanced, Satan and the kingdome of
darknesse subverted, and God shall dwell in the midst of us to our comfort in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> who with the Father and Holy Ghost, abideth blessed in all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
AMEN.</p>
                  <p>This was the form of policy presented to the Parliament,<note place="margin">This was the course the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly took for admitting this form of policy.</note> and the effect of the
Commission granted for the same, such general heads as did not touch the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the King, nor prejudge the liberty of the Estate, were easily agreed. The
rest were passed over, or deferred as we have seen, to further reasoning, which could
not after this time be obtained of the Councel, one excuse or other being still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
The Ministers perceiving they would not speed this way, did in their next
Assembly resolve to put their conclusions in practise, without insisting any more
for ratification thereof. And beginning with Mr. <hi>Iames Boyd</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi> urged to submit himself.</note>
whom they hoped to find most tractable, he was desired to submit himself to
the Assembly, and to suffer the corruptions of the Episcopal estate to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in his person. After long reasoning kept with him by the Moderator <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50008:164"/>
Ferguson</hi> and some others, he presented his answer in writing.</p>
                  <p>I understand the name, office, and reverence given to a Bishop to be lawful and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the Scriptures of God,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops answer presented in writing.</note> and being elected by the Church and King to be Bishop of
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> I esteem my calling and office lawful, and shall endevour with all my power to
perform the duties required, submitting my self to the judgement of the Church, if I shall
be tried to offend, so as nothing be required of me, but the performance of those duties which
the Apostle prescribeth. As to the rent, living, and priviledges granted to me and my
successours, I think I may lawfully, and with a good conscience enjoy the same. And for
assisting the King with my best service in Councel and Parliament, as my subjection
ties me thereto; so I esteem it no hurt, but a benefit to the Church, that some of their number
should be alwayes present at the making of Lawes and Statutes, wherein for my self I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intend, nor by the grace of God shall ever do any thing, but that which I believe may
stand with the purity of the word of God, and the good of the Church and countrey.</p>
                  <p>This answer read in open Assembly was judged insufficient,<note place="margin">The answer doth not content be Assembly.</note> and he required to
bethink himself better, and be present in the after-noon. But he excusing himself,
returned not to the Assembly, whereupon Commission was given to Mr. <hi>Andrew
Hay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> and some brethren in the West, to urge his subscription
to the Act made at <hi>Striveling</hi> for reformation of the estate Episcopal; and if he did
refuse, to proceed against him with the censures of the Church. The Bishop taking
grievously these proceedings, and having received about the same time a great
wrong at the hands of his Cousen <hi>Robert Boyd</hi> of <hi>Baydinheth,</hi> by the demolishing of
the house of <hi>Lockwood,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop contracts sicknesse, and dieth.</note> which is in the Barony of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> contracted a melancholy,
whereof he died not long after at <hi>Glasgow.</hi> Nothing did more grieve him, then the
ingratitude of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> and his uncourteous formes; he had brought the
man to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> placed him Principal in the Colledge, bestowed otherwise liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon him, and was paid for this his kindnesse with most disgraceful contempt. In
private, and at the Bishops table (to which he was ever welcome) no man did use
him with greater respect, giving him his titles of dignity and honour; but in the
publick meetings where he owed him greatest reverence, he would call him by his
proper name, and use him most uncivilly. The Commission of the Assembly he
exerced with all rigour, and by threatening the Bishop with the censures of the
Church, induced him to set his hand to certain Articles, which as he professed in his
sicknesse, did sore vex his mind; yet being comforted by Mr. <hi>Andrew Polwart</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean
of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> he departed this life in great quietnesse He was a wise, learned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Prelate, and worthy to have lived in better times, then he fell into. His
corps was solemnly buried in the Quire of the Cathedral, and laid in the sepulchre
of Mr. <hi>Gawan Dumbar,</hi> one of his predecessors.</p>
                  <p>The small respect carried to Bishops in these Assemblies of the Church,<note place="margin">The conditions prescribed to Bishops.</note> made
them dishaunt, and come no more unto the same. Yet matters went on, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Archbishop of <hi>S. Andrews</hi> did absent himself, Commission was given to
certain of their number to call him before them, and charge him to remove the
corruptions in the estates of Bishops in his own person, which they reckoned to be
seven; ordaining him and the Bishops that would submit themselves to correction,
to set their hands to the conditions following.
<list>
                        <item>1. That they should be content to be Ministers and Pastors of a flock.</item>
                        <item>2. That they should not usurp any criminal jurisdiction.</item>
                        <item>3. That they should not vote in Parliament in name of the Church, unlesse they
had a Commission from the general Assembly.</item>
                        <item>4. That they should not take up for maintaining their ambition, the rents which
might maintain many Pastors, Schooles, and poor, but content themselves
with a reasonable portion for discharging their office.</item>
                        <item>5. That they should not claim the title of temporal Lords, nor usurp any Civil
jurisdiction, whereby they might be withdrawn from their charge.</item>
                        <item>6. That they should not empire over Presbyteries, but be subject to the same.</item>
                        <item>7. That they should not usurp the power of Presbyteries, nor take upon them
to visit any bounds that were not committed to them by the Church.</item>

                           <pb n="304" facs="tcp:50008:165"/>
Lastly, it was provided, that if any more corruptions should afterwards be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Bishops should agree to have them reformed.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>What troubles hereupon arose, both in the Church and Countrey, we shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
hear.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Glasgow</hi> the next spring there happened a little disturbance by this occasion.<note place="margin">A tumult in <hi>Glasgow</hi> for pulling down the Cathedral.</note>
The Magistrates of the City by the earnest dealing of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> and
other Ministers, had condescended to demolish the Cathedral, and build with the
materials thereof some little Churches in other parts for the ease of the Citizens.
Divers reasons were given for it; such as the resort of superstitious people to do their
devotion in that place; the huge vastnesse of the Church, and that the voice of a
Preacher could not be heard by the multitudes that convened to Sermon; the more
commodious service of the people; and the removing of that idolatrous monument
(so they called it) which was of all the Cathedrals in the Countrey only left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruined,
and in a possibility to be repaired. To do this work, a number of Quarriers,
Masons, and other workmen was conduced, and the day assigned when it should
take beginning. Intimation being given thereof, and the workmen by sound of a
Drum warned to go unto their work, the Crafts of the City in a tumult took
Armes, swearing with many oathes, that he who did cast down the first stone,
should be buried under it. Neither could they be pacified, till the workmen were
discharged by the Magistrates. A complaint was hereupon made, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals
cited before the Councel for insurrection; where the King, not as then thirteen
years of age,<note place="margin">The matter brou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ht before the Councel.</note> taking the protection of the Crafts, did allow the opposition they had
made, and inhibited the Ministers (for they were the complainers) to meddle any
more in that businesse, saying, <hi>That too many Churches had been already destroyed, and
that he would not tolerate more abuses in that kind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A little before this time the Abbot of <hi>Dunfermlin</hi> being returned from <hi>England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Abbot of <hi>Dunfermlin</hi> returned from <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note>
related in Councel the effects of his negotiation, and was approved by all. For that
which he had in Commission touching the Lady <hi>Lennox,</hi> he remitted the answer to
the Queens own letters delivered to the King. Concerning the <hi>disorders fallen out in the
Borders,</hi> the Queen, he said, did accept the excuse he made in good part, saying, she
was assured,<note place="margin">The report of his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that both the King and Councel were offended therewith, and that she
was content the same should be redressed by the advice of the Wardens on both
sides: onely desired that in time coming the King would make choice of wise and
experienced men, inclined to peace and justice, to command in those parts. As to the
<hi>League,</hi> he declared that the Queen had a good inclination unto it; holding the
same a most sure means to represse the practises of enemies both at home and
abroad: But in regard he had no warrant to descend into particulars, he had abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from any dealing therein, and could not but testify, that he saw in her a great
care of the King his good Estate, and that both he and his message were most kindly
accepted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King in this mean time to pacify the Borders,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Ruthven</hi> made Lieutenant of the Borders.</note> 
                     <hi>which were broken loose,
chiefly in the West parts, gave the Lord</hi> Ruthven <hi>a Commission of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandry,
which he discharged with great commendation, and bringing with him the
Lord</hi> Maxwel, <hi>who was Warden of the bounds, returned to</hi> Striveling <hi>the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of</hi> Ianuary. <hi>A frequent Councel was there kept for the time, wherein the
Lord</hi> Maxwel <hi>being challenged of negligence in his office, did answer,</hi> That he had
only the title of a Warden, and that the limitations of his charge, and the exceptions
granted to the Gentlemen of the Countrey made the office needlesse and contemptible. But
if the King should be pleased to discharge the exceptions, and give him a free Commission,
such as his predecessors had wont to have, he should strive to do his best service to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and the Countrey. <hi>This answer was not well taken, and the Lord</hi> Hereis <hi>(as one
known to have greatest experience in these matters) being desired to give his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
delivered the same in a long speech, to this purpose.</hi> Your Majesty, <hi>said he,</hi>
hath in deliberation a businesse of great importance, whereof it were more fitting any man
should give his opinion, then I, by reason of the suspicion I stand in with the present War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
for what I say, will be interpreted to proceed of spleen, and of a desire to have the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50008:165"/>
charge taken from him,<note place="margin">An. 1579.</note> and not of any care I take of your Majesties service, or the good
and benefit of the Countrey, yet seeing your Majesty commands me to speak, I will rather
hazard on such misinterpretings, then keep back any thing which I know to be useful and
necessary for the errand. And what I speak, I desire it to be understood of the West mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
onely, to which my experience chiefly reacheth. But because the evils would first be
known, I will begin at them, and then propone the fittest and most easie remedies to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
Sir, a little before the death of your Majesties Noble Grandfather King <hi>James</hi>
the fifth, some few disloyal subjects of this Realm fleeing into <hi>England,</hi> did plant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a parcel of waste ground, that lies opposite to the West Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
being maintained by the <hi>English</hi> grew unto such numbers, and became so insolent, as they
made daily incursions upon the Countrey. Your Majesties Grandfather did hereupon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
certain forces against them, intending to sack and destroy their houses, and make them
unable from thenceforth to annoy his subjects. But these forces not being rightly governed,
and lacking the provision that was required for such an enterprise, were put to the worse,
and shamefully discomfited. At that time, what by ransoming prisoners, what by the spoyl
they got, they gained above one hundred thousand Merks, wherewith, and by the depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they have made since that time, they are become wealthy, have built eight or nine
strong houses upon the frontiers of your Realm, that no Wardens power is able to force. They
have joyned in alliance with divers of our own Borders, as wickedly disposed as themselves,
and are so feared, that every man is glad of their friendship; without which none is thought
to have any surety, either of life or goods. When your Grandfather departed this life, which
was in the year 1542. they did not exceed the number of 20. or 30. men at most. Now
they are growne to three or four hundred, dwell nigh to others, are well armed, have good
horses, and upon a simple shout are ready to joyn in defence one of another. The Borderers
on the <hi>Scots</hi> side are not in this condition; for the space of twenty miles, there is not a
strength in which an honest man may sleep safe, no town nor strong hold to retire unto in
time of necessity, neither is the countrey populous, nor is it fruitful, the ground being a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
ground, barren and profitable only for the bestial, the people that inhabit the same,
poor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unruly, and not subject to order. So what for the number of these wicked men, that live
in the <hi>English</hi> Borders, what for the evil disposition of our own, it is a charge most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
to guard these marches, and to contain the people from doing or receiving wrong. The
only remedy in this time of peace is, to keep our own countreymen in awe and fear of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
so as neither they break loose themselves, nor have any dealing with their neighbours
under hand, in their wicked practices. And how this may be done most surely, your
Majesty and this honourable Councel is to think; my opinion I have set down in some Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which I humbly submit to your Majesties and Councels censure.</p>
                  <p>Having thus spoken, he presented a writing containing these heads.
<list>

countrey, of which number two should be of the name of <hi>Iohnston;</hi> and lest
their chief should think the Wardens proceeding against his followers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and done out of old rancor, that a moderate course should be kept in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscation

<hi>Iohnston,</hi> should remain nigh to the Warden, and when the Lord <hi>Maxwell</hi>
hath not the charge, that he be obliged to dwell in the house of <hi>Langhome,</hi> or
if he be Warden himself, that he maintain a Captain therein, with twelve
horsemen to be ready upon all occasions.</item>

honest man to watch and give warning to the countrey where the fray is,
and a husband land allowed him for his service.</item>
                        <item>7. That the lands called <hi>The debateable lands</hi> be visited; that it may be known
how much thereof is claimed by the broken men of the countrey to be
their steedings, and security taken of them for keeping good order.</item>
                        <item>8. That dayes of truce be kept every 40. days once, or within two moneths

                        <item>Lastly, that his Majesty every year in the moneth of <hi>September,</hi> send one or two of
the Councel to try the estate of the countrey, what duty the Warden doth,
and if the Barons and landed men do give their assistance, that where any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

                  <p>At these Articles the Lord <hi>Maxwel</hi> took exception,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Maxwel</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth against the Articles.</note> especially at the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;

and that any part of the Escheats should be given to the Laird of <hi>Iohnston,</hi>
he held it prejudicial to the Wardens office, and said it would be an occasion for
other Barons to suite the like. But that which did most displease him (though this
he dissembled) was, that any should be joyned with him as assisters: for he would
needs be absolute in these parts, and have all to depend of him, which ambition he
still nourished, and thereby in end wrought his own ruine. Yet the King not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to displace him (for he understood his power to be great in these marches) made
offer to continue him in the charge, and to allow him a company of 24. horsemen,
with a Captain for repressing the outlawes, upon three conditions. First, that he
should take the advice of the Barons of the countrey in all affairs, and proceed in the
ministring of justice by their counsel. Next, that none should be declared fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives,
but by their consents. And thirdly, that the servants of landed men
should not be apprehended, till their Masters were first charged to exhibit them,
unlesse they were taken in the fact, and as they speak <hi>with the red <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself, and professing a great willingnesse to give his attendance to any

and the custody of the West Marches committed to him.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this year (to wit,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> dieth.</note> upon the 24. of <hi>April,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi>
died at <hi>Kincarne,</hi> of a sicknesse contracted in <hi>Striveling,</hi> where he and some other
Noblemen had been feasted by the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> and as report speaketh always
the worst of great mens deaths, so the rumour at this time went, that <hi>Morton</hi> had
made him away by poyson: which his Lady and friends did so strongly apprehend, as
when the Councel was examining the Physitians that embalmed his corps, whether
they perceived any sign of poyson at his unbowelling, they took upon protestation
that the trial of the Councel should not prejudge the criminal pursuit, which they
intended before the Justice. And albeit the Physitians did upon their oathes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that his death was not caused by any extraordinary mean, yet the scandal
was fostered a long time by a sort of rhyming Libels, which were afterwards tried
to be composed by one <hi>Turnbull</hi> a Schoolmaster at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Certain Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers executed at <hi>Striveling.</hi>

Summer.</p>
                  <p>A consultation was held at the same time in <hi>Striveling,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Commission for apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his brother Lord <hi>Claud.</hi>

of the two Regents, which by the edict of pacification was delayed unto the
King his assuming of the government in his own person. Touching the form of
proceeding, the opinions of those that were privy to the businesse were different:
for some thought that the persons who were suspected, should be summoned to a
day and form of proces kept with them; others judged that there needed no such
formality, seeing the Authours were known, and the sentence of forfeiture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50008:166"/>
against them, stood unreduced. To use a citation they said, was to give
them warning to flee, whereas otherwise they might be taken unprovided, and
brought to their censure. At last it was agreed that a Commission should be given
to some Noblemen that had power, and affected the businesse, to apprehend them.
This Commission was given to the Earls of <hi>Morton, Marre,</hi> and <hi>Eglinton,</hi> and to
the Lords of <hi>Ruthven, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

advertisement went to the Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his brother Lord <hi>Claud,</hi> so as they

of <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Draffan,</hi> which belonged to the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> their elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and were possessed by the Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> as administrator to his brother
because of his disease. The Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> himself they had kept in the Castle of
<hi>Draffan,</hi> attended by some servants, and he was known to have no part in any of
these facts, wherewith they were charged, so as by way of justice his estate could not
fall under forfeiture; yet some colour of right behoved to be made for bringing the
same under the Courts disposing. To this effect it was devised, that a complaint
should be preferred in the name of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and his Majesties Advocates,
bearing the miserable condition of the said Earl, and how he was detained in close
prison by his two brothers without fire, aire, and the company of his honest

out) he ought to have had Curators given him by the King; and if he was <hi>mentis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi>
it was an intolerable wrong to use him in that sort. Therefore desired letters
to be directed for his exhibition before the Councel, that it might be known in
what estate he was, and an honourable provision appointed unto him, such as befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his birth and condition. This desire being judged reasonable, summons were
directed against the two brothers that were fled, and they not appearing at the day,
were denounced Rebels. But this not sufficing to work their ends, the disobedience
of the Keepers in not rendring the strengths when they were charged, was made
the Earls crime, and he found to have incurred the pain of treason; an act of the
greatest injustice that could be done. Notthelesse upon this ground were both the
Castles at that time demolished, and Captain <hi>Iames Stewart</hi> afterwards preferred
to the Earldome of <hi>Arran.</hi>

was put off to a new Commission.<note place="margin">The King wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Church.</note> Some moneths before, the King had required
them, by a letter directed with <hi>Iohn Doncanson</hi> his Minister, to abstain from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any novation in the Church policy, and to suffer things to continue in the
state wherein they were, unto the Parliament approaching; without prejudging the
decision of the Estates by their conclusions. But they neglecting the letter, went
to examine the conference kept at <hi>Striveling</hi> the year preceding, and whereas in
that conference divers heads were remitted to a further consultation, they ordained
nothing to be altered either in form or matter, of that which amongst themselves
was concluded. They further called the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> in question
for granting collations upon some Benefices, and for giving voice in Parliament,
not being authorized thereto by the Church. This did so displease the King, as from
that time forth he did not countenance the Ministers as in former times, and upon
the complaint of persons who otherwise deserved not much regard (that the Church
might find in what need they stood of his favour) he suffered divers sentences to

                  <p>This dissension betwixt the King and the Church brought with it many evils,<note place="margin">Jesuits and Priests resort to the countrey.</note>
for upon the notice of it divers Jesuits and Priests did resort into the countrey, and
at home, such as were Popishly affected, began openly to avow their profession. In
S. <hi>Andrews</hi> Mr. <hi>Nicholl Burn</hi> professor of Philosophy in S. <hi>Leonards</hi> Colledge, made
open Apostasie from the truth; as Mr. <hi>Archihald</hi> and <hi>Iohn Hamiltons</hi> Regents in
the new Colledge, had (not long before) done. In <hi>Dumfreis</hi> Mr. <hi>Ninean Daliel</hi>
Schoolmaster, did read to his Scholars the <hi>Romane</hi> Catechisme, and in <hi>Paisley</hi> a
number of Papists assembling together, did in derision sing a <hi>Soule Masse</hi> for the
Ministers, as if they and their religion had been utterly gone. These things
being complained of, and not much hearkened to, the Ministers in their Sermons
fell to regrate the countenance given to Papists in the Court, and the dangers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

the Nobleman was brought in a short space, to joyn himself to the Church,
and openly in S. <hi>Giles</hi> to renounce the errours wherein he had been educated. Yet
did not this remove the jealousies of the people, which were increased by the interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting

in doctrine,<note place="margin">A confession of faith formed because of the dispensations from <hi>Rome.</hi>

swear and subscribe; the like was done by the whole Councel &amp; Court; and observers
appointed to take notice of those that did not resort to Sermon, or behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in any sort scandalously. So careful was the King to have the Church satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and the rumours of the Courts defection from Religion repressed.</p>
                  <p>After this all things continued quiet for a while,<note place="margin">A rumour rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against the Earl of <hi>Morton.</hi>

otherwise advise him; for he knew her Majesties good affection, and would not
forget the care she had of him in his tender age. That he could not be justly blamed

                     <note place="margin">An Assembly of the Church, with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against the Bishops.</note> 
                     <hi>the Assembly of the Church had convened at</hi> Dundy,
<hi>where it was concluded,</hi> That the office of a Bishop as it was then used, and commonly
taken within the Realm, had neither foundation, ground, nor warrant in the word of God;
and thereupon an Ordinance was made, that all persons either called to the said office, or
that should be called thereto at any time thereafter, should be charged to dimit and forsake
the same, as an office whereunto they are not called of God. As also to desist and cease from
preaching, ministring the Sacraments, or using in any sort the office of a Pastor, till they
should be admitted of new of the general Assembly, under the pain of excommunication. <hi>In
the end of the Act it was directed,</hi> That concerning the patrimony of the Church pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
by the Bishops, the next Assembly should reason and advise upon the disponing
thereof.</p>
                  <p>Whether the folly or iniquity of this Ordinance was greater,<note place="margin">The iniquity of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> it can hardly be
said; for granting that the office of a Bishop had been as they judged unlawful,
there was no reason to discharge them of using the ministerial office, till they should
be received of new. And what a foolish thing was it to think that the Prince and
Estates would permit the rents of the Bishops to be disponed at their appetites? They
saw what was done with the other Prelaces, and how the Abbots and Priors were
no sooner declared to be no office-bearers in the Church, but presently they turned
temporal Lords, and carried the rents with them quite away from the Church.
And could they look for other dealing with the Bishopricks? sure it was, if the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulars
themselves did not find the credit to enjoy them, that others of the Laity
would have invaded the same, as afterwards also they did.</p>
                  <p>But to passe this,<note place="margin">A letter from the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> to the Assembly.</note> the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> desiring by all means to win the favour of
the Church, sent to this Assembly Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi> a brother of <hi>Traquaire,</hi> with
a letter to this effect; <hi>That it was not unknown to them, how it had pleased God to bring
him since his coming into the countrey, to the knowledge of the truth, which he esteemed
more then all worldly happinesse, and that he had made open profession thereof, first in</hi>
S. Giles <hi>Church at</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>and afterwards subscribed the confession of faith at</hi> Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<hi>and was yet, if any farther was thought needful, ready to perform whatsoever should
be required: assuring them of his best advice in all things tending to God his glory, and
to the good of the Church, requesting, together with the assistance of their prayers, that he
might continue in their good favours.</hi> But all this could not remove their suspicions of
his counterfeiting, still he was taxed in publick Sermons, and made odious to
the people. Neither was it long after this assembly dissolved, that <hi>Iohn Dury</hi> one of
the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was called before the Councel,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn Dury</hi> committed to the Castle.</note> and committed in the
Castle for certain speeches of that kind uttered by him in Pulpit, but upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of his fellow Ministers and promise of forbearing, he was after a short stay
in the Castle, licenced to return to his charge.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>October</hi> following, Mr. <hi>Iohn Row</hi> Minister of <hi>Perth</hi> departed this life, who

                     </note> In his
younger years having applied his mind to letters, and taking the degree of a Master

then much frequented) and grew to be so skilled in the Canon law, as he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
to negotiate the affairs of the Church in the Court of <hi>Rome. Iulius</hi> the third
did then govern that See, of whom he was well accepted, and in possibility to have
attained unto some preferment, if he would have stayed there, for he gained the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of all to whom he was known; and was in special grace with <hi>Guido Ascanius
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:50008:169"/>
Sfortia,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Sancta Flora,</hi> who made such account of his skill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the lawes, that he would have him pass Doctor in the University, whereof
he was Chancellor. After some eight or nine years abode in those parts coming
home to visit his countrey, and giving account of the affairs, wherewith he had been
trusted, he found the state of the Church quite overturned, and the countrey all in
tumult, by the reformation which was then in hand. Thereupon doubting what
course then to take, and minding to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was disswaded by the Prior
of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> who held him in good esteem, and afterwards induced by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> to betake himself to the Ministery, which he exercised a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
space at ... in <hi>Fife,</hi> till by the General Assembly he was translated to

                     </note> his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand

having called to mind the services done by the Nobleman in his Majesties
minority, and chiefly the diligence he had used in finding out and punishing the
murtherers of his Father, which by the malice of his adversaries was now laid to his
charge, he requested in the name of the Queen his Mistris, that the Nobleman might
be released from his Ward, declaring that her Majesty would esteem it a singular
kindnesse done unto her, and otherwise would take it ill to be denied in so just and
reasonable a matter.<note place="margin">His Majesties answer to the Ambassadour.</note> The King after he had heard him patiently, made answer,
<hi>That the many good offices he had received from his sister the Queen, did tie him to a
thankfull requital, but in that particular which touched him so nigh, (the trial of his Fathers
murther) he knew she would excuse him; alwayes, because of her intercession, he would be the
more careful to have the trial rightly carried, and as liberty had been given to his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
to accuse, so the like, and greater should be allowed him for his defence.</hi>

                  <p>The Assembly of the Estates being called at the same time,<note place="margin">An Assembly of the Estates.</note> and the Ambassador

made Iustice there to cease, and hath practised with forair Princes for the invading of</hi>

Queen his Mistris. <hi>But this beyond all measure doth grieve her, that a Prince of such
hopes, joyned in such neerness of blood, and for whom she had taken so great care, should be

for performance both of the one, and other. But this combination held not long,
being quickly discovered and broken. Of all the number, <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Marre</hi> onely

and of being <hi>art and part</hi> (as the phrase is) in committing the same. He denied all,
and pleaded not guilty. The Jutors being called, he excepted against <hi>Argile,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> and the Laird <hi>Waughton,</hi> yet they were all received upon their purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they had not given any counsel to his hurt or prejudice. This done,<note place="margin">Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</note> and
they all sworne according to the custome, they went apart, and after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
a while, returning into the Court, the Earl of <hi>Montrosse</hi> Chancellor of the
Assise, declared him convict of counsel, concealing, and being art and part of the
Kings murther. At these last words he shewed himself much grieved, and beating
the ground once or twice with a little staffe he carried in his hand, said, <hi>Art and part,
art and part! God knoweth the contrary.</hi> When doom was given, that he should be
taken to the place of execution, hanged on the gibbet, have his head cut off, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
quartered and affixed in the most publick places, he uttered not a word, nor did
he seem to be moved therewith, and because it was drawing towards night, he was
conveyed back to the lodging wherein he was kept.</p>
                  <p>In the morning Mr. <hi>Iames Lawson,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Ministers conference with the Earl of <hi>Morton.</hi>
                     </note> with two or three other Ministers, did visit
him. They asking how he had rested that night, he answered, that of a long time
he had not slept more soundly; <hi>Now I am,</hi> saith he, <hi>at an end of my troubles, some nights
before my trial, I was thinking what to answer for my self, and that kept me from sleep,
but this night I had no such thoughts.</hi> Then falling to speak of his present case, and the
sentence pronounced against him, they said that he should do well to unburthen his
mind, and declare what his part was of the Kings murther, he answered with a great
attestation that he never gave consent to that wicked fact. <hi>The Earl Bothwel,</hi> said
he, <hi>upon my return from</hi> England, <hi>(where I remained a while, because of Seignior</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
<hi>slaughter) came to me in</hi> Whittingham, <hi>and after a long discourse brake the matter
unto me, saying, that the Queen would have the King taken away, for that she blamed
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:50008:170"/>
him more of</hi> Davies <hi>mother, then all the actors; and asked, What would my part be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?
I made him this answer, that being newly relieved of a great trouble, I would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
enter into another, and that I would have no medling in that businesse. He not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with my answer, insisted to have me consent, saying, The Queen would have it done.
If so be, said I, bring me the Queens hand-writing, that I may know that it is her mind.
This he never did, and if he had brought it, I was fully resolved to have turned my back
upon</hi> Scotland, <hi>and banisht my self, till I saw better times.</hi> Next, they inquired whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mr. <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> had any dealing with him in that purpose. Whereunto he
answered, that Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> (being at that time a depender upon <hi>Bothwell)</hi> did
bring him (he being then at S. <hi>Andrews</hi>) a letter from <hi>Bothwell,</hi> containing credit
and that he travelled to perswade him to give his assistance to that fact: but he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
himself, because he saw no warrant from the Queen, as <hi>Bothwell</hi> had promised.
After the murther committed, he said, that Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> came again unto
him, and told him that he did accompany <hi>Bothwell</hi> and <hi>Huntley</hi> to the place,
and was assisting to the fact. <hi>Therefore can I not not deny,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I foreknew
and concealed the same; but to whom should I have revealed it? for the King when he
was advertised of the danger, would not believe it; But they have condemned me of art
and part,</hi> said he, <hi>which is more then concealing; but as I wish God to be merciful to me
now at my last, I never gave counsel nor consent thereto.</hi> The Ministers replying that he
could not justly complain of the sentence, being guilty of foreknowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
by his own declaration; he acknowledged the same to be true, but saith he,
<hi>It would have gone alike with me, if I had been as innocent as S.</hi> Steven, <hi>or as guilty as</hi>
Judas. <hi>But of that I am not to complain, nor will I stand to my justification, being assured,
howsoever men have carried themselves in it, God hath dealt justly with me; and that I
am to suffer nothing, but that which I have merited, yea worse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This confession reported to the King,<note place="margin">The sentence mitigated.</note> the rigour of the sentence was mitigated,
and order given that he should be beheaded only, and his body committed to buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
In the afternoon, when it was told him by his Keeper, that the time was come,
and all things were in a readinesse,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arran</hi> desireth <hi>Morton</hi> to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> he said, <hi>I praise God I am also ready:</hi> And making
forth was met by the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> in the very entry, who desired him to stay, and
subscribe his confession; he answered, <hi>I pray you trouble me not, for I am now to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
my self for death, and cannot write in this estate.</hi> The Earl ceasing to urge that
point any further, desired he might be reconciled with him, protesting that he had
done nothing upon any particular grudge:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Morton</hi> his Answer.</note> he answered, <hi>It was no time to reckon
quarrels, I forgive you and all others.</hi> When he was come to the scaffold, which was
erected in the publick street, he repeated the substance of his confession; and in
some few words exhorted the people to continue in the profession of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and maintain it at their power, intreating them to assist him with their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God. The chief Minister did then conceive a prayer, during the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he lay prostrate upon his face, and was greatly moved, as appeared by the reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with many sobbes and sighs. The prayer ended, divers came to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Morton</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour at his death.</note> whom he received very kindly, all the rest that were on the scaffold
he took by the hand, bidding them farewell, and going towards the Block, laid down
his head, and cried aloud; <hi>In thine hand O Lord I commit my spirit: Lord Iesus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
my soule.</hi> Which words he was still uttering, when as the axe fell, and cut off
his head. His corps left on the place, lay from the hour of execution to Sunne-set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
covered with a beggerly cloak, every man fearing to shew any kindnesse, or so
much as to expresse a sign of sorrow; his corps was afterwards carried by some base
fellowes to the common sepulchre, and his head fixed on the <hi>Tolbuith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never was seen a more notable example of fortunes mutability;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mortons</hi> quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and good parts.</note> he who a few
years before had been reverenced of all men, and feared as a King, abounding in
wealth, honour and number of friends and followers; was now at his end forsaken
of all, and made the very scorne of fortune; to teach men how little stability there is
in honour, wealth, friendship and the rest of these worldly things, which men so
much admire. He was of personage comely, of a men stature, and a graceful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and singular courage; whereof in the civil troubles he gave many proofes;
wise and able for government, a lover of justice, order, and policy; but inclined to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50008:170"/>
covetousness, which the wants and necessity he indured in his younger years, was
thought to have caused; and given too much to the pleasures of the flesh, as at his
dying he acknowledged with a great remorse. In this lastly most happy, that though
his death in the worlds eye was shameful and violent, yet did he take it most pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
quitting this life with the assurance of a better.</p>
                  <p>The day following,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arrans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding against <hi>Morton</hi> and his servants appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> in Councel made a discourse of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in the trial of <hi>Morton,</hi> declaring what he had done, and how to come to
the knowledge of the fact, for which he had suffered, he was forced to use some ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
dealing towards his servants, and put certain of them to the torture: lest
this should be imputed to him as a crime, his desire was to have his Majesties and the
Councels approbation. This was easily obtained, and an Act made ratifying all
that he had done in that business, as good service to his Majesty and the Estate;
Yet was it well enough known, that the inquisition he made upon <hi>Mortons</hi> servants,
was to find out where his gold and money was hidden,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arran</hi> his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Countesse of <hi>Marche.</hi>
                     </note> and for no purpose else.
Near about the same time, he took to wife the Earl of <hi>Marche</hi> his Lady, a woman
intolerable in all the imperfections incident to that sexe. She had forsaken her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
not long before, and obtained sentence against him for alleadged impotency,
yet was she known to be with child even then by <hi>Arran,</hi> which made the Proces
on her part more shameful; nor was his part a whit better, nay rather much worse;
having been a long time entertained in the Noblemans house, and furnished by him
in every thing necessary, whilest his estate was but yet mean; to have repayed the
Nobleman so dishonourably, was accounted a vile ingratitude. The marriage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
went on, and their unlawful love held that way legitimated.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>August</hi> next the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> was created Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> Lord <hi>Robert
Stewart</hi> Uncle to the King by his Mother made Earl of <hi>Orkney, William</hi> Lord <hi>Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
Earl of <hi>Gowry,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Maxwel</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton. Arran</hi> although he
had assumed the title before, would then also be created Earl, which was done
with great solemnity, and the first place bestowed on him, for he would not endure
to be second to any, and took so ill the credit which he saw the Duke carried with
the King, as he spared not to affront him at all occasions. The Laird of <hi>Farnherst</hi>
was then newly returned from <hi>France,</hi> where he had lived divers years in exile, and
by the Dukes favour, to whom the King could deny nothing, had respit given
him for certain crimes committed in the Kings minority. As it was passing in
Councel, the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> did protest against it, alleadging an oath made at <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
by the Counsellors, not to give way to respits, or remissions granted to the
Kings enemies. Herewith the Duke offended, and a great heart-burning grew
amongst them, which in the Parliament kept at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the moneth of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
following, burst forth in an open breach. The question was about some privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
belonging to the Chamberlain in time of Parliament, which <hi>Arran</hi> would
not acknowledge, taking upon him, as Captain of the Guard, to place near unto the
King whom he pleased. The Duke not induring this insolency, absented himself
from Parliament, which did so irritate the King, as the next day he went to <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith,</hi>
taking the Duke with him, and charged <hi>Arran</hi> not to come towards Court.
Many were glad to see them thus committed amongst themselves, and for a while
matters went so hot, as it was not expected the discord should be suddenly appeased.
The Duke had the advantage of the Kings favour, <hi>Arran</hi> strengthened himself
with the common cause, giving out that the quarrel was for religion, and for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Dukes courses, who craftily sought the overthrow thereof. And all this
time this frowning of the Court continued, you should have seen him and his Lady
repair so devoutly to Sermon and prayers, that the people believed this to be the
ground of the dissension, and that he was only disliked for his sincerity in Religion.
But <hi>Arran</hi> knowing this would not long bear out, and fearing to lose the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
altogether, he imployed some friends to make offer of satisfaction to the
Duke; and in end things were so composed; as <hi>Arran</hi> did quit the commandment of
the Guard, and the charge thereof was given to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>To return to the matters of the Church, there was a general Synod this year kept
at <hi>Glasgow</hi> in the moneth of <hi>April,</hi> wherein the question of Bishops was again agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50008:171"/>
and because of the scruples which some brethren had at the Act concluded in
<hi>Dundy</hi> the year preceding, especially where it was said, <hi>that the office of a Bishop had
no warrant of the word of God;</hi> the Assembly declared, that their meaning was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the estate of Bishops as they were then in <hi>Scotland.</hi> A number of the more wise
and moderate sort interceded, that the conclusion of that matter might be for a time
deferred, because of the inconveniences it would draw upon the Church, but they
were cried down by the multitude. Amongst others, one Mr. <hi>Robert Montgomery</hi>
Minister at <hi>Striveling,</hi> was so servent in the cause, as he would have the Assembly
censure those that had spoken in defence of that corrupted estate. Yet before the
end of that year, this zealous man did suffer himself to be more pitifully corrupted,
the story whereof shall now be related: The See of <hi>Glasgow</hi> being then voyd, it
was suggested to the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> by some flatterers, that he had a fair occasion
presented, to make himself Lord of that City, and of the lands pertaining to that
See, if he should only procure a gift thereof to some one that would make a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same to him and his heirs. The offer was made to divers, who refused all,
because of the condition required;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Montgomery</hi> his Simoniacal bargain for the Bishoprick of <hi>Glasgow.</hi>
                     </note> At last, the agents in that businesse fell upon
this <hi>Montgomery,</hi> who was content to accept it. A gift was thereupon formed, and a
Bond given by him, <q>That how soon he was admitted Bishop, he should dispone
the Lands, Lordships, and whatsoever belongeth to that Prelacy, to the Duke
and his heirs, for the yearly paiment of one thousand pounds <hi>Scots,</hi> with some
horse-corn and poultry.</q> A vile bargain it was, for which justly he ought to have
been repulsed. But the Church passing this point, made quarrel to him for accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Bishoprick, which the King would not acknowledge to be a reason sufficient.
<hi>If they could charge him with any fault in doctrine or life, he was content they should keep
their order, but to challenge him for accepting the Bishoprick, he would not permit the same,
having lately ratified the Acts agreed upon at</hi> Leth, <hi>Anno 1571. touching the admission
of Bishops, and ordained the same to stand in force untill his perfect age, or till a change
was made thereof in Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This related to the Church,<note place="margin">Inquisition made of <hi>Montgomehy</hi> his life and doctrine.</note> they did appoint <hi>Montgomehy</hi> his life and doctrine
to be inquired upon, if possibly they could find any matter against him: which
done, an accusation was framed, and he cited to answer in the next Assembly.
The Articles laid to his charge were these.
<list>
                        <item>1. That he preaching at <hi>Striveling</hi> had proponed a question touching the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
of women, and affirmed, they were circumcised in the skin of
their forehead.</item>
                        <item>2. That teaching in <hi>Glasgow</hi> he should say, the discipline was a thing indifferent,
and might stand this or that way.</item>
                        <item>3. That he called the Ministers captious, and men of curious braines.</item>
                        <item>4. That he laboured to bring the Original languages in contempt, abusing the
words of the Apostle in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and jeastingly asked, In what School
were <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> graduated?</item>
                        <item>5. That to prove the lawfulnesse of Bishops in the Church, he had used the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Augustine.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>6. That in his doctrine he said it was sufficient to baptize in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
onely, or in the name of the Sonne, or in the name of the holy Ghost,
seeing they are all one God, and to that effect alleadged the nineteenth of
the <hi>Acts.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>7. That he should have called matters of discipline, and the lawful calling of
the Church, trifles of policy.</item>
                        <item>8. That he charged the Ministery with sedition, warning them not to put on or
off Crownes; for if they medled therewith, they would be reproved.</item>
                        <item>9. That he condemned the particular application of Scripture, disdainfully ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
In what Scripture they found a Bishop for a thousand pounds, horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne,
and poultry, &amp;c.</item>
                        <item>10. That he oppugned the doctrine of our Saviour speaking of the number of
the wicked, and them that perish.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="317" facs="tcp:50008:171"/>
11. That he denied any mention to be made in the New Testament of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
or Eldership.</item>
                        <item>12. That he accused the Ministers of Pasquils, lying, backbiting, &amp;c.</item>
                        <item>13. That the Church being traduced with infamous libels, he did not only not
find fault therewith, but seemed to approve the same, having used in his
preaching, the very words of the Libel cast in the Kings chamber against the
Ministers.</item>
                        <item>14. That these three moneths past, he had been negligent in doctrine and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and giving no assistance to the Eldership.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Articles were sent to the King by some Ministers,<note place="margin">The Articles against <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the King.</note> who were desired to
shew his Majesty, that the accusation was not founded upon the accepting of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick,
but upon erroneous points of doctrine. The King answered, <hi>That whatsoever
colour they gave to the process, he knew, that his yielding to accept the place, was the true
quarrel; and for himself, albeit he loved the Religion, and agreed fully therewith, he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not divers heads of their policy; alwayes for the particular in hands, he would leave the
man to make his own answer.</hi> This reported to the Assembly, they went on with
the accusation, and <hi>Montgomery</hi> being called, Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> became his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.
The Articles upon his denial were admitted to probation, but few of them
were verified, yet the conclusion of the Assembly was, that he should continue in
his Ministery at <hi>Striveling,</hi> and meddle no more with the Bishoprick under pain of
excommunication. Mean while the Presbytery of <hi>Striveling</hi> (for they had now
erected Presbyteries in divers places of the countrey) was enjoyned to try his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
and how he did exercise discipline, if possibly any thing might be found
against him that way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It fell out at the same time,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Walter Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canquel</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned for speeches in Pulpit.</note> 
                     <hi>that Mr.</hi> Walter Balcanquel <hi>one of the Ministers of</hi>
Edinburgh, <hi>did utter some reproachful speeches in a Sermon against the Duke of</hi>
Lennox, <hi>saying,</hi> That within these four years Popery had entered into the countrey and
Court, and was maintained in the Kings Hall by the tyranny of a great Champion, who
was called Grace. But if his Grace continued in opposing himself to God and his word, he
should come to little Grace in the end. <hi>The King advertised of this, sent</hi> Iames Melvil
<hi>his servant to complain to the Assembly, requiring some order to be taken therein.
The Minister being put to his answer, said,</hi> That he praised God for two things,
First,<note place="margin">Balcanquels <hi>answer.</hi>
                     </note> that he was not accused for any thing done against his Majesty and the Lawes: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that he perceived the Church had obtained some victory: For when he was last
questioned for his Sermon, the Councel did make themselves Iudges of Ministers doctrine:
Now that he saw the complaint remitted to the Assembly, he was glad, and willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
his doctrine to their trial: Onely that he should not give advantage to his enemies,
he desired the Apostolick Canon to be kept, which prohibiteth an accusation to be received
against an Elder, but under two or three Witnesses.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Smeton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</note> and <hi>David Ferynson</hi> were upon this directed to shew the
King, that the Assembly was willing and ready to try the complaint: but withall,
that the liberty craved by the person accused could not be denied, he being a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.
So if it should please his Majesty to send an accuser assisted by two or three
witnesses, the accusation should be received, and justice done. The King not liking
this answer, for he knew the difficulties he should have to find out an accuser, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the businesse no more; but the Minister not contenting, that the cause should
thus desert, would needs have the judgement of the Assembly, whether or not he
had uttered in his Sermon any scandalous or offensive words? for they had been all
Auditors of that he spake. This being put to voices, the Assembly declared his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to have been good and sound, and that he had given no just offence thereby
to any person. When this was told the King, he was much offended; for not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dayes before,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Balcanquels</hi> Sermon appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</note> when as the same Minister with his Colleague <hi>Iohn Dury</hi> was called
to give accompt of some speeches they had uttered in Pulpit, it was excepted, <hi>that
the King and Councel could not be Iudges of their doctrine;</hi> and now his Majesty
having complained to themselves, and they being Auditors of the speeches, when
he expected some censure to be inflicted, they had justified all that was spoken,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50008:172"/>
and so would force him to take other courses,<note place="margin">An. 1582.</note> then he desired to follow.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Montgomery</hi> his cause, the Ministers of <hi>Striveling,</hi> as they were
enjoyned,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Montgomery</hi> suspended by the Presbytery of <hi>Striveling.</hi>
                     </note> made a visit of the Church, to try what they could find against him. All
they got delated was, that he had baptized some children begotten in fornication,
not calling the offendors before his Session. Upon this declaration he was cited to
appear, and because he kept not the Diet, suspended from his function, he notthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
preached still, and exercised all the parts of his Ministery, as in former times;
which they took to be an high contempt, and therefore did summon him to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
(which was shortly to meet at S. <hi>Andrews</hi>) to hear their sentence approved,
and to answer to such other things as in that meeting should be laid to his charge;
and because they understood, that against the inhibition of the last Assembly he was
still labouring to secure himself in the Bishoprick of <hi>Glasgow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He is cited to appear before the Synod of <hi>Lothian.</hi>
                     </note> and had cited the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
before the Councel, for refusing to convene to his Election, they likewise char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to compeir before the Synod of <hi>Lothian,</hi> to hear the sentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
pronounced against him.</p>
                  <p>The King being informed of this, caused warn the Synod to appear the twelfth
of <hi>April</hi> at <hi>Striveling,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Synod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</note> discharging in the mean time all proceeding in the businesse.
Mr. <hi>Robert Pont,</hi> and with him a few others compeiring at the day, he in the name of
the rest protested, <hi>That albeit they had compeired to testify their obedience to his Majesty,
yet he did not acknowledge his Majesty and Councel Iudges in that matter, the same being
a cause Ecclesiastick, and that nothing done at that time should prejudge the liberties of the
Church, and Lawes of the Realm.</hi> This protestation the Councel rejected, inhibiting
the Ministers to use any proceeding against <hi>Montgomery,</hi> which because of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Assemblies approaching they yielded unto; onely they caused charge him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the Assembly. When the Diet came, he appeared, and first protesting
for remedy, if they should use him wrongfully; he said, that the proces of <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
could not be allowed, for that he was never lawfully summoned to hear any
sentence given against him.<note place="margin">An Assembly at S. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                     </note> The Presbytery of <hi>Striveling</hi> remitting themselves to

suspension pronounced.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mark Ker</hi> sent to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</note> As they were proceeding to his censure, for contempt of
the sentence, Mr. <hi>Mark Ker,</hi> then Master of the Requests, presented a letter from
his Majesty, inhibiting them to trouble the Bishop for any thing that concerned the
Bishoprick, or whatsoever cause preceding; for that the King would have those
things heard and handled in his own presence. The Assembly answered, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his Majesties request, they should look more carefully to the businesse, and
see all things carried rightly, according to justice.</p>
                  <p>The Master of Requests replying that his Majesty had willed them by his letter
to desist,<note place="margin">The Assembly discharged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</note> and treat no more of that businesse: Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> who presided for
the time, answered, <hi>that they did not meddle with things belonging to the Civil power; and
for matters Ecclesiastick, they were warranted to proceed in these, specially with one of their
own number.</hi> He perceiving that notwithstanding of his Majesties letter they would
proceed, caused a messenger of Armes whom he had brought with him, charge
them under pain of Rebellion to desist. Then was <hi>Montgomery</hi> called to see if he
would abide by the charges used at his instance; But he was retired to his lodging,
and could not be found; and (the night drawing on) was appointed to be summoned
to the next morning to receive his censure. After the hour appointed, one <hi>William
Montgomery</hi> having procuration from him, appeared, and appealing from the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
to the King and Councel,<note place="margin">The Assembly proceedeth, and findeth him culpable of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers crimes.</note> gave this for a reason amongst others, that <hi>he who
was his accuser in the last Assembly, was turned to be his Iudge.</hi> But the Assembly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the Appellation, fell presently a reading the <hi>enorm crimes</hi> (so they called them)
whereof he was guilty; nor was there any thing omitted that served to aggravate
the same; corruption in doctrine, dissolutenesse of life, contempt of the Churches
sentence, falshood, and breach of promise, lying, perjury, moving of sedition, and
stirring up certain of the Nobility against the Church. Of all these he was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
culpable,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Montgomery</hi> falling from his resolution, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himself to the Assembly,</note> and ordained therefore to be deprived, and cast forth of the Church.</p>
                  <p>How soon he heard that this conclusion was taken, his courage which seemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
high and resolute, began to cool; whereupon presenting himself to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:50008:172"/>
he renounced his appeal, desiring conference of some godly and learned bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
which granted, he was induced by them to confesse his offence in divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
submitting himself to the will of the Assembly; and in end, to promise
solemnly in the presence of the whole number, that he should meddle no further
with the Bishoprick of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and neither accept of it, nor of any other office in
the Church, without the advice and consent of the General Assembly. Yet this gave
not an end to the business; for how soon he returned to the Court, and perceived
the King countenance cast down upon him for that he had done, he undertook of
new to settle himself at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and had letters from his Majesty to the Gentlemen
of those parts to assist him.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>The rumour of this fact ran quickly through the Kingdom,<note place="margin">A solemn Fast kept.</note> and a solemn fast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kept by the appointment of the former Assembly, the causes whereof were
made to be the abundance of sin, the oppression of the Church, the dilapidation of

who did seek to corrupt him in manners and Religion; the insolency commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at <hi>Glasgow</hi> was likewise adjected, and furnished matter of long discourse to the
Preachers. Amongst others, <hi>Iohn Dury</hi> did exclaime mightily against the Duke of
<hi>Lennox,</hi> upon whom the blame of all things was laid, and thereby did so irritate the
King, as he would needs have him removed forth of the Town. Charges to that
effect were directed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn Dury</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his charge.</note> commanding the Magistrates within the space of 24. houres to
remove him: who not daring disobey, yet being unwilling to use their Minister in
that sort, travelled with him to depart quietly, and leave the Town. The Minister
proponing the case to the General Assembly, (for upon advertisement given by the
Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they were there convened) desired their advice: for, <hi>to leave
his flock at the pleasure of the Court,</hi> he said, <hi>might work a prejudice to the Church, and
to depart privately as the Magistrates advised him, might be imputed to fear, or then make
him to be thought guilty of some fault.</hi> The brethren after a short consultation did advise
him to stay,<note place="margin">Ministers dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the King.</note> till he should be commanded to depart, and then obey. Mean while,
Mr. <hi>Thomas Buchannan</hi> and <hi>David Ferguson</hi> were sent to the King, who was then
at <hi>Striveling,</hi> to intreat his Majesties favour unto him, and therewith to request a
continuation of the Diet, for the appearing of the Ministers of <hi>Glasgow</hi> at <hi>Perth.</hi>
The King desiring to have matters quieted, answered the last proposition first, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>That if the Assembly would delay the proces which they had against the Provest of</hi>
Glasgow, <hi>and his assisters, he would likewise dispense with the appearing of the Ministers

the Duke returned to Court, whose interesse was greatest in that business, order should be
taken with him, and consideration had of the Assemblies request.</hi> But they not satisfied
herewith, striving to make good what they had taken in hand, went on with the
proces of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and leading probation against <hi>Minto</hi> and the rest, decerned them
to be excommunicated, and cast forth of the society of the Church, onely the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing

brethren before the Councel.</p>
                  <p>

Mr. <hi>Iohn Davidson</hi> then Minister at <hi>Liberton,</hi> pretending a warrant from the

which (albeit done against all form) was allowed, and intimated in all the
Churches of the countrey. The Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> notwithstanding did still enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him in his company, and at some occasions had made him to preach publickly.
Thereupon Mr. <hi>Alexander Archbuthnet,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Adam Iohnston</hi> were directed by
the Assembly, to intimate unto the Duke his excommunication, and the Acts of
the Church against such as kept excommunicate persons in their company. The
Duke taking them up somewhat hotly, asked them, <hi>Whether the King or the Church
were superiours;</hi> and thereafter answered them directly, <hi>That he was commanded by
the King and Councel to entertain him, which he would not forbear to do, for any fear he
had of their censures.</hi> This amongst other grievances of the Church was ordained to
be represented to his Majesty by the Commissioners appointed to attend the
Councel at <hi>Perth.</hi> But touching this, the King answered, <hi>That the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was null, and declared such by the Councel, as being pronounced against equity and all
lawful form, no citation being used, nor any admonition preceding, which all lawes, and even
their own discipline appointed to be observed.</hi> To their other grievances they received
general answers, and for the brethren of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> their trial was continued to the

the state of all affairs, some of the Nobility combining themselves for defence

Duke of <hi>Arrans</hi> absence from the Court, placed themselves about the King, and
detained him some dayes at the house of <hi>Ruthven.</hi> The principals in this attempt
were <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Marre, William</hi> Earl of <hi>Gowry, Patrick</hi> Lord <hi>Lindesay, Robert</hi>
Lord <hi>Boyd,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his sport by the Master of <hi>Glammit.</hi>

Driburgh,</hi> and <hi>Cambush keneth,</hi> the Lairds of <hi>Lochlevin, Easter Weemes, Cleish,</hi> and
the Constable of <hi>Dundy.</hi> The King at their first coming suspected there was some
practise in hand, yet dissembled the matter, thinking to free himself the next day,
when he went abroad to his sport; but as he was about to go, the Master of <hi>Glammit</hi>
stept to the dore of the Parlour, and told him he must stay. The King askt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
he answered, he should know it shortly. When he saw it to be so, and found his
liberty restrained, he grew into a passion, and after some threatening speeches burst
forth in tears. The Master seeing him weep, said, <hi>It is no matter of his tears, better
that bairnes should weep, then bearded men:</hi> which words entered so deeply into the
Kings heart, as he did never forget them. The newes went quickly of the Noblemens
being at Court in such numbers, which made the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> haste thither, for he
held himself assured of the Earl of <hi>Gowries</hi> friendship, as being of his alliance, and
having kept one course in the pursuit of the Earl of <hi>Morton;</hi> his only fear was, that
he should be stayed by the way, therefore having crossed the ferry, he singled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from his company, and taking one only servant with himself, directed his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>William Stewart</hi> to keep the high way with the rest. By this mean he did escape
those that lay in wait for him, and came in the evening to <hi>Ruthven;</hi> where, when he
had entered the gate,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arran</hi> withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from the the King.</note> he asked what the King was doing, as meaning to go directly
to him, but was conveyed to another room, and told that he must have patience, and
think his fortune good, that he was come to that place with his life saved; as he
himself judged, when a little after he heard that the horsemen which lay in wait of
him, and encountred his brother near unto <hi>Dublin,</hi> after divers wounds given
him, had taken him prisoner.</p>
                  <p>A day or two after,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> sendeth to enquire of the Kings Estate.</note> some Noblemen imployed by the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who
remained then in <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> came to Court, but were not permitted to speak with
the King, nor see him except in Councel. Being examined what their businesse
was, they told that the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> had sent them to learn of the King in what
condition he was, and if he was detained against his will, as the rumour went, he
might, with the assistance of other good subjects, see him made free. The King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
cried out, that he was captive, which he desired all his subjects know, and
that the Duke should do what he might to procure his liberty. The Lords prayed
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:50008:173"/>
his Majesty not to say so, <q>for that he should not be denied to go whither he
pleased, only they would not permit the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> and Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
him any longer,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> willed to retire to <hi>France.</hi>
                        </note> and oppresse both Church and Kingdom, as they have done.
Wherefore he should do well to cause the Duke retire himself quietly to <hi>France,</hi>
otherwise they would be forced to bring him to an accompt of his doings, and
proceed against him with rigour of law.</q> This they willed the same Noblemen
whom he had sent, to signifie unto the Duke, and that they were resolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
what they had undertaken at the utmost hazard of their lives and estates.</p>
                  <p>After they were gone,<note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion declaring the Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment with his stay at <hi>Perth.</hi>
                     </note> the Kings anger being somewhat asswaged, and fearing
the Dukes case more then his own, he was moved to send forth a Proclamation to
this effect. <q>That for pacifying the present commotions, and removing some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
fallen out amongst the Nobility, his Majesty had thought it expedient
to interpose himself a Mediator; and for the better working of an union amongst
them, had resolved to make his residence in <hi>Perth</hi> for a time, till he saw what good
effects his travels might produce. And lest his stay in these parts should be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
to be a detention of his person, because of the Noblemen and others
that had lately repaired to Court, his Majesty declared, that it was his own free
and voluntary choice to abide there; and that the Noblemen and others who did
presently attend, had done nothing, but what their duties obliged them unto, and
which he took for a good service performed both to himself and to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
Therefore inhibited all the subjects to attempt any thing that might tend
to the disturbance of the Realm, commanding them also that had levied any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
upon pretext of his Majesties restraint, to dissolve the same within six houres
under the pain of death.</q> This Proclamation was dated at <hi>Perth</hi> the 28. of <hi>August,</hi>
some six dayes after the surprise of his person at <hi>Ruthven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke in the mean time was gathering forces,<note place="margin">The Duke is advised to go unto <hi>Dumbrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                     </note> and grown to be strong by his

that it was his pleasure, he should leave the Realm, and depart forth thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the 20. of <hi>September.</hi> The letter he communicated to his friends, who did all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
him to retire unto <hi>Dumbritton,</hi> where he might with more safety stay for a while,
and if he found not an opportunity to right himself, should have good occasion of
shipping for <hi>France.</hi> When he was come thither, the resort of Noblemen and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
and others, were so great unto him, that the Nobility offending therewith,
directed letters, charging him to live more private with his ordinary retinue, and all
others that were in his company, to return to their houses within 12. houres after the
charge, and not to come nigh the part where he remained, or should happen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
during the time of his abode in the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The bruit of this change being carried to <hi>England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An Ambassador from <hi>England September</hi> 12.</note> the Queen sent Sir <hi>Henry Cary</hi>
and Sir <hi>Bobert Bowes</hi> unto the King to advise him, in regard of the danger he

good part the Lords enterprise,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in favour <hi>October</hi> 12.</note> and restore the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> who had lived exiled
in <hi>England,</hi> since the time of <hi>Mortons</hi> execution. This last they obtained with no
great difficulty, so as the Nobleman was soon after reconciled, &amp; accepted in favour:
but to the first point, the King having a suspicion that the attempt was not made
without the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> knowledge, he gave good general answers, whereby
it was hoped that upon the Noblemans good behaviour, in a short time his offence
would be mitigated. The King also conceiving that a gentle usage would bring
them to reconcile with the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> began to give them a more gracious
countenance then before. But he found them untractable, and not without great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
did purchase their consents to a few dayes prorogation of his departing, upon
promise that he should be pursued as a Rebel, if he went not away at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
wind and weather serving: yet was his going put off upon divers occasions

to <hi>Halirudhouse</hi> in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> knowing that the people of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
did affect their enterprise, as appeared by the reducing of <hi>Iohn Dury</hi> their Minister
immediately upon the newes of the Kings restraint, and the triumph they made,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:50008:174"/>
singing as they went up the street the 124. Psalm, <hi>Now Israel may say,</hi> &amp;c. They

the nineth of that moneth,<note place="margin">An Assembly of the Church at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                     </note> and doubted not to find them favourable enough. To
this Assembly Mr. <hi>William Areskin</hi> (styled then <hi>Commendatory of Paisley</hi>) was sent by
the Noblemen to declare that the causes moving them to that enterprise, were the
evident perill they perceived the Religion was brought unto, with the disorders and
confusions introduced into the State: whereof having discoursed a while, he came in

made, first it was voyced, whether the dangers of the Church and disorders of State
were such as in their hearing were related: which being affirmatively answered by
the whole Assembly, Mr. <hi>Iames Lawson,</hi> Mr. <hi>David Lindesay,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Craig</hi>
were appointed to signifie unto the King what the Assembly had found, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his own judgement therein. The King esteeming it most sure for himself to
temporize, said, <hi>That he believed Religion was in hazard, and indirect courses taken
to overturn the same, wherewith he acknowledged his own danger to be conjoyned; and for
abuses crept into the Commonwealth, as they were too many, so he expected that all good
subjects, and they for their own parts would help to remove the same.</hi> This answer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Assembly, they concluded an Act in this form.</p>
                  <p>For as much as the Noblemen and others joyned with them in the late action of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">The Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the attempt at <hi>Ruthven.</hi>

out of a desire to have the Church, and whole professors of the true Religion, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the grounds and occasions moving them to repair towards the Kings Majesty, to
seek redress of the disorders fallen out in the Commonwealth, have made publick attestation
to the whole Assembly, that the motions and grounds of their enterprise were, and are, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Church of God within this Realm, and the true Religion therein professed, from the
evident peril and danger wherein all men perceived the same to stand; as likewise to guard
and preserve the innocent person of the King his Majesty and Estate, being in no less hazard
then the other, and to remove the corruptions and confusion entered into the body of the
Commonwealth: wherein as they are well perswaded themselves, to have done good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to God, and to have performed their duty to their Soveraign and countrey; so they
wished all that feared God should judge and esteem well of their action, especially that the
brethren of this Assembly should declare their good liking and approbation thereof, and ordain
all the Pastors and Ministers within the Realm, to publish in their particular Churches the
causes and grounds moving them to the said enterprise; exhorting all Noblemen, Barons,
and other faithful subjects to give their best concurrence and assistance thereto. The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
having weighed the said desire with the whole circumstances thereof, have in the fear
of God after mature deliberation resolved, found and voted, no man gainsaying, That not
only the Church of God within this Realm, and true Religion professed in the same, but
also the King his most noble person and royal estate, were and stood in extreme danger and
hazard, besides the manifold grosse abuses that had invaded the Commonwealth before the
late enterprise, which his Majesty had acknowledged and professed to the Commissioners of
the present Assembly. And that therefore the said brethren could not but think their Honours,
imploying themselves hereafter for averting the like dangers, to have done good and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
service to God, their Soveraign and native countrey. And the prosecution thereof,
all partiality aside, will be acceptable to all that fear God, and tender the preservation of
the Kings person, and prosperous estate of the Realm. And to the effect the same may be
made the more manfest and notorious, it is thought expedient that all the Ministers within
the Realm upon the first occasion shall publickly declare unto their particular flocks the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril
wherein the Church of God and true Religion, the King his most noble person, and estate
stood, with the grounds that moved the said Noblemen unto the late action, recommending
the same to the consideration of all good subjects, exhorting them as they tender the glory of
God, and love the preservation of the King and countrey, faithfully to concurre and joyne
with the said Noblemen in prosecuting the said grounds to the full deliverance of the
Church, and perfect reformation of the Commonwealth; And if any should be found either by
word maliciously, or violently by way of deed, to oppose to that good cause, they shall be
called before the particular Elderships, and order put unto them by the censures of
the Church; and in case of their wilful and obstinate continuing therein, be dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:50008:174"/>
to the King and Councel, to be punished for their offence civilly.</p>
                  <p>This Act of the date the thirteenth of <hi>October</hi> 1582. was published in all the
Churches of the Realm, to the offence of many good men, who were grieved to see
had cause thus coloured and defended.<note place="margin">A Convention of the Estates at Edinburgh.</note> But the Lords knowing that this approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could not secure them, had laboured the King to convocate the Estates for the
same purpose; The eighteenth of the same moneth being appointed for their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there came to the convention for the Church estate, the Archbishop of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
the Bishops of <hi>Dunkeld</hi> and <hi>Orkney,</hi> the Abbots of <hi>Dunfermlin, Newbottle,
Paisley, Driburgh, Cambuskenneth, Culrosse, Inchaffray, Coldingham,</hi> and <hi>Pittinweyme;</hi> of
the Nobility there were present the Earls of <hi>Marche, Arrol, Marshal, Bothwel</hi> (who
some few moneths before returned from beyond Sea) <hi>Marre, Rothes, Glencarn,
Eglinton, Gowrie,</hi> and <hi>Morton;</hi> the Lords <hi>Lindesay, Home, Ogilvy, Hereis, Boyd,</hi>
... and <hi>Sinclare.</hi> But from the Burghes there came not any Commissioners, nor
could they be moved to countenance this action in any sort; conceiving, as it fell out,
that how soon the King obtained his liberty, he would censure and condemn the
fact as treasonable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To these alwayes that convened the King had a speech,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Kings speech to the Estates.</note> 
                     <hi>much to this effect,</hi> That
of all the vexations he had tried since his acceptation of the government in his own person,
the distraction of the Nobility was the greatest, and at the present did grieve him most; for
the removing whereof, he had called them together, and expected their best counsel and
help. In other things, <hi>he said,</hi> that needed reformation, he would be willing to follow their
advice. <hi>One of the Lords, I find him not named, made answer,</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>that the dissensions
of the Nobility were caused chiefly by some, that having his Majesties ear, did
abuse his favours, ruling all things at their pleasure, and disdaining the advice of
other fellow counsellors.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Then falling into particulars he said,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>that the Duke
of</hi> Lennox <hi>and Earl of</hi> Arran <hi>had misgoverned all affaires,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The attempt of <hi>Ruthven</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be good service.</note> 
                        <hi>and brought divers abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
into the State, which unlesse some Noblemen had taken a course to remedy by
their repairing to his Majesty, both Religion and State in a short time had been
subverted.</hi> 
                     </q> 
                     <hi>After this, the Earl of</hi> Marre, Gowry, <hi>and</hi> Glencarne, <hi>who had been the
chief actors in that attempt, rose up, and having declared the cause, which moved
them to take that action in hand, did humbly offer to submit themselves to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his Majesty and the Estates, and thereupon removing themselves forth of the
Convention, it was found and declared,</hi> That in their repairing to the King upon the
22. of August last, and abiding with him since that time; they had done good, thankful,
and necessary service to the King and countrey. Also that their taking of Armes, making
of Conventions, entring in conflicts, taking and detaining of prisoners, contracting of
leagues and bonds, and all other deeds done by them, which might appear to be against his
Majesties authority, in so farre as the same was done without his Highness warrant, should
be reputed, and esteemed good service done to the King and State. And that they and their
partakers should be exonered of all action, civil, or criminal, that might be intended against
them, or any of them in that respect: Inhibiting therefore all the subjects to speak or utter
any thing to the contrary, under the pain to be esteemed calumniators and dispersers of false
rumors; and to be punished for the same accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The declaration passed, it was ordained that the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> should be detained
in the Castle of <hi>Ruthven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> ordained to be detained till the Duke was gone.</note> till the Duke was gone out of the Realm, after which he
should be confined on the North of the water of <hi>Iern:</hi> and that four companies
should be levied upon the publick charges, two of horsemen, and as many foot to
guard the King and Noblemen, who did attend him, till the present troubles
were quieted. Then were some grievances proponed in name of the Church, but these
laid by till another time, the Lords not willing to irritate the King for such matters
having once secured themselves.</p>
                  <p>The Duke to keep the word which the King had given for his departing took ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the West parts,<note place="margin">The Duke fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sick at Seat taketh journey by land.</note> about the midst of <hi>October,</hi> and being hindred by contrary winds
fell sick at Sea. The King advertised of his ill disposition, advised him to travel
through <hi>England</hi> in regard of the winter season, and to remain at <hi>Blackness</hi> till a safe
conduct was procured from the Queen. He had not stayed many dayes there, when
a rumour was raised, as was thought, by his enemies, that he was to be brought again
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50008:175"/>
to Court, and the Lords turned out, or used with more violence. This made a new
stirre, whereupon the Lord <hi>Hereis</hi> was sent to command him to begin his journey
and to be in <hi>Berwick</hi> the 22. day of <hi>December,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to see the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went away, is denied.</note> he craved to see the King and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> two Ambassadours arrived sent by the <hi>French</hi> King,
the one named <hi>Monsieur la Motte,</hi> the other <hi>Monsieur Menevel: La Motte</hi> came by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(with whom came alongst,<note place="margin">Two Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from <hi>France, La Mott</hi> and <hi>Menevil.</hi>
                     </note> Mr. <hi>Davidson</hi> Ambassadour from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) the
other by Sea, both having the same instructions, which were to work the Kings liberty
in the best sort they could; to confirm his mind in the love he bare to the <hi>French,</hi> and
to renue the purpose of <hi>Association.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The purpose of association re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</note> This last businesse was set on foot the year before,
and almost concluded in this sort; <hi>That the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>should communicate the
Crown with her sonne, and both be joyned in the administration of affaires; that so he
might be acknowledged for a lawful King by all Christian Princes, and all domestick facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
suppressed.</hi> But upon the Dukes sequestring from Court, it was left off, and not
mentioned again till now. The Assembly of the Church in the last meeting, had made
this one of their special grievances, and complained of it as a most wicked practise.
And now the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> hearing that purpose to be moved of new by the
<hi>French</hi> Ambassadours,<note place="margin">The Ministers declared in their Sermons against the Ambassadors.</note> declaimed bitterly against them in their Sermons; especially
against <hi>La Motte,</hi> who being a Knight of the order of S. <hi>Esprit,</hi> did wear the badge of
a white Crosse upon his shoulder. This they called <hi>the badge of Antichrist,</hi> and him
<hi>the Ambassadour of the bloudy murther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r,</hi> meaning the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who they said,
procured him to be sent hither.</p>
                  <p>It grieved the Ambassadours much to hear these out-cries,<note place="margin">The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> desired to feast the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.</note> which daily were
brought unto them, but perceiving the Kings authority not able to restrain the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which the Preachers had taken; they did not complain, but urged earnestly their
dimission. The King desirous to entertain the ancient amity betwixt the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and dimit them with some contentment, desired the Magistrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
to give them the Feast before their parting. To impede this Feast, the Ministers did
on the Sunday preceding proclaim a Fast to be kept the same day, on which the Feast
was appointed:<note place="margin">The Ministers proclaim a fast, <hi>Febr.</hi> 16.</note> and to detain the people at Church, the three ordinary Preachers
did one after another make Sermon in S. <hi>Giles</hi> Church, without any intermission of
time, thundering curses against the Magistrates, and other Noblemen that waited on
the Ambassadours by the Kings direction; nor stayed their folly here, but the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
being gone, they pursued the Magistrates with the censures of the Church,
and were with difficulty enough stayed from proceeding with excommunication
against them, for not observing the Fast they proclaimed.</p>
                  <p>Of all this the King seemed to take no notice;<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> dieth at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </note> for he saw not a way to represse

his death, who partly of grief, partly through the long and troublesome journey
he made in that cold and rainy season, contracted a fever at his coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
after a few days he died.<note place="margin">26. May, 1583.</note> Some hours before his expiring, there came to him a
Priest or two, to do their accustomed service, whom he could not admit, professing
<hi>to die in the faith of the Church of Scotland,</hi> and to keep the oath he had given to the
King inviolate. This the King made to be proclaimed at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> that the people
might see what wrong the Duke had sustained during his abode in the Realm, by the
uncharitable suspicions both of Ministers and others. But this belongs to the year

put the Lords that attended him, out of an opinion that he had any meaning to free
himself. And the Duke being gone whom they feared most, they esteemed the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the lesse, for <hi>Arran</hi> was not well loved because of his violent courses; and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
who had the greatest following, was put from his charge in the Borders, and the
same given to the Laird of <hi>Iohnston;</hi> The King had likewise by their advice sent Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Stewart,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Colvil</hi> in a joynt Commission to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to
move her for restoring the lands in that Kingdome, which appertained to his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> his Grandmother; together with
the by-run profits intrometted by the Thesaurer, or Master of Wards; as likewise to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50008:175"/>
communicate unto her the course he had taken for quieting the Realm,<note place="margin">An. 1583.</note> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
her aid and assistance therein. Some instructions besides were given them to
propone, as touching the Kings marriage, the matters of the Border, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
of a defensive league; by all which they held themselves secured of his
Majesties favour.<note place="margin">The negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion took no effect.</note> But for the negotiation it sorted to no effect, by the contrary
courses the two Commissioners took, after their coming to the Court of <hi>England.</hi>
The King foreseeing the same, when they were first imployed, had moved Mr.
<hi>David Lindesay</hi> Preacher at <hi>Leth,</hi> (a man wise and moderate) to accompany them,
and pacify the contentions which possibly might arise amongst them; but their emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
were so great, as all he could do, scarce served to keep them from open
discord.</p>
                  <p>Before I enter upon the accidents of the next year,<note place="margin">The life and death of Mr. <hi>George Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan.</hi>
                     </note> the death of Mr. <hi>George Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>channan,</hi>
which happened in the end of <hi>September,</hi> must not be passed, a man so well
deserving of his countrey, as none more; he was of an excellent wit, and learning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable,
born nigh to the Highlands within the Parish of <hi>Killern,</hi> and of the
house of <hi>Drunmakill;</hi> his Uncle by the mother called <hi>Herriot,</hi> took care to have him
trained up in letters, perceiving his inclination to be set that way: wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
so much, as he went beyond all his instructors; Nature, it seems, having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him thereunto. In the year 1539 being called in question by the <hi>Franciscan</hi>
Friers upon the malice they bare him for some bitter verses written against them,
and their profession, which he did to please King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth, whom they had in
some things offended, he was committed, as suspected of <hi>Lutheranisme;</hi> but made an
escape to <hi>France,</hi> where he lived a long time, and became acquainted with many
learned men, with which that countrey did then abound. His paraphrase of the
Psalmes, a rare work, and other Poems, he wrote for most part, whilest he stayed
abroad; and for his learning and quick ingenie was admired of all men. Returning
into <hi>Scotland</hi> about the year 1560. after he had professed Philosophy some yeares in
S. <hi>Leonards</hi> College within the University of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> he was chosen to attend
the King, and bring him up in letters. In his age he applied himself to write the
<hi>Scottish</hi> History, which he penned with such judgement and eloquence, as no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
can shew a better. Only in this is he justly blamed, that with the factions of the
time, and to justify the proceedings of the Noblemen against the Queen, he went
too farre in depressing the Royal authority of Princes, and allowing their controll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by subjects: his bitternesse also in writing of the Queen, and troubles of the
time, all wise men have disliked. But otherwise no man did merit better of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for learning, nor thereby did bring to it more glory. He died in a great age at
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and was buried in the common place, though worthy to have been laid
in marble, and have had some Statue erected for his memory. But such pompous
monuments in his life he was wont to scorne and despise, esteeming it a greater cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
as it was said of the <hi>Roman Cato,</hi> to have it asked <hi>why he doth lack a Statue, then
to have had one, though never so glorious, erected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The summer following the King found the occasion to free himself of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
For being at <hi>Falkland,</hi> and pretending to visit his Uncle the Earl of <hi>March,</hi>

he went to take a view of the Castle, accompanied with <hi>Colonel Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi>
Captain of the Guard, to whom he had communicated his purpose, and having
entered into the Castle, commanded the gates to be shut, and these that followed
to be excluded. The Earls of <hi>Argile, Marshal, Montross,</hi> and <hi>Rothes,</hi> came thither
the next morning, and were all welcomed by the King. Of the Noblemen that
had waited on him since his restraint at <hi>Ruthven,</hi> only the Earl of <hi>Gowry</hi> was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Castle, by the Colonels means; for he had sometimes followed him as a
servant.<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Gowry</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his fault, and is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> The Earl how soon he came in presence fell on his knees, and craving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for the fact of <hi>Ruthven,</hi> did humbly submit himself to the Kings mercy, who
after he had checked him in some few, but grave speeches, for his ingratitude to the
Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> accepted him in favour, upon condition of a more loyal behaviour
in time coming.</p>
                  <p>Some few days the King abode in the Castle, and in a Councel keptthere the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

effect.</p>

to notify unto the world, but especially to all our good and loyal subjects, our
true mind touching the things that fell out in the year past, declare the same to
be as followeth. That is, howsoever for preserving of publick quietnesse, we
did patiently endure the restraint of our person at <hi>Ruthven,</hi> with the secluding of
our Counsellors from us, and all that ensued thereupon, yet did we take it deeply
to heart, and did account no otherwise of it, then a fact most treasonable, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till it should please God to restore us to our former estate and liberty: which
having now by his goodness obtained, to make known our indifferent disposition
towards all our good subjects, and that we do not seek the harm and ruine of
any one whomsoever; we have resolved to forgive and forget all offences by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,
especially that which was committed in <hi>August</hi> last, and hath been since
that time strongly maintained, providing the Actors and assisters do shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
penitent for the same, ask pardon in due time, and do not provoke us by
their unlawful actions hereafter, to remember that attempt. Willing all our
subjects, by the example of this our clemency (whereof some already have made
proof) to discharge all quarrels amongst themselves, and not to malice one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for whatsoever cause by gone, all which we will have buried in oblivion;
and to this have ordained publication to be made hereof in all the principal

hand, who had now the disposing of all things, they expected no good. The
King hereupon took purpose to confine some of the principals in several countreys,
and to commit others who were reckoned most turbulent. The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> was
confined beyond <hi>Spey, Iohn Levingston</hi> of <hi>Dunypace,</hi> and <hi>Patrick Drummond</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi>

not take it well, if he or any other should direct her in matters that concerned her subjects;

                     <q>Sir, the Queen my Mistris will never meddle
with your affaires, but to work your good and quietnesse; Yet she taketh it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly,
that the promises made unto her are so lightly regarded. One <hi>Holt</hi> an
<hi>English</hi> Jesuit, who is thought to have an hand in <hi>Throgmortons</hi> treason, that was
of late detected, being in your prison, at the request of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour
was permitted to escape,</q> whereas the Queen my Soveraign looked daily to have
been delivered in <hi>England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Majesties answer.</note> as was promised. <hi>Nay,</hi> said the King, <hi>it was not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that he should be delivered, but as the Queen answered my Ambassadours, when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
Mr.</hi> Archibald Douglas <hi>to be rendered, who is known to be guilty of my Fathers
murther; I said that the man was charged with certain suspicious practises in my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which I believed first to try; and if the Queen had been pleased to have delivered
my subject to me, whom I had more then reason to remand, I would have made no
delay in the rendering of</hi> Holt. <hi>But for his dimission or my connivence at his escape,
there is no such thing; and if you know, or can learn that any indirect means have been
used for letting him go, the trial and punishment of the doers shall clear my part.</hi> This
said, the Ambassadour, (who was a most worthy and discreet Gentleman) decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that he was satisfied, fell to speak of the preservation of peace betwixt the two
Kingdomes, and of a new league to be made with the Queen; whereof the King
did shew a good liking, and in these termes they left for that time.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>October</hi> next,<note place="margin">An Assembly of the Church.</note> the Church Assembly convened at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grates
were made, and presented in certain Articles to the King; <q>First, they
complained that the benefit of pacification was extended to Mr. <hi>David Chalmers</hi>
a professed enemy to Religion, and suspected of the murther of his Majesties Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Next,<note place="margin">Grievances presented to his Majesty by the Church.</note> that Papists were grown too familiar in Court, and namely, the
Laird of <hi>Fintry,</hi> who had made defection from the true Religion, in which he
was educated. 3. That <hi>Holt</hi> a wicked Papist, sent to the countrey to traffique
against Religion and the State, was suffered to escape, and no trial taken of the
workers thereof. 4. That his Majesty seemed to favour too much the enemies
of the truth, both in <hi>France</hi> and at home. 5. That he had received in his service
men of dissolute life, and who had never given any testimony of their good
meaning either to Religion or the state of the countrey, and put others from his
service that were known to be zealous of Gods cause, and faithful to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
self from his very tender age. 6. That since his acceptation of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Church had received many fair promises without any performance,
and that to the contrary the liberties and priviledges thereof were daily infringed.
7. That the thirds were set in taks or leases in defraud of the Church. 8. That
Abbacies were disponed against the Acts of Parliament, and no care taken for
provision of the Ministers that served at the Churches annexed. 9. That spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
livings were conferred to children, and erected in temporal Lordships.
10. That there were no punishment for incest, adultery, witchcraft, and the
like abominations. 11. That there was an universal murmur, that no man
could be assured of his lands and life, the laws of the countrey being wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. 12. That his Majesty did interpone his authority to stay the execution
of the Churches Acts, in matters properly Ecclesiastical. Lastly, they regrated
the division of the Nobility, one part seeking the ruine and overthrow of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for which they did intreat his Majesty to call unto himself the most wise and
indifferent amongst them, and by their advice to take some moderate course for
uniting the hearts of all good subjects to the maintenance of Gods truth, the
preservation of his Highnesse person and estate, and the comfort of all that were
grieved at the present division.</q>

                     <hi>The King desiring to give the Church satisfaction, made answer the next day to
all these particulars. And first, concerning Mr.</hi> David Chalmers, <hi>he said,</hi> that he was
only forfeited for the common action for being at <hi>Landside</hi> field,<note place="margin">The King his answer to the grievances.</note> field, for which pardon had
been given to many, so as it should not be thought strange to give him the like benefit, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at their request, who had moved him therein, and that he no ways intended to grant
oversight to him or any others that should be found culpable of his fathers murther, or yet
professed themselves adversaries to the Religion. <hi>Touching</hi> Fintry <hi>he said,</hi> that he had
not impeded the proceedings of the Church against him or any other Popishly affected, nor
had he been countenanced at Court, if the Minister of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> had not testified that
he was willing to conform. <hi>That for</hi> Holts <hi>escape,</hi> he had satisfied the <hi>English</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
and that it was no uncouth thing to see a prisoner deceive his keepers. <hi>Concerning
the</hi> intelligence he kept with forain Princes, <hi>for the entertaining of civil peace;</hi> that he
did not think the Assembly would disallow it, seeing diversity of Religion made not leagues
of friendship unlawful. <hi>And that they should meddle with the</hi> choice of his servants,
<hi>he held it</hi> strange; This he hoped they would remit to himself, and not to be too curious
in examining the occasions of their placing or displacing. <hi>And where they complained,
that since his accepting of the government,</hi> the liberties of the Church <hi>had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed;
he said,</hi> that since that time, more good and profitable lawes had been made for
the advancement of true Religion, then ever before; and if any thing lacked in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the fault was not his. <hi>For that which concerned</hi> the Church rents, <hi>he answered,</hi>
that those things must be helped in Parliament, and that he should assist the reformation
thereof at his power. <hi>As for the punishment of the abominations mentioned,</hi> that
the fault could not be imputed to him, sith he was willing to give Commission to such as
the Ministers should judge most fit for the execution of lawes. <hi>And for</hi> Ecclesiastical
Acts <hi>which his authority was said to impede,</hi> he knew none of late, onely he had stayed
the remove of Mr. <hi>Alexander Arbuthnet</hi> from the Colledge of <hi>Aberdene</hi> to be Minister
of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> which being rightly considered, would not be found prejudicial to the
Church, nor impertinent for him to deal in. <hi>Lastly, for the</hi> murmur of people, pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of lawes and difference amongst the Nobility, <hi>his Majesty said,</hi> that he was ready to
hearken to any good advice, for reformation of that which should be found amisse.</p>
                  <p>The answers all most reasonable,<note place="margin">The answer did not satisfy the Church.</note> and proceeding from the King, ought to have
been well taken, but the discontent they had received for the late change in Court,
made every thing distasteful, and still the displeasure betwixt the King and Church
did grow as we shall hear.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>November, Lodowick</hi> (eldest son to the late Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi>)
arrived at <hi>Leth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lodowick</hi> son and heir to the late decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> cometh into <hi>Scotland, Novemb.</hi> 13.</note> and was conveyed by the Earls of <hi>Huntley, Crawford,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tross</hi>
to the King, who lay then at <hi>Kinneill.</hi> Soon after the advertisement of the
Noblemans death, the King had sent the Master of <hi>Gray</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to bring
home all his children: But <hi>Lodowick</hi> excepted (who then was 13. years of age)
the rest were young, and not able to indure so long a journey. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him with great expressions of love, did presently invest him in his Fathers
lands and honours, committing the trust of his affairs to the Earl of <hi>Montrosse,</hi> till
he should grow up to maturity;<note place="margin">The King his kindnesse to the Duke his children.</note> for his education in letters, Mr. <hi>Gilbert Moncreef,</hi>
the King his principal Physician, was appointed to attend him, a man wise, and of
good learning. Some years after two of his sisters were brought into the countrey;
<hi>Henrietta</hi> the eldest was married to <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntley, Mary</hi> the younger of
the two to <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> to the third the King had provided an honourable
match, but she having vowed her self to God, would not be wonne from the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
by any perswasion; a younger son came to the King, after he went into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and was by him advanced to great honours. Thus the untimely losse of their
Father, did turn to the childrens benefit, by the constant and unmatchable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a loving King.</p>
                  <p>In the countrey matters grew daily more and more troubled. Those that diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
the charges given them for entering in Ward, pretended the time assigned
for their entry, to have been so short, and the distance of the place so great, as there
was no possibility in them to obey, yet under hand they were still seeking to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
themselves, and associate others to be of their faction. To take from them
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:50008:177"/>
this pretext the first of <hi>December</hi> was allowed them for their entring in Ward,
and so many as should find surety to obey, had favour promised them. The Laird
of <hi>Braid, Colluthy,</hi> Mr. <hi>David Lindesay,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Andrew Hay,</hi> were licenced also to
conferre with them, and with all that had any part in the attempt of <hi>Ruthven,</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
them of his Majesties gracious inclination towards all of that number, who
should acknowledge their offence, and live obedient and peaceably from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth.
But little or nothing was wrought this way,<note place="margin">A Convention of Estates.</note> whereupon the King took pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to convene the Estates this 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and having exponed his whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in that business, an Act was passed by an universal consent, of this tenour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Albeit the late surprise and restraint of our person perpetrated in <hi>August</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
a year, was a crime of <hi>laesae Majestatis,</hi> hainous in it self, of dangerous sequel,
and most pernicious example; meriting the more severe punishment, because the
committers thereof for the most part, besides the allegiance and common duty of
subjects,<note place="margin">Prorogation granted to those that were charged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Ward.</note> were specially bound to us by particular favours and benefits bestowed
on them: yet out of our natural disposition to clemency, we resolved to reduce
them by all gentle means to their duties; and not only forbare to use them with
rigour, but made offer of pardon and mercy to such as would acknowledge their
offence, and continue thereafter in a dutiful obedience; satisfying our selves with
that moderate declaration which tended not in any sort to their detriment,<note place="margin">An offer of pardon to those who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their offence at <hi>Ruthven.</hi>
                        </note> and
prorogating days and moneths, to see what they could perform. Hereof we gave
our promise to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> which was certified to them by divers, and
of late by certain Ministers and well disposed Gentlemen, whom we licenced to
conferre with them, for perswading them of our sincere meaning: behaving our
selves in all this, as a kind Father that seeketh to recover his children, and not as a
Prince that respected his estate. But our lenity not having produced the effects
which were wished, we took counsel to assemble our Estates, and make them
witnesses of our clemency, whatsoever might happen to their persons hereafter:
and now by their advice we have determined to prosecute with all rigour, such
of that number as shall continue in their disobedience, and shall not embrace the
offers of pardon made unto them. In the execution whereof, our Nobility and
Estates convened, have solemnly promised their assistance, and for the greater
authority both We and our said Estates have subscribed this Act with our hands.
Further, by their advice We have ordained, and ordain the Act of Councel past in
<hi>October</hi> 1582. touching the attempt at <hi>Ruthven,</hi> to be delete forth of the Books,
inhibiting all and sundry of whatsoever estate, quality, and degree, to allow by
word, writing, or otherwise, the foresaid fact, which We (being now at liberty)
and our Estates, have so publickly condemned.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Act made,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation.</note> the Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> protested, that his subscription to the Act in
<hi>October,</hi> 1582. approving the attempt of <hi>Ruthven</hi> for good service, should not be
laid to his charge, seeing he did the same unwillingly, and by his Majesties special
command and direction, like as soon after the committing of the fact, he had satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his dislike thereof. The King acknowledging the same to be of truth, made
his protestation to be admitted. Then began all the faction to fall asunder, every
man suing his pardon; which was granted upon condition, they should depart forth
of the Realm, and not return without his Majesties licence. The Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi>
the Master of <hi>Glammis,</hi> with the Abbots of <hi>Driburgh,</hi> and <hi>Cambuskenneth,</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Ireland;</hi> the Lord <hi>Boid, Lochlevin,</hi> and <hi>Easter Weymis</hi> unto <hi>France;</hi> others of
the meaner sort were confined within certain bounds. The Earl of <hi>Gowry</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he was reconciled to <hi>Arran,</hi> fearing to be troubled, obtained licence
to go into <hi>France;</hi> but whilest he delayes to go, and putteth off his journey from
day to day, he falleth into new practises, which brought him unto his end.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the winter was quiet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn Dury</hi> questioned for allowing the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                     </note> but now and then the Court was kept in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
by the Sermons of some Preachers, who were therefore called in question:
<hi>Iohn Dury</hi> Minister at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> had in one of his Sermons justified publickly the
fact of <hi>Ruthven:</hi> for which being cited before the Councel, he stood to the defence
of that he had spoken; yet after advice taken with Mr. <hi>Iames Lawson</hi> his Colleague,
he was moved to submit himself to the King, who continued the declaration of his
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50008:178"/>
pleasure,<note place="margin">An. 1584.</note> till he had proof of his better behaviour. The businesse with Mr. <hi>Andrew
Melvil</hi> was greater, for he being cited to answer for certain speeches uttered by
him in a Sermon preached at S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> declined the judgement of the King and
Councel, affirming, <hi>That what was spoken in Pulpit, ought first to be tried and judged
by the Presbytery, and that neither the King nor Councel might,</hi> in primâ instantiâ, <hi>med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
therewith, though the speeches were treasonable.</hi> When by no perswasion he could
be induced to submit himself; and that the King and Councel finding themselves
Judges, did proceed to examine the witnesses; he burst forth in undutiful speeches
against the King,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> fleeth into <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> saying, <hi>he perverted the lawes both of God and man;</hi> which unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
words proceeding from a Divine, in whom moderation and humility should
chiefly have appeared, did greatly offend the Councel. Thereupon was he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to enter his person in <hi>Blackness,</hi> within the space of ten hours; but in stead of
obeying, he turned his back, and fled that night to <hi>Berwick.</hi> Then did all the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits
sound, and every day were the Ministers exclaiming, that <hi>the light of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
for learning, and he that was only most fit to resist the adversaries of religion was exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and compelled for safety of his life to quit the Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pity it is to think how the King was then used,<note place="margin">The King his Proclamations misregarded.</note> for though he cleared himself by
Proclamations, shewing that the mans flight was voluntary, and that he meant not
to have used him with any rigour, yet nothing was believed, and every where peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
began to stirr. Hereupon charges were directed, commanding those who had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
leave to depart out of the Realm, to use the benefit of their licences, and inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
all intelligence by letters, or otherwise, with those that are already gone. This
wrought not much, only made those that travelled to and fro with advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the more wary and circumspect.<note place="margin">The Earl of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </note> The Earl of <hi>Gowry,</hi> to liberate himself of

and the Master of <hi>Glammis</hi> from <hi>Ireland,</hi> at which time he and others of that
faction were to joyn and take Arms for reformation of abuses, the securing of
Religion, and preservation of the King his person and estate; for that was made
the pretext.</p>
                  <p>The King having notice given him of these practises, sent Colonel <hi>Stewart</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

found in his subjects at this time, as upon a short warning a greater Army and
better appointed was in no mans memory known to have been assembled. The

and my life and my living aimed at, I was of necessity forced to seek my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
by concurring with others of the Nobility, who laboured to secure themselves
and their estates. And hearing that there was some trafficking betwixt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
in <hi>Ireland</hi> and others at home, I used all means, though I was suspected
by them, to know what their courses and hopes were; after some diligence I made
that way, I met with Mr. <hi>Iames Areskin,</hi> who travelled to and fro betwixt them.
And he at first obscured himself from me, and would not be plain, till I promised
my assistance: Then he shewed me, that he had been with the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi>
whom he found cold, and in some hope to make addresse for himself, and so
lesse careful of their relief, who were absent. Yet he believed, if the Nobleman saw
any good concurrence of others, he would give his assistance: but refused to deal
in these matters, till they should return, and things be determined with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent. This I thought likewise fittest, but in the mean time I prepared
to depart, and would have been gone, if contrary winds had not stayed me. The
same Gentleman came afterwards unto me, and shewed that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and would shortly be seen at <hi>Striveling.</hi> This moved me to remain,
albeit doubting of a sufficient concurrence of Noblemen, I was not resolved what
course to take, and lay in a carelesse security at <hi>Dundy,</hi> more inclined to go then
to stay. I protest always before God, that I never heard, nor was in counsel of
any plot against his Majesties Person, Crown, or Estate, but only studied to keep
my self from ruine by the assistance of others. At our meeting together, unto
which time all was deferred, it was thought that a course should be taken by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
advice, for securing our selves in his Majesties favour. And whereas I am
asked what Noblemen were privy to the enterprise, and what was looked for
from <hi>England,</hi> I will truly declare all, upon the firm assurance of his Majesties
clemency. At home it was expected, that all those who subscribed the bond in
that first alteration, would joyn themselves with us, and besides those divers
others: namely, the Earl of <hi>Marshal</hi> and <hi>Bothwel,</hi> with the Lord <hi>Lindesay,</hi> and
some of the West parts. So it was affirmed to me, but how truly I cannot say.
From <hi>England</hi> we expected a supply, but no certain time was appointed, and it
was said, that the Queen minded to intercede for restitution of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi>
if she found the King tractable. This is all I know, and if there by any other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
tending to his Majesties well or hurt, which I do not at the present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
I shall plainly reveal the same, whosoever be offended therewith.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At his coming to <hi>Striveling,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A letter from <hi>Gowry</hi> to his Majesty.</note> he sent to the King a letter penned in this form,
<q>Please your Majesty, it is neither diffidence nor despair in your Highnesse favour
and clemency towards me, nor any desire I have to live in this world, that moves
me to require some short audience of your Majesty. But there is a purpose of so
weighty importance, which I desire to impart unto your Highnesse, which might
have endangered the life and estate of your mother and your self, if I had not
stayed and impeded the same, the revealing whereof may avail your Majesty
more, then the lives and livings of 500. such as my self; most humbly therefore
I beseech your Highnesse that my Petition may be granted. I assure my self of
your Majesties gracious answer.</q> 
                     <hi>Striveling</hi> the last of <hi>April</hi> 1584. In a Postscript
this was added. <q>The matter I have to speak, is not the concealing of treason, but
the revealing of a benefit</q>.</p>
                  <p>This Petition was denied,<note place="margin">He is denied audience and put to the trial of a Jury.</note> and the same made a part of his indictment, for being
brought to his trial the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Grahame</hi> sitting as Justice, and assisted
by Sir <hi>Iohn Gordon</hi> of <hi>Lochinvar, Alexander</hi> Master of <hi>Levingston, Alexander Bruce</hi> of
<hi>Airth,</hi> and <hi>Iames Edminston</hi> of <hi>Duntraith,</hi> he was indicted of four points. First,
that in the beginning of <hi>February</hi> Mr. <hi>David Home,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The points of his endict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> servant to the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi>
came to him privately in the town of <hi>Perth,</hi> under silence of night, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to him the treasonable device of surprizing the Burghs of <hi>Perth</hi> and <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
at least of one or other of them; and that he agreed to the taking and fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:50008:179"/>
of the said towns, whereby he had incurred the crime of Treason, as well in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing,
as consenting to that wicked purpose. 2. That understanding Mr. <hi>Iames
Areskin</hi> to be a trafficker betwixt <hi>Marre, Angus,</hi> and others, he did belay the ways,
to the end he might speak with him, and after meeting kept conference with him,
touching the surprise of the Castle of <hi>Striveling,</hi> and the furnishing thereof with
men and ammunition. 3. That being charged in <hi>Dundy</hi> by his Majesties letters
to render himself to the Lord <hi>Petten Weyme</hi> his Majesties Chancellor, and Captain
of his Highnesse guard, he did enter into the house of <hi>William Drummond</hi> Burgesse
of <hi>Dundy,</hi> and with his Complices defended the same by the space of 6. houres,
making exclamations to the people, that he was pursued for Religion, and desiring
them to aid and assist him. 4. That he being obliged to maintain his Majesties person,
life, honour, and Crown, and having intelligence of a most weighty purpose, that
concerned the life and estate of the King and the Queen his mother, he had treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
concealed the same, and did as yet keep up the specialties thereof; albeit he
professed, he knew it so perfectly, that in his letter written to the King, he saith, that
it had not failed to have taken effect, if he had not stayed and impeded the same.</p>
                  <p>The indictment read,<note place="margin">His exceptions repelled.</note> he first excepted against <hi>Lochinvar,</hi> that he could not be
assessor to the Justice in his trial in regard of the deadly enmity betwixt <hi>Gartland</hi>
(who had married his Ladies sister) and him. This exception was repelled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the propinquity alledged, was only <hi>affinitas affinitatis.</hi> Then he complained
that the Noblemen who were sent to examine him, had not kept their word; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
promised, that whatsoever he had confessed, should not be laid to his charge.
It was answered, that the Noblemens word could not warrant him. Thirdly, he
said, that being indicted for treason, he ought to have been cited upon 40. days, and
a delation made by some accuser, which was not observed. The Advocate replied,
that in matters of Treason the King might arrest any person upon the space it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him. Fourthly, he alledged the license granted him to depart the countrey.
This was found nought, except he did therewith produce a respit or permission.
To the last point of the indictment, he said, that what he offered to reveal, tended
to his benefit if he had vouchsafed him hearing, and was no matter of treason. It
was answered, that the concealing of that might tend to the hurt of the Kings life,
and mothers, was treason.</p>
                  <p>So the indictment was found relevant,<note place="margin">The names of the Assisers.</note> and the persons of the Jury called. These
were, <hi>Colin</hi> Earl of <hi>Argile, David</hi> Earl of <hi>Crawford, Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Montrosse, Iames</hi>
Earl of <hi>Glencarne, Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Eglinton, Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran, George</hi> Earl of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal,
Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Seaton, Hugh</hi> Lord <hi>Sommervil, Iames</hi> Lord <hi>Down, William</hi>
Lord <hi>Levingston, Patrick</hi> Lord <hi>Drummond, Iames</hi> Lord <hi>Ogilvy, Alexander</hi> Master of
<hi>Oliphant,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Murray</hi> of <hi>Tillibardin.</hi> They retiring themselves,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gowry</hi> found guilty, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</note> as the custom
is, and returning within a short space, pronounced him guilty: whereupon sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was given, that he should be taken to the Market Crosse, have his head cut
off, and be dismembred as a traitor. The last part thereof was dispensed, and he in
the evening beheaded. His servants were permitted to take the head with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and bury it. This was the end of that Nobleman, who in his life was much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and imployed in the chief offices of Court; a man wise, but said to have
been too curious, and to have consulted with Wizards, touching the state of things
in future times; yet was he not charged with this, nor seemed he to be touched
therewith in his death, which to the judgement of the beholders was very peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and quiet. He was heard to make that common regret, which many great
men have done in such misfortunes;<note place="margin">His execution and manner of death.</note> 
                     <hi>That if he had served God as faithfully as he had
done the King, he had not come to that end:</hi> but otherwise died patiently, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the world, and assurance of mercy at the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>The same day <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> (called <hi>the Constable</hi>) and Mr. <hi>Iohn Forbes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> and another exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</note> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> were executed; the rest who were taken in the Castle,
had their lives spared, and were banished the countrey, and <hi>David Home</hi> of <hi>Argaty,</hi>
and one <hi>Iohn Shaw,</hi> were pardoned.</p>
                  <p>The King after this returned to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The houses of the Rebels charged.</note> where he gave order for charging
the houses of the fugitive Lords, and their friends; and upon information made,

were denounced Rebels, and fled into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Parliament declared current at the time, for the more speedy dispatch
of businesse, convened the 22. of <hi>May:</hi> In it his Majesties declaration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the attempt of <hi>Ruthven</hi> was ratified; The King his authority over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
in all causes confirmed; The declining of his Majesties judgement, and the
Councels, in whatsoever matter, declared to be Treason; The impugning of the
authority of the three Estates, or procuring the innovation or diminution of the
power of any of them, inhibited under the same pain. All jurisdictions and judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
spiritual, or temporal, not approved of by his Highnesse, and the three Estates
discharged, and an Ordinance made. <hi>That none, of whatsoever function, quality, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
should presume privately or publickly, in Sermons, Declamations, or familiar confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
to utter any false, untrue, or slanderous speeches, to the reproach of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,

parents, and progenitors, or to meddle with the affaires of his Highnesse and Estate, under
the pains contained in the Acts of Parliaments made against the makers and reporters
of lies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilest these statutes were in framing,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>David Lindesay</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster at <hi>Leth</hi> committed.</note> the Ministers who were informed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to work at least a delay, sent Mr. <hi>David Lindesay</hi> to intreat the King that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should pass in Act concerning the Church, till they were first heard. <hi>Arran</hi>
getting intelligence of this, caused arrest him, as one that kept intelligence with
<hi>England;</hi> so as he was not permitted to come towards the King. The first night
he was kept in <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi> and the next morning sent prisoner to <hi>Blackness,</hi> where
he was detained 47. weeks. Mr. <hi>Iames Lawson,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn Dury</hi> some weeks before was removed and confined in the Town of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trosse,</hi>
so as <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was left without any Preacher. Mr. <hi>Robert Pont</hi> Minister of
S. <hi>Cutberts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Robert Pont</hi> protesseth against the Acts.</note> and one of the Senators of the Colledge of Justice, because of the misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Church, as he pretended, in concluding these Acts (as the Heraulds
were proclaiming them according to the Custome) took instruments in the hands
of a Notary of the Churches disassenting, and that they were not obliged to give
their obedience thereto; which done, he likewise fleeing, was denounced Rebel, and
put from the place in Session.</p>
                  <p>Rumours hereupon being dispersed, that the King was declined to Popery, had
made divers Acts to hinder the free passage of the Gospel, and abolish all order
and policy in the Church; Command was given to form a brief declaration of his
Majesties intention in those Acts that concerned the Church, and to publish the
same for detecting the falshood of those rumours. In this declaration the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that enforced the King to the making of these statutes, were particularly set
down, and the equity thereof maintained by divers reasons. <q>Amongst the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were reckoned the allowance of the fact of <hi>Ruthven,</hi> by the assembly of the
Church; Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> his declining of the King and Councel; the fast kept
at the feasting of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors; general fasts indicted through the
Realm, without the King his knowledge; the usurping of the Ecclesiastical juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
by a number of Ministers and Gentlemen; the alteration of the lawes
at their pleasure, and a number of like abuses.</q> And for satisfying good people,
strangers as well as subjects, touching his Majesties good affection towards the
maintenance of Religion; certain Articles were drawn up and subjoyned to the
said Declaration,<note place="margin">Libells and pamphlets against the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Court.</note> to make it appear that his Majesty had intended nothing but to
have a setled form of policy established in the Church.</p>
                  <p>But these things gave not much satisfaction (so great was the discontent) and
were replied unto in Pamphlets, defamatory libels, and scurril poems, which daily
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50008:180"/>
came forth against the Court, and the rulers of it. To furnish the vacant places of
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> till some were moved to undertake the charge, the King did appoint his
own Ministers, Mr. <hi>Iohn Craig,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Duncanson,</hi> the Archbishop of Saint
<hi>Andrews</hi> supplying the ordinary preaching at Court. Soon after, there came a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the Ministers directed to the Session of the Church at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and to
the Councel of the town, of this tenour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That seeing they were assured many calumnies would be forged against them for
absenting themselves from their flock;<note place="margin">A letter from the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to the Session of the Church and Councel of the Town.</note> they had good to write unto them the true
causes thereof; which were as they said. The great indignation conceived against
them by the rulers of the Court, for resisting the dangerous courses then in hand;
the Acts made in the late Parliament repugnant to the word of God and doctrine
oftentimes by them preached; the iniquity committed in the passing the said Acts,
and violence, wherein they were defended; the Articles penned and presented
to some Ministers for submitting themselves to the tyrannical Regiment of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
whom they called <hi>gross libertines, belly-gods, and infamous;</hi> the charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Provost and Bayliffes of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to take and apprehend all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that should convene to the Eldership, and those that in Sermon should utter
any thing against the Acts, and present unhappy course; with the insolent words
cast forth against them, That if they followed the same course they were in, though
their heads were as haystacks, they should be laid at their heels. These things
they said did cast them in a grievous temptation; for to go from their good course
they could not, unlesse they should be traitors to God; to continue in it and stay,
would be counted treason against the King, and be hazardous of their flock that
was charged to apprehend them, in case of condemning these Acts which, they
could not do, and that after a long wrestling, they had resolved to depart and
reserve themselves to better times, which they were assured was the pleasure of
God, and that he would make the world understand that he had his own work in
it. In end beseeching them to stand to these things which they had heard from
them, and imbraced as the truth of God, they forewarned them of wolves that
should intrude themselves, teachers that sought themselves and not <hi>Christ Iesus;</hi>
which often they had foretold the contempt of the truth would work: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with an hope that they should sustain the present Crosse patiently, and be
united to them again in God his good time.</q>

                  <p>The King hearing of this letter sent for the same,<note place="margin">By the Kings direction an answer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in this form.</note> and offending greatly thereat,
would have the Session and Councel to answer them in this form.</p>
                  <p>We have received and read your letter, for the which offence we have humbly craved
his Majesties pardon, and not only obtained the same, but have likewise purchased liberty
to write unto you this present, wherein we use you more charitably then ye have used us,
remitting to learned men and your own consciences to shew you, seeing you are not blinded
with ignorance, nor lack learning (at the least some of you) how farre ye have strayed from
the right way in your letter lately sent to us; unreverently affirming his Highnesse Acts of
Parliament to be repugnant to the word of God: we tell you that the same do fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and satisfy us, seeing we can find no part of Scripture that is contrary thereto. And
sith we see by the first Act, the liberty of preaching the Word, as the same is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
professed, and ministration of the Sacraments ratified and allowed, and that we know
there are wise men, and fearing God amongst the Estates who concluded these Acts; we

us. And now in respect you have so contemptuously slandered these good and necessary
lawes established by his Majesty and the Estates, and laboured so farre as you can to draw
men unto dislike thereof, fled out of the Realm unchallenged, and unpursued, and thereby have
not only declared your selves guilty, but also misbehaved your selves to us your late flock;
first, in leaving us without our knowledge, against your duty, and the conditions made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us; next in drawing upon us his Majesties suspicion, that we foreknew your departure,
which of new ye have confirmed by sending a letter to us, you being his Majesties Rebels
and fugitives; In respect we say, of all the foresaid causes, we by these presents discharge
our selves unto you, esteeming our selves no longer your flock, nor you any more our Pastors;
and thanking God the revealer of secrets, that he hath made you manifest to your shame, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:50008:180"/>
relieved us of wolves instead of Pastors; Thus hoping his Majesty will provide us of good
and quieter spirited Ministers, we commit you to Gods mercy, who may give you to repent of
your foresaid offences.</p>
                  <p>This letter sent to the Councel and Session of the Church to be subscribed
made a great businesse,<note place="margin">The letter grieveth the Ministers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.</note> the Town fearing to displease the King, and to discharge

The Ministers having received and read the letter were mightily grieved,
especially Mr. <hi>Iames Lawson,</hi> who had taken greatly to heart the troubles of the
Church, and the advertisements which were given him of the successe of matters at
home; and now perceiving by this letter, that some who professed themselves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
forward in the cause, had turned their backs upon it, he fell in a great sorrow,
and thereby contracted a sicknesse,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Iames Lawson</hi> died at <hi>London.</hi>
                     </note> whereof he died at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>October</hi> following.
A man he was of good learning and judgment, of a pious and peaceable disposition,
but carried too much with the idle rumours of the people. After his course of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
passed in the University of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> he was imployed by the Countesse of
<hi>Crawford</hi> a Noble Lady, to attend her three sonnes, whom she sent to <hi>France,</hi> and
upon their return to shew his gratitude unto the School wherein he was educated,
gave himself to read the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue to some youths in the same University;
from thence he was called to be Principal in the old Colledge of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
three years profitably spent in that place, was brought, as we shewed before, to
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he continued Preacher the space of 12. years, in great esteem and
reputation, untill these unhappy times, which bereft his Church and countrey of
him and his labours. He died in the 46. year of his age, and was buried in the
new Church yard of <hi>London,</hi> at the side of Mr. <hi>Dearing,</hi> a famous Preacher
in that Church.</p>
                  <p>His death bringeth to mind other two learned men in this Church, Mr. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Arbuthnet,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Smeton,</hi> the one Principal of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and the
other of <hi>Glasgow</hi> Colledge, who in the end of the last year nigh about the same time
departed this life,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Alexander Arbuthnet</hi> his death.</note> to the great losse both of the countrey and Church; The first a

of letters, and having the course of Philosophy in the same Colledge with Mr.
<hi>Lawson,</hi> went to <hi>France</hi> at the age of twenty three years; there applying himself to
the laws, he lived five years an Auditor of that great Doctor <hi>Cuiacius,</hi> and being
made licenciate, returned to <hi>Scotland</hi> in the year one thousand five hundred three
score and six, of purpose to follow that calling, but God otherwise disposing, in the
year 1569. he was made Principal of the Colledge of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> where by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
teaching &amp; dexterous government, he not only revived the study of good let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but gained many from the superstitions, whereunto they were given. He was
greatly loved of all men, hated of none, and in such account for his moderation with
the chief men of these parts, that without his advice they could almost do nothing:
which put him in a great fasherce, whereof he did often complain. Pleasant and
jocund in conversation, and in all sciences expert; a good Poet, Mathematician, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
Theologue, Lawyer, and in medicine skilful, so as in every subject he could
promptly discourse, and to good purpose; he died in the 45. year of his age much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and was buried in the Colledge Church at <hi>Aberdene</hi> the 20. of <hi>October</hi> 1583.</p>
                  <p>Within some few dayes he was followed by Mr. <hi>Thomas Smeton;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Thomas Smeton</hi> his death.</note> this man
born in <hi>Gaske,</hi> a little Village not farre from <hi>Perth,</hi> studied Philosophy in S. <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>

House, by whose perswasion he went beyond Sea, and after he had remained
a while at <hi>Paris,</hi> took journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> where entering the society of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> he
abode three years. Thereafter coming home for some private businesse, when he
had setled the same, he returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> and kept still in that Society: in the year
1571. <hi>Thomas Metellan</hi> travelling through <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> did request his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in that journey, whereunto he yielded, and went with him to <hi>Italy;</hi> but
the Gentleman contracting sicknesse by the way, and dying, he returned by
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:50008:181"/>
                     <hi>Geneva,</hi> and was there confirmed in the Religion to which a little before he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
when he went to <hi>Paris;</hi> after he had revealed himself to some Principals of
the Society, he forsook their profession, and was in danger to have been killed at the
Massacre, which fell out at the same time, but by the favour of Sir <hi>Thomas Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador, he was saved, and came in his company to <hi>England.</hi>
Five years he remained at <hi>Colchester</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> teaching some youths of the countrey,
and in the year 1578. returned into <hi>Stotland.</hi> In the year 1580. upon the remove
of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> to the new Colledge of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> he was chosen Principal
of the Colledge of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and taught the controversies there some three yeares,
with great profit; he was a man learned in the languages, and well seen in ancient
Fathers, the reading of whose works he did ever seriously recommend to the youth.
The answer he penned in defence of this Church against Mr. <hi>Archibald Hamilton</hi>

the losse this Church received by his death, he deceased at <hi>Glasgow</hi> the 6. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
1583. in the 47. year of his age, and was buried in the Cathedral Church.</p>
                  <p>These deaths falling so quick one after another,<note place="margin">The Ministers charged with the subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of certain Articles.</note> were taken to be a presage of
great troubles in the Church, nor was it long before these sturres happened, of
which we have spoken. All this Summer the same continued, the Ministers being
daily called before the Councel, and a great businesse made of their subscription to
certain Articles which concerned their obedience to the Bishops; they who refused,
had their stipends sequestrated, which caused a great outcrying amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and made the Rebels to be more favoured. The King to rid himself of these
vexations, did call the principal Ministers, and having shewed that all his desire was
to have the Church peaceably governed, and a decent policy established, he willed
them to set down in writing the Reasons which moved them to refuse subscription,
that he might consider the same, and satisfy their doubts. They choosing rather to
propound the same by word of mouth, were after some conference induced to set
their hands to the Articles; this clause being added [<hi>agreeing with the word of God.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Yet new occasions of trouble were still breaking forth,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Nicol Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleish</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> upon information that
Mr. <hi>Nicoll Dalgleish</hi> Minister at S. <hi>Cuthberts,</hi> did in his publick prayers remember
the exiled brethren; he was called before the Councel, and accused for praying for
the Kings Rebels, as also for keeping intelligence with them by letters. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
confessed his praying for the brethren, maintaining the same to be lawful,
but the intelligence he denied; only granted that he had seen a letter written by Mr.
<hi>Walter Balcanquel</hi> to his wife, wherein he was kindly remembred. The King offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with his answers, commanded the Advocate to pursue him criminally, which
was done the next day. At his appearing before the Justice, when he heard the
indictment, he said, <hi>That he ought not to be questioned for one and the same fact before
two Iudicatories, and that having answered these points before the Councel, he should not
be put again to it.</hi> The Advocate replying that the Councels proceeding could not
stay the criminal Judge, he was commanded to answer, and to do it advisedly, seeing
it concerned his life. <hi>If I must answer,</hi> said he, <hi>I do not think that I have offended in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for my brethren, who are in trouble; and for the letter I saw, if the concealing thereof be a
fault, I submit my self to his Majesties will.</hi> The Jury proceeding, declared him guilty of
treason, yet the sentence was continued, and he sent to the <hi>Tolbuith,</hi> where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some moneths, and in end upon his supplication was pardoned, and put to liberty.</p>

for they were both Gentlemen of good respect, and mistrusted of the Court, <hi>Mains</hi>
especially because of his valour and manhood. To make out the accusation, it was
devised, that Sir <hi>Iames Edmonston</hi> of <hi>Duntraith,</hi> who had lived in great familiarity
with them, should be charged with the said crime, and upon his confession to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned;
which by the policy of the accuser, to his own perpetual discredit, he was
menaced to yield unto.</p>

making any defence, confessed all betaking him to the Kings mercy. <hi>Drumwhasill</hi>

by the unlikelyhood, and their impossibility to compasse a businesse of that
importance, to all that were present, as in their hearts they did pronounce him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.
Notwithstanding they all three were convicted and declared guilty of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;<note place="margin">They are found guilty and executed.</note>
doom was only pronounced against <hi>Drumwhasill</hi> and <hi>Mains,</hi> and they the same

pitied, <hi>Mains</hi> his case especially; <hi>Hamilton</hi> who made the delation, lived after this in a

society and intercourse of humanity was in a manner left, no man knowing to
whom he might safely speak, or open his mind. <hi>Arran</hi> in the mean time went on,
drawing into his own hands the whole managing of affairs, for he would be sole and
supreme over all. The Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> having departed this life the year preceding,
he was created Chancellour. The office of Secretary he gave to Mr. <hi>Iohn Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,
Lethingtons</hi> son, having banished the Abbot of <hi>Dunfermlin,</hi> who formerly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
the same. The Castles of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Striveling</hi> he had himself in custody,
then made himself be chosen Provost of the Town; and as if all this had not been
enough, he was declared General Lieutenant over the whole Kingdom. In a
word, whatsoever he was pleased was done, and without him nothing could be done.
This stirred up great emulation against him in Court. The Master of <hi>Gray,</hi> a great
favourite at that time, did take it disdainfully, that every thing should be governed
by him; Sir <hi>Lewis Ballenden</hi> Justice Clerk, a man of brave spirit, did also hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it; and Mr. <hi>Iohn Metellan,</hi> though he had followed still from <hi>Mortons</hi> execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that time, began to fall away and work his own credit: those things were
cunningly dissembled as among Courtiers, and all outward respect given him by
those that were plotting his ruine.</p>
                  <p>To his felicity nothing as he thought was wanting but the friendship of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>

which he possessed by the forfeiture of the <hi>Hamiltons. Maxwel</hi> not liking

thereto by some indirect means, travelleth with the Lady <hi>Iohnston,</hi> who gave at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance

himself a <hi>Romane</hi> Catholick, would in nothing that the King affected, be thought
refractary.</p>
                  <p>It was thought that the Ambassadour did rest well satisfied with the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse
towards the league, and that he should have presently returned; But he
had some other businesse in trust, which was carried more closely. This was to
make friends to the exiled Lords, and labour their restitution, as had been concluded
in <hi>England.</hi> To this effect he kept divers private meetings with the Master of <hi>Gray,</hi>
the Secretary and Justice Clerk; giving the Lords intelligence from time to time
of his proceedings; among other means he thought expedient that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
their private quarrels with the Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and his brother <hi>Claud,</hi> who
were likewise exiled, and lived then in <hi>England;</hi> he wrought so as they were
brought, as it seemed, to a perfect accord, promising to take one course, and joyn all
in the same cause.<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Claud</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the banished Lords taketh a course by himself.</note> But <hi>Claud</hi> fearing either the event of the enterprise, or not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
buried his former grudges, did afterwards separate, and by discovering their
purpose, procured to himself liberty to return; yet did he not find that acceptance
which he expected, being shortly after his coming confined in <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and within
a little while commanded to leave the countrey, and goe into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There came this Summer from <hi>Denmark</hi> certain Ambassadours to redeem,<note place="margin">Ambassadors from <hi>Denmark, Iuly</hi> 12.</note> as
they pretended, the Isles of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Shetland,</hi> alienated of old from that Crown,
yet the true errand was to propone that marriage unto the King, which was some four
years after happily perfected. The King receiving them kindly, and excusing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
for the matter of <hi>Orkney</hi> because of the Pestilence which raged as then in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
(Where the Registers of the Kingdom were kept) promised how soon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
served,<note place="margin">The King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised of the enterprise of the banished Lords.</note> to give all reasonable satisfaction, and to send some in Commission
to treat of those matters.</p>
                  <p>How soon they were dimitted, the King went into <hi>Striveling,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to recreate himself as he was accustomed, where he received advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:50008:183"/>
that the banished Lords were come down to the borders, and that <hi>Maxwel</hi>
was to joyn his forces with them. Hereupon he returneth to <hi>Striveling,</hi> and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for <hi>Arran,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to meet the King at the Castle of <hi>Crawford.</hi>
                     </note> made Proclamations to go through the countrey, commanding all
the subjects to meet him at the Castle of <hi>Crawford</hi> the 22. of <hi>October,</hi> for resisting
the attempts of the Rebels. But things were so prepared at Court by the <hi>English</hi>
Ambassadour, as the Lords did prevent the King in his expedition. They had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
their rendezvous at <hi>Linton</hi> in <hi>Tweddale,</hi> and meeting there, did solemnly
swear, not to separate nor give over the profecution of their enterprise, till the King
should be moved to accept them in favour, and put <hi>Arran</hi> forth of his company.
<hi>Maxwel</hi> brough with him 300 souldiers that had served against <hi>Iohnston,</hi> and about
700 horsemen, all the others did scarce equall that number, though <hi>Bothwel, Home,
Yester, Cesford,</hi> and <hi>Drumlanrig</hi> had joyned with them. To justify their proceedings,
they gave forth a Proclamation in all the places they came unto,<note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given out by the banished Lords.</note> declaring the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of their enterprise to be, <hi>the defence of the truth, the deliverance of the King from
corrupt Counsellors, and the preserving of amity with</hi> England. In this Proclamation
nothing was left unsaid, that might make <hi>Arran</hi> odious, and hateful; amongst other
things he was charged to have bragged of his descent from <hi>Duck Mordoch</hi> (who was
beheaded in the time of King <hi>Iames</hi> the first) and to lay claim to the Crown by
that title, calling himself <hi>King Iames the seventh.</hi> It is true, that in the Parliament
held the year preceding, he took protestation in open Court, that he renounced any
title, that he might pretend to the Crown that way, which I suppose he did to purge
himself of that aspersion; but the protestation was laughed at, in the time, by the
wiser sort, and gave them to think that such a folly had once possessed his mind.</p>
                  <p>The Proclamation did often mention him and Col. <hi>Stewart</hi> as abusers of the King.<note place="margin">The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour went, not saluting the King.</note>
Of the rest of the Counsellours there was no speech, which increased <hi>Arrans</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy
of them. Now how soon the Ambassadour heard that the Lords were entred in
the countrey, fearing that some notice should be taken of his dealing, he left <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
and went in haste to <hi>Berwick,</hi> without saluting any man. They sent a Post
after him with a letter,<note place="margin">A Post is sent after him, and his excuse.</note> desiring to know the cause of his suddain departure, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was directed by the Queen his Soveraign to go away in such sort. Being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
at <hi>Anwick,</hi> he answered, that he had no such direction from the Queen, when
he was first imployed, but that of late he had received a command to retire, because
she saw no hope of the delivery of that wretched <hi>Farnherst.</hi> This he made the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of his departure, yet in reason he could not alledge it. <hi>Farnherst</hi> lying bedfast
at the time in <hi>Aberdene,</hi> where he was committed, which was notified to him, and
he knew to be a truth; In the conclusion of his letter, he said, <hi>that he could not
grant that he had departed</hi> insalutato hospite, <hi>seeing he performed that office, both
with his heart and hand, and that he should by all possible means endevour that his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
should rather help to maintain, then dissolve the amity betwixt his Soveraign and him.</hi>
That which he speaketh of his hand, was a letter that he left to be given to the
King, the day after he was gone, in which he laid the cause upon <hi>Arrans</hi> credit,
without whom he saw nothing could be obtained, <hi>Arran</hi> seeing the letter that he
left to be given to the King, began to think that all was not sound, and accused
the Master of <hi>Gray,</hi> as being privy to the Ambassadors departure, which he denied;
yet all that time nothing was done that was sitting either for the Kings safety or
reputation, and not so much as the Castle furnished with victuals, which might
have easily been provided.</p>
                  <p>Neither were the Lords ignorant of this,<note place="margin">The Lords make haste to <hi>Striveling.</hi>
                     </note> which made them use the greater speed,
marching directly to <hi>Falkirk,</hi> and the next day, which was the last of <hi>October,</hi> to
<hi>Striveling,</hi> At the Church called <hi>Sanct Nineans</hi> (a half mile or lesse from the
Town) they put themselves in order of battel, and stood so till night fell; at which
time, upon warning given them by their friends within the Town, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
and knowing all the passages, entred by a certain back way without any
resistance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arran</hi> had taken upon him to watch that night,<note place="margin">The town of <hi>Striveling</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> and was keeping the Town
gate, when a cry was raised that the Town was taken. The Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> who
watched with him, fled to the Castle, but he escaped by the bridge, of which he
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:50008:184"/>
kept the keyes. Some weak resistance was made by Colonel <hi>Stewart,</hi> at the head
of the Market street, but he was soon put back with the slaughter of one or two of
his company. The borderers according to their custome fell upon the stables, and
made prey of all the Gentlemens horses, whereof they found good store. The
spoile otherwise was not great, as of a town not very rich in merchandise.</p>
                  <p>In the morning betimes the Castle was inclosed, which they knew could not long
hold out, for it was unfurnished, and scarce provided with victuals of one day: in this
extremity the King was advised to employ two of his Councel towards the Lords,<note place="margin">Two of the Councel dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Lords.</note>
to ask what they intended. Choice was made of the Secretary and Justice Clerk, as
men whom they would willingly hear. At the first meeting, the Secretary was rough
enough with them, saying, <hi>That such violent formes were not to be approved, and to
deal in that manner with their King, they would finde it unsure; for what was extorted
from him by force or fear, he would soon finde means to undo, and never want men to
serve him in that whereunto his will was bent; that humble Petitions became subjects, and
had been more fitting then to come in the manner they did.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Lords Answer.</note> The Lords answered,
<q>that it grieved them fore to be reduced to that necessity, nothing being more
dear to them then the Kings honour and safety. But what could they have
done? they were banished from their countrey, put from their livings, their
friends used with cruelty, the King not permitted to hear them in their just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and alwayes shut up from presenting their Petitions. That their coming
in that manner was not to dishonour, nor force the King, to whom they would
be most humble supplicants, and upon their knees if they should find accesse,
beg mercy at his hands. All they did was to save themselves from ruine, and to
be secured from their adversaries, who had wronged them, and the whole States of
the Kingdom: wherefore they besought them, as their countreymen and friends,
to intercede with his Majesty, that they might be accepted in favour, and all things
composed in the most quiet and honourable manner for the King and State that
could be devised.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This reported to the King, did mitigate his mind a little;</hi> For my self, <hi>said he,</hi> I
did never like that mans violence (meaning <hi>Arran</hi>) and howbeit I cannot but offend with
their doings; yet for the countreys sake, and preservation of publick quietnesse, I can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and overpasse all; but one thing I desire you that have been in conference with them, to
look to;<note place="margin">The Kings care of those that attented him.</note> that none in my company receive any harm. I know there are quarrels betwixt
the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> and the Master of <hi>Glammis;</hi> That the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> doth not
like <hi>Montrosse;</hi> and I believe that Colonel <hi>Stewart</hi> is not well beloved for things done in
my service. These I cannot see with mine honour, hurt; provide for that, and that they
may be in safety, and I shall willingly admit them.</p>
                  <p>When this was shewed the Lords,<note place="margin">The King is pleased to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Lords in his presence.</note> they said, <q>that they had not taken up Arms
for any private quarrel, nor would they mixe their particulars with the publick;
but it should be good for eschewing such inconveniences as might happen, that
the Noblemen (whom the King had named) were put in custody with some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
persons, and that the Colonel should be discharged from his office of the
guard, and the same conferred to another. This being declared to the King, he
gave his consent to receive them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Being brought unto his prefence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> in name of the rest, suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates mercy.</note> 
                     <hi>they fell all upon their knees, and the Lord</hi>
Hamilton <hi>(who had the precedency in regard of blood) taking the speech, said,
<q>that they were come in most humble manner to beg mercy, and his Majesties love
and favour;</q> The King answered,</hi> My Lord, I did never see you before, and must
confesse,<note place="margin">The Kings Answer.</note> that of all this company, you have been most wronged: you were a faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the Queen my mother in my minority, and when I understood not, as I do, the
estate of things, hardly used. The rest of you, that have since that time been exiled, and put
from your livings, cannot say but it was your own fault, and that your misbehaviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the same;<note place="margin">The Kings speech to <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
                     </note> But (<hi>turning himself to</hi> Bothwel) what should have moved thee <hi>Francis,
said he,</hi> to take this course, and come in Armes against me? did I ever thee any wrong,
or what cause hadst thou to offend? I wish thee a more quiet spirit, and that thou mayest
learn to live as a Subject, otherwise thou wilt fall in trouble. To you all, who, as I truly
think, have not meant any harm to any person, I am pleased to give both my hand, and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:50008:184"/>
my heart, and will remember nothing that is past, providing you carry your selves from
henceforth as becomes men of your places, and behave your selves as dutiful subjects.
<hi>So they arose one by one, and kissed his Majesties hands. It was observed that he
received the Lord</hi> Hamilton <hi>with greatest kindnesse, and gave him more respect
then any others. This was the day after their entering into</hi> Striveling.</p>
                  <p>Two days after in Councel,<note place="margin">The King his pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.</note> the King renewing his promise, did by publick Act
confirm the pardon granted to them, and their Assisters, which was by sound of
trumpet proclaimed. The Earls of <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Montross</hi> were commended to
the Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who used them honourably, and Colonel <hi>Stewart</hi> suffered
quietly to depart. <hi>Arran</hi> after his flight went unto <hi>Coile,</hi> and lived private amongst
his friends, deprived of all his honours. The charge of the guard was given to the
Master of <hi>Glammis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Master of <hi>Glammis</hi> made Captain of the Guard.</note> the Castle of <hi>Dumbritton</hi> put in the Lord <hi>Hamiltons</hi> custody,

                  <p>How soon the Noblemens peace was proclaimed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Duntraith</hi> confesseth the deposition he made against the Lords to be false.</note> 
                     <hi>Duntraith</hi> who had touched
them in his deposition against <hi>Maius</hi> (saying that he was told by one <hi>Iohn Home,</hi>
the Lords had hired every one of them two men to kill the King) so comperired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Councel undesired (so the Act of Councel beareth) and confessed that he
was suborned by Captain <hi>Iames</hi> (who is henceforth to be so named, the title of
<hi>Arran</hi> being returned to the right owner) to make that deposition, which in it self
was false and untrue, out of fear and to save his life. For verifying whereof, and to
shew that he did not confesse this to please the Noblemen, whom he had wronged
by such a confession, he declared that for the space of eight weeks before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
he had revealed the same to the Master of <hi>Gray,</hi> and to the Provost of <hi>Linclou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
both which upon oath testified no lesse to the King. The Councel for
clearing the Noblemen, ordained his confession to be published, which was not very
needful, (for no man did beleive the delation) only it served to discover the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood
of the suborner.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>December</hi> following a Parliament was held at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> for ratifying the
peace,<note place="margin">A Parliament at <hi>Linlithgow.</hi>
                     </note> and abolishing the memory of things past. In this meeting the Ministers
who returned in company of the Lords, did earnestly urge the repealing of the
Acts concluded the year preceding, against their discipline: which the King did
utterly refuse, ordaining, <hi>that none should either publickly declare, or privately speak
or write in reproach of his Majesties person, estate, or government,</hi> as is to be seen in the
first Act of the parliament.<note place="margin">The Ministers offend with the reconciled Lords.</note> The Ministers offending greatly therewith, especially
with the Lords, who had promised to see these Statutes repealed, stirred up one
Mr. <hi>William Watson</hi> in his preaching before the King, to complain of the neglect

                  <p>This young man the Bishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> had placed in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>

or to insinuate himself this way in the favours of the Ministers, who he thought
would rule all matters of Church as they pleased, he took the boldnesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the King to his face. This his unseasonable and insolent doing was by all
wisemen condemned, and he therefore committed to the Castle of <hi>Blacknesse.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse

his Lady</hi> Jesabel, <hi>and</hi> William Stewart (meaning the Colonel) <hi>were taken to be the
persecutors of the Church; but that now it was seen to be the King himself, against whom he
denounced the curse that fell on</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>That he should die childless, and be the last of
his race.</hi> This man called before the Councel, confessed the speeches, and proudly
maintained the same, for which he was likewise committed. <hi>Watson</hi> upon promise
to amend and behave himself more dutifully, was suffered to return to his charge;
but the businesse with the other lasted to a longer time, as we will afterwards hear.</p>

A few days before this Parliament deceased Mr. <hi>Iohn Spottiswood</hi> Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

have common with the <hi>Gordons:</hi> his Father was killed at <hi>Floudon</hi> in the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
battel wherein King <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth died, and he left an Orphane of four
years old. When he was come to some years, his friends put him to Schoole in
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> where he took the degree of a Master of Arts, and having a purpose to
study Divinity, which he most affected, was wholly diverted from following the
same, by the perfecutions he saw used against those they called <hi>hereticks.</hi> So lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the countrey he went into <hi>England,</hi> and there falling in familiarity with Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> was by his means brought to the knowledge of the truth. Soon
after the death of King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth, he returned to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and stayed a long
time with <hi>Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> who was known to be affected that way. In
his company he came to be acquainted with <hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and was by him
imployed towards <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, at the time that <hi>France</hi> did cast him off by the
Cardinals dealing, as we touched before. Matters succeeding to the Earl of <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi>

Sandylands</hi> of <hi>Calder,</hi> a man of great authority in those times, he was by him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to accept the Parsonage of <hi>Calder,</hi> which fell then void. And living some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with him, sometimes with the Prior of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> in whose company he
went to <hi>France</hi> at the time of the Queens marriage; he made no great stay in any
one place, till the work of reformation began; at which time he took himself to
reside in <hi>Calder,</hi> and was how soon those troubles ended, chosen Superintendent
of the Churches of <hi>Lothian, Mers,</hi> and <hi>Tiviotdale;</hi> which by the space of 20. years
he governed most wisely, his care in teaching, planting of Churches, reducing
people, and persons of all sorts into the right way, was great, and so successful,
as within the bounds of his charge none was found refractary from the Religion
professed. In his last days when he saw the Ministers take such liberty as they did,
and heard of the disorders raised in the Church through that confused parity which
men laboured to introduce; as likewise the irritations the King received, by a sort
of foolish Preachers; he lamented extremely the case of the Church to those
that came to visit him, (who were not a few, and of the better sort) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
foretold, <hi>That the Ministers by their follies would bring Religion in hazard,
and as he feared, provoke the King to forsake the truth: Therefore wished some to
be placed in authority over them to keep them in awe;</hi> for, <hi>the doctrine,</hi> said he,
<hi>we profess is good, but the old policy was undoubtedly the better; God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I lie not.</hi> And that these were his ordinary speeches some two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death, many then alive could witnesse. He was a man well esteemed for
his piety and wisdome, loving, and beloved of all persons; charitable to the
poor, and careful above all things to give no man offence. His happy life was
crowned with a blessed death, which happened the 5. of <hi>December,</hi> 1585. in the

a Masse to be said:<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Maxwel</hi> go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Councel, and committed to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he remained some

Whilest these things were a doing, Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> to be revenged of Saint
<hi>Andrews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An. 1586.</note> who had devised, as he imagined, the Acts made in the parliament
1584.<note place="margin">A Synod at S. <hi>Andrews</hi> called against the Bishop, <hi>April</hi> 1586.</note> and penned the Declaration thereafter published, did in a Synod holden at S.
<hi>Andrews,</hi> raise a new stirre, calling a number of Barons, Gentlemen, and Ministers
together, as to a Synod; Mr. <hi>Iames Melvil</hi> his Cousen made the exhortation; in
which, after a bitter Invective against the devisers of the foresaid Acts, he admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
the Assembly to censure him that was known to have had a chief hand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
meaning the Bishop. The exhortation ended, Mr. <hi>Robert Wilkie</hi> Professour of
Philosophy in S. <hi>Leonards,</hi> was chosen Moderator; and their doctrine, as their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was, being approved, it was proponed, that according to the admonition given
them, they should proceed in censuring the Bishop. The opinions were divers,
some holding it dangerous, and doubting what might be the consequence of it;
others inquiring if he was cired to the Diet a third sort more zealous then the rest,
cried out that it was the cause of God, in which no man ought to forecast or fear
any danger; and that a citation needed not where the iniquiry was so manifest; or
if that was thought necessary, that he might be warned to the next Session; being
then in the City. This course was held most formal, and so was he ordained to
be cired.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon he compeired,<note place="margin">The Bishop being cited compeireth, and protesteth against the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory.</note> and protesting that he did not acknowledge that Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory,
<hi>desired to understand what they could charge him with, that he might justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himself. They misregarding the Protestation, did accuse him of devising the
Statutes made in the year 1584. of penning the Declaration published thereafter
by his Majesty, of traducing the brethren that fled into</hi> England <hi>in the time of his
Ambassage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His accusation.</note> 
                     <hi>and a number the like. To this the Bishop repeating his protestation,
answered,</hi> That the Statutes were not of his devising, but when they were proponed, he
gave his opinion that they were good and lawful Acts, and therein had served his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the very second Act of that Parliament being an express confirmation of Popery, in
so farre as by it the dignity and authority of the three Estates was ordained to stand unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
according to the ancient custome of the Realm. <hi>This, said they, is a ratifying of
the Episcopal jurisdiction, according as it was in time of Popery. The Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,</hi> That the Bishops were not by themselves an estate, but they represented in a part
the estate of the Church, which was ever reputed the first estate of the Realm, since the
Kingdome became Chiristian; and that in the Act alledged, no jurisdiction was established;
howbeit for the Episcopal power, there was enough to be said, if the time and place were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
But if they had no further to say, he would leave them, putting them again in mind that
they were not his Iudges, and that these were matters too high for subjects to meddle in.
<hi>At last perceiving they would proceed with their censures,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He appealeth to the King, and Estates.</note> 
                     <hi>he appealed to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
the Councel, and three Estates of the Realm, or any other lawful Assembly
convened by his Majesty, and so departed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was gone, they entered into consultation what to do; many were of the
judgment, that after appellation there could be no proceeding: others though, that
the appellation was not to be regarded.<note place="margin">The Bishop excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</note> The matter being put to voices, it was
concludeded only by two voices more that he should presently be excommunicated.
The Moderator by his place was to pronounce the sentence, but he refused, albeit he
was no friend to the Bishop at that time; nor would any other of the Assembly take
on them to do it. In end when all were dissolving, and a great part gone forth out
of the Schools (for the Assembly was kept in S. <hi>Leonards</hi>) a yong fellow named
Mr. <hi>Andrew Hunter,</hi> willed them to stay, professed that he was warned by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to pronounce the sentence, and so ascending the chair, he read the same out of
the book, a few only remaining as witnesses.</p>
                  <p>This scornful and disorderly proceeding,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Andrew</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Melvil</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by a servant and Cousen of the Bishop.</note> was the next day required in a form
nothing better. Two of the Bishops servants going to the Church at the time of
prayer, caused one Mr. <hi>Samuel Cunningham</hi> Cousen to the Bishop, go unto the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
seat, and pronounce the same sentence against Mr. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames
Melvil,</hi> and some others of the Ministers of <hi>Fife,</hi> who had been most eager and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
against the Bishop.</p>
                  <p>The Appellation was sent by the Bishop to the King, wherein first he excepted
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:50008:186"/>
against the <hi>Synod</hi> as being <hi>unlawfully convened;</hi> Next, against their <hi>unjust proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
The first he proved, saying, <q>That convention was expresse against the
Statutes of Parliament,<note place="margin">The Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the reasons sent to the King.</note> and neither convocated by his Majesties letters, nor by
the Bishop of the Dioces: moderated by a Laick person, that had no imposition
of hands, made up of a company of Barons, Gentlemen, Masters of Schools and
Colledges, who bare no function in the Church, and ought not to have any
suffrage in Ecclesiastick Assemblies, and no sufficient number of Ministers assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
who though they had been present, by the Apostles rule were subject ot the
Bishops censure, and he not to theirs. The <hi>injustice</hi> of their <hi>proceeding</hi> he qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified;
first, by their citation, which neither contained a lawful cause, nor did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him a reasonable time for his appearing. 2. That at his compeiring, (which
was under protestation that he did in no sort acknowledge that judicatory) they
accused him for defending his Majesties authority in matters Ecclesiastick, and for
his consent given to the Statutes made in Parliament 1584. which were the lawes
of the King and three Estates, which they ought not to take on them to condemn.
3. That they transgressed the order set down in their own Assemblies, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
admonitions and prayers to be used for persons, before the sentence be
pronounced. 4. That the conclusion they took to excommunicate, passed not
with consent of those who were present, and was carried only by the voices of two
ignorant Ministers. 5. That the Moderator of the pretended Synod, refusing
to pronounce the sentence, one <hi>Hunter</hi> servant to Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> had taken
on him to do the same, alledging he was moved thereto by the Spirit of God:
which was a conceipt of the Anabaptists, and ought to be severely punished.
And, 6. That Ministers in their Synods, were they never so lawfully conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
may not excommunicate any person without consent of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he is a member. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (on whose example they grounded their excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications)
not presuming by himself to cast forth the incestuous man, but
writing to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that when they were convened together, they
should do the same. In end he intreated his Majesty whom it specially concerned to
take cognition of their unruly and tumultuous proceeding, and to consider how
dangerous a thing it was to put the spiritual sword in the hands of such men, who
might possibly attempt the like against his Majesties self, &amp; others of the Councel.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the King heard of this business,<note place="margin">A transaction betwixt the Bishop and the Assembly.</note> he was greatly commoved, yet because the
Diet of the Assembly was approaching, he thought best to continue the matter to
that time; where in stead of examining the process, or discussing the Bishops Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation,
a transaction was made in this sort. That the <hi>Bishop</hi> by his hand-writing
or personal appearance in the Assembly, should deny <q>that ever he publickly
professed or meaned to claim any supremacy, or to be Judge over other Pastors,
and Ministers, or yet avowed the same to have a ground in Gods word; and if
so he had done, it had been an error against his conscience, and knowledge. That he
should also deny, that in the last Synodal Assembly, he did claim to be Judge of
the same, and if he had done it, that he erred therein, and in his emperious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and contempt of the said Synod. That thirdly, he should promise to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himself better in time coming, and crave pardon for any oversight by him
committed, claiming no further then justly he might, by Gods word: and in all
other things carry himself as a moderate Pastor ought, labouring to be the Bishop
described by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> submitting his life and doctrine to the judgment and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the general Assembly, without any reclamation, provocation, or appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
from the same in any time coming. That the <hi>Assembly</hi> on the other part, for
his Majesties satisfaction, and to give testimony of their willing minds to obey his
Highness, so far as they could, and in conscience they might, and for the good hope
they had of his Majesties favourable concurrence in building up the house of God;
should hold the said process and sentence as undeduced, and not pronounced, and
restore the Bishop in so far as concerned the said process and sentence, to the
estate wherein he was before the pronouncing of the same; especially because the
said process was led and deduced during the time of the conference, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
his Majesty had conceived offence: with this proviso, Always that the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:50008:186"/>
Bishop should observe what he promised in the premises, and carry himself duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
in his vocation, in all times thereafter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What should have moved the King to hearken to a mediation so prejudicial,<note place="margin">The reasons moving the King to give way to this transaction.</note>
both to his own authority, and the Episcopal jurisdiction which he laboured to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish,
cannot well be conjectured; except we will think, that by yeilding to the
Churches advice in this particular, he hoped to winne them in end to those things
which served for his peace, and their own quietnesse; or, which I rather believe, that
he did only temporise not seeing another way how to come by his ends, and was
content to keep them in any tolerable terms, till he should find himself of power
sufficient to redresse these confusions. Whatsoever the reason was the Bishop did
set his hand to the conditions proposed by the Assembly, and received that decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour
for an absolution. Yet did not this satisfy the adverse party, who perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily
urged the justifying of their process, with the confirmation of the sentence
they had pronounced; which when they could not obtain, the same <hi>Hunter</hi> that
pronounced the sentence, protested publickly against the Assemblies proceeding,
and that notwithstanding the absolution granted, the Bishop should still be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as one justly delivered to Satan, till his conversion were seen to be true and
effectual: unto which protestation Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>
did adhere.</p>
                  <p>A motion was made in the same Assembly for censuring the Ministers that had
allowed the Acts concluded in the Parliament 1584.<note place="margin">The Ministers exhor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they were found to be so many, as it was feared, the urging thereof would breed
aschisme and division in the Church; wherefore after some altercation the matter
was left, and all the Ministers exhorted to judge charitably one of another, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their diversity of opinions.</p>
                  <p>The Articles agreed upon in the conference with certain Ministers,<note place="margin">Acts conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</note> whereof the
determination was remitted to this Assembly, made more adoe; for they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
condescended to accept Bishops, and to give them a chief hand in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Church affairs, they always being subject to the censure of the general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
It was strongly opposed, and after a long dispute concluded; <hi>That in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the Bishop was a Pastor, as other ordinary Pastors are, he should for matters of life
and doctrine be tried by the Presbytery and Synod; and for his Commission otherwise in
Church affairs be subject to the general Assembly.</hi> The Secretary, Justice Clerk, with
the Lord Privy Seal, and other Commissioners for the King, disassented and made
protestation, <hi>That seeing the Assembly had gone from the Articles agreed upon in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
nothing either then, or at the present concluded should stand in force.</hi> And thus
were they like to dissolve, but that Mr. <hi>Robert Pont, Iames Martin,</hi> and <hi>Patrick
Galloway,</hi> being directed to inform his Majesty of the difference, things were drawn
to this middest; <hi>That the Bishops and others having Commission to visit Churches,
should be only subject to the trial of the general Assembly, and such as had power from
them, till further order was taken. And that where Bishops and Commissioners were resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
they should preside in the meetings of Presbyteries and Synods,</hi> Fife <hi>only excepted,
where Mr.</hi> Robert Wilkie <hi>was appointed to moderate the Presbytery of Saint</hi> Andrews,
<hi>untill the next Synod.</hi> In the mean time was the order of the Presbyteries set down,
and their power defined, the King taking no notice of their doings in that kind.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary who then supplied the place of Chancellor,<note place="margin">His Majesties answer to the advice given him by the Chancellor.</note> perceiving the King
so vexed with the affairs of the Church, and the Ministers so refractary and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be ruled, did advise him to leave them to their own courses, saying, <q>That
in a short time they would become so intolerable, as the people would chase
them forth of the countrey.</q> 
                     <hi>True,</hi> answered the King, <hi>if I were purposed to undoe
the Church and Religion, I should think your counsel not ill, but my mind is to maintain
both, therefore can I not suffer them run into these disorders, that will make Religion to be
despised.</hi> This answer did shew the Kings love to the Church, and his care of the
good estate thereof, which in this place I thought was not to be passed.</p>
                  <p>In the Estate matters went not much better at this time, and amongst others, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
gave more offence then the acquitting of Mr. <hi>Archibald Douglas,</hi> by form of
Assise. This man was known to be guilty of the murther of the King his Father,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:50008:187"/>
and had fled into <hi>England</hi> six yeares before. The Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> at his death,
and one <hi>Binny</hi> Mr. <hi>Archibalds</hi> own servant, who was executed about the same time,
did both declare, that he was present at the doing of that wicked fact, for which the
King had often by his letters and Ambassages intreated the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to
have him delivered, yet could not obtain it. At this time a remission being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
to him for the concealing of that murther, with a letter of rehabilitation,
whereby he might stand in judgement and plead against his forfeiture; he was in a
Jury held the 26. of <hi>May,</hi> declared innocent, and absolved of the crime.</p>
                  <p>This was done by the procurement of the Prior of <hi>Blantire,</hi> who had intruded
himself in the Parsonage of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> whereof Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> had been titular, and
otherwise then by his restoring could have no right in law to retain it. Many were
grieved to see Justice in that sort abused, for maintaining a facrilegious possession;
but to have sent him back to <hi>England,</hi> with a Commission to reside there as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
for the King, which likewise was done, was an errour inexcusable; and how
he and the Master of <hi>Gray,</hi> who was chiefe man in that led Assise, carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Queen of <hi>Scotlands</hi> businesse, wherewith they were trusted, we will
hear in the end of this year.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>the Isles</hi> this Summer there arose great trouble betwixt <hi>Mackoneil,</hi> and <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi>
two principal men in those parts. <hi>Macklain,</hi> by his education in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
had learned civility and good manners, and living accordingly, was in great
respect both with his own people, and all his neighbours about, <hi>Mackoneil</hi> out of
an emulation made many quarrels to the other, and in end laid a plot to murther him
(though he had married his sister) which he went about in this manner. He sent a
message to <hi>Macklain</hi> offering to visit him at his house, and to stay some days, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
he would come back, and make merry with him in his countrey, that the
world might see all injuries were forgotten, and that they loved one another as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and good neighbours ought to do. <hi>Macklain</hi> answered, that he should be
welcome, but for his going back with him, they should talk at meeting. <hi>Mackoneil</hi>
receiving this answer, came the next day and was received very kindly by <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain.</hi>
Some four or five days he stayed, using the fairest shewes of amity that could
be wished, and being to part homewards, intreated <hi>Macklain</hi> to go with him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he would leave his eldest son, and a brother-germane pledges for his
safety: <hi>Macklain</hi> upon his importunity yielded to go, but refused the pledges,
left he should seem to distrust him, and so went, taking with him of the trustiest of
his kindred and servants, some 45.</p>
                  <p>They arrived in <hi>Kyntire</hi> early in the morning,<note place="margin">

with liberal feasting, according to that peoples custome. At night when they were
gone to rest, <hi>Mackoneil</hi> beset the house, wherein <hi>Macklain</hi> and his people lay, with
a number of men, and called him to come forth and drink; he answered, that of
drink they had too much, and that it was then time to rest. Yet it is my will, said
<hi>Mackoneil,</hi> that ye arise and come forth. <hi>Macklain</hi> hearing this, began to suspect
some bad dealing, and dressing himself and his men, did open the dore, where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a company in Armes, and <hi>Mackoneil</hi> with his sword drawn; he asked
what the matter was, and if he meant to break his faith. No faith, said he, I
gave none, and must now have an account of you, and your friends for the
wrong I have received. <hi>Macklain</hi> had taken that night his nephew a little child to
bed with him, and being put to his defence, kept the childe upon his left shoulder in
manner of a targe. The childe cried for mercy to his Uncle: wherewith <hi>Macko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neil</hi>
moved, did promise to spare his life, providing he would render his weapons,
and become his prisoner. <hi>Macklain</hi> seeing no better, was content, and thereupon
was conveighed with some keepers to another house; All the rest (two excepted)
upon the like promise rendred themselves. The two whom he refused to spare, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the dore so desperately, as neither he nor his men durst enter: whereupon
fire was put to the house, and they burnt within the same. The others that rendered,
notwithstanding the promise given them, were all beheaded in <hi>Macklains</hi> sight,
some of them the next morning, and the rest the days following. <hi>Macklain</hi> himself
had gone the same way, but that it happened <hi>Mackoneil</hi> by a fall from his horse to
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:50008:187"/>
break his leg, by which accident his execution was prolonged. In the mean time,
upon notice given to the King of that barbarous fact, an Herauld was sent with a
charge to deliver <hi>Macklain</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Argile;</hi> but this availed not, but still he
was detained and compelled to yeild vnto most unreasonable conditions, before he
got his liberty; which was no sooner obtained, then <hi>Macklain</hi> to revenge himself,
fell upon <hi>Mackoneils</hi> bounds, burning and killing man wife and childe, without
mercy; and so took a cruel revenge of the others treachery.</p>
                  <p>A little before this trouble in the <hi>Isles,</hi>

not only within their own States and Dominions, but also in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
left they should seem to be lesse solicitous for the defence thereof, then
were their enemies who thought to overthrow the same; have thought it necessary
as well for the preservation of their own persons, on whose safety doth the Well of

Religion which they now professe, to joyn and unite themselves in a more strict
league then hath been between any Princes their Progenitors.</p>

footmen, or a lesser number, as it shall please the said Queen to require, and should
cause them be conducted from the borders of <hi>Scotland</hi> into any part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England,</hi> upon the charges of the said Queen; And in case the said Realm of
<hi>Scotland</hi> be invaded in any part remote from the borders of <hi>England</hi> by any forain
force, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> upon requisition made to her by the King, should
furnish 3000 horsemen, and 6000 footmen, or a lesser number at the option of the
said King, and shall cause them to be conducted to any part of the Realm of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
upon the Kings charges.</p>
                  <p>6. That in case the invasion should be upon the North parts of the Realm of
<hi>England,</hi> within 60 miles of the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King being required by
the Queen, should gather all the forces he could make, and joyn with the <hi>English</hi>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:50008:188"/>
power for pursuing the said invaders, and keep them together for the space of thirty
days or so much longer (if it be required) as the subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> are usually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to stay in the fields for the defence of their own Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>7. That upon any invasion or trouble arising in the Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the King
upon notice given to him thereof, should not only inhibit the repair thither of any
of the inhabitants of <hi>Argile, Isles</hi> and places adjacent, or any other parts of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions;
but also if it shall happen them or any of them to go into <hi>Ireland</hi> with a
number extraordinary, and in hostile manner, the King upon signification of the
same, should denonnce them his Rebels, and pursue them as Traitors.</p>
                  <p>8. That neither of their Majesties should hereafter aid, supply, assist or entertain
the Rebels or adversaries of the other, nor permit them to reside either privately
or publickly in any part of their dominions, but upon the first requisition of the
Prince, to whom they are Rebels, they should undelayedly be delivered according
to the old leagues and treaties, or then expulsed forth of their dominions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
made for any injuries they should happen to commit, during their abode in
the same.</p>
                  <p>9. That all controversies about matters of borders or wrongs committed in the
Marches since the time of the Kings accepting the government in his own person,
and by the space of four years preceding; should be friendly determined and satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the sight of Commissioners to be appointed on both sides, who should meet
at the within six moneths after the date of the presents, and decide
thereupon.</p>
                  <p>10. That neither of their Majesties should enter into any league or treaty (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the consent of the other, by letters signed with their hands under their privy
signet)
with any other Prince or State whatsoever, to the prejudice of the present
Treaty.</p>
                  <p>11. That all former treaties betwixt their Majesties progenitors, and both
Realms, notwithstanding any discontinuance thereof, should stand in full force,
so farre as they should not be found derogatory to the present treaty, and that this
treaty should not infringe any league made by either of their Majesties or their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors,
with other their friends and confederates, in any time by-gone, the cause
of Religion onely excepted, wherein the present league is declared to be
offensive and defensive.</p>
                  <p>12. That both their Majesties should confirm the league by their oathes and
great Seals, which should be interchanged, and mutually delivered to others.</p>
                  <p>13. Lastly, that the King at his coming to the perfect age of 25. years, should
cause the present league to be ratified by the States of the Kingdome; like as the
Queen at the same time should cause it to be confirmed in her Parliament of
<hi>England</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These were the Articles of the league concluded at <hi>Berwick,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The names of the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of both Kingdomes.</note> and signed by
<hi>Francis</hi> Earl <hi>Bothwel, Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Boyd,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Home</hi> of <hi>Coldinknowes,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
for the King; As likewise by <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Rutland, William</hi> Lord
<hi>Evers,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Randolph,</hi> Commissioners for the Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was believed, that this amity contracted with such deliberation should have
continued firm;<note place="margin">A new breach between the King and Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> for (besides the publick league) the Queen had sent to the King a
letter under her own hand, wherein she did faithfully promise to suffer nothing to
be done, that might derogate or prejudge his right and title to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And for a further demonstration of her kindnesse, had presented him with a
gift of annuity answerable to the lands possessed by the Lady <hi>Lennox</hi> in her time,
which the King by divers Ambassadours had formerly required, as due to him.
Yet a few moneths after, brake out a businesse that put them in worse terms then
before, and was with no small difficulty pacified; the story whereof shall next
be related.</p>
                  <p>The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> being touched in the trial of <hi>Babingtons</hi> conspiracy,<note place="margin">The proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings against the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
                     </note> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
interchanged divers letters with him, a consultation was kept concerning her,
and what was fittest to be done; for they considered that all the conspiracies made
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:50008:188"/>
against the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> being chiefly intended in hope of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen
her succession so long as she lived, their Soveraign should never be secured, and
that therefore the surest course was to put her out of the way; But how this should
be done, the opinions were different. The Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> advising to dispatch
her secretly by poyson, Secretary <hi>Walsingham</hi> did mightily oppose it, as that which
would draw upon the Queen both danger and dishonour, and besides, in it self was
a thing injust, and no better then a cruel murther. Wherefore his opinion was,
that the course of Law should be kept, and Commission given for making her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and as the trial should prove, for giving sentence and judgement. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
prevailing, certain Noblemen Counsellours and Judges were chosen for the
businesse, who meeting at the Castle of <hi>Fotheringham</hi> (where the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>
was kept) the eleventh of <hi>October,</hi> and calling her before them, did charge her with
the said conspiracy, and entercourse of letters. She refusing to answer, and be
tried as a subject, being her self an absolute Queen; they notthelesse went on, and
finding her guilty,<note place="margin">Sentence of death pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against her.</note> pronounced the sentence of death; which was shortly thereafter
confirmed by the Estates of Parliament, and a supplication therewith delivered to
the Queen for putting their decree in execution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How soon the King was advertised hereof, he sent</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>William Keith</hi> sent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> about the midst of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</hi>
                     </note> William Keith <hi>Gentleman of
his chamber to the Queen, with a letter to this effect.</hi> That howbeit it seemed strange
to him that the Nobility and Counsellors of <hi>England</hi> should take upon them to give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon a Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and one descended of the Royal blood of <hi>England,</hi> yet
he would think it much more strange, if she should stain her hands with the blood of his
mother, who was of the same Royal condition with her self, and of the same sexe: which as
he could not believe, would enter into her heart to do; so if it should be, he desired her to
consider how much it touched him in honour, that was both a King and a sonne, to suffer
his mother an absolute Prince, to be put to an infamous death.</p>
                  <p>No answer being returned to this,<note place="margin">A letter to <hi>William Keith</hi> from the King.</note> upon new advertisement that the Queen was
like to be drawn by the importunity of her Estates to give way to the execution, he
wrote to <hi>William Keith</hi> more sharply, <q>requiring him to shew the Queen how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
he held that proceeding against his mother, and that it did neither agree with
the will of God, who prohibiteth to touch his anointed ones, nor with the law
of Nations; That an absolute Prince should be sentenced and judged by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
and if she would be the first to give that pernicious example of profaning
her own and other Princes Diadems, to remember her, that both in respect of
nature and honour it concerned him to be revenged of so great an indignity;
which if he should not do, he should peril his credit both at home and abroad;
and therefore willed him for to labour for a delay, untill he should send an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
with overtures that might content and satisfy her Majesty. For by a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sent from Mr. <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> that stayed as Leiger in <hi>England,</hi>
                     </q> he found
him not well disposed in the businesse, and thereupon resolved to employ a more
honourable person, and one of greater trust</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Keith</hi> having intreated the Queen for a delay,<note place="margin">The Queen in passion at the sight of the letter.</note> when as he could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the same, did shew her the direction he had received from the King: at which
she grew into such a passion, that if <hi>Leicester</hi> and others of the Councel who stood
by, had not pacified her (saying that the King did only request that his mother
might be well used, which was a thing natural, and in him an honourable part; and
that some ill affected persons possibly had stirred him up to write so sharply) she
had simply refused him any more hearing. But after she had calmed a little she
said, <hi>That she would give no answer in anger, and would think of it to the next morning.</hi>
At which time calling him again, she said, <hi>That no precipitation should be used, and if
any did come from the King within a few days, she would stay all proceeding to that time,
and be glad to hear such overtures, as might save the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>life, and assure
her own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King advertised of this,<note place="margin">The King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth the sharpnesse of his letter.</note> and conceiving some hope that matters would
draw to an agreement, wrote of new to the Queen, and shewed <q>he was sorry to
understand that his letter sent to <hi>William Keith,</hi> had been construed as if he did
threaten her and her Estates, whereas his purpose was only to inform her of the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:50008:189"/>
rumours going in the countrey, and how much his subjects were moved at these
forms of proceeding with their Queen. That for himself, he knew well enough how
hardly she was pressed by objecting unto her the perill of her own life; and that
he never blamed her directly for any thing that was done. Therefore prayed her
to accompt him her most honest and stedfast friend, since he never had nor should
deserve any other at her hand, and that for his sake she would continue any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
against his mother, till his overtures should be heard, which the Master
of <hi>Gray</hi> should bring with him, who was to take journey on the Saterday
following.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This letter was speedily carried to the Queen, which gave her some content,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Master of</hi> Gray <hi>and Sir</hi> Robert Melvil <hi>sent into</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> for
thereby she perceived the rumours to be vain which were dispersed, that he was
minded to break the league, and denounce warre. The King in the mean time
having convocated the Estates, and imparted to them the case wherein his mother
stood, had very liberal promises given him, and a present supply of money gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for dispatch of his Ambassadour. And being advised by the Estates to joyn
Sir <hi>Robert Melvil</hi> in Commission with the Master of <hi>Gray,</hi> as one that had served
his mother long, and was truly affected unto her, the Commission was given to
them both, and they put in equal trust. So parting from <hi>Halirudhouse</hi> the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<hi>December,</hi> they came to <hi>London</hi> the penult of the moneth.</p>
                  <p>The next day Master <hi>Archtbald Douglas</hi> being sent to desire audience,<note place="margin">The first au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> the same
was refused upon information that they had been with <hi>Monsieur Bellieur</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
Ambassadour, who was imployed in the same errand, and had parted from the
Queen in wrath; yet the contrary being shewed, and that they refused to make any
visit till they had prefence of her Majesty, they had accesse granted the first of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary.</hi>
At her first meeting she quarrelled the letter sent to <hi>William Keith,</hi> asking if
they were sent with the like threats. They answering that his Majesties letter might
receive a good construction, and that he had interpreted himself by another, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
since that time to her Majesties self, she brake forth into these speeches, <hi>I am
unmeasurably sorry that there can be no means found to save the life of your Kings
mother, and assure mine own, I have laboured to conserve the life of us both, but now I see
it cannot be done.</hi> The Ambassadour replied, that the case was nothing so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and that means would be found to put her Majesty in assurance; yet because
they perceived her to be somewhat commoved, they did not think meet to enter
at that time more deeply in the businesse.</p>
                  <p>At their second audience which was on the tenth day,<note place="margin">The second audience and effect thereof.</note> the Queen begun with
them, in this sort. <hi>A thing long looked for, should be good when it cometh; I would
now hear what are your Kings offers.</hi> The Master (as having the first place) answered,
no man makes offer, but for some cause. If it like your Majesty, we desire to know
if the person be extant for whom we offer, (for the rumour went constantly that the
execution was past.) As yet, said the Queen, I think she be, but will not promise an
hour. Nay said the Master, we come not to shift, but to offer from our Soveraign
whatsoever in reason can be required; specially, that he shall interpose his credit in
behalf of his mother, and give the chief of his Nobility for pledges, that no plot
nor practise should be contrived against your Majesty with her knowledge or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:
or if that be not sufficient, and that it shall please your Majesty to set her at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and send her into <hi>Scotland,</hi> a course shall be taken for securing your Majesty
from all such attempts by her occasion.</p>
                  <p>The Queen calling the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> with the Lords Admiral and Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
who were nigh by, repeated in their hearing these offers, setting them all at
nought: whereupon the Master took occasion to ask, <hi>What should move any man to
attempt against her Majesty for the Queen of</hi> Scots? Because said the Queen, they
think she shall succeed to me, and that she is a Papist. <hi>And if these means shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away,</hi> said the Master, <hi>apparently the danger will cease.</hi> This, sayes the Queen,
I would be glad to understand. <hi>If her right succession to</hi> England <hi>shall be made over in
our Soveraigns person</hi> (said he) <hi>Papists will have no more hope, and this I think the
Queen his mother will dimit and resign to him.</hi> But she hath no right, said the Queen,
for she is declared incapable of succession. And <hi>if she have no right,</hi> said the Master,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:50008:189"/>
                     <hi>the hope of Papists ceaseth, and it is not to be feared that they will enterprise for her.</hi> But
the Papists, said the Queen, do not allow our Declaration. <hi>Then let it fall,</hi> said he,
<hi>in the Kings person by her resignation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Earl of</hi> Leicester <hi>ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ecting that she was a prisoner, and could not dimit, the
Master answered,</hi> That the dimission being made to her son, with the advice of all the
friends in <hi>Europe,</hi> in case (as God forbid) the Queen by any attempt should be cut off, she
would have none to partake with her against her son, all the princes her friends stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged for her resignation, that it should be valid and effectual to her son. <hi>The
Queen making as though she did not understand him, the Earl of</hi> Leicester <hi>said, that
the Ambassadours meaning was, that the king should be in his Mothers place,</hi> Is it
so? <hi>sayes the Queen,</hi> then I put my self in worse case before; By Gods passion <hi>(this was
her oath)</hi> that were to cut mine own throat: he shall never come in that place, and be
party to me. <hi>The Master answered, that</hi> he would be more party, if he should come in
his Mothers place through her death. Well, <hi>said the Queen,</hi> tell your King what I have
done for him, to keep the Crown on his head since he was born, and that for my part, I
mind to keep the league that stands betwixt us; which if he break, it shall be a double
fault. <hi>And with these words she made away; Sir</hi> Robert Melvil <hi>following her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
for some eight days continuance of the execution, whereunto she answered,</hi>
Not an hour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King advertised of this conference,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A letter from the King to the Master of <hi>Gray.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and that nothing but extremity was to
be expected, wrote with his own hand to the Master of</hi> Gray, <hi>as followeth.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
your self no longer in your dealing for my mother, for you have done it too long, and
think not that any thing will do good if her life be lost, for then adicu with further dealing
with that State. Therefore if you look for the continuance of my favour, spare no pains nor
plainnesse in this case, but read my letter written to <hi>William Keith,</hi> and conform your self
wholly to the contents thereof, and in this let me reap the fruits of your great credit there,
either now or never. Farewell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But before this letter came unto the Master,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Master of <hi>Gray</hi> drawne upon another course.</note> 
                     <hi>he was drawn upon another course
and made more cold in the businesse, and (as the fame went) had taken upon him
to pacify the King, though the execution proceeded. Mean while the Earl of</hi> Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester
<hi>wrote to the King a letter, wherein not obscurely shewing what was resolved,
he advised him to deal more moderately in that matter of his mother, her cause not
being worth the losing of such a friend as the Queen his Soveraign was.</hi> For albeit
no man, <hi>said he,</hi> can blame your Majesty to speak for the safety of your mothers life; yet
under your favour, your Majesty being a Prince and a King, you ought to weigh without
partiality the case of other Kings and Princes, as if it might be your own. Iustice should
in the bosome of all Princes have such place, that whatsoever affection may draw them, if the
thing which any of them doth for the preservation of their own life and estate be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it ought to be borne withall by others. <hi>And proceeding in this manner, he said,</hi> Let
the case of the Queen my Soveraign be made your Majesties, and that any King or Prince
being in your hands, claiming title to your Crown, would raise warre within your Realm
against you, or conspire with traitors within your Court or countrey to kill you; in that
case I would fain know what would be thought fit by any faithful or good subject of yours,
that you should do to such a one? Nay, give me leave I humbly beseech you, to ask even of
your self, what you would think fit in such a case: there is no other difference, but that this
offence is done to the Queen Majesty by your mother. <hi>And after that a little (for the
letter is long)</hi> If my plain speech may be without offence to your Majesty, I would wish you
to think well of this case: remember how near it is to you, and how much nearer it may be
to you; it is seen to all the world wherefore the life of our Mistris is sought, whose death
may be as farre out of your way, as your mothers liberty hath heretofore been dangerous to
your estate. And if it be true which I have heard, your Majesties self by her will, had as
well been dispossessed of the possession of that you have, as defeated of any remainder you
thought to have interest in. And therefore as Kings be, and ought to be jealous of their
own estate, so I doubt not but your Majesty will deeply consider of this case of your mothers,
wherein you may perform both the Office of a Son, and of a King. And as I have always
advised you, so do I still, except for a just cause (which I am perswaded you shall never
have) give not her Majesty any cause to conceive a breach of love and friendship on your
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:50008:190"/>
part. She is the person and Prince in the world, that may do you most good or most harm;
let no perswasion or device make you think otherwise: the world is full of practise, and
the worst heads most busy, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>At the same time Secretary <hi>Walsingham</hi> writing to the Lord <hi>Thirlstan</hi> the Kings
Secretary,<note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham</hi> writeth to the Lord <hi>Thirlstan.</hi>
                     </note> with whom he kept intelligence, declared <q>that it was wondred by all
wise and religious men in <hi>England,</hi> that the King should be so earnest in the cause
of his mother, seeing all the Papists in <hi>Europe</hi> that affected the change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in both Realms, did build their hopes altogether upon her, and that she had
shewed her self so passionate in point of Religion, as she had transferred her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
right to both the Crowns untothe King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in case the King her son
should persist in his profession.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true that such informations were given out amongst the Papists to divert the
King from constancy in his profession, but that any such tranflation was made by
her it is not probable, and a thing not to be believed; her Declaration at the time of
her death being far other, as we shall hear; Albeit a Popish Abbot descriving the life
of <hi>Laurens</hi> the Cardinal, who was at that time Protector of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
the foresaid translation to have been in his hands, and to have been delivered
to him by Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour at <hi>Rome.</hi> But that doth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
little credit: such forged titles would perhaps have served, if the enterprise of
the 88. had succeeded, but they are now of little purpose.</p>
                  <p>The King perceiving by all these letters that the death of his mother was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,<note place="margin">The King commandeth the Ministers to remember his mother in their prayers.</note>
called back his Ambassadours; and at home gave order to the Ministers
to remember her in their publick prayers: which they denied to do, though the
form prescrived was most Christian and lawful: which was, <hi>that it might please
God to illuminate her with the light of his truth, and save her from the apparent danger
wherein she was cast.</hi> Upon their denial charges were directed to command all Bishops,
Ministers, and other office-bearers in the Church, to make mention of her distresse
in their publick prayers, and commend her to God in the form appointed. But of all
the number, Mr. <hi>David Lindesay</hi> at <hi>Leth,</hi> and the Kings own Ministers, gave obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
At <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the disobedience was most publick, the King purposing
to have their fault amended,<note place="margin">The third of <hi>February,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for solemn prayers in her behalf.</note> did appoint the third of <hi>February</hi> for solemn prayers to
be made in her behalf, commanding the Bishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> to prepare himself
for that day; which when the Ministers understood, they stirred up Mr. <hi>Iohn

the time,<note place="margin">The Bishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> appointed to preach, Mr. <hi>Iohn Cowper</hi> usurpeth the place.</note> and exclude the Bishop. The King coming at the hour appointed, and
seeing him in the place, called to him from his seat, and said, Mr. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that place
was destinate for another, yet since you are there, if you will obey the charge that
is given, and remember my mother in your prayers, you shall go on; he replying, <hi>he
would do as the spirit of God should direct him,</hi> was commanded to leave the place:
and making as though he would stay, the Captain of the Guard went to pull him
out; whereupon he burst forth in these speeches, <hi>This day shall be a witnesse against
the King, in the great day of the Lord:</hi> and then denouncing a woe to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he went down, and the Bishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> entering the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
did perform the duty required. The noise was great for a while amongst the
people, but after they were quieted, and had heard the Bishop (as he was a most
powerful Preacher) out of that text to <hi>Timothy,</hi> discourse of the duty of Christians
in <hi>praying for all men,</hi> they grieved fore to see their teachers so farre overtaken, and
condemned their obstinacy in that point. In the afternoon <hi>Cowper</hi> was called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Councel, where Mr. <hi>Walter Balcanquel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Watson</hi> Ministers,
accompanying him, for some idle speeches that escaped them, were both dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from preaching in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Ministers at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> discharged.</note> during his Majesties pleasure, and <hi>Cowper</hi> sent

pronounced against her, and being willed to prepare her self for death, was
nothing thereby dejected, but thanked God for that her sorrowful life was now to
end, intreated the Queen of <hi>England</hi> by her letters, for three things: <q>First, that
her body might be carried by her servants into <hi>France,</hi> to be buried besides her
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:50008:190"/>
mother. Next, that she should not to be put to death secretly, but in the presence
of her servants and others, who might bear witnesse of her dying <hi>in Christ,</hi>
against the false rumours which her adversaries might disperse of her. Thirdly,
that her servants might have leave to go whither they would, and enjoy the
mean legacies she had bequeathed unto them in her Testament;</q> which things
she requested, <hi>in the name of Iesus Christ, by the soul and memory of</hi> Henry the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     <hi>Progenitor to them both, and by the royal honour and title which she had carried.</hi> In the
same letters she complained of the indignity done unto her, in the taking away of
her royal furniture, and that her keepers did use her without that respect which was
due to her estate and birth. But to none of these desires was any answer given, the
Queen of <hi>England</hi> dissembling that she had received any such letter.</p>
                  <p>Yet was she much perplexed and doubtful what to do,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>England,</hi> is doubtful which way to take.</note> whether to take her out of
the way or not. If she should be spared, she doubted the Noblemen who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
sentence against her, would take it ill, and perhaps run other courses to free
themselves from her malice; and to take her away, she knew it would be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a great cruelty on her part, as likewise that the King her son would be sore
displeased: for albeit that the Master of <hi>Gray</hi> at his parting from her, had in private
given hopes that the Kings title being reserved, and no prejudice made thereto by
the sentence given against his mother, her death would be forgotten; yet Sir <hi>Robert
Melvil</hi> who was joyned in Commission with him had assured her, if rigour were
used, that friendship would no longer be kept. Debating thus with her self some
days upon the most expedient, she signed a warrant for the execution, and gave it
to <hi>Davison</hi> one of her Secretaries to be passed the great Seal: which was no sooner
done, then repenting the direction, she told him that she would take another way.
But having before communicated the Warrant with the Councel, they presently
sent <hi>Beal</hi> their Clerk with the Mandate and Letters to the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury, Kent,
Derby,</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> to see the same performed.</p>
                  <p>The Earls accompanied with the Sheriffe of the Shire and Justices of Peace,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> willed to prepare her self for death.</note> came
to <hi>Fotheringham</hi> on <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and having signified the cause of
their coming, willed the Queen to prepare her self to die, for that she was to suffer
the next morning. She was no way moved, as it seemed, and said, <hi>I did not think that
Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>my Sister, would have consented to my death, but since it is so, death is
to me most welcome. That soul is not worthy of the heavens joyes, whose body cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
one blow of the hangman: only I will request,</hi> said she, <hi>that I may speak with my
Confessor, and</hi> Melvil <hi>my Steward.</hi> It was answered, that her Confessor would not be
permitted to come unto her, but she should have the Bishop, or Dean of <hi>Peterborow</hi>
who were nigh by to give her comfort. She replied, <hi>They are of another profession,
and cannot be sit comforters to me: but since you will not allow my Confessor to come at me,
I will comfort my self in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some other speeches passed amongst them touching <hi>Babington,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her behaviour and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and her Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>No,</hi> and <hi>Curle,</hi> who had both confessed the enterchange of letters with <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington;</hi>
after which the Earls departed; she calling for supper, commanded her
servants to make haste, that she might have leisure to set things in order. Having
supped sparingly (as her custome was) she made an Inventory of her goods and
moveables, setting down the names of those, for whom she appointed them; &amp; unto
some she gave money with her own hand. This done, she wrote unto her Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
intreating him to pray unto God for her; and a few lines to the <hi>French</hi> King,
and Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> in behalf of her servants; at the ordinary hour she went to bed
and slept some hours quietly, after which having awaked, she spent the rest of the
night in prayer.</p>
                  <p>The day beginning to break, she apparelled her self as she was wont to do on the
Festival days, and calling together her servants, shewed unto them her Will, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them to take in good part the Legacies she had bequeathed unto them since her
means were at the time no better; and then gave her self wholly to devotion.
About eight of the clock, the Sheriffe of the Shire named named <hi>Thomas Andrews</hi>
entered the Chappel, where she was praying on her knees, and told her that all was
ready: and, I am likewise, said she. Thus arising, she came forth to her Chamber
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:50008:191"/>
of presence, where she made a short speech to her servants, willing them to fear
God, and live vertuously: and so kissing her women, and giving the men-servants
her hand to kisse, she bad them farewel.</p>

Mr. Dean,</hi> said she, <hi>I have nothing to do with you, nor you with me.</hi> The Noblemen
desiring him not to trouble her further, she said, <hi>That is best, for I am setled in the
ancient Catholick Religion, wherein I was born and bred, and new will die in the same.</hi>
The Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> saying, that as yet they would not cease to pray unto God for
her, that he would vouchsafe to open her eyes, and enlighten her mind with the
knowledge of his truth, that she might die therein. She answered, <hi>That you may do

them back saying, <hi>She was not accustomed to be served with such grooms, nor dressed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

which was laced on the back, and putting on her Armes a pair of silken sleeves, her
body covered with a smock only, she kissed her maids again, and bad them farewel.
They bursting forth in tears, she said, <hi>I promised for you that you should be quiet,

and with the least token of fear that might be, having her eyes covered with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief,
she repeated the Psalm, <hi>In te, Domine, confido, ne confundar in aeternum.</hi>
Then stretching forth her body with great quietnesse, and laying her neck over the
block, she cried aloud, <hi>In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum.</hi> One of the
executioners holding down her hands, the other at two blowes cut off her head;
which falling out of her attire, seemed to be somewhat gray. All things about her
were taken from the executioners, and they not suffered to carry their Aprons, or
anything else with them that her blood had touched, the clothes and block were
also burnt, her body embalmed, and in solemn manner buried in the Cathedral
Church at <hi>Peterburrow;</hi> and after many years taken up by the King her son, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred

forced her to flee into <hi>England;</hi> where after 19. years captivity, she was put to death

with your mother; which warrant she delivered to her Secretary Mr. <hi>Davison</hi> to be
kept, not intending it should be given out of his hands, except some invasion from abroad,
or insurrection of Rebels at home, were made to procure her liberty. But her Secretary
otherwise then she had purposed, having shewed the Warrant to two or three of the Councel,
they called the whole number together, and presently sent a mandate for her execution;
which was done, she protests to God, before she knew of it. Hereupon the Secretary is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and will not escape her high displeasure. This is the effect of my message, which if
I could expresse so lively, as I did hear her utter it with a heavy heart, and sorrowful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;

mother happened, I did forthwith upon my return impart to Mr.
<hi>Douglas</hi> some things concerning the course was conceived here, by your said
Soveraigns best friends, fit to be holden in this remedilesse accident for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of peace and amity between the two Crowns, as a thing for the weal of both
Nations to be desired. But finding him unwilling to meddle therewith, I have
thought good to write to the same effect unto your self. The rather for that I
presently understand, by some advertisements out of that countrey, that the death
of the Queen is likely to breed so strange an alienation of his Majesties mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this Realm, tending (as is reported) wholly to violence, and to revenge of
that which hath been so necessarily done by the whole body of the same; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as for mine own part, I should be right sorry, so it is generally hoped, that his
Majesty being of that singular judgement himself, by the good help and advice
of such as you are, in credit and authority about him, men of wisdom and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
whom he will hear; this mischief will notwithstanding be carefully and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
prevented, considering how every way, all things being rightly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
this course will be found prejudicial as well to your said Soveraigns estate,
as to his reputation, if he resolve to persist therein.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>For first, the enterprise will undoubtedly be condemned in the sight of all such
as shall not be transported with some particular passion: for that they shall see,
that he takes Armes for revenge of an Action, besides the necessity wherein it is
grounded, full of so honourable and just proceedings, as howsoever the effect
was contrary to their liking, the manner thereof by the late Queens great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers,
could not but be approved and allowed. And as on the one side, the
King your Soveraign oppugning the course of Justice, of so unlawful, unjust,
and desperate a quarrel, cannot be expected any other thing, then a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
and miserable issue: so we being assured that in the defence of Justice the
assistance of his mighty arm will not fail us, whose judgement this was, need not
to fear whatsoever man shall attempt to the contrary against this Realm.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But not to stand upon the justnesse of the quarrel, which every man perhaps
will not so much regard; It would be considered what means your Soveraign shall
have to go through with such an enterprise, if he take it in hand. For the forces
of his own Realm, being so farre inferiour to these in <hi>England,</hi> no man is so simple,
but seeth it were no way safe for his Majesty, trusting only thereto, to make head
against the power of this land; neither is it thought that any man will be found
so unadvised, as to wish him so to do.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But as it may be, that a great number for lack of understanding are carried
away with such vain discourses, as some without solid ground imagine of that
might be done in this case, by a King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> backed and assisted (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in the aire) with the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> aid; so it is likely enough, there
shall not want those, that either satisfaction of their private passions, or supply of
their necessities, or better affectionating some other their private designes; would
be content to serve themselves of this present publick occasion and opportunity:
who will propound, and promise also more to his Majesty of such forain assistance,
then they know in their consciences can be performed, if he would declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
enemy to this Realm; which that he should, (though to his own ruine) the
enemies of both Realms will do what they can to procure.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But men of wisdom and understanding, laying before their eyes as well the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
delayes, and after long solicitation and pursuit, the simple supplies and
support, commonly found at these forain Potentates hands; as also, how doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and uncertain the successe of warre may prove, <hi>England</hi> (God be thanked)
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:50008:193"/>
being so prepared, and in case to defend it self, both otherwise, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zelands</hi> forces by Sea, in respect whereof this Realm
need not fear, what all the Potentates of <hi>Europe</hi> being bended against us, can do
for to annoy the same; Due consideration, I say, being taken hereof, you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
judge and find, how vain it were for your Soveraign upon so uncertain hopes
to embark himself and estate in an unnecessary warre. But much more if you
shall consider, what a sequell and train of dangers and hazards this warre draweth
therewith, the consequence whereof, reacheth to whatsoever your Soveraign
possesseth, or hopeth for in this life. For escaping to be slain in field, if he should
happen to be taken prisoner; or be constrained to retire himself out of the Realm,
(things that have fallen out oft in experience) and then having incensed this
whole Realm against him, he should be disabled from any right in the succession
of this Crown, (as authority is given to do it by the same Statute, whereby they
proceeded against the mother) for attempting the invasion of this land, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
should he be reduced unto?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>And truly it could not otherwise be, the ancient enmity between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
now forgotten, being by drawing blood one of another again, likely to be
in such sort revived, as it would be impossible to make them like of a Prince of
that Nation, and specially him who had been upon so unjust a ground the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of that unfortunate breach.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Besides, that the greatest part of the ancient Nobility, by whose judgement
the late Queen was condemned, and the rest of the principal Gentlemen of the
Realm, who confirmed the same in Parliament, should have just cause to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
any thing even to the marching over their bellies, rather then to yeild to
his government, who carrying such a vindictive minde, they might doubt would
one day call their lives and honours in question.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>And as for the remedy and relief which he might attend (standing in these
terms) of forain Princes; there are many examples of the former ages, and within
fresh memory. As the King of <hi>Navarres</hi> Grandfather by the mothers side, and
<hi>Christiern</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> both were allied to <hi>Francis</hi> the first, and <hi>Charles</hi> the
fist, two of the mightiest Potentates that reigned in long time; And that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Don Antonio</hi> may suffice for ensamples, to teach all Princes, if they can avoid
it, to beware how they fall into that state whereby they shall be inforced to seek
their own by other Potentates means. Princes are not so ready in these days, to
embrace other mens quarrels, but where they are extraordinarily interressed in their
own fortunes.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Wherefore I doubt not, but it will be seen by men of judgement, not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with passion, or led away with private respects; that it should be every
way the only best course for your Soveraign, by a good and kind usage of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and by shewing that Princely moderation; as well in this grievous accident
of his mothers death, as his whole proceeding with this Realm, (which the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of his Highness education seemeth to promise) to seek to win the hearty good
wills of this Realm, as the chief and principal assurance he can in any sort obtain.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>For to trust or depend either upon the <hi>French</hi> King, or the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as
if by their assistance he might attain to the present possession of this Crown,
which be indeed the only two Potentates, whom he must have recourse unto, if
he reject the Amity of <hi>England,</hi> whosoever shall so counsel your Soveraign, as
things presently stand, shall in the judgement of men of best understanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
great want either of fidelity or judgement, drawing his Majesty unto so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward
and desperate a course.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>For it is no way safe for any Prince to repose his trust and strength upon their
favour and assistance, to whose desires and designes his greatnesse may yeild any
impeachment and hinderance; so were it clearly against common reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
other support and assistance from them, then might stand with their own
commodities and pretensions, in respect whereof neither of the two foresaid
Kings can simply and roundly joyn with your Soveraign to his good.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>First, his Religion being odious to them both, and likely to prove most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:50008:193"/>
to the Catholick cause, he growing so great, as he should be made by the
union of the two Crowns, the consideration whereof, caused his mothers affairs to
stick a long time, and made now in end leave him quite out of the reckoning, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> her heir, if her son became not Catholick.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Next, it is meerly repugnant to the policy of <hi>France,</hi> were it but in respect
of the ancient claim <hi>England</hi> maketh to that Crown, to suffer the uniting of this
Island under one Prince.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>They have been content in former times, when <hi>England</hi> had a footing in
<hi>France,</hi> to serve themselves of your Nation, therewith to annoy this Realm, by
the means of diverting or dividing the forces thereof; and so perhaps the Politicks
of <hi>France</hi> can be content to wish at this day, by your Soveraigns quarrel, or any
other such like, to be eased of the burthen, and miseries of the present Warre
wherewith they are plagued, by transporting the same into this Island. But as
this Realm hath good means to prevent that mischief if it were intended, so were
your Soveraign to look, when all were done, but to be made an instrument, as his
predecessors have been, of the effusion of much <hi>Scottish</hi> blood for <hi>French</hi> quarrels,
and the desolation of that Realm.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>And as things stand presently in <hi>France,</hi> it is not thought that you should find
the King ready to hearken to any enterprise against this Land, the said King being
most desirous to live in peace, both with his neighbours abroad, and his subjects
at home, but that he hath been forced full sore against his will, by the practise of
them of the house of <hi>Guise,</hi> to countenance with his authority the Civil Warre
raised in that Realm; which maketh him, whatsoever shew he maketh of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
to hate them in his heart</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Neither would it be held sound counsel to be given him by any that depends
upon his fortune, to further the advancement of a King of <hi>Scots,</hi> so nearly allied
to that family, which he hath discovered, and greatly feareth to level at his own
Crown, with any intention to depose him, which by the greatnesse of a King of
<hi>Scots,</hi> they should be so much the sooner and better able to effect.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>The King of <hi>Spains</hi> assistance, being now in Warre with this Realm, were more
likely to be obtained, but farre more dangerous to be used in respect of his insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
ambition, deep practises and power accompanied in this case, with a colour
of right; wherein how farre he would seek to prevail, any opportunity or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
being offered, it may justly be doubted, by the experience that sundry States
have had, which upon slender grounds of title have been extorted and wrung
from the true inheritours, and annexed to his own Kingdom, as <hi>Navarre, Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
and all he possesseth in <hi>Italy</hi> hath been.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>It is believed that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> considering his years and unsetled estate
every way, would willingly incline to peace if it were offered with reasonable
conditions, and not over-readily at this present, embark himself in any new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But otherwise it is well known, that as he had fancied to himself an Empire of all
this part of Europe, so he had an eye to this Realm ever since he was King in right
of his wife. The conquest was intended under colour of Religion, as was discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by some that were of his own Privy Councel at that time; his pretention to be
the heir of the house of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and since the late Queens death, the first Catholick
Prince of the blood Royal of <hi>England,</hi> as also the donation of this Crown made
him by the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> in her letters with a promise to confirm it by Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(things blazed abroad by the said Kings Ambassadour at <hi>Paris</hi>) ought to
breed jealousy and suspicion in your Soveraigns head, and give him to think how
he should be used at such an assistants hand. Auxiliary forces have ever been
reputed dangerous, if they either in number or policy were superiour to them
that called them in. The assistance therefore of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> being of this
nature, as your Soveraign hath need of neither, so he shall do well to forbear
them both, and so shall it be most for his ease.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>It may be some will pretend, that by change of his Religion, your Soveraign
shall better his condition, in regard of these forain Princes, besides a great party
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:50008:194"/>
within this Realm, that thereby shall be drawn wholly to depend upon his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
But the poor distressed estate of <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> being a Catholick Prince
spoiled by a Catholick, and receiving so little succour at Catholick Princes hands,
shall be a sufficient barre to all that can be alleadged in that behalf.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>As for the Catholick party in <hi>England,</hi> in his mothers life it was never so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as they drew all in one line, much lesse will they be brought suddenly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
upon him if he should alter his Religion (as God defend) which would be his
utter discredit and overthrow both with the one and the other party, neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cause to repose any confidence in him: The Protestants because he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the Religion, wherein he was with great care brought up; the Papists
because they could not be assured in short space, that he was truly turned to their
faith. Yea, all men should have reason to forsake him, who had thus dissembled
and forsaken his God.</q>

                        <p>
                           <q>And where it was given out, that divers do insinuate unto your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
that his honour and reputation is so deeply interessed herein, as it
must necessarily turn to his perpetual ignominy and reproach, if he give
not some notable testimony to the world, of the affection and dutiful love
he bare to his mother; your King being of that singular judgement, that
he is thought to have, cannot be ignorant how farre true honour ought
to possesse a Christian Prince; that is, not whither passion or fury useth to
carry men, but whether reason and wisdome have laid the bounds, that is, within
the compasse of possibility, decency and justice. If the late Queen had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
revenge had been necessarily just and honourable, but being culpable,
contrary in all reasonable mens judgements, he hath sufficiently discharged the
duty of a son, in mediating for his mother so long as she was alive, and so farre
as he was able to prevail. They which require more at his Highnesse hands, may
be presumed not to regard what beseemeth his place and dignity, but to seek the
satisfaction of their own particular passions and desires.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>And whosoever perswadeth his Highnesse, that the mediation used by him for
his Mother, contrary to the humble pursuit of the whole Parliament, hath already
given that offence to the Nobility and people of this land, as it behoveth him
of force to have recourse to forain supports, doth greatly abuse both his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and this Realm: for as they were not ignorant what nature might and ought
to move his Highnesse unto, so long as there was any hope of her life; so they
do not doubt but that reason will induce him to leave sorrowing, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her in due time.</q>

                        <p>
                           <q>Thus have I troubled you with a long discourse, whereunto the desire I have
of the continuance of amity between the two Crowns, hath carried me unawares
further then I purposed; all which I referre to your good consideration, not
doubting, but you will afford most readily and willingly all good offices that
shall lye in your power, to the end that a happy conclusion may ensue hereof,
which shall tend to the common good of the whole <hi>Island;</hi> and so I commit you

                  <p>THis letter shewed to the King, served much to allay his anger; as afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
In the <hi>May</hi> after,<note place="margin">A Convention of the Estates.</note> the Estates being assembled at <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi> they
shew a great forwardnesse all of them for assisting the revenge of his Mothers death,
every man offering to spend his goods and life in that quarrel; yet the businesse was
so timed out that summer, by the private dealing of certain Counsellors, as hopes
were given to the Queen,<note place="margin">The King is informed of certain speeches uttered by the Master of <hi>Gray, 20. Apr.</hi>
                     </note> that matters should compose, and a more peaceable
course be taken.</p>
                  <p>It was at this time that Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi> brother to Captain <hi>Iames,</hi> returned
again to Court, and gave his attendance upon the Master of <hi>Gray.</hi> The Master then
was plotting a change of Court, and had conspired with the Lord <hi>Maxwel</hi> to kill
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:50008:194"/>
the Lord <hi>Thirlstane,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Home</hi> of <hi>Coldingknowes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Douglas,</hi>
Collector, whose power with the King he greatly envied. This he reveales to Sir
<hi>William,</hi> as one that he believed would take part in the businesse; and to make him
the more forward, tells, <hi>that it was</hi> Thirlstane, <hi>the Iustice Clerk,</hi> Blantyre, <hi>and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that brought in the Lords at</hi> Striveling, <hi>and put his brother from Court, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
and would help so farre as he could, to recall him.</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> knowing the
mans nature, and that he was not to be trusted, gave him some hopes of joyning
with him, but in the mean time related all to the King. This coming to <hi>Thirlstanes</hi>
knowledge, he complaineth thereof in Councel, and desireth a trial. The Master
denied that any such purpose had passed betwixt them; whereupon Sir <hi>William</hi> was
called, and standing to that he had told the King, they two fell a contesting; after
some bitter speeches, Sir <hi>William</hi> taking him up roundly, said, <hi>that he deserved no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
as having abused his ambassage to</hi> England, <hi>and treacherously consented to the death
of the Kings Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There had a rumour gone of a letter written by the Master to the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
after his parting from that Court,<note place="margin">The Master of <hi>Gray</hi> and Sir <hi>William Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi> committed.</note> advising her to put the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> out
of the way; and the words he had used, <hi>Mortui non mordent,</hi> Dead folks bite not,
were in every mans mouth: and now the challenge being made publick the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
moved the King to put the Master to trial, and commit both the one and the
other. So were they both the same night sent to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The Lord
<hi>Thirlstane,</hi> and those others that were touched with the enterprise of <hi>Striveling,</hi>
made great instance to be cleared in that point, but the King not liking to search
too deeply in those businesses, said, <hi>That their own purgation, with the Declaration of
the Noblemen that came home at that time, was sufficient.</hi> There were present of that
number, the Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Marre</hi> and <hi>Bothwel,</hi> who upon oath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<hi>that they had no assurance from any about the King at the time of their coming,
till they were received by his Majesty in favour.</hi> The like purgation was made by the
Lord <hi>Thirlstane,</hi> the Justice Clerk, and the rest, and so that businesse ceased.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After some two or three days,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi> insists in the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of the Master of <hi>Gray.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>the Master of</hi> Gray <hi>and his accuser were brought
again before the Councel, where the same things that before we heard, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
by Sir</hi> William Stewart, <hi>he added further,</hi> That he knew the Master to be a traffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
against Religion, and that he had written divers letters to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> declaring that the King was to seek their assistance, in revenge of his
mothers death, but intreated them not to grant him any help, unlesse he did grant tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Catholicks, for exercise of their Religion. <hi>The Master being desired to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and as he lookt for any favour to deal ingenuously, and confesse the truth,
said,</hi> That he could not deny his dealing for toleration of Catholicks, and that he disliked
some of the officers of State, and could have wished an alteration, but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e never had so
much as a thought against his Majesties person, beseeching to impute these things wherein
he had offended, to his youth and foolish ambition. <hi>Being enquired touching the letter
sent to the Queen of</hi> England, <hi>he confessed,</hi> That when he perceived her inclining to
take the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> life, he advised her rather to take her away in some private way,
then to do it in form of Iustice; <hi>and acknowledged the words</hi> Mortui non mordent,
<hi>to be his, but not used by him to the sense they were detorted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His confession did liberate his accuser,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi> libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Master of <hi>Gray</hi> imprisoned.</note> who was presently set at liberty, and he
himself sent to the <hi>Tolbuith</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to attend his arraignment, which was
made a few days after. There, having repeated the same things in effect, he submitted
himself to the Kings mercy; who thereupon gave order to the Justice to banish him
the Realm, and in case he did return without licence to pronounce the sentence of
death. Mean while he was prohibited to go either into <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> under
the like pain. A punishment too mild, as many at that time judged, for crimes so
hateful and odious. But the innated clemency of the King, and his unwillingnesse
to use rigour towards them whom he had once favoured, did not suffer him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
the punishment which the offence had merited.</p>

                     <note place="margin">An. 1587.</note> These informations he sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
in a letter to the King by <hi>Henry Stewart</hi> of <hi>Craigihall.</hi> The King communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the same to the Councel, direction was given to charge him to enter his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
within the Palace of <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> and remain there till the truth of these delati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should be tried: certifying him that if he failed to obey, processe of forfeiture
should be laid against him, as a sower of discord betwixt the King and his Nobility.

                     </note> a Parliament was indicted to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 29. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> for a preparation thereto, and that the King might
find the better assistance, the Noblemen were sent for, they especially betwixt
whom there were known to be any quarrels. At their coming the King did presse
them with a submission of all controversies,<note place="margin">The Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men reconciled</note> and having obtained their consents,
made them all friends. Only <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Yester</hi> refusing to reconcile with <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaire,</hi>
was committed and sent to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he was detained
some moneths, till that variance was also composed. Such content the King concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of their agreement, that he did feast them all royally at <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi> thereafter
caused them walk in hands two and two in form of procession, from the Palace to
the Mercat Crosse of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where they sealed their concord by drinking
healths one to another, to the exceeding great joy of all the beholders.</p>
                  <p>A general Assembly was then also called by his Majesties Proclamation to the
20. of <hi>Iune,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Church.</note> where the King did purpose to have all matters setled betwixt him and
the Church;<note place="margin">The Kings propositions to the Assembly by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.</note> but this meeting had not the like successe. For the Chancellar, and
Justice Clerk being sent thither with certain Articles, of which two specials were to
desire satisfaction for the offences committed by <hi>Iames Gibson</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
Ministers; and that Mr. <hi>Robert Montgomery</hi> might be received without any ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
into their fellowship; answer was made, <hi>That if the Petitions of the Church
in the approaching Parliament should be granted, they would labour to bring matters to
such a middest, as might best agree with the honour of the Ministery, satisfy the offence of
the godly, and the conscience of their brethren, against whom his Majesty had taken offence.</hi>
And for Mr. <hi>Robert Montgomery, they should dispense with some ceremonies used in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
excommunicants, in case the King was willing to remit somewhat of the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
craved of the other two brethren.</hi> This answer did so displease the King, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to enter into any such capitulations, he left off all further treating with them
at that time.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Montgomery</hi> being redacted to great necessity,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Montgomery</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeth the Bishoprick of <hi>Glasgow</hi> to Mr. <hi>William Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin.</hi>
                     </note> and not knowing what course
to take (for the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> his agents having possessed themselves in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick,
he was no more acknowledged) did resign his title in favour of Mr. <hi>William
Areskin</hi> Parson of <hi>Campsie,</hi> a friend and follower of the Earl of <hi>Marre.</hi> This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
being well beloved of the Ministery, and otherwise of good parts, obtained
the consent of the Presbytery of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and was admitted thereto by them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was a Laick and bare no charge in the Church. They being called to an
accompt of this their doing in the next Assembly, excused themselves, saying,
<hi>That since Churchmen were not permitted to enjoy the Bishoprick, they esteemed it better
he should in title of it then any other, and that he had given his bonds to renounce the
same, in case the general Assembly did not allow of his admission.</hi> The excuse for the time
was accepted, yet their doing was disallowed, and they ordained to pursue him upon
his bonds for disanulling the admission: but he found means to retain the same, till
Bishop <hi>Iames Beaton</hi> (who lived in <hi>France)</hi> was restored. <hi>Montgomery</hi> his resignation
being then made publick, he was shortly after, as informally absolved as he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
and placed at a Church in <hi>Cunningham,</hi> where he lived in a poor

                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:50008:195"/>
Abbot of <hi>Kinlosse,</hi> rising up and directing his speech to the King, made a long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the right they had to sit, and give voice for the Church in these meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
complaining, that the Ministers had most disorderly shut them forth of their
places in the Church, and now they thought to exclude them from their places
in the Estate, which they hoped his Majesty would not suffer, and would punish as a
presumptuous arrogancy, on the part of the Petitioners. Mr. <hi>Robert Pont</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some what bitterly, the King willed them to be quiet, and present their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
orderly to the Lords of the Articles, where they should be answered according to
reason. When it came to the Articles, this being in the front of their Petitions,
was simply rejected; some other Petitions were passed, as they had desired, for rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
all lawes made in the Kings minority in favours of the Church, for trying
and censuring the adversaries of true Religion, and for the punishment of such as
did menace or invade the Ministers of the Church.</p>
                  <p>It was in this Parliament,<note place="margin">The temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Benefices annexed to the Crown.</note> that the temporality of Benefices was annexed to the
Crown upon a pretext of bettering the Patrimony thereof, and that the King might
have means to bear forth the honour of his Estate, and not burthen his subjects
with taxations for his support. This was the publick pretext, and the King made
to believe that the reservation of the Prelates houses, and precincts, with the tithes
of the Churches annexed to their benefices, would suffice to maintain their dignity
and estate. But privately to such of the ministery as sought the subversion of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal
government, it was whispered, <hi>That this was the only way to undoe the Prelacy,
for there being no livings to maintain them</hi> (as in this case there would be little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
remaining, most of the Bishopricks being founded on temporal lands, and
having but Churches annexed) <hi>none would be found to accept those places:</hi> which also
proved true. Hopes besides were given to those Ministers, that they should have
the tithes to use, and dispone at their pleasure; yet was it not long, ere the King
did find himself abused, the temporalities formerly disponed, (which were not a
few) being all in the same Parliament confirmed and those that remained, in a short
time begged from him, and given away to the followers of Court, so as nothing was
left to benefit, or reward any well deserving servant. When as he saw this, and that
the spiritual Estate was by this mean utterly decayed,<note place="margin">The King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinketh the passing of the annexation.</note> the Priors and Abbots being all
turned temporal Lords, he did sore forthink the passing of the Act, calling it<note place="margin">

                     <hi>a vile
and pernicious Act,</hi> and recommending to the Prince his son, the annulling thereof.
The Ministers that lookt for restoring the tithes, perceiving themselves likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,
began also to exclaim, and condemn the course, howbeit somewhat too late.</p>
                  <p>In the same Parliament an Act was made in favour of the <hi>small Barons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The small Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons admitted to give voice in Parliament.</note> giving
them by their Commissioners a voice in Parliament, and Conventions with the
others Estates. The Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> did strongly oppose, and in name of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
protested against their receiving. That which the King intended by this, was
to free the Barons of their dependence upon Noblemen, and have the Estates more
particularly informed at their meeting of the abuses in the countrey. But so farre
was he from obtaining these ends, as to the contrary they did work him great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in all the ensuing Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the Estates dissolved,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> hath presence of the King.</note> the Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> Governour of <hi>Berwick,</hi> sent
to intreat presence of the King, who yeilded the more willingly, because he of all
the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> had medled least in the proceedings against his Mother.
The Nobleman proposing the same reasons in effect which <hi>Walsingham</hi> had used in
his letter to the Chancellour, and laying before the King the danger, wherein he
might bring the title and right of succession, (which otherwise was undoubted)
if he should enter into open warre with <hi>England;</hi> did earnestly beseech him, <q>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which was done could not be undone, to give place unto necessity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
(because it was still beaten into the Kings ears, that the execution of his
Mother did barre his succession) to bring unto him a Declaration under the
hands of all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> that the sentence given against his Mother,
was no hurt to his right, nor could work any prejudice to his succession.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This conference did break the King very much from his resolution,<note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> yet the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
of the countrey were great, and their desires so vehement for revenge, that he
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50008:196"/>
parted with <hi>Hunsdon</hi> in doubtful terms. But when the Declaration of the Judges,
which he had promised, was brought unto him, and therewith the sentence given
against <hi>Davison</hi> in the Starre Chamber, (whereby it appeared that the execution
was done without the Queens knowledge) he became more appeased, and suffered
Proclamations to go out, inhibiting all that dwelt in the Borders, to make incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon <hi>England</hi> as they were begun to do.</p>
                  <p>About the same time did <hi>Patrick Vaus</hi> of <hi>Barnbarrough,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors sent into <hi>Denmark,</hi> return.</note> and Mr. <hi>Peter Young</hi> his

making report of their agreement: whereupon conclusion was taken, that in

and bring home the young Queen. But the death of King <hi>Frederick</hi> her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                  <p>In the end of the year there came from beyond Sea divers Jesuits and Priests,<note place="margin">A Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits and Priests.</note>
to deal with the Catholick Noblemen for assisting the <hi>Spanish Armada,</hi> which was

their hope was to find the King favourable, because of the Queens proceedings
against his Mother, and that he should joyn his forces with the <hi>Spanish,</hi> for revenge
of that wrong. But he considering his own danger, if strangers should set foot in
the Isle, and not trusting that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would take the pains to conquer for him
the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> (for that also was proffered) refused to give ear unto such
motions. Mr. <hi>Iames Gordon</hi> Jesuit, and Uncle to the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> had been all
the summer before in the countrey, and was overseen because of his Nephew, whom
the King intended to match with the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> his eldest sister; neither was
he much feared, as being a simple man, and not deeply learned; Mr. <hi>Edmond Hay</hi>
brother to <hi>Peter Hay</hi> of <hi>Megnish,</hi> a Jesuit also, but of greater account, and more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
and wise, did thereafter arrive, pretending that he came to take his farewel
of his friends, and after him came divers others, which made the King give out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
against the resetters, and for apprehending their persons.</p>
                  <p>In this Proclamation,<note place="margin">The Jesuits find caution to depart.</note> besides Mr. <hi>Iames Gordon</hi> and the said Mr. <hi>Edmond Hay,</hi>

Mr. <hi>Iohn Morton;</hi> most of these upon their supplications and sureties given to
depart in the first ships, obtained a protection unto the last of <hi>Ianuary:</hi> which did
so offend the Ministers,<note place="margin">A general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Church.</note> as they did call a number of Noblemen, Barons, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of Burghs, to meet at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the sixth of <hi>February,</hi> for advising upon
some remedy against the present dangers. The meeting was frequent, and Mr.
<hi>Robert Bruce</hi> by the suffrages of all chosen to preside. He had preached ordinarily
at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> a year or somewhat more, and was in great respect with all sorts of
people, but had not entered as yet unto the ministerial function.</p>
                  <p>Certain assessors chosen according to the custome,<note place="margin">A Proposition made for the dangers threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> the first thing proposed, was
touching the dangers threatened to Religion, and the readiest means for quenching
the fire of Papistry kindled through the whole countrey, which they were all great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exhorted to take to heart, and to consider what course was best, to obviate
these dangers. And to the end things might be done advisedly, the Noblemen
were advised to meet apart, the Barons and Commissioners of Burghes likewise
apart, to set down their advice in writing, and present the same to the whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
the next Session.</p>
                  <p>The day following all being convened,<note place="margin">The advice of the Noblemen and Barons.</note> the advice of the Noblemen and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
was presented, containing three heads. <q>1. That the laws of the countrey
should be prosecuted against Jesuits, Seminary Priests, Idolaters, and the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
thereof. And for the more speedy effectuating of the same, that the
names of all such should be enrolled, and delivered to the Thesaurer, with the
names of their resetters, and entertainers, to the end citations might be directed
against them. 2. That in regard of the danger so imminent, his Majesty and
Councel should be earnesty solicited to proceed in execution of the laws against
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50008:196"/>
the principal Jesuits, and their maintainers without delay. 3. That the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Barons, Ministers, and whole Assembly should go together to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
and regrate the peril whereunto the Church and Kingdom was brought by
the practises of Jesuits, making offer of their lives, lands, and friendship to be
imployed at his Majesties direction for preventing their wicked devices.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This advice being approved,<note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth accesse to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> command was given to meet at two of the clock
in the afternoon, that all might go together from the place of the Assembly to
the Palace of <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi> where the King then remained. When this was told to
the King, and that they were to present themselves in such numbers, he grew into
choler, and said, <hi>They meant to boast him with their power, and force the execution of
their demands.</hi> Therefore refusing accesse to the multitude, some few of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals
only were called, to whom he uttered his dislike of those irreverent and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary
forms. Yet because he did acknowledge their complaint to be just, and
that there was need of a remedy to the evils complained of, he promised to appoint
six of the Councel to meet with such as the Assembly should design, for advising
upon the best remedies.</p>
                  <p>This reported to the Assembly,<note place="margin">A conference betwixt certain of the Councel and the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> they did nominate the Lords of <hi>Wedderburn,
Colluthie, Caprinton, Ormston,</hi> and <hi>Whittingham, Iohn Iohnston</hi> Commissioner for
<hi>Edinburgh, Oliver Peblis</hi> for <hi>Perth,</hi> and <hi>William Menzeis</hi> for <hi>Aberdene:</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert
Pont, David Lindesay, Andrew Melvil,</hi> and <hi>Peter Blackburn</hi> to attend. These con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
the next day, with the Chancellor and some others of the Councel, did
urge in name of the Church, <hi>That Mr.</hi> James Gordon, <hi>and Mr.</hi> William Crichton
<hi>Iesuits, who were known to be in Town, should be apprehended; and that the resetters of
Iesuits and Priests, none excepted, whether they were Noblemen, or others of an inferiour
degree, should be punished according to the lawes.</hi> For the <hi>Noblemen,</hi> the Chancellor
answered, that the King did mean to use them more calmly, and as he had begun
with the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> (of whose conversion there were good hopes) so he would
proceed with others of that degree. For the <hi>two Iesuits,</hi> it was promised, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
should be taken for their dispatch forth of the countrey.</p>
                  <p>The Assembly no ways pleased with the report of this conference,<note place="margin">The grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the King.</note> resolved to
present their griefes to his Majesty in writing, and insist for a more direct answer
to their desires, as they did, exhibiting therewith the names of Jesuits, Priests, and
their resetters, such as had been delated to the Assembly. Among others they
complained of the Lord <hi>Hereis,</hi> and the disorders committed by him at <hi>Dumfreis,</hi>
where he had openly erected Masse, and forced the Ministers to leave the Town.
The King having considered the griefs, made answer, <hi>That albeit they had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from him to assemble at that time, yet (as he had signified before to the Noblemen that
were sent unto him) he was glad to hear that they were convened in so frequent a number,
the businesse being of such importance, and that he should do what became him as a King to
do, neither should any of those that he found unreclameable, have credit or countenance of
him.</hi> For the Lord <hi>Hereis,</hi> he said, <hi>that he was more offended with him, then any of
themselves, and had resolved to take journey in the beginning of</hi> March <hi>unto</hi> Dumfreis,
<hi>for punishing that and all other insolencies committed by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This answer reported by the Chancellor,<note place="margin">The Minister <hi>Iames Gibson</hi> censured for his speeches against the King.</note> gave some content, thereafter as he
was directed, he shewed the Assembly that the King did expect a reparation of the
offence committed by the Minister <hi>Iames Gibson,</hi> for he had obtained his liberty,
upon promise that he should give satisfaction at the Churches sight. Hereupon the
Minister was called, who acknowledged his offence, and was enjoyned the next
Sermon day to preach, and publickly acknowledge the speeches complained of, to
have been unadvised and rashly uttered. This he promised to do, yet when he came to
the place, he made no mention at all of that businesse; and being immediately char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for not doing that he had promised, he answered, <hi>That out of infirmity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
he had confessed a fault, albeit his conscience did tell him, he had not spoken any
thing that might give just offence.</hi> The Chancellor perceiving the mans inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and that he had been diverted by some ill disposed persons, required the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Assembly, <hi>Whether or not they did esteem it an offence, to call the King a
persecutor of the Church, and to affirm in pulpit, that he should be the last of that race.</hi>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:50008:197"/>
The question was a while declined,<note place="margin">An. 1588.</note> yet in end being put to voices, it was found,
that the speeches were slanderous and offensive, and that he ought therefore to be
censured.</p>
                  <p>It being then 12. of the clock, the defining of the censure was continued to the
afternoon, and the Minister warned to attend. The hour come, and he not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the businesse was greater then before; some alleadging that citation must be
used, ere any censure was inflicted, others excused his absence upon just fear, being
pursued by so great personages. Hereto it was replied, <hi>That there was no fear of
any indirect or violent course to be taken; the King, who by his own authority might have
punished him, having for the regard he carried to the Church, choosed to complain to the
Assembly, and remit the offender to be censured by themselves.</hi> Next for the citation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
it was answered, <hi>That the warning given him in the face of the Assembly was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gibson</hi> suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from his ministery.</note>
                     <hi>and that by his not appearing, he had added contumay to his offence.</hi> These answers
being held sufficient, and the voices askt touching his censure; by the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
he was ordained to be suspended from the ministery, during the pleasure of
the Assembly. Yet this did not end the businesse; for in <hi>August</hi> thereafter, another
Assembly being convened, the Minister appearing declared, <hi>That the reason why
he withdrew himself in the former Assembly, was not any contempt or stubbornness on his
part, but the care he had of the Churches peace, the affairs whereof, as he was informed,
had been cast off if he had compeired, and not been punished.</hi> Upon this Declaration,
without once acquainting the King, he was purged of contumacy, and thereby a
way made to his reponing. The King, as he had reason, being greatly offended
with these proceedings, and intending to right himself otherwise, the Minister fled
to <hi>England,</hi> and remained there a long space, entertained by the factious brethren
in those parts, who were labouring at that time to bring in the <hi>holy discipline,</hi> as they
termed it, into that Church.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Hereis</hi> in the mean time being certified of the Kings intended expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
into the West Marches,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reis</hi> cleared of the accusation made against him.</note> prevented him and came to Court, offering himself
to trial; nothing being found but certain neglects in the administration of his office
(for the complaint of erecting Masse at <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> and compelling the Minister to
leave the Town, was not verified.) Upon promise to amend, and surety given that
he should resort to Sermons, and suffer nothing to be done within his Wardenry
to the prejudice of Religion, he was sent back to his charge.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the Lord <hi>Maxwel,</hi> who had been licenced to go abroad, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
some moneths in <hi>Spain;</hi> having seen the preparation made for invading of
<hi>England,</hi> by the advice of some <hi>Scottish</hi> Catholicks, returned into the countrey
(notwithstanding the assurance he had given not to return without licence) taking
land at <hi>Kirkudbright</hi> (a part of <hi>Galloway</hi>) about the end of <hi>April.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Borders begin to stirre upon the Lord <hi>Maxwels</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</note> It was then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that the Navy should take their course to the West parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> where
they might land more safely, and with the assistance of <hi>Maxwel</hi> and others that
would joyn with them, enter into <hi>England</hi> by the Borders; which if they had done,
would doubtlesse have been more to their advantage, but they took their counsels,
as we shall hear.</p>
                  <p>Upon <hi>Maxwels</hi> return number of broken men,<note place="margin">The Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to <hi>Dumfreis.</hi>
                     </note> and countrey people resorted
unto him, conjecturing there was somewhat in hand which would give them work.
The Lord <hi>Hereis</hi> not able to command them, and fearing if any disorder arose, the
same should be imputed to him, came and shewed the King what appearance there
was of trouble. Charges were incontinent directed for <hi>Maxwels</hi> appearing before
the Councel, but he disobeyed, and fortifying his houses, and other strengths that
he had in custody, began to levie some companies of foot and horse: which being
told to the King, he with such forces as he could have of a sudden, took journey to
<hi>Dumfries,</hi> and came upon him so unexpected, as he had almost surprised hin in his
house at <hi>Dumfries.</hi> But upon warning given him, an hour before the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he escaped and went to <hi>Galloway.</hi> Some little resistance was made at the Port,
which gave him leisure to escape, and was excused by the Towns ignorance of the
King his being there in person.</p>
                  <p>The next narrow which was the 28 of <hi>May,</hi> the houses of <hi>Lochmaben, Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:50008:197"/>
Treve,</hi> and <hi>Carlaverok,</hi> were summoned to render; all which obeyed, the
Castle of <hi>Lochmaben</hi> excepted. This was kept by one Mr. <hi>David Maxwell,</hi> who
trusting foolishly to the strength,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lochmaben</hi> rendred, and the Keeper exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</note> refused to yeild, though the King himself going
thither, did call him by name (for he knew the man) commanding him to render.
Upon his disobedience the house was inclosed; and because there was no munition
at hand whereby to batter it, a Post was directed to borrow some Ordinance from
the <hi>English</hi> Warden, which was quickly conveighed thither, and a company of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
sent to guard the same. These began no sooner to play, then the Keepers ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with the noyse, craved a parley. Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi> brother to Captain <hi>Iames,</hi>
being imployed to conferre with them they yeilded, upon promise as was said, that
their lives should be spared. But the Captain, because he had refused the King
himself at first, was hanged, the rest were pardoned, and suffered to depart.</p>
                  <p>The King returning the same night to <hi>Dumfreis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Maxwel</hi> taken prisoner at sea by Sir <hi>William Stewart,</hi> and brought priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                     </note> directed Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi> to
try what course <hi>Maxwell</hi> had taken, and to do as he found occasion: having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he had taken sea in a small Bark, he followed in a ship rigged forth by the
town of <hi>Aire,</hi> and overtaking him some miles off, brought him back and delivered
him prisoner to the King, who was then returned to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> It was no small
peece of service, and by all men so esteemed. But the countenance the King gave
him,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi> killed by <hi>Bothwel Penult. Iulii.</hi>
                     </note> made the man so swell, as falling in a contest for I know not what matter,
with the Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> he used some uncivil speeches to the Nobleman, who
meeting him a few days after in the high street of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> did in a suddain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
kill him outright.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The newes of the</hi> Spanish <hi>Navy being then divulged,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A meeting of the Estates up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rumour of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Navy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>August.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and the King advertised
of their setting forth; he called the Estates to a meeting at</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>and impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them the advertisements he had received, did ask their advice how he should
carry himselfe in that businesse.</hi> For howbeit, <hi>said he,</hi> I have no great occasion for
my self to fear, being under league and friendship with all Christian Princes and Estates,
yet the case of <hi>England</hi> ere it be long may turn to be our own,<note place="margin">His Majesties speech to the Estates.</note> and we forced to share with
them in their troubles. The intention of <hi>Spain,</hi> I know, is against <hi>England;</hi> and considering
the right I have to that Crown after the Queens death that now reignes, I see not how it
shall be safe for me, to let another possess himself of that Kingdom; nor will any man make
me to think, that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> if he shall chance to prevail, will part with it, and
give place to my right, having once made conquest thereof. As now whilest the event is
doubtful, they speak fair and make liberal promises; but if matters succeed to their mindes,
we shall hear other words. They take Religion for a pretext of their invasion, but it is the
kingdom they seek: and granting that Religion were the true cause, are not we our selves
in the same case with <hi>England?</hi> The prosecution of the holy league, will strike no lesse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, then them. But for my self, I have ever thought mine own safety, and the safety
of Religion to be so conjoyned, as they cannot well be separated; neither desire I to live, to
reign any longer then I may serve to maintain the same. I am not ignorant what the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of many is, and that they think I have now a fair occasion to revenge the wrong and
unkindness I received by the death of my mother. But whatsoever I think of the excuses
which the Queen hath made to me, I will not be so foolish, as to take the help of one that is
mightier then my self; nor will I give such liberty to mine own passions, as therefore to
neglect Religion, and cast in hazard both this Kingdom, and those others that belong to me
after her death. By this you see what my mind is, and the reasons that lead me to it. I
I have called you that I may have your counsel and assistance at this time, and therefore
desire to hear of you, what is the best both for you and me to do.</p>
                  <p>This speech was seconded by the Chancellor,<note place="margin">The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor his speech seconding the King.</note> who did out of his reading adduce
divers Histories, to make good what the King had said, <q>That it was no way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to side with <hi>Spain</hi> in that invasion, or suffer him to possesse himself of
<hi>England:</hi> yet since the Queen had not required any aid from him, his opinion
was, that he should strive to assure his own Kingdom, and not to permit them to
take land in his bounds; That a general muster should be taken in the whole
Realm, and some Noblemen named, unto whom upon occasion, the subjects
might resort, watches appointed at all the Sea-ports, and Beacons erected in the
highest places, for advertising the countrey if any fleet was seen at Sea, and that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:50008:198"/>
the King and Councel should stay at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to attend the successe of things,

therein was so forward, that upon his own charges he had levied souldiers to serve
under him, if the resolution which he expected should have been taken. But the
King willing him to look unto the Sea, (for he was Admiral by his office) and to
take care that the ships within the countrey were ready for service, he acquiesced.</p>
                  <p>A little after the Convention dissolved,<note place="margin">Colonel <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> his arrive at <hi>Leth.</hi>
                     </note> Colonel <hi>Semple,</hi> who had betrayed the
town of <hi>Lire</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> some six years before, and remained for the most part
with the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> arrived at <hi>Leth,</hi> pretending a Commission
from that Prince to the King. But the matters he proponed were of so small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
as the King apprehending the Commission to have been given him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a colour of his practises, with some ill disposed subjects, then for the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
pretended; commanded Sir <hi>Iohn Carmichael</hi> Captain of the Guard, to have
an eye upon him unto his return, (for he was then going to <hi>Falkland</hi>) and if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
any letters brought unto him in the mean time, to take and present them to
the Councel, <hi>Carmichael</hi> getting notice that a Pinnace was arrived in the <hi>Firth,</hi> and
a passenger landed, went straight to the Colonels lodging in <hi>Leth,</hi> and finding him
unsealing the letters,<note place="margin">The Colonel apprehended, and relieved by the Earl of <hi>Huntley.</hi>
                     </note> shewed what he had in charge, and what it concerned him to
present the same to the Lords. The Colonel offering to go himself to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> who did then reside in a lodging near the Palace of <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudhouse,</hi>
with his young Lady whom he had married a few days before,<note n="*" place="margin">21. Iuly.</note> upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of his apprehension did meet <hi>Carmichael</hi> in the way, and forced him to quit his
prisoner, saying, that he would enter him to the Councel. Advertisement go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this to the Chancellour, who was then at the Evening service in S. <hi>Giles</hi> (for
it was a time of publick humiliation) he came forth, and being followed by a great
number of people, made towards <hi>Huntley,</hi> and had certainly taken back the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,
if the King who was then come from <hi>Falkland,</hi> had not happened to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him as he went down the street, with whom he returned to the lodging within
the City, where at that time, and most of the Winter, the King did keep his
residence.</p>
                  <p>There the Chancellor declared what had fallen out,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Huntley</hi> offers to present the Colonel to the Councel.</note> and whither he was going,
intreating his Majesty to take some order with the insolency committed. <hi>Huntley</hi>
being called, after some frivolous excuse, did promise to present the Colonel the
next morning, but he escaping the same night, was not any more seen. The King did
highly offend at his escape, yet was loth to use the Nobleman with rigour, having
matched him so lately to his Cousen; only he discharged him to come in his presence,
neither was he admitted unto it till the newes were brought of the dissipation of the
Navy; and then as in a time of publick joy, that fault was overseen and pardoned.</p>
                  <p>The Queen of <hi>England</hi> in the mean time hearing what course the King had

and to make offer of her assistance, if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> should make offer to land
in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The King received him graciously, and as he was discoursing of
the ambition of <hi>Spain,</hi> and his purpose to take in <hi>England,</hi> said, that the King
needed not to expect any greater kindnesse at his hand, if he prevailed. The
King merrily answered, <hi>That he lookt for no other benefit of the</hi> Spaniard <hi>in that case,
then that which</hi> Polyphemus <hi>promised to</hi> Ulysses; <hi>namely, to devour him after all his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
were devoured.</hi> Neither did <hi>Sidney</hi> sooner return, then a fresh advertisement

as nothing can be added. Yet because the benefit redounded to this Church

part in our Northern Isles, we shall touch it a little. The Navy consisted of 134.
saile, a great part whereof were <hi>Galleasses,</hi> and rather like Castles pitched in the

besides the Commanders, and voluntary adventurers, who were reckoned 124.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:50008:198"/>
and for provision they had abundance of whatsoever was necessary, either at sea or
at land. Their direction was to joyn with the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and his forces, who
were appointed to meet them in the narrow Seas, and to invade <hi>England</hi> together.
But whether the Prince had not time sufficient to prepare himself, or that he was
kept in by the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, he came not as was expected. At <hi>Plimmouth</hi> the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
had the first sight of the Navy, and kept combat with them till they anchored
in the road of <hi>Callais.</hi> Before they came thither, they lost the Gallion wherein <hi>Don
Pedro de Valder,</hi> and divers other Noblemen were, which was taken in fight and
sent to <hi>Plimmouth.</hi> And the Gallion commanded by <hi>Don Michael de Oquendo,</hi> took
fire, and therein many were burnt to death, yet the nether part of the ship, being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
was likewise sent thither. The Galliasse of <hi>Naples</hi> commanded by <hi>Don Hugo de
Moncada</hi> perished in the sands of <hi>Callais;</hi> where whilest they lay at Anchor, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Drake</hi> by a stratagem put them in great confusion;<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Drakes</hi> stratagem.</note> for choosing out eight
small ships that were least useful, he filled them with pitch, brimstone, gunpowder,
and the like combustible matter, and charged the Ordinance with bullets, stones,
broken iron, and chaines. The ships driven with the wind and tide into the midst
of the Navy, and the traines taking fire, put the <hi>Spanish</hi> in such fear, (the same fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out in the night season) as having no leisure to weigh their Anchors, they were
forced to cut their Cables, and make to the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The next morning ranging themselves again in order, they approached to
<hi>Graveling;</hi> but no supply coming from <hi>Parma,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> ships hotly pursuing
them, they were compelled to passeby. In this conflict perished the Gallion of <hi>Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kay,</hi>
and two other great ships. Two Gallions of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the one called S. <hi>Philip,</hi>
the other S. <hi>Matthew</hi> having lost their tackling, and being torn with shot, made
towards the coast of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and were taken by the <hi>Zelanders.</hi> Once as it seemed,
the General with the rest of the Navy, bent their course towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> but not
knowing what favour they should find there, and the wind blowing fair, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to make home by the North Isles. The General himself with the best provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vessels,<note place="margin">The Navy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </note> took the main Ocean towards <hi>Biscay;</hi> and arrived safely in <hi>Spain.</hi> The rest
seeking to take in fresh water, partly in the Isles, and partly in <hi>Ireland,</hi> were so tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with tempests and contrary winds, that 40. and above were cast away in those
Seas. A ship of <hi>Florence</hi> driven upon the West coast of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was spoiled and
set on fire by certain Highlanders. Shortly, the destruction was so great, as of the
134. Ships, that set fail from <hi>Lisbone,</hi> 53. onely returned to <hi>Spain;</hi> of the souldiers,
besides the mariners, 13500. were lost by one way or other. And as they write,
not a family in <hi>Spain</hi> of any note there was, which suffered not in this expedition,
having lost either a son or a brother, or some nigh kinsman. Such was the successe
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Navy, which had been four years in preparing with no small cost,
and in a few days was thus overthrown; one <hi>English</hi> ship onely being lost, and
about 100. men in all. The King caused solemn thanksgiving for this deliverance
to be given to God in all Churches of the Kingdome, beginning in his own Court
for an ensample to others.</p>
                  <p>This was <hi>the marvellous year,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The death of <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus.</hi>
                     </note> talked of so long before by the Astrologues, which
this defeat, and the accidents that fell forth in <hi>France</hi> about the end of the same
year, did in a part make good. In this kingdom (which we ought ever to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
with thankfulnesse to Almighty God) happened no dysaster, for which we had
cause to be grieved, the death of <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> excepted, who deceased
in the moneth of <hi>Iuly:</hi> a Nobleman as in place and rank, so in worth and virtue
above other subjects; of a comely personage, affable and full of grace, a lover of
Justice, peaceable, sober, and given to all goodnesse, and which crowned all his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
truly pious. A long time he lived in exile in <hi>England,</hi> not through his own fault,
but the misfortune of his friends, whom he could not forsake. After he was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Kings favour, no man did carry himself in better sort, and in that time
which was full of factions, he kept himself free of all partakings; being imployed in
the Lieftenandry of the Borders, he discharged himself to his Majesties great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and to the liking of all the subjects; and not long after, fell into that disease,
whereof he died, leaving no heir male, and one only daughter by his second marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:50008:199"/>
who did not long survive him.<note place="margin">An. 1589.</note> Never died any Nobleman with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
regrate, and so much the more was his death lamented, that as it was then
thought, and afterwards confessed, that he was taken away by forcery and incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the time of his sicknesse,<note place="margin">His disposition in his sickness.</note> when the Physicians found his disease not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
of any natural cause, one <hi>Richard Graham,</hi> who was executed some years after
for witchcraft, being brought to give his opinion of it, made offer to cure him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as the manner of these Wizards is, that he had received wrong. But when he
heard that the man was suspected to use unlawful arts, he would by no means admit
him, saying, <hi>That his life was not so dear unto him, as for the continuance of it some years
he would be beholden to any of the Devils instruments; That he held his life of God, and was
willing to render the same at his good pleasure, knowing he should change it for a better.</hi>
Thus after a long and languishing disease, he died in <hi>Smeton</hi> near to <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and was
buried in <hi>Abernethy,</hi> in the sepulchre of his progenitors. The houses of <hi>Angus,</hi> and
<hi>Morton,</hi> which within his person were conjoyned, went by provision of Taile to the
Lairds of <hi>Glenbervy</hi> and <hi>Lochlevin.</hi>

they had lost heart quite, but that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> did of new encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them by his letters, shewing that the losse was nothing so great as it was given
out to be, and giving them hopes of another Army that set out more timely, and to
be with them the next spring. These letters were sent by one Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> and
delivered to <hi>Huntley,</hi> to be communicated with the rest of that faction. Shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
came one <hi>Iohn Chesholme,</hi> bringing with him ten thousand Crowns, which were
delivered to <hi>Bruce,</hi> to be used as he thought most fit, for advancing the cause. The
Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> made instance to have the third part of the summe; Lord <hi>Claud
Hamilton</hi> pleaded for as much, and <hi>Maxwel</hi> lying then in prison, held no lesse to be
due to him. But <hi>Bruce</hi> excused himself by the charge he had to dispone the mony by
the advice of <hi>David Graham</hi> of <hi>Fintrey,</hi> who was warded at the same time in <hi>Dundey,</hi>
and payed them all with one answer. The Lord <hi>Claud</hi> more covetous then the rest,

<hi>Maxwel</hi> had some sent him, for his consolation in the prison: But <hi>Huntley,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at the Kings desire subscrived the confession of faith, and reconciled himself to
the Church, was wholly neglected.</p>
                  <p>This he excused afterwards by a letter to the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> professing,
<q>That after the escape of Colonel <hi>Semple,</hi> he found himself so busied on all hands,
and in such sort pressed by the King, as it behoved him either to yeild, or depart
out of the countrey,<note place="margin">

all hope of help being taken from him by the return of the Navy of <hi>Spain,</hi> but in
what he had failed he should endevour to amend, by some good service tending
to the advancement of the cause of God, who had put him, <hi>he said,</hi> in such credit
with the King, as he had broken his former guards, and made him establish others
about his person, by whom at all occasions he might assure himself, and be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the King, and so when the support promised should arrive, spoile the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
of his authority, and make sure the Catholicks enterprises. Therefore
besought him to be perswaded of his unchangeable affection, albeit in outward
action he was forced to accommodate himself to the necessity of the time.</q> This
letter was dated at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 24. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1589.</p>
                  <p>Another of the same date was sent by the Earl of <hi>Arrol</hi> (whom Mr. <hi>Edmond Hay</hi>
the Jesuit had seduced and brought on that course) to <hi>Parma,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A letter from the Earl of <hi>Arroll</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Parma.</hi>
                     </note> bearing, <q>That
since his conversion to the Catholick faith he did ever think himself obliged to
procure the advancement of the Catholick Kings enterprises, tending prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to that end, and to another civil cause, which had great affinity and
conjunction with things at home, in regard whereof he said, that ever before
his conversion, he had been in his affection one of his friends, and servitours; and
that Religion, which was the greatest, and most important cause of the world,
being now joyned to the other, he was become altogether his. This he did intreat
his Highness to signify to his Catholick Majesty, and to assure him that in <hi>Scotland</hi>
he had not a more affectionate servant then himself.</q> The like he did professe to
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:50008:199"/>
the Prince, remitting his intentions to be more fully declared by him, that should
deliver the letters.</p>
                  <p>There went other Letters at the same time from the Earls of <hi>Huntley,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Letters sent to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> from the Catholick Lords.</note> 
                     <hi>Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and <hi>Morton</hi> (so did the Lord <hi>Maxwel</hi> style himself) to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
wherein after they had expressed their great regrate for the disappointment of his
preparations, they said, <q>That if his Naval Army had visited them, the same
should have found no resistance in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and with the support they would
have made given enough to do to <hi>England,</hi> but that it seemed the <hi>English</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
who had their refuge in <hi>Spain,</hi> out of an unchristian enmity did extenuate
the means of the <hi>Scottish</hi> aid, to magnify their own, and to have it thought that
they were able to do all by themselves; Therefore they prayed his Majesty to
make such account of the one, as he neglected not the other, and to serve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with them both, to the ends he did aim at.</q> Then remitting to the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some of his own subjects who had been in those parts, the commodity and
advantage of landing an Army in <hi>Scotland;</hi> they said, <q>That having 6000. men
of his own countrey, with money to levie as many more, they might within six
houres of their arrivall be well advanced in <hi>England</hi> to assist the forces that he
should send thither, and that the expence bestowed upon ane Galliass, would profit
more being so imployed, then many of them put to Sea could do. Withall,
they advised him not to make any more Armies by Sea, but to send a part of his
forces to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and another by the back of <hi>Ireland</hi> toward <hi>England,</hi> and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the <hi>English</hi> forces, which should be partly attending at Sea, partly employed
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they should believe all their forces to be landed. A further
Declaration hereof they remitted to Colonel <hi>Semple,</hi> and so praying God
to give him a full accomplishment of all his holy enterprises, they took their
leave.</q>

                  <p>Neither were the Jesuits that lurked in the countrey in this mean time idle;<note place="margin">The Jesuits stirre up the Lords to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> of
these the principals were, Mr. <hi>Edmond Hay,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Creichton,</hi> who had been
prisoners some few moneths in the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> They advising the Popish
Lords to attempt somewhat by themselvus, which would make the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
more earnest to give succourse; a plot was laid to take the King out of the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
and Thesaurers hand, by whose counsel they thought he was only ruled, and
that the pretence should be the neglect of the Nobility, and the ill managing of
publick affairs.<note place="margin">A plot for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the King.</note> This way they hoped to procure the assistance of other Noblemen
that were discontented, and that no mention being made of Religion, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
would be more cold in resisting their enterprise. The time and place of
meeting being condescended on, <hi>Fintrie</hi> undertook to bring the Earle of
<hi>Montrosse</hi> to the party, and of <hi>Bothwell</hi> they held themselves assured, as well
for the malice he professed to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> as because in a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with <hi>Bruce</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agent, he had promised if he should assure him of
the two Abbeys of <hi>Coldingham</hi> and <hi>Kelso,</hi> which he possessed, he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
turn to their side.</p>
                  <p>To bring about this their purpose,<note place="margin">A practise against the Chancellor.</note> the device was, that they should meet all at the
quarrel holes betwixt <hi>Leth</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and go from thence to <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi> and
settle themselves about the King, secluding those two Counsellors, or if they found
them with the King, that they should presently kill them. But this device was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
by the Kings remaining in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who suspecting some plots against
the Chancellor, did for his security stay in the same lodging with him. <hi>Bothwel</hi>
abode at that time in his house at <hi>Creichton,</hi> and kept about him the souldiers that
he had conduced, pretending a journey to the Isles, and the collecting of the Kings
duties in those parts. <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Arrol</hi> came with their friendship to the North
Ferry. <hi>Montross</hi> saigned a visit of his Cousen Mr. <hi>Iohn Graham</hi> at <hi>Halyards,</hi> some six
miles from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and upon advertisement that the King did keep lodging
within the Town, advanced no further. But <hi>Huntley</hi> who resided then with his
Lady at <hi>Dunfermlin,</hi> presuming much of the Kings affection, held on his way, and in
the evening on which they had appointed to meet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Huntley</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the King.</note> came unexpected to the Kings
lodging, where he found him in conference with the Chancellor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="374" facs="tcp:50008:200"/>
The King seeing him brack of his purpose, askt whence he came, and how he
fell to be so late, and from that falling into another discourse, the Chancellor stept
aside to the window. <hi>Huntley</hi> had brought with him the Laird of <hi>Kinfawns,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> and some of <hi>Arrols</hi> men, that were esteemed of best
courage and action. These filling the presence, and looking as men that had some
purpose in hand; the Chancellors friends began to suspect the worst, whereupon
the Laird of <hi>Ormeston, Carmichael,</hi> and the Provost of <hi>Linclowden</hi> drew nigh and
stood by him, after the King had talked a while with the Earl, he retired to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet,
and staying somewhat longer then was expected, the Chancellor asking the
Usher if it was time of supper, &amp; he answering, that it was more then time; then said
he, Let us go: and with those three that kept fast by him, passed forth of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and through the company that stood in the presence (all of them making way) to
his own lodgings, which were just above the Kings rooms. How soon he came there,
he sent one to shew the King, how unseemly it was to fill the presence with such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and men armed as they were, saying, that he would not have permitted the
same, if he had been alone in the lodging, nor have cast himself in such danger.</p>
                  <p>Presently the roomes were ushed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Huntley</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Castle of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                     </note> and the Earl with his company went forth.
The next morning the King sent for him, and at his coming began to examine
wherefore he came to Town, and why in that manner: his answers not satisfying, he
was committed in the Castle. By advertisement given the same day of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that were with <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Arroll</hi> at the North Ferry, and there dissolving, the
whole purpose was discovered, whereupon the Earls of <hi>Arroll</hi> and <hi>Bothwel</hi> were ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to appear before the Councel, and for their disobedience denounced Rebels.
<hi>Montrosse</hi> and <hi>Crawford</hi> were not called, having excused themselves as it was said,
and promised to meddle no more in that businesse. <hi>Huntley</hi> upon the like promise,
after a few dayes obtained his liberty,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Huntley</hi> set at liberty.</note> and went into the North. In his going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whether of purpose or by accident, it is uncertain; the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> did
meet him at <hi>Perth,</hi> where at first they concluded to fortifie the town as a place most
convenient for drawing forces together from all quarters; but doubting how they
should make good the enterprise, they gave it over, and getting intelligence that
the Thesaurer was come to <hi>Angus,</hi> and had appointed a meeting of some friends at
the Church of <hi>Megle;</hi> they belayed the wayes, and gave him the Chase unto the
house of <hi>Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fire was cast to the house, and he forced to yield himself, as he did, to his Cousen
the Laird of <hi>Achindown</hi> who kept him some weeks prisoner in the North.</p>
                  <p>The Letters written to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A letter from the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to the King.</note> and Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> whereof we
made mention, and some others from Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> directed to the same Prince being
about this time intercepted, laid open all the practises of these Noblemen; which
being reported to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> she wrote to the King a sharp letter,
wherein complaining of his remisnesse in punishing these treacheries, &amp; of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
he gave to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that had fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> after their wrack in the
Irish Seas; she besought him not to overslip such happy occasions, as it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> had pleased
God to offer him by revealing these practises; as likewise to rid the Realm of those
strangers, and send them away with speed. Hereupon order was taken for their
dispatch, and ships conduced to transport them unto <hi>West-Flanders.</hi> The <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
advertised of their coming, sent forth some ships to intercept them, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them some two miles from the coast of <hi>Flanders,</hi> took one of the vessels and put
to the sword all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were therein, the rest ran their vessels on ground,
where a number seeking to save themselves by swimming, were pitifully drowned.</p>
                  <p>A Proclamation was likewise renewed against the Jesuits,<note place="margin">The Lords make open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</note> and their ressetters, and
Mr. <hi>Edmond Hay,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Creichton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> and <hi>David Graham</hi> of <hi>Fentry,</hi>
commanded under pain of death to depart the Realm. But they contemning the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
did stir up the Earls of <hi>Huntley, Crawford,</hi> and <hi>Arrol,</hi> to make open insurrection.
These three taking Arms, and assembling all the forces they could gather, came to
<hi>Aberdene</hi> in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> where they made Proclamations in the Kings
name, <q>Declaring that he was held captive, &amp; forced against his mind to use his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
more rigorously then he desired, requiring all the Lieges to concurre and assist
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:50008:200"/>
them for setting his person at liberty.</q> Their hopes were that <hi>Bothwel</hi> with his
friendship in the South, should make the King such businesse, as they needed not
to fear any suddain pursuit; but the King having caused denounce <hi>Bothwel</hi> and the
chief of his followers Rebels, resolved to begin with them, and leave him to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.<note place="margin">The Subjects warned to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the King.</note>
So charges being directed to warn all the subjects remaining on the South of
<hi>Aberdene</hi> to accompany the King, and they gathering somewhat slowly, he made
forward with those he had in his company toward the middle of <hi>April,</hi> and having
advanced as farre as <hi>Cowy</hi> (a little Village some ten miles off <hi>Aberdene)</hi> was there
advertised that the Earls were 3000. strong, and marching directly towards him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King nothing dismayed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Majesties speech to the Noblemen in his Army.</note> 
                     <hi>called the Noblemen that were in the Army toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and spake cheerfully unto them, saying,</hi> That they had a great deal of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of their enemies, the better cause, and the King on their part. Neither oaths nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,
<hi>said he,</hi> can assure these men, and if benefits or good deeds could have made
them loyal and obedient, I have not been sparing to them all. Now that I am drawn against
my will by their open Rebellion to use force, I do assure my self of your fidelity, and that you
will not forsake me. I shall desire you stand no longer then ye see me stand, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
I do not think they dare set their faces against me, yet I shall pray you to dispose all
things in the best order you can.</p>
                  <p>This speech he delivered with such a grace,<note place="margin">A question for leading the Vant-guard.</note> as thereby the Noblemen,
and others that stood by, were greatly incouraged, every one avowing to do
their uttermost for his Majesties honour. But a question falling between the Lord
<hi>Hamilton</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> for leading the Vant-guard, was like to have caused
some trouble; <hi>Angus</hi> claiming the place by the priviledges granted to his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors;
and the Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> alledging, that none ought to contend with him in
honour, because of his proximity to the Royal blood: but the King interposing
his authority, gave the leading of the Vant-guard for that time to the Lord <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>

was done at that time should work any prejudice.</p>
                  <p>All that night the King did watch himself,<note place="margin">The Lords dissolve their forces.</note> and kept his Army on foot. In the
morning early he was advertised that the Rebels were dispersed, and gone back: for
<hi>Huntley</hi> understanding that the King was resolved to put it to a day, declined the
fight, because of the danger that might come to the Kings person; <hi>Crawford</hi> for the
same reason seemed not very bent: but <hi>Arroll</hi> insisting to have gone forward,
when he saw they would not be moved, parted from them at the bridge of <hi>Dee</hi> in
great wrath.<note place="margin">The King go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>Aberdene.</hi>
                     </note> The King came the same day to <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and calling the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
did threaten them sharply for receiving the Rebels into their City. They
excused themselves by their weaknesse, and the want of power to resist the
great forces: which was admitted, upon promise that they should look better to
their town in after times. Whilest the King stayed there, the Noblemen and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
of the countrey came in and made offer of their service, giving surety not to
reset nor intercommune with the Rebels, and to concurre with his Majesties Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
when they should be required.</p>
                  <p>This done the King returned to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>

thousand pounds was granted by the Councel, according to a warrant given them
in the Parliament 1587. whereof the subjects made ready payment: so great was
their desire to have the King matched, and the royal succession established in
his race.</p>
                  <p>The enterprise of the Rebels being in this sort defeated,<note place="margin">The Rebels offer to submit themselves.</note> the Thesaurer was
put to liberty, and at his coming to Court did solicit the King in favours of the Earl
of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Crawford,</hi> who forthinking the attempt they had made, did offer to
enter their persons in Ward, and submit themselves to the punishment his Majesty
should be pleased to impose. The Chancellor made the like intercession for <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
but for <hi>Arroll</hi> none did speak. After the King had thought a little of it, he
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:50008:201"/>
was content they should enter, and present themselves to the Justice; but would
give no condition. For this effect the 24. of <hi>May</hi> was assigned; at the day Mr. <hi>Edward

Priests, and other strangers against Religion, receiving of <hi>Spanish</hi> gold,<note place="margin">The points of their indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
and hiring souldiers therewith to disturb the quiet of the Realm. 2. That they
had entered in bond and confederacy with the Earls of <hi>Arroll, Montrosse,</hi> and
others contrary to the Lawes, kept Conventicles, and treasonably surprised the
Town of <hi>Perth,</hi> of purpose to have fortified the same against his Majesty.
3. That they had conspired to take the King prisoner at <hi>Halyrudhouse,</hi> and kill
his servants, and Counsellours, especially Sir <hi>Iohn Maitland</hi> of <hi>Thirlstane</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.
4. That they had besieged the house of <hi>Kirkhill,</hi> put fire to the same, and
forced the Master of <hi>Glammis</hi> Thesaurer to render himself captive. 5. That
they had convocated the subjects by open Proclamation, and given out that the
King was detained prisoner against his will. 6. That they came with displayed
banners to the Bridge of <hi>Dee,</hi> of mind to invade the King, whom they knew to
be upon an expedition to the North parts. 7. That they had taken the Kings
Herauld at Arms in the City of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> spoyled him of his Coat, and Letters,
when he was about to proclaim them. The 8. and last, concerned <hi>Bothwell</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
who besides the rest, was charged to have hired souldiers, as well strangers, as
men within the countrey, entertaining them in <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and threatning to invade

                     <hi>Bothwell</hi> confessing that he had waged souldiers,<note place="margin">The Lords found guilty, and committed to several Wards.</note> and entered in bonds with other
Noblemen, did therefore put himself in his Majesties will, the rest of the points he
denied, remitting himself to the trial of his Peers. <hi>Crawford</hi> confessed that he was
in the fields at the taking of <hi>Kirkhill,</hi> and with the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> in <hi>Aberdene,</hi> but
denied the other points; <hi>Huntley</hi> come in will for the whole. The Assise removing
by themselves, found <hi>Bothwell</hi> guilty of the enterprise at the quarrel holes, besides
that which he confessed. They filed <hi>Crawford</hi> of surprising the Town of <hi>Perth,</hi> and
coming in Arms to the Bridge of <hi>Dee; Huntley</hi> by his own confession was found
guilty in all. The sentence upon the Kings Warrant was suspended, and they
committed to divers places: <hi>Bothwell</hi> in <hi>Tantallon, Crawford</hi> in <hi>Blacknesse,</hi> and
<hi>Huntley</hi> in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Iune</hi> following,<note place="margin">An Assembly of the Church at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                     </note> the Assembly of the Church convened at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where
the King giving his presence, after he had spoken a little of his good affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Church; shewed that he was come to desire Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway</hi> to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
one of his Ministers: the <hi>Assembly</hi> by the mouth of their Moderator, <hi>rendring
his Majesty humble thanks for the beginnings he had made in suppressing the enemies of
Religion, did intreat him to prosecute the businesse, and made offer of their humble service
and assistance to the uttermost of their power. As to that which he desired, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that his Majesty might command any Minister wheresoever he served, to attend
himself and his Court;</hi> and so ordained Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway</hi> to leave his charge
at <hi>Perth,</hi> and wait upon the King.</p>
                  <p>It was a good beginning, and this gave no small content to all well disposed
men. But things continued not long in that case, for before that meeting took an
end, a fresh offence was given. The year preceding, the King having contracted
his Cousen the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> his sister to the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> had caused the
Bishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> celebrate the marriage,<note place="margin">The Bishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived for the marriage of <hi>Huntley.</hi>
                     </note> at which the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
taking exception, they complained of the same, in a preceding Assembly, and had
obtained a Commission to the Presbytery for calling and censuring the Bishop ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Acts of the Church. Whether the Bishop would not ackowledge
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:50008:201"/>
them for Judges, or that he esteemed his Majesties command a Warrant sufficient
for what he had done; whilest as he neglected their proceedings, they pronounce him
deprived from all office and function in the Church; and presenting the processe in
this assembly, the same was found formal, the sentence ratified, and ordained to be
published in all the Churches of the Kingdome, only to make the Bishop hateful,
and contemptible. He complaineth to the King, who shewed himself extremely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with their doings; but what course he should take he was doubtful, for every
day he was expecting the arrival of his Queen, and loved to have all things quiet, and
setled at her coming, especially in the Church; with whom it grieved him not a little
to be still in question: but espying no better way, he resolved in end to dissemble his
anger towards them, and to take the imprisoned Lords in favour, lest he should make
himself too much businesse. Thereupon he returneth to the North<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his will concerning them. The Lord <hi>Maxwel,</hi> upon his bond not to practise
against Religion, under the pain of an hundred thousand pounds, is likewise
dimitted.</p>
                  <p>And in this case stood things when advertisement came that the marriage was
accomplished,<note place="margin">Advertisement to the King of the marriage with the Queen.</note> and the Queen ready to take Sea. All diligence was thereupon used
to prepare for her reception, and nothing left undone that was required for so great
a solemnity. But a second and unlookt for message cometh shortly after, shewing
that the Navy appointed for her conduct was driven by a tempest into <hi>Norway,</hi> and
that it was thought she should stay in those parts unto the spring. The King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this impatiently,<note place="margin">The King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Norway.</hi>
                     </note> concludeth with himself to go thither in person; and because
he knew many impediments would be made, if his purpose were known, he giveth
out that he would send the Chancellor and Justice Clerk to transport her in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
Vessels, if the <hi>Danes</hi> would not adventure theirs in that season. How soon the
ships were prepared for their journey, no man expecting any such matter, he taketh
Sea himself,<note n="*" place="margin">22. October.</note> leaving direction to the Councel for the government of affaires
during his absence, with the following Declaration written all with his own hand,
but not seen to any till he was gone.</p>
                  <p>In respect I know that the motion of my voyage will be at this time diversly scanned,<note place="margin">He leaveth a Declaration under his hand.</note>
and misinterpreting may be made as well to my dishononr, as to the blame of innocents;
I have thought fit to leave this Declaration, for resolving all good subjects, first of the
causes that moved me to undertake this voyage, then in the fashion in which I resolved to
make the same. As to the causes, I have been generally blamed by all men for deferring
my marriage so long, being alone, without Father, Mother, Brother or Sister; and yet a
King not only of this Realm, but heir apparent of another. This my nakedness made me
weak, and mine enemies strong; for one man is no man as they speak, and where there is no
hope of succession, it breeds contempt, and disdain; yea the delay I have used hath begot in
many a suspicion of impotency in me, as if I were a barren stock; These and other reasons
moved me to hasten my marriage, from which I could yet have longer abstained, if the
weal of my countrey could have permitted. I am not known to be rash in my weightiest
affairs, neither am I so carried with passion as not to give place to reason; but the treaty
being perfected, and the Queen on her journey, when I was advertised of her stay by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
windes, and that it was not like she should perfect her voyage this year, I resolved to
make it on my part possible, which was unpossible on hers.</p>
                  <p>The place where I first took this resolution was in <hi>Craigmillar,</hi> none of my Councel
being present; and as I took it by myself, so I bethought me of a way to follow the same. And
first I advised to employ the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> in the voyage, in regard he is Admiral; but
his preparations took so long a time, that I was forced to call the Councel, and send for the
Chancellor and Iustice Clerk, who were then in <hi>Lawder.</hi> When as they met, they found so
many difficulties in sending forth a number of ships for the Queens convey (for so I gave it
out) and who should be the Ambassadors, that I was compelled to avouch, if none should be
found to go, I should go my self alone in a ship: adding that if men had been as willing as
became them, I would not have needed to have been in these straits: This the Chancellor
taking to touch him (for he knew he had been standered all that time for impeding my
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:50008:202"/>
marriage) partly out of zeal to my service, and partly fearing that I should make good
my word, if no better way could be found, made offer to go himselfe in that service. This
I embraced, keeping my intention from all men, because I thought it enough for me to put
my foot in a ship when all things were ready, and from the Chancellor himself, (from whom
I never kept any of my weightiest businesses) for two reasons. First, because if I had made him
of my Councel in that purpose, he had been blamed, for putting the same in my head, (which
had not been his duty) for it becomes no subject to give his Prince advice in such matters;
withall considering, what hatred and envy he sustained injustly for leading me by the nose
as it were to all his appetites, as though I were an unreasonable creature, or a child that
could do nothing of my self, I thought pity to heap mo unjust slanders on his head. The
other reason was, that I perceived it was for staying my journey, that he made offer to go;
so was I assured if he had known my purpose, he would either have stayed himself at home,
or thinking it too heavy a burthen for him to undertake my convoy, he would have linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so long, as there should not have been a possibility for making the voyage. This I thought
meet to declare, (and upon my honour it is the truth) lest I should be esteemed an imprudent
Asse, that can do nothing of my self, and to save the innocency of that man from unjust
reproaches. For my part, besides that which I have said, the shortness of the way, the surety
of the passage, being clear of all sands, forelands, and such other perils; safe harbours in
these parts, and no forain fleets resorting in these Seas; it is my pleasure that no man
grudge at this my proceeding, but that all conform themselves to the directions I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to be followed unto my return, which shall be within 20. dayes, wind and weather ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
and if any shall contravene these, I will take it as a sufficient proof, that he bears
me no good will in his heart; as to the contrary I will respect all that reverence my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
in the best sort I may. Farewell.</p>
                  <p>This Declaration written and signed with his Majesties own hand,<note place="margin">Directions to the Councel.</note> was the next
day after he was shipped, presented to the Councel by <hi>Alexander Hay</hi> Clerk
of Register, together with the directions mentioned in the end thereof, which
were thus conceived.</p>
                  <p>Seeing it hath pleased Almighty God to bring us to mans age, and that nothing hath
been more earnestly wished by all our good subjects, then to see us honourably matched, so that
the Crown might descend to our own succession after so many worthy progenitors; me to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
their desires, having resolved upon a personage, that for blood and other commodities
of alliance, could not be thought but most worthy; did enter into contract with <hi>Frederick</hi>
King of <hi>Denmark</hi> lately deceased, and by advice of our Councel directed our Ambassador
to solemnize the marriage, and conduct her unto this Realm: But having intelligence,
that by contrarious windes she and her company was driven to <hi>Norway,</hi> and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
remitted to her choice, whether she would return unto <hi>Denmark,</hi> or make stay there
untill the opening of the spring, she had embraced the last condition, as the best and most
liking to her desire: Albeit hitherto we have not behaved our self dissolutely, but patiently
attended the good occasion that God should offer; yet now taking to heart her pains and
danger, with the difficulties that have occurred in her transport, we could find no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
till that we enterprised to make a voyage towards her, and bring her home, which
we are in good hope to do, within the space of 20. dayes wind and weather serving.</p>
                  <p>Yet fearing the time of my stay may be longer at Gods good pleasure, lest any looseness
during our absence should fall into the government, we have of our own motion, and not
counselled by any, left a Declaration with the Clerk of Register, and willed no man to grudge
at our absence, seeing in former times the Kingdom hath wanted a Governour longer, then
we trust in God, it shall want us; as namely from the death of our Grandmother the
Queen Regent, unto the arrival of our dearest mother form <hi>France,</hi> the space of 14.
moneths, during which time, for the reverence and love carried unto her, albeit a woman
and minor in years, no violence was committed by any person, and greater peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
observed then was before, or since that time known to have been kept. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
our expectation is nothing lesse, of the good behaviour of our subjects in this
our absence, we have taken order for the better government of the publick affairs, that our
privy Councell should reside at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and ordained the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
to be President thereof, and to be assisted by our Cousen <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi>
whom we appoint to attend him, with the other officers of State, namely the Thesaurer,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:50008:202"/>
Comptroller, Master of requests, Privy Seal, the Captain of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
Advocate and Clerk of Register, who shall ever be present, five of them at least with our
said Nephew.</p>
                  <p>We have likewise given order, that some Noblemen in their courses shall attend at
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> the space of 15. dayes; the Earls of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Athol,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi>
and <hi>Innermeth</hi> to begin; and the next course to be kept by the Earls of <hi>Marre</hi> and
<hi>Morton,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Seaton,</hi> and <hi>Yester.</hi> The Barons of <hi>Lothian, Fife, Srive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-shire,</hi>
and <hi>Strathern,</hi> we appoint to attend as they shall be warned, and directed by the
Councel. For the South parts, we have made the Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> our Lieutenant, that is,
within the three Wardenries and Sheriffdom of <hi>Lanrick,</hi> and to be assisted, when need is,
by the Lords <hi>Boyd Hereis, Maxwell, Home, Cesford,</hi> and other chief Barons within
the Marches; his residence to be at <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> or <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> and his charges to be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
out of the readiest of the Taxation by Mr. <hi>John Colvill</hi> Collector thereof. And that
peace and quietnesse may be the better observed, we discharge all Conventions for any cause
whatsoever unto our return. Finally, we require the Ministers, and Preachers of the Word,
to exhort the people to peace and obedience, and commend us and our journey in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to the protection of Almighty God. As this is our desire, so we expect that all our good
subjects, will follow the same, especially they who have tried our favour of late, and that
they will persist in the loyalty promised by them: certifying those that do in the contrary,
that they shall incurre our high displeasure, and be punished with all rigour; as on the
other part, we shall remember the peaceable and obedient thankfully, when occasion
presents.</p>
                  <p>By another Missive presented at the same time to the Councel, the Earl <hi>Bothwel</hi>
was declared second to the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Melvil</hi> Vicechancellor,

<hi>Ianuary</hi> was received at <hi>Crownenburgh</hi> Castle, by the Queen-Mother, the young
King, the Duke of <hi>Holstat</hi> his brother, and the four Regents of the Realm, with
all magnificence possible. There he remained to the end of <hi>February</hi> royally enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
and because he was to stay upon the marriage of his Queens eldest sister,
with the Duke of <hi>Brunswick</hi> which was appointed in <hi>April</hi> next, he directed home
<hi>William Shaw</hi> Master of <hi>Worke</hi> to advertise the Councel of the reason of his stay, and
to cause some ships, and expert Pilots be sent with all diligence, for his more safe
convoy.<note place="margin">Colonel <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi> sent with ships to the King.</note> The Councel upon this advertisement employed Collonel <hi>William Stewart,</hi>
with six well furnished ships together,<note place="margin">Penult. Martii.</note> and with him Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway</hi> the Kings
Minister was sent to further his Majesties return. They arriving at <hi>Elsingore</hi> about
the middlest of <hi>April,</hi> in the very time that <hi>Brunswicks</hi> marriage was solemnizing,
did signify to the King the longing that the subjects had for his return, and the
peace that had been observed since his going from <hi>Scotland.</hi> For all that while
(which considering the feuds of the countrey was strange) two riots only did hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
one committed by <hi>Archibald Wachop</hi> of <hi>Nudry</hi> a wicked and insolent man;
another by the <hi>Clangregore</hi> in <hi>Bachudder.</hi> It rejoyced the King to hear that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
had been so quiet, as he did likewise accompt it a great happinesse, that in his
own company there had no quarrels fallen out, either amongst themselves, or with
the strangers; whereas it is hard for men in drink, at which they were continually
kept, long to agree. A little strife at his first coming to <hi>Upslo</hi> arose betwixt the
Chancellor and Earl <hi>Marshal</hi> for priority of place, the Earl thinking it due to him
because of the honour he had in the espousal of the Queen; and the Chancellor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting,
that his Ambassage ceased in regard of the Kings presence, and that the
same precedency belonged to him by vertue of his office in those parts, being
with the King, that he had at home. But this was pacified without any noise by the
Kings determination, who declared the place to belong to the Chancellor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brunswicks</hi> Marriage and solemnity thereof finished, the King conveyed with
many great ships,<note place="margin">The King and Queen return to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </note> took journey homewards, and arrived with his Queen at <hi>Leth</hi> the
20. of <hi>May,</hi> where he was received with a wonderful joy, and a great concourse of
people. After his landing, he went first to Church, and caused publick thanks to
be given to God for his safe and happy return; then after to the Noblemen and
Councel he gave many thanks for the care they had taken in administration of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and the quietnesse they had maintained in the countrey. The Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi>
besides the rest, was received with a most gracious countenance, for that contrary
to all mens expectation he had carried himself orderly all that time.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bothwel</hi> his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Church.</note> And he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
soon after the Kings departing (whether to purchase the opinion of a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
man, or that, as he pretended, remorse of conscience did move him) in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with <hi>Iames Gibson</hi> Minister, who was then privately returned from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
did offer for removing the many scandals he had given by his dissolutenesse, to
acknowledge publickly his offence, and make any satisfaction the Church should
enjoyn; which also he performed, appearing (as he was appointed) in the Church
where Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> did ordinarily preach, and making confession of his sinnes,
promised to live more regularly, and not to give offence thereafter to good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
But it was not long after the Kings return, that falling to his wonted forms,
he became more disordered then ever, and there through procuring the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
wrought his own undoing, as we shall hear.</p>
                  <p>The next day after the Kings arrival,<note place="margin">A difference among the Clergy for anointing the Queen.</note> the Councel assembled to advise upon
the Queens Coronation. The King determining to have it done in most solemn
manner, because none of the Bishops were present, nor could conveniently be
brought against the day, made choice of Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> to perform the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:50008:203"/>
The Ministers that were in town being therewith acquainted, some of the
number more curious then wise, did except against the ceremony of <hi>Unction</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>it was</hi> Jewish, <hi>and abolished at the coming of Christ, introduced into Christian
Kingdoms by the Pope, and not to be used.</hi> The chief of this opposition was one Mr. <hi>Iohn
Davison,</hi> an idle and turbulent man, who as then had no charge in the Church, but
had gained some credit with certain foolish people, that would be thought more
holy and zealous then other. Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> sided with him at first, reasoning for
the same opinion. It was shewed them,<note place="margin">The ceremony of Unction not Jewish.</note> 
                     <hi>That the ceremony could not be</hi> Jewish <hi>seeing
it never had the beginning from the</hi> Jewes, <hi>nor was it used by that people only. That the
anointing of Kings was mentioned in the book of</hi> Judges, <hi>which albeit uttered in a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
did shew that it was a custom received in creating of Kings. And that it was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in other Kingdomes, besides that of</hi> Judea, <hi>was a thing manifest, for</hi> Hasael <hi>King of</hi>
Aram, <hi>was anointed by</hi> Elias, <hi>and</hi> Cyrus <hi>King of</hi> Persia, <hi>is called by</hi> Esay <hi>Gods anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Both these were strangers to the Law and people of the</hi> Jewes, <hi>yet were they anointed;
wherefore the ceremony could not be</hi> Jewish. Then where they said that this rite was
introduced by the Pope of <hi>Rome; as that could not be made out, so no reasonable man
would think that every rite used amongst</hi> Papists <hi>was to be rejected; for in that case we
should be forced to remove many things that are both of good institution and use. Seeing
therefore the function and authority of Princes continueth the same, and is alike in all free
Monarchies, their anointing could no more be excepted against, then their crowning, and
the bearing of the Sword, and Scepter before them, which have all the like warrant.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Queens Coronation at <hi>Halyrudhouse.</hi>
                     </note> Thus
they were reasoned with, but nothing could remove their scruples: which the King
hearing, he called them before him, and finding them obstinate in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
told them, <q>
                        <hi>That he would not have the right of Unction omitted, and if Mr.</hi>
Robert Bruce <hi>would not do it</hi> (for they had threatned him with Church censures) <hi>he
would prorogue the day of Coronation, and stay till one of the Bishops came who would not
refuse.</hi>
                     </q> Upon this they fell to a second deliberation, and Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
misliking that a Bishop should be employed in the action, divided from
the others, so that by the plurality of voices, in end it was concluded that the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
should be used. Thus the Sunday following the Queen was solemnly crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and all the rites accustomed, performed by Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> in the Abbey
Church of <hi>Halyrudhouse.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </note> she made her triumphant entry into the Town of
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where nothing was omitted that might serve to expresse the love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the people. The rest of the moneth, and much of the next was spent in
banquets and royall shewes, for the entertaining of the strangers. These finished,
and order taken for administration of the rents assigned to the Queen, the strangers
were dimitted, and had rich presents given them both from the King and Queen.</p>
                  <p>How soon they were gone,<note place="margin">The Ministers challenged for permitting <hi>Iames Gibson</hi> to preach.</note> the King upon information that the Ministers of
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> had permitted <hi>Iames Gibson</hi> to preach in their Churches,
notwithstanding he was silenced by the general Assembly, caused cite them before
the Councel. They answered, <hi>That his silencing, as they took it, was only to the time
of his appearance before the Assembly, and that he was purged of contumacy;</hi> But the
Act being produced, and hearing that he was silenced <hi>during the pleasure of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,</hi>
which as yet was not declared, they confessed their oversight, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that he should not have place amongst them till his Majesty was satisfyed. The
King constructing their answer to the best, gave order to summon <hi>Gibson</hi> for his
contempt, and he not appearing, was denounced Rebell.</p>
                  <p>At the same time there was a marriage treated betwixt the Earl of <hi>Arrol</hi> and a
daughter of the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the alliance of <hi>Morton</hi> with <hi>Arrol.</hi>
                     </note> at which the King took exception, and did inhibit the
same, as not liking that he who had so lately rebelled, and was not yet reconciled
to the Church, should be strengthened by such an alliance; Notthelesse the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
went on, for which the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> being called before the Councel, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that he could not restrain the affection of his daughter, and was forced to
give way unto it. The Councel finding him to have failed in his duty, did remit
his censure to the King himself, who as he was a Prince most tractable, did passe it,
upon the Earl his submission.</p>

In the moneth of <hi>Iune</hi> the Assembly of the Church convened at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
which the King did honour with his presence; Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway</hi> elected to
preside in name of the Church, did put up three Petitions to his Majesty: <q>
                        <hi>One</hi> for
establishing the Churches jurisdiction,<note place="margin">An Assembly of the Church.</note> and the abolishing of all Acts made to the
contrary. <hi>Another</hi> for purging the country of Jesuits, seminary Priests, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
persons, trafficking against Religion. The <hi>third</hi> was for providing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
maintenance to Ministers, forth of the tithes of the Parishes where they
served, and applying what was above, to the sustentation of Schooles, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the poor, repairing of the fabrick of Churches, and other the like necessary
uses.</q> To the first his Majesty answered, <hi>That in all Parliaments the first Act that
was concluded, did concern the liberty of the Church, which he should have care to see ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
as in times passed.</hi> For the second he said, <hi>that it was known what pains he had
taken therein before his journey to</hi> Denmark, <hi>and that he would do what lawfully could be
done, for purging the countrey of Papists.</hi> And touching the third, because many were
interessed therein, he did advise them <hi>to make choice of the most discreet of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to meet with such of the Councel, as he should appoint, for conferring upon the readiest
means to effectuate that which they desired.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King Commended to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the deadly feuds.</note> Thereafter his Majesty falling to speak
of the barbarous feuds which were entertained in the Realm, and the many odious
murthers there through committed, <hi>did seriously commend to them (as those who
should of all others most study to make peace) the removing of such barbarities, so farre as in
them lay, wishing them in their Sermons to strike on that point, and make people understand
how sinful it was, and how shamefull to the whole Nation; as likewise to employ the most
wise amongst them for reconciling the variances that abounded in the countrey. For my
self,</hi> said he, <hi>I will employ all the power I have that way, and if you shall apply your selves
in your places to do the like, my work shall be the more easie, and have the better successe.</hi>
This was greatly applauded of all; and indeed after that time he took such pains,
partly calling those that were at variance, before the Councel, and causing them
submit their quarrels; partly making strict lawes against the troublers of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
peace, as he never ceased till he got the feuds wholly abolished.</p>
                  <p>Yet this was not wrought but after some time,<note place="margin">A trouble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Murray.</hi>
                     </note> and with much difficulty, new
troubles daily arising in sundry parts of the countrey. In the North a dissension
brake out betwixt the Earls of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> that kept those parts a long
time in trouble, the occasion whereof was this: <hi>Iohn Gordon</hi> son to <hi>Thomas Gordon</hi>
of <hi>Cluny,</hi> having married the widow of <hi>Grant</hi> of <hi>Ballendallagh,</hi> it happeneth
in a private quarrel, one of <hi>Gordons</hi> servants to be killed by the Tutor of the house:
<hi>Gordon</hi> pursuing him before the Justice, for not appearing he was denounced Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
and Commission given to the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> as Sheriffe of the countrey to
apprehend him. The Earl making search for him cometh to the house of <hi>Ballendal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagh,</hi>
and after some resistance taketh it by force, but findeth not the Tutor. This
the family of the <hi>Grants</hi> interpreting to be done in their disgrace, they betook
themselves to the patrociny of the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and with them the <hi>Clanchatton,</hi>
and divers of the name of <hi>Dumbarre</hi> did joyn. <hi>Huntley</hi> offending that any in those
parts should make head against him, and having understood that the Earls of <hi>Atholl</hi>
and <hi>Murray</hi> were to meet these <hi>Glammis</hi> in <hi>Forres,</hi> for making up a confederacy;
did assemble his friends, and went thither to dissolve the meeting, but before his
coming they had severed, and the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> was returned to his house of <hi>Tarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
Huntley</hi> taking that way home, and some of his company riding about the
house in manner of a Bravado, they within discharging some Musquets upon them,
it happened the same <hi>Gordon</hi> that married the widow, to be killed; To be revenged
of this affront, <hi>Huntley</hi> gathered forces to invade the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and he assisted
by the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> his Cousen, prepareth to defend. The convocations were
great on either side, whereof the King receiving advertisement, charges were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to command <hi>Atholl</hi> home, and inhibit <hi>Huntley</hi> from coming by West the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Spey,</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> not to come on the East of <hi>Findorne;</hi> this course did restrain
them for a time, but gave not an end to thòse troubles.</p>
                  <p>A little after this fell out the slaughter of <hi>William Ker</hi> of <hi>Ancram</hi> a Gentleman
of great sufficiency, who was killed in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> under night, by Sir <hi>Robert Ker</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:50008:204"/>
of <hi>Cesfourd;</hi> There had been a long and old emulation betwixt the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of <hi>Cesfourd</hi> and <hi>Farnherst</hi> for the Wardenry of the middle Marches,<note place="margin">An. 1591.</note> and the
Provostry of <hi>Iedburgh.</hi> But <hi>Farnherst</hi> being then deceased, and the heir left
young; this Gentleman as descended of the house, did what he could to maintain
the reputation of it, which was an eyesore to the other. It happened also some little
time before, this Gentleman in the trial of goods stolne from <hi>England,</hi> to find out
the committer of the theft, and when the same was denied (for the matter was
brought before the Councel) to verify the same by clear testimonies, which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to be done out of spleen, and to rubbe some infamy upon <hi>Cesfourd,</hi> who was
then Warden; for the man accused was one of his followers. This the Lady <hi>Cesfourd</hi>
a woman of an haughty spirit, did apprehend so deeply, as she never ceased till she
had moved her son being then very young, to bereave the Gentleman of his life.
A hateful fact it was, both for the manner in which it was done, and for the losse the
countrey received by the Gentlemans death; for he was a man generally well given,
wise of great courage, and expert beyond others in the Lawes and Customes of the
Borders. The King was highly offended, and was resolved to use exemplary Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
upon the Actor. But he eschewing, and living a fugitive some moneths, was
pardoned, upon satisfaction made to the Gentlemans children, as was thought by
the Chancellors intercession, who afterwards married him to his Neece, a daughter
of <hi>Lethington.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Most of this Winter was spent in the discovery and examination of Witches and
Sorcerers:<note place="margin">A sorceresse <hi>Agnes Samson</hi> apprehended.</note> Amongst these <hi>Agnes Samson</hi> (commonly called <hi>the wise wife of</hi> Keith)
was most remarkeable; a woman not of the base and ignorant sort of Witches; but
Matron-like, grave, and setled in her answers, which were all to some purpose. In
her examination she declared, <q>That she had a familiar spirit, who upon her call
did appear in a visible form, and resolve her of any doubtful matter, especially
concerning the life or death of persons lying sick.</q> And being askt what words
she used when she called the spirit, she said her words was, <hi>Holla Master,</hi> and that
he had learned her so to do. She further confessed, <q>That the Earl <hi>Bothwel</hi> had
moved her to enquire what should become of the King, how long he should
reign, and what should happen after his death; and that the spirit having underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to make away the King, after he had failed in performing, and was challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by her, confessed it was not in his power, speaking words she understood not,
but as she did take them,</q> the words were, <hi>Il' est homme de dieu. Richard Graham</hi>
another notorious Sorcerer, being apprehended at the same time, made the like
confession of <hi>Bothwel,</hi>

his house was to those who in that time were called <hi>Hereticks,</hi> a special place
of refuge; afterwards such was the scarcity of Ministers, that he took upon him the
charge, and was chosen with the first to have the oversight of the Churches in these
North parts, which he governed to his death most wisely, and with great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
giving no way to the Novations introduced, nor suffering them to take place
within the bounds of his charge, whilest he lived. A Baron he was of good rank,
wise, learned, liberal, of singular courage, who for divers resemblances may well be
said to have been <hi>another Ambrose:</hi> he died the 12. of <hi>March,</hi> in the 82. year of his
Age, leaving behind him a numerous posterity, and of himself, and his vertues a

by Proclamation all the subjects to intercommune or keep intelligence with him.

And lest the proceeding should have been thought too rigorous, it was declared in
the Proclamation, <q>that he being tender in blood to his Majesty, and advanced

Lord <hi>Halyeards,</hi> (so they styled him) against Mr. <hi>Patrick Simpson.</hi> The Assembly
answered, <hi>That what they did, was no way hurtfull to the priviledges of Session, nor
were they minded to meddle in any Civill matter, but in the purging of one of their own
members, they might proceed without the prejudice of the Civill judicatory, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wished them not to take ill the Churches dealing in the triall of one of their own
number.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords dimitted with this answer,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Iohn Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> questioned by the Church.</note> Mr. <hi>Iohn Graham</hi> was called, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
against the Judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affirming the cause to be <hi>Civil,</hi> and that the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof belonged to the Lords of Session, <hi>primariò,</hi> in regard the same was
depending before them. The Assembly repelling the declinatour, <hi>found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Iudges in the cause, therefore willed him to say what he could in his own defence,
otherwise they would give processe, and minister Iustice.</hi> But he taking documents of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:50008:205"/>
their Interloquutor, and protesting for remedy of law departed. The Lords esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this an encroaching upon their priviledges, and that upon such grounds all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that touched any Minister might be drawn from their Judicatory, resolved to
send a prohibition to the Assembly and discharge their proceeding; but by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of some well disposed persons, that did not like to have questions of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
moved, the business was setled, and both actions ordained to cease. Not
the less the instrument was sustained by the Lords and judges to make faith, which
turned in end to the pursuers undoing.</p>
                  <p>In this Assembly certain Articles were presented subscribed by the Archbishop
of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of S <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation.</note> allowing the Presbyterial discipline, and condemning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Episcopal, which were afterward imprinted under the title of M. <hi>Patrick
Adamsons</hi> recantation. The Bishop lay bedfast at the time, and was fallen into great
necessity by his own misgovernment; whereof his Adversaries taking advantage,
it was devised, that he should be visited by some of the brethren, and desired to leave
a testimony under his hand, of his opinion of matters of discipline; This being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
unto him, he said, <hi>That he did not trouble himself with such thoughts at that time, and
had never allowed of any other Bishop in the church, but S.</hi> Pauls Bishop, <hi>which he would
willingly set his hand to.</hi> Upon this his answer were these Articles drawn up and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by him. Whether he knew what was contained in them, or that he was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thereto by a poor collection they gave him in the time, (for so the report went)
or otherwise, it is uncertain; but when it was told him that such a recantation was
published in his name, he complained heavily of the wrong that was done him and
committing his cause to God, ended his days in the end of this year. A man he
was of great learning, and a most perswasive Preacher, but an ill administrator of the
Church Patrimony, which brought him to the misery that is pitiful to think of.
Divers works he left, of which some are extant, that shew his learning; but his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
upon the Epistles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which were most desired, falling into the hands
of his adversaries, were suppressed.</p>
                  <p>In the same Assembly a general revocation was made in name of the Church,<note place="margin">A revocation made in name of the Church.</note> by
M. <hi>Robert Pont,</hi> of all things done in prejudice of the Rents, and Patrimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
either by Ministers that were beneficed, or by others bearing the title of
Church-men. This in the opinion of wise men was esteemed to be a good way
for pleading restitution, according to the priveledge of ancient Laws; but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
and scoffed at by those that had filled their hands with the spoils of the
Church. And folly it was sure to think they could enjoy any benefit by these pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
having destroyed the estate, and dignity of the Church, by which these
priviledges should have been preserved.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this meeting there happened a great division in the Presbytery of
S. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Schisme in the Presbytery of S. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                     </note> for planting the Church of <hi>Luchars.</hi> The pretenders were M. <hi>Patrick
Weimes</hi> and M. <hi>Robert Wallace:</hi> M. <hi>Andrew Melvill</hi> with some few that followed
him, stood for M. <hi>Wallace,</hi> M. <hi>Thomas Buchannan</hi> and the rest for M. <hi>Patrick
Weimes.</hi> The matter after a hot contention being put to voyces, M. <hi>Thomas Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>channan</hi>
and some 19 or 20 with him gave their suffrages to M. <hi>Weimes;</hi> M <hi>Andrew</hi>
and other six that adhered to him gave their voices to M. <hi>Robert Wallace.</hi> M. <hi>Andrew</hi>
taking it impatiently to be thus oversweyed, left the place where the Presbytery
did meet, and with his six went to the Schools of the new Colledge, and made up
another Presbytery. M. <hi>Thomas</hi> and the rest aboad in the place, and according as they
had voyced, appointed Mr. <hi>Patrick Weimes</hi> on the next Sunday to be received Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of <hi>Luchars:</hi> M. <hi>Andrew</hi> with his company gave forth the like Ordinance for
M. <hi>Robert Wallace,</hi> and thus both were instituted and admitted Ministers to the
Church upon one day. The Gentlemen of the parish went likewise in factions,
some holding with the one and some with the other, which caused a great scandal.
There being none to pacifie the strife, M. <hi>Andrew Lambe</hi> the Minister at <hi>Brunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Island)</hi>
was directed from the Synod of <hi>Fife</hi> to entreat some of the Ministers of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>
to take the pains of bringing them to an agreement. For this effect, M. <hi>David
Lindesay,</hi> M. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> and M. <hi>I. Spotswood</hi> were chosen; who coming to S. <hi>Andrews</hi>
in the Moneth of <hi>October,</hi> called the parties before them, to understand the reasons
of their dissension. M. <hi>Andrew</hi> did plead for the one party, and M. <hi>Thomas Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:50008:206"/>
for the other. It was laid to M. <hi>Andrew</hi> his charge, <q>That he had made a seces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
forsaken the place of meeting, and the fellowship of his brethren, and with
some six onely that followed him, presumed to overturn the conclusion of the
greater number.</q> His defence was, <hi>That albeit he and his followers had left the place,
yet they could not be judged to have made secession, by reason the others had given the cause,
and conspired to preferre a person in worth not comparable to him whom they had elected.</hi>
As to the number of voices, he said, <hi>quòd suffragia essent ponder anda, non numer anda,</hi>
that voyces ought not to be numbred, but to be weighed and pondered. Two days
they continued reasoning, and in end the mediators finding no other means of
their agreement, took course to displace both the yong men, and to appoint a third
person for the service of the Church: and for eschewing such contentions thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which were feared because of the heat betwixt M. <hi>Thomas</hi> and M. <hi>Andrew,</hi> they
did appoint the Presbytery to be divided in two, a part to sit at <hi>Couper,</hi> and the rest
to abide at S. <hi>Andrews.</hi> Thus was that strife pacified, which many held to be omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
and that the government, which in the beginning did break forth into such
schismes, could not long continue; for this every man noted, <hi>That of all men, none
could worse endure parity and loved more to command, then they who had introduced it
into the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to leave the matters of the Church for a while;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bothwells</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon <hi>Halyrudhouse.</hi>
                     </note> when as the King did think
that all was quiet, and <hi>Bothwell</hi> so weakned as he could not make any trouble (for
<hi>Bacleugh</hi> his son in law was by licence gone into <hi>France,</hi> and all the gentlemen of
the South parts, who were of any worth, had given surety to have no medling with
him) there were found in the Court it self, instruments apt enough to serve his
turn. For of the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> his retinue some that envied the Chancellors
credit with the King, and others whose hopes wholly depended upon the trouble of
the State, did by secret messages incite <hi>Bothwell</hi> to enterprise somewhat for himself,
offering to bring him within the Kings Palace unperceived, where with a few hands
he might make himself master of the King, and all the Court. <hi>Bothwell</hi> is easily
drawn to condescend, and the conspiracy so ordered, that he with his followers should
under night be let in at a back passage, that lay through the Lord Duke his Stables;
and first they should seise upon the Gates, take the keyes from the Porter, and go
after that to the Kings Chamber, and make him sure. Within the Palace were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
privy to the conspiracy, especially Colonell <hi>William Stewart, Iohn Neswith</hi>
Chirurgeon to the King, and <hi>Iames Dowglas</hi> of <hi>Spot,</hi> who was brought to take part
in that enterprise by this occasion: Some days before it happened <hi>George Home</hi> of
<hi>Spot</hi> his father in law to be killed by certain <hi>Mersemen</hi> of the surname of <hi>Home</hi> and
<hi>Craw.</hi> Sir <hi>George Home</hi> Nephew to <hi>Spot,</hi> and one of the masters of the Kings Esqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
did charge <hi>Iames Dowglas</hi> as author, or accessary to the murther, because of a
fear he had conceived that his Father in law should by a new right possess his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
Sir <hi>George</hi> in some part of the lands, to which he had right by his mariage: upon
this suspicion three of his servants were apprehended and detained prisoners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Palace, till they should be tryed by torture. The Chancellor, on whom
<hi>Iames Dowglas</hi> depended, laboured all he could to free his servants from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
form of trial; but the presumptions being pregnant, the King would
have them to be tortured; which when <hi>Spot</hi> understood and saw that the same would
not be eschewed, he thrust himself desperately in the action, which but a few hours
before was communicated to him by one of the Associates.</p>
                  <p>This fell out happily for the King,<note place="margin">The success of the attempt.</note> and was it, that marred the whole conspiracy;
for when <hi>Bothwell</hi> with his company had entred by the way named, and was come
to the inner Court of the Palace, <hi>Iames Dowglas</hi> that minded nothing but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of his servants, drew a number to break open the doors where they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and by the noise thereof, all in the palace were put upon their guard. The
King was then at supper, and being told that armed men were in the nether Court,
leaving the rooms, wherein he lodged, went up to the Tower as to a place of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
surety. <hi>Bothwell</hi> having directed some to enclose the Chancellors lodgings lest
he should escape, made towards the Queens rooms where he expected to find entry,
and perceiving all shut upon him, called to bring fire. But ere they could find any,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:50008:206"/>
Sir <hi>Iames Sandilands,</hi> one of his Majesties chamber who had supped without the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
with a number of the people of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> entring by the Church of <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rud-house,</hi>
did beat him and his company from the doors, and was in possibility to
have taken them all, if there had been any lights; but those being all extinguished,
<hi>Bothwell</hi> with the principals of his company made shift in the dark, and escaped, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
by the same way that he entred, in his out-going he was encountred by a
Gentleman of the Esquiry, named <hi>Iohn Shaw,</hi> whom he killed with a Pistoll, yet
lost some nine of his followers, men of small note, who were executed the next
morning.</p>
                  <p>The enterprise thus defeated,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> slain at <hi>Dunyb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Bothwell</hi> went into the North, looking to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
by the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> his Cousen germane: which the King suspecting, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi>
Lord <hi>Ochiltry</hi> was sent to bring <hi>Murray</hi> unto the South of purpose to work a
reconcilement betwixt him and <hi>Huntly.</hi> But a rumour being raised in the mean
while that the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> was seen in the Palace with <hi>Bothwell</hi> on the night of
the enterprise, the same was entertained by <hi>Huntly,</hi> (who waited then at Court) to
make him suspected of the King, and prevailed so far, as he did purchase a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to apprehend and bring <hi>Murray</hi> to his triall. The Nobleman not fearing that
any such course should be used, was come to <hi>Dunybirsill</hi> a house situated on the north
side of <hi>Forth</hi> and belonging to his mother the Lady <hi>Downe; Huntly</hi> being advertised
of his coming, and how he lay there secure, accompanied onely with the Sheriffe of
<hi>Murray</hi> and a few of his own retinue, went thither and beset the house, requiring
him to render. The Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> refusing to put himself in the hands of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
after some defence made, wherein the Sheriffe was killed, fire was set to the
house, and they within forced by the violence of the smoak and flame to come
forth. The Earl stayed a great space after the rest, and the night falling down,
ventured among his Enemies, and breaking through the midst of them did so farre
out-run them all as they supposed he was escaped, yet searching him among the
rocks, he was discovered by the tip of his head-peece which had taken fire before he
left the house, and unmercifully slain. The report went that <hi>Huntlies</hi> friends fearing
he should disclaim the fact (for he desired rather to have taken him alive) made
him light from his horse, and give some stroaks to the dead corps. This done, <hi>Gordon</hi>
of <hi>Buckie</hi> was dispatched to advertise the King what had happened, and <hi>Huntly</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
took journey Northwards, in such hast as he left Captain <hi>Gordon</hi> his Cousen, that
was lying on the ground wounded, behinde him. This Captain was brought the next
day to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and publickly executed.</p>
                  <p>The death of the Nobleman was universally lamented,<note place="margin">The murther universally ill taken.</note> and the clamours of the
people so great, especially against the Chancellor upon whom all the blame was laid;
that the King not esteeming it safe to abide at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> removed with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where he remained untill <hi>Huntly</hi> did enter himself in Ward in <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
as he was charged. But he stayed not there many dayes, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon Caution to answer before the Justice whensoever he should be called.
The corps of the Earl and Sheriffe of <hi>Murray</hi> were brought to the Church of <hi>Leth</hi> in
two coffines, and there lay diverse Moneths unburied, their friends refusing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their bodies to the earth till the slaughter was punished.<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Ochiltrie</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth defection to <hi>Bothwell.</hi>

himself so much interessed in that fact, as the Lord <hi>Ochiltry,</hi> who had perswaded

and joyned with him for revenge of the Murther.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament which had been now twice prorogated,<note place="margin">An. 1592.</note> did keep in the moneth
of <hi>Iune.</hi> In behalf of the Church it was there petitioned, <q>1 That the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
made in the year 1584.<note place="margin">Petitions in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Church.</note> against the Discipline of the Church and liberty
thereof, should be abrogated and annulled, and a ratification granted of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
whereof they were then in practise. 2. That the Act of annexation
should be repealed, and restitution made of the Churches Patrimony. 3. That
the Abbots, Priors, and other Prelates bearing the titles of Churchmen and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
voice for the Church without any power, and Commission from the Church,
should not be admitted in time coming to give voice in Parliament, or conveen
in their name. And 4. That a solid order might be taken for purging the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:50008:207"/>
Realm of idolatry and blood wherewith it was miserably polluted.</q> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third Petitions rejected, consultation taken about the other two, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
the last, it was condescended, <hi>That saying of Masse, receiving of Iesuits, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
Priests, and trafficking Papists against the Kings Majesty, and Religion presently
professed; should be a just cause to infer the pain and crime of treason against Iesuites,
Mass Priests, trafficking Papists, and their ressetters:</hi> with a provision, <hi>That if the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
and seminary Priests did satisfie the Prince and the Church, the foresaid penalty should
not strick upon the ressetters;</hi> which in effect was no restraint, neither was the traffick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against Religion declared to be a crime of Treason, unless the same was proved
a trafficking likewise against the King. So in this point the Church received small
satisfaction. As to the complaint of blood, the same was remitted to the ordinary
course of Justice.</p>
                  <p>But the first Petition was longer debated,<note place="margin">The first Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion granted, and in what manner.</note> the King being unwilling either to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate

for he foresaw the inconvenients that would grow by the liberty that Ministers
should assume to themselves; yet <hi>Bothwels</hi> business, and the many discontentments
within the Realm, moved him to give way, lest he should be troubled likewise with
their outcries. So the Act passed, but in the most wary tearms that could be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
As for the Statute confirming his Majesties royall power, the abrogation
whereof was chiefly sought; it was onely declared, <hi>That the said Statute should be no
wayes prejudiciall, nor derogatory to the priviledge that God hath given to the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

and having warrant of the Word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the end of the Parliament the King went to <hi>Falkland,</hi>

                        <hi>Bothwells</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> where <hi>Bothwell</hi> made
a new attempt, encouraged thereunto by the Earls of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arroll,</hi> the Master
of <hi>Gray,</hi> Colonell <hi>Stewart,</hi> and the Lairds of <hi>Iohnston</hi> and <hi>Balwery,</hi> who did all
promise their concurrence in bringing him unto the Kings presence. The Master of
<hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Balwery</hi> did meet him with a good number of horse, <hi>Angus</hi> kept the Diet
but with a small company, <hi>Arroll</hi> remained with the King within the Palace, and
had taken upon him with the assistance of Colonel <hi>Stewart</hi> to open the Gates; but
either out of fear, their hearts failing them, or not having a number sufficient to
make good their undertaking, nothing was done; yet upon suspicions they were
apprehended,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arroll</hi> and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Stewart</hi> committed.</note> and <hi>Arroll</hi> sent to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the Colonel to <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
the company that came with <hi>Bothwell</hi> was not great, and did not exceed six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
in all, broken men for the most part, whom he had taken up in the <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Scottish</hi> borders; with these he had journied 2 dayes and nights, without either meat
or sleep, &amp; came to <hi>Falkland</hi> a little before midnight, where finding his expectation
disappointed, and those in the Palace provided to defend, he stayed on the side of
the hill, till a little after Sun-rising; some of his followers in the mean time break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open the Queens stables, took away the horses, and what else they could lay
hands upon. The night was then at the shortest, for it was the 26. of <hi>Iune,</hi> and the
Countrey gathering from all parts to relieve the King,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bothwell</hi> and his company flyeth.</note> he was forced to flee: But
what way to take he was uncertain, for to pass the Ferrie with his company he
could not safely, and to return by the bridge of <hi>Striveling</hi> was a long way, which
neither the horses nor their riders after so long watching could indure, yet seeing
no better then to be gone, with the haste he could make, about nine of the clock he
caused sound the trumpets, and retired.</p>
                  <p>The King after the Countrey people were come followed by the Queens Ferry,<note place="margin">The King pursueth and cometh to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh.</hi>
                     </note>
thinking he had gone that way, but finding that he had taken his course by <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
and knowing that the company would separate how soon they had passed the
bridge, he directed most of his followers to apprehend such as they could overtake.
Divers were taken in the Moors of <hi>Calder</hi> and <hi>Carnwath,</hi> but suffered to escape by
their takers: many horses were found straying in the fields, the riders being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with sleep and fallen from them.<note place="margin">

and some 7. or 8. with him, whilest they lay sleeping in a meadow nigh to
<hi>Cambusnetham,</hi> were taken by the Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and sent to be kept in the Castle
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:50008:207"/>
of <hi>Draffan,</hi> but his Lady the day after, out of a womanly commiseration whilest
her Lord was absent, suffered them to depart. <hi>Bothwell</hi> himself fled unto the West
borders, and from thence into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The badness of this attempt put the borders in a great fear,<note place="margin">Pardon gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to those that would forsake <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>

Kings clemency, as being at <hi>Dumfreise,</hi> whither he went in the beginning of <hi>Iuly,</hi> a
generall pardon was proclaimed to all that would submit themselves; whereupon
numbers did enter, and were received in favour. <hi>Bothwell</hi> thus forsaken almost
of all, did notwithstanding in the Court again find some that out of emulation, and
private rancour, more then for any affection they carried unto him, wrought the
King new troubles.</p>

to the King by Sir <hi>Iames Sandelands,</hi> who as then was keeper of the house, and being

Lord</hi> Spinie <hi>had resset</hi> Bothwell <hi>in his Ladies house at</hi> Aberdowre; which he offered
to prove <hi>by witnesses, circumstances and other clear demonstrations.</hi> These were his
words. <hi>Spinie</hi> denying all, appealed the Colonell to combat, which the King
would not permit, assigning the 12 of <hi>September</hi> for his triall before the Justice.
<hi>Spinie</hi> appearing at the day, the Colonell excused himself by the shortnesse of the
time, and had a new diet assigned him, at which his probation failing, <hi>Spinie</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to his honour, dignity and service, yet did he never recover his former credit
with the King, but was held still suspected, and whether offending at this, or that the
first declaration was true in it self, the year following he took open part with <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
and was therefore denounced Rebell.</p>
                  <p>At the same time <hi>Iohn Weymis</hi> younger of <hi>Logie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn Weymis</hi> of <hi>Logie</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for his practises with <hi>Bothwell</hi> esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</note> Gentleman of his Majesties
Chamber, and in great favour both with the King and Queen, was discovered to
have the like dealing with <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and being committed to the keeping of the
Guard, escaped by the policy of one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Maids, with whom he entertained
a secret love. The Gentlewoman, named mistress <hi>Margaret Twinslace,</hi> coming one
night whilest the King and Queen were in bed, to his keepers, shewed that the King
called for the prisoner to ask of him some question; the keepers suspecting nothing;
for they knew her to be the principall Maid in the Chamber, conveighed him to
the door of the Bed-chamber, and making a stay without as they were commanded,
the Gentlewoman did let him down at a window by a cord that she had prepared.
The keepers waiting upon his return stayed there till the morning, and then found
themselves deceived. This with the manner of the escape, ministred great occasion
of laughter, and not many dayes after the King being pacified by the Queens means,
he was pardoned, and took to wife the Gentlewoman, who had in this sort hazarded
her credit for his safety. These dealings at Court increased not a little the boldness
of others in the Countrey, so as some of all ranks, both Barons, Gentlemen and
Burgesses, became followers of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and feared not to entertain him openly.
All <hi>Teviotdale</hi> ran after him; whereupon the King made an expedition to <hi>Iedburgh
12. October,</hi> and finding some of his ressetters tooke bonds of them for their better
behaviour.</p>
                  <p>At his return he found new vexations by a faction made at Court against the
Chancellour,<note place="margin">A faction made against the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</note> whereof the heads were, the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Argile</hi> and

joyn. That which gave the occasion, was a claim made by the Queen of
the Lordship of <hi>Mussylbrugh,</hi> as being a part of <hi>Dumfermelin,</hi> which she desired the
Chancellour to resign, for he had acquired an heritable right thereof, at the making
the act of Annexation. The Chancellour excusing himself, and in effect denying to
satisfie her desire, she grew offended, and drew in these Noblemen to oppose him;

to be conveighed with a strong guard, delivered him to the Provost of the City, the
King being then in <hi>Alloway</hi> at the <hi>Christmasse</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> who but a few
payes before had married the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> his sister. Advertisement made of
his apprehension, and of the letters deprehended with him, the King made haste to
return. The night before his coming was the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> returned from the
North,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned in the Castle.</note> and not having heard any thing of Mr. <hi>George Kers</hi> taking, went as he was
accustomed to his lodging in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but was presently arrested by the Provost
and Baylifes, and sent prisoner to the Castle. The King esteeming this too great a
presumption in them, to have used a Nobleman and Counsellour lately returned
from such a publick imployment, without warrant in that manner, was not a little
offended; yet because of the hainous accusations laid against him, their forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
was excused, and his imprisonment allowed for good service by Act of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> George Ker <hi>at his examination did ingenuously confesse all that he knew of

                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>George Ker</hi> his Confession</note> 
                     <hi>the summe whereof was as followeth.</hi> That upon a letter sent from

King of <hi>Spains</hi> aid for the alteration of Religion, Mr. <hi>James Gordon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Abercrombie</hi> Iesuits, had devised to send one to <hi>Spain,</hi> to certifie the King of the
concurrence of the Scottish Catholicks in his service, and that for the greater secrecy, the
three forenamed Earls should undertake for the rest, and by their letters testifie the same.
That this being proponed to the Noblemen, they did willingly consent, and accordingly set
their hands to eight blanks, six whereof were to be filled, as missives from them to the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the two other with procurations, one for the messengers credit, the other
for the Articles, that should be drawn up in <hi>Spain;</hi> That the filling of the blanks was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to Mr. <hi>William Chreichton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>James Tyrie,</hi> and that Sir <hi>James Chisholm,</hi>
one of the Kings Master housholds was first chosen to be carrier of the blanks, but that he
being impeded through some private businesse, they were delivered to him, subscribed in the
moneth of <hi>October,</hi> he being then in <hi>Edinburgh. He further declared,</hi> that by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at the same time with the Earls of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arroll,</hi> he understood that the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> was to send an Army of thirty thousand men into <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereof 15000.
should remain in the Countrey, and with the assistance of the Catholicks either alter the
present Religion, or procure liberty to their own profession: and that the rest of the army
should invade <hi>England,</hi> being conveyed thither by the Catholick Lords who were to meet
the Army at their landing, which was appointed to be either at <hi>Kirkudbright</hi> in <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi>

The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> charged with these points denied, affirming the blanks and
subscriptions to be counterfeited. But <hi>David Graham</hi> of <hi>Fintry,</hi> who was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
upon suspicion at the same time,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> denieth the blanks.</note> declared that Mr. <hi>Robert Abercrombie</hi> had

their prayers to implore the mercy of God for preservation of themselves, their wives and

but also to let him know what help they would contribute for strengthening him
in his proceeding against the unnaturall Subjects.</p>
                  <p>His Majesties desire being reported to the Meeting their advice was,<note place="margin">An offer made by the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

it was not expected that they would appear so as his Majesty should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to pursue them by force of Armes; they did humbly offer their attendance
upon his Majesties person, till they should be apprehended or expulsed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;

thankfully accepted, and a Proclamation made to meet the King at <hi>Aberdene</hi> the 20
of <hi>February,</hi> for settling the North parts; and for a beginning of Justice <hi>David

                  <p>Some two dayes before his execution, Mr. <hi>Iohn Graham</hi> one of the Senators of

cause was common and touched all Princes professing the same Religion, she desired to be

the course taken in both their dominions for resisting the attempts of <hi>Spain. The King
thanking the Queen for her friendly offer and advice, said,</hi> That he knew Sir <hi>Robert

blanks and letters intercepted: that he had made a beginning, and was fully resolved to
prosecute the same with all rigour against those that he should trie culpable; but willed her
to consider how dangerous it was for him to have so many great men his Rebells, and what
a businesse it would be, to hunt them out of those holes, and desert places where they lurked;
That he would stand in need of her help and supply, which he doubted not to finde, it being
more dangerous for her estate to have the Spaniard set foot in his Kingdome, then either
in <hi>France,</hi> or the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> both which she had liberally helped and supplyed with

eonjoyned, as they that were enemies to the one, could not be friends to the other, that
some of every Presbytery should be appointed to inform and advertise his Majesty of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of the Papists and the ressetters of <hi>Bothwell;</hi> whose whole courses tended to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Religion, no lesse then the indangering of his Majesties person.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And fifthly,</hi> That they should appoint some of their number to cause the Magistrates of
Burghes, where there are any Sea-ports, try those that came into the Countery, or passed
forth of the same, to delate their names, that the plots and practises against Religion might
be better discovered.</p>
                  <p>These Articles,<note place="margin">The Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies Answer.</note> especially the first two, savouring of discontent, were answered
generally by the Assembly: concerning their Meetings, they said, that they should
follow the Act of Parliament made the year preceding: and for the declaming in
Pulpit, an Act was made prohibiting <hi>any Minister to utter in Pulpit any rash or irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
speeches against his Majesty and Councell, or their proceedings; and to give their
admonitions upon just and necessary causes, and in all fear, love and reverence.</hi> Which
the King esteeming to be no restraint, but rather to minister an excuse to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
sort when they transgressed, then otherwise, rejected as not satisfying his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
whereupon the Petitions of the Church proponed against Papists at the same
time, and against the erections of Tithes in Temporalities, were not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                  <p>In this Assembly it was enacted <q>That none professing Religion within the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> should from thenceforth repair to any of the King of <hi>Spains</hi>
Dominions, where the tyranny of Inquisition was used, for traffick of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
or other the like negotiations, till the King did obtain liberty from the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> to his Subjects for traffick in these bounds, without any danger of their
person or goods for the cause of Religion,</q> under the pain of Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>The Merchants offending hereat, did petition his Majesty and Councell for
maintaining their liberty of traffick; which was granted. Notwithstanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Ministers proceeded in their censures, till the Merchants made offer to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease
their trade with <hi>Spain,</hi> how soon their accompts were made, and they payed
by their creditors in those parts.</p>
                  <p>But the abolishing of the <hi>Mondayes</hi> Mercat in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A change of the <hi>Mondayes</hi> Mercat urged at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                     </note> though assented unto
by the Councell of the Town, and past in an Act, took not the like effect; for the
shoomakers who were most interessed in that businesse, hearing that the same was

to be put in execution tumultuously gathering themselves together,<note place="margin">An. 1593.</note> come to the
Ministers houses, menacing to chase them forth of the town, if they did urge that
matter any more; after which the motion ceased, the Mercat continuing as before.
This did minister great occasions of sport at that time in Court, where it was said,
<hi>That rascalls and sowtars could obtain at the Ministers hands, what the King could not
in matters more reasonable.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </note> Sir <hi>Robert Melvil</hi> was sent in Ambassage to <hi>England;</hi> his
Commissionwas to signifie what had been done in the prosecution of the Authors,
and contrivers of the last practises since the Lord <hi>Burgh</hi> his return, and to require
some aid and assistance for inabling the King to follow that businesse to an end;
and particularly he was desired to crave a supply in money for levying 600. Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and entertaining them some moneths, till the service was finished, and the
Rebells either apprehended, or forced to quit the Realm; withall he was appointed
to renew the former complaints of <hi>Bothwel</hi> his resset and entertainment in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>England,</hi> and to crave his delivery according to the league. But while he
was pressing that businesse in <hi>England, Bothwel</hi> surprised the King at home, and
for a while made all these purposes to sleep, so as he returned without effecting
any thing.</p>
                  <p>The occasion and manner of the surprise was this.<note place="margin">The King surprised by <hi>Bothwell.</hi>
                     </note> The Chancellour who had
all that year been absent from Court, upon a discontent the Queen conceived against
him, had sent to the King a Letter <q>requesting his licence to depart forth of the
Countrey, since he could not with safety attend his service; for that to remain at
home, and live deprived of his Majesties presence, he said was to him a very hell,
which he could hardly indure; promising to return at such time, as his Majesty
should find convenient to recall him to his service.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King did shew the letter to the Queen,<note place="margin">The manner of the surprise.</note> because in the same he had protested
much of his sincere affection towards her, and being loath to quite him whom he
had tried to be so able a servant, moved her to forget all quarrels, so as he would
resigne the Lordship of <hi>Mussilbrugh,</hi> which had bred this dissension. The resignation
made, and the Chancellour being on the point to return to Court, the Duke of
<hi>Lennox</hi> by the advice of <hi>Atholl, Ochiltrie,</hi> and others of the name of <hi>Stewart,</hi> resolved
to prevent his coming by the inbringing of <hi>Bothwell.</hi> The Parliament had broke
up some two dayes before, and the Noblemen resorting to the Palace to take their
leave of the King, the Gates were kept patent, and lesse heed taken of those who
entred. <hi>Atholl</hi> with his Lady had lodged all that time in the house, then pertaining
to the Earl of <hi>Gowry,</hi> at the back of the Palace, and kept <hi>Bothwell</hi> private with Mr.
<hi>Iohn Colvill,</hi> one of his followers. So early in the morning the Lady pretending
to bid the King farewell, and making her entry through the Postern Gate, taketh
<hi>Bothwell</hi> and his companion along with her, and bringeth them unperceived of any
into the Kings bedchamber; The King was then private in a retiring room, and
when he came back, and saw them stand with their swords in their hands, cried
aloud, <hi>Treason, treason:</hi> They falling on their knees called for mercy; <hi>Nay,</hi> said the
King, <hi>you have dishonoured me;</hi> and placing himself in his chair, <hi>Strike Traitor,</hi>
saith he to Bothwell, <hi>and make an end of thy work, for I desire not to live any longer.</hi>
He protesting with many oaths, that he came only to beg pardon, and to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his Majesties will: the King replyed, <hi>That mercy extorted by violence, was not
mercy, and that it was not the form of supplicants to come with weapons in their hands.</hi>
Whilest the King was thus talking, the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Keith</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Chamber, and presently after them a number of <hi>Bothwells</hi> faction,
who by this time had possessed the utter Court, and assumed the charge of the
Gates.</p>
                  <p>The report of this accident going to the City the people went to armes,<note place="margin">The Citie in armes.</note> and
conducted by Sir <hi>Alexander Home</hi> their Provost, made towards the Palace to give
the King relief; but he was then become somewhat pacified, and following the Earl
of <hi>Marre</hi> his advice, after he had shewed himself from a window to the people, and
given them thanks for their readiness, he willed them to return to their houses &amp; at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his advertisement. All that day matters were caried fairly in a sort, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

speeches, and offering himself to trial for the consultation which began his trouble;
for his other misdemeanors he desired mercy, excusing himself by the want, and
necessity, whereunto he and his friends were driven. But when he perceived the
Kings countenance not to be towards him, as he wished, he changed his forms, and
letting some words fall that sounded not well, gave divers to suspect that he should
attempt some violence. This did set the English Ambassador on work, who being
assisted by the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> did after long travell and much perswasion
induce the King to set his hand to the Articles following.</p>
                  <p>1 That remission should be granted to <hi>Bothwell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Conditions granted to <hi>Bothwell</hi> by the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors mediation</note> his friends and partakers for all
attempts against his Majesties person and authority in any time past, and promise
made never to call or pursue him and his foresaids for any by-past fact; as likewise
to repossess them in their houses, and lands, notwithstanding whatsoever process
laid against them.</p>
                  <p>2 That a Parliament should be called in <hi>November</hi> next, and such an Act past in
his and their favours as was made at <hi>Linlithgow Anno</hi> 1585 for their greater
security.</p>
                  <p>3 That during that time, the King should not receive in his Company the
Chancellor, the Lord <hi>Home,</hi> the Master of <hi>Glammis,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Home</hi> knight.</p>
                  <p>4 That from henceforth, the Earl <hi>Bothwell,</hi> his friends and followers should be
esteemed as good and lawful subjects, and used with much favour as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
offended.</p>
                  <p>These Articles the King did in the word of a Prince promise to perform,<note place="margin">Articles sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the witnesses.</note> and
for <hi>Bothwells</hi> greater satisfaction after he had signed the same with his own hand,
caused so many of the Councell as were present together with the Magistrates and
Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> subscrive as Witnesses. The subscribers were, the Duke of
<hi>Lennox,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Atholl,</hi> the Lords, <hi>Forbes, Ochiltry, Spiny,</hi> and <hi>Urquhart,</hi> the Master
of <hi>Gray,</hi> M. <hi>Iames Elphinston, Mircarny,</hi> the Clerk of Register, <hi>Nicoll Edward, Iohn
Morison, George Fodrick,</hi> and <hi>David Williamson,</hi> Baylifes of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> M. <hi>David
Lindesay,</hi> M. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> M. <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> M. <hi>Walter Balcanquell</hi> and M. <hi>Patrick
Galloway,</hi> Ministers. For <hi>Bothwell</hi> it was promised that he should leave the Court,
and not come towards the King till he was called by his Majesty.</p>
                  <p>These things were done at <hi>Halirudhouse</hi> the 14 of <hi>August</hi> 1593.<note place="margin">The King go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>Falkland</hi>
                     </note> some twenty days
after the surprise. The next day the King went to <hi>Falkland,</hi> attended by the Duke of
<hi>Lennox,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ochiltry,</hi> and <hi>Chreichton</hi> of <hi>Clany</hi> a follower of <hi>Atholl,</hi> who did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to waite upon the the King unto <hi>November,</hi> and debarre those others that by
the Articles were not to be admitted. The rest of the moneth the King stayed at
<hi>Falkland,</hi> and in that time <hi>Bothwell</hi> did obtain himself purged by an Assise of
practising and consulting with Witches, which had been the original of his
mischief.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>September</hi> the King went to <hi>Striveling,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Convention at <hi>Striveling 7. Sept.</hi>
                     </note> where he had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Convention to meet for taking order with the broken men of the Highlands
and borders; Thither came the Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Marre, Morton, Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne,</hi>
and <hi>Montrose,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Lindesay</hi> and <hi>Levingston;</hi> of the Church estate,
the Bishops of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> and <hi>Aberdene,</hi> the Prior of <hi>Blantyre,</hi> and Abbot of <hi>Lundors,</hi>
and divers Commissioners of Burghes. After some speeches concerning the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Highlands, and the means to quiet them which was the errand pretended,
the King declared, <q>that he had called them, to that meeting for business that
touched him more nigh: and then relating the many indignities he had endured at
<hi>Bothwells</hi> hands, which they all knew, he desired to have their advice touching
the Conditions granted to him of late,<note place="margin">The Estates finde the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions given to <hi>Bothwell</hi> dishonorable.</note> and whether they did think him tyed to
the performance thereof, the same being extorted by the importunity of those
that took on them to mediate betwixt him and <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and yeelded unto by him
upon just fear. The answer of the Convention was,</q> 
                     <hi>That they judged the fact of</hi>
Bothwell <hi>Treasonable, and the Conditions granted in such a manner to carry no necessity
of performance; that for the remission promised to him, and his followers, the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon his Majesties own pleasure, and that he should doe therein what seemed to
him good; but to be tyed not to receive in his company his servants and officers, they held
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:50008:211"/>
it not to stand with the honour and dignity of a King. For the remission,</hi> said the King,
<hi>I could be content for the quiet of the Realm, to grant the same upon his humble suite, and
supplication, when I am now at liberty, but to be forced thereto and by way of capitulation
to grant the same, I do not think it agreeth with mine honour. That which I require of you
since I judge the conditions unlawfull, and that neither in law nor conscience I am bound to
observe them, is, that by publick Act the same be declared, and that as a free Prince I
may presently, and in all time coming, admit and receive into my company, such of the
Nobility, Councell, Officiars, and other good subjects, as I shall think good to use in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of my affairs.</hi> All esteeming this to be most reasonable, an Act was made
declaring, <q>That his Majesty with the advice of the Estates, had recalled the grant
made to <hi>Bothwell</hi> in <hi>August</hi> last, and that being a free Prince he might use the
service of any of his subjects and call them to him at his pleasure.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Declaration made,<note place="margin">The Prior of <hi>Blantyre</hi> and sir <hi>Robert Melvill</hi> directed to <hi>Bothwell.</hi>
                     </note> the Prior of <hi>Blantyre</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Melvill,</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to <hi>Bothwell</hi> to shew him that albeit the King did not think himself bound in
law, or hnour to perform the Conditions made at <hi>Halyrudhouse,</hi> yet if he should
now make humble suit for pardon to himself, and his followers, the same should
be granted, with a double Proviso: first that he should supplicate his pardon, and
pass the same formally before the 20 of <hi>November;</hi> secondly, that the remission be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exped, he should depart forth of the Realm and abide in such parts beyond
Sea, as the King should appoint, and not return into the Countrey without his
Majesties licence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bothwell</hi> at first did take the offer well and seemed therewith content,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bothwell</hi> falleth to his wonted forms.</note> but when
he was returned to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> (for the intimation was made to him at <hi>Linlithgow</hi>)
and heard that the Lord <hi>Home,</hi> and those others against whom he took exception,
were received in Court, he was greatly commoved, and falling to his wonted forms,
threatned to make the King observe the Conditions, and keep what he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
To this purpose he advertised the Earl of <hi>Atholl,</hi> desiring he should meet him
at <hi>Striveling</hi> the first of <hi>October</hi> with his forces: <hi>Atholl</hi> kept the Diet, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Earl of <hi>Montrosse</hi> and a great number of men; but the King was parted
from <hi>Striveling</hi> and remained then at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> attended by the Lord <hi>Hamilton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
and divers other noble men, which made <hi>Bothwell</hi> change his purpose and disappoint
the interprise.</p>
                  <p>The King understanding that <hi>Atholl</hi> with his forces was come to <hi>Striveling,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Atholl</hi> coming to <hi>Striveling</hi> is charged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home in the beginning of <hi>October.</hi>
                     </note> sent
a messenger to charge him to return home, and dissolve his companies; which he
obeyed, pretending that his business was onely to hold a Court at <hi>Down Castle,</hi> (a
house pertaining to the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> whereof he had the Ward) and that the
messenger might witness the truth thereof, he took him along with him the next
morning to <hi>Down.</hi> The stay of the messenger put the King in suspicion that the
Charge was not obeyed, and that <hi>Atholl</hi> did wait upon <hi>Bothwells</hi> coming. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he went back to <hi>Striveling,</hi> and understanding that <hi>Atholl</hi> was gone to <hi>Down</hi>
he followed thither.<note place="margin">

the fields, encountring the Earl of <hi>Montrosse,</hi> made him prisoner, and used him and
his men somewhat roughly. But he professing to be sent by <hi>Atholl</hi> to the King
for making his excuse, and declaring the true cause of his coming in those parts, was
dimitted, the next day upon his promise to appear before the Councell whensoever
he should be charged.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Leaving these affairs for a while, we will now return to the Popish Lotds. They
had been cited to the Parliament which was kept in <hi>Iuly</hi> preceding, but upon some

                  <p>3 That when the Estates after mature deliberation shall put the foresaid traitors
to trial, the Jury be not nominated at the option of the parties accused, but by the

                  <p>4 That seeing the aforesaid traitors are excommunicated, and by the just sentence
of the Church cut off from the society of Christs body, that they are not admitted
to stand in judgement, or have any benefit of law, till they be reconciled to the
Church according to the laws of the Countrey, and his Majesties own promise, as
likewise in respect they have made themselves guilty, partly through their escape
forth of Ward, and partly by playing the fugitives and not appearing neither at
S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to which they were first cited, nor at the time of the last Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>5 Or if his Majesty will not alter the day appointed at <hi>Perth,</hi> as we do not doubt
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:50008:212"/>
but after good consideration he will, then we desire that such as profess Religion,
may be a guard to his Majesty at the time to defend his person from violence, and
to accuse and pursue them to the uttermost, which we are minded to do, although
it should be with the loss of all our lives in one day, being fully resolved if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
enemies to God and his truth, that the Countrey shall not brook them and us
together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Commissioners coming to</hi> Iedburgh <hi>had presence given them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt his Majesty and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the Church.</note> 
                     <hi>and having
presented the Petitions, the King at the reading of the inscription grew incensed,
saying,</hi> That he would not acknowledge any such Convention, nor them for Commissioners,
seeing they had assembled themselves without his consent and knowledge. <hi>They answered,
that the meeting was warranted by his Majesties Proclamations. A long reasoning
was kept upon that point; in end the King condescended to hear them as subjects,
and satisfie them with reason in every particular, but to accept of their Commission
or return any answer to that meeting he would not. This passed, he said,</hi> That he
was not foreseen of the coming of these Earls unto him at <hi>Falow,</hi> nor had he any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with them; but when they came, and did humbly offer themselves to triall, he could
not of his Princely duty refuse it, though they had been the meanest and simplest persons of
the land, that he had dismissed them without any promise or the smallest assurance of favor,
whereof he had many witnesses; and for the time and place assigned to their triall, the same
was done by advice of such of the Councell as were present, but that he had since considered
the time to be too short and the town of <hi>Perth</hi> not so convenient, and therefore had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a meeting of the Estates at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> the last of that moneth, by whose advice he
would proceed and doe that which was fitting. It hath been, <hi>said he,</hi> the suite of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to have those Earls brought to their triall, and now when they offer themselves unto it,
it is strange there should be such business made for a delay. As for himself, he had resolved
what time and place soever were appointed for the triall to have all things rightly done, and
that neither the Iudges nor Iurors, if the matter came to that point, should be other then
men indifferent and well affected to Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Commissioners putting his Majesty in minde of that he had said at the first
view of the Blancks and the hearing of M. <hi>George Ker</hi> his confession, <hi>that the crime
was above the reach of his power to pardon,</hi> and beseeching him to regard his honour
and surety, seeing it was dangerous to permit the Earls to come accompanied with
such numbers, as they intended to bring; he said that he could provide for any
dangers that way. And when they did offer, as in the Articles, to come and attend
his Majesty as a guard at the time of triall; he answered, <hi>That he would make choice of
his own guard, that those whom he called to that Diet should be welcome, and such as came
undesired should not be so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then they shew what offence was taken at the Lord <hi>Hume</hi> his entertainment in
Court, who was both excommunicated and known to be a professed enemy to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
the King replyed, <hi>That a day was given him to satisfie the Church by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
themselves, which was not as yet expired, and if he did not satisfie, that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
no longer at Court.</hi> But said they, he doth not keep promise and is thought to
have been a chief instrument in bringing these excommunicates to your Majesties
presence. <hi>For that,</hi> said the King, <hi>I know it not, and if you will accuse him, he can
speak for himself.</hi> After these speeches, they humbly besought his Majesty to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
the Assembly some answer in writing, but he absolutely refused, and so they
took their leave.</p>
                  <p>These answers reported,<note place="margin">The assembly resolved to keep the Diet appointed for the Lords trial</note> did no way content the Meeting, whereupon it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that upon advertisement they should all convene in armes at the place
which should be assigned for the triall of the Lords, and be their pursuers; to which
purpose some was left at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to make timely warning to the rest. The King
being informed of this conclusion at his return to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> called the speciall
Ministers that were in town, and shewed that it was an undutifull part in them to
convocate the subjects, and cause them take armes without his warrant; prohibiting
any such advertisement to be given as was appointed. They excusing themselves,
said, <hi>That it was the cause of God, and in defence thereof they could not be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi>

taken in that businesse,<note place="margin">A Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inhibiting all convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> he had indicted a Parliament in <hi>Iuly</hi> last for that cause, at
which time nothing being done (albeit not in his default) and he impeshed a
long time after by the practises of <hi>Bothwell</hi> and other troubles in the Countrey,
was no sooner received forth of his hands then he fell again upon the same
thoughts; and that now he had appointed a Convention of Estates at <hi>Linlith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow,</hi>
for taking their advice touching the surety of his own person, the relief of
the subjects oppression, and the ordering of all that businesse, especially since
the said Lords had by their letters and otherwise most humbly desired a triall,
which he doubted not the Estates would consider and so proceed therein, as
might best serve to the preserving of Religion, and the quietnesse of the
Countrey; his own intention being no other, but to have them satisfie the
Church, or if they refused, to cause them to be expulsed and banished the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
And for that end he had commanded them to remain at <hi>Perth,</hi> and attend
the resolution of the Estates, dissolving their forces if any they had assembled.
Whereof his Majesty did think meet to give all his subjects notice, that they
might know his care for the maintenance of true Religion against all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
thereof. And therefore inhibited the subjects to make any Convocations;
or if any were already made by the sinistrous informations of ill disposed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they were commanded to dissolve and turn to their houses till they should
be advertised either by missive Letters or Proclamations, and not otherwise,
under the pains appointed for seditious persons and disturbers of the publick
peace.</q>

                     </note> there came great companies to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
and in all parts of the Countrey were people stirring; so that the Convention
which was called to meet at the same time being not very frequent kept a short
while together. The offers and Petitions of the Popish Lords being onely read, the
consideration thereof was remitted to certain chosen by the Estates. These
were the Lord <hi>Thirlestane</hi> Chancellour,<note place="margin">Certain of the Estates selected to judge of the Lords offers.</note> the Earls <hi>Marshall, Marre, Montrosse,</hi> and

Couper, Striveling</hi> and <hi>Linlithgow;</hi> to these or any four of every estate, together
with his Majesties Officers, power was given to consider the Petitions and offers
of the said Lords, to try their accusations, purgations and the truth thereof, and to
conclude therein, as they should think most expedient for the surety of Religion,
and redressing of disorders within the Realm, ordaining their determination to be
as valid and effectuall, as if the same had been concluded in Parliament or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.
It was likewise ordained that Mr. <hi>Robert Lindesay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Patrick Calloway,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Carmichael</hi> and <hi>Iohn Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>causon</hi>
should be admitted to the said conference if they should desire. And that
in the absence of any of the Estates nominated, such as were present should appoint
others at their pleasure. The Commissioners nominated having conveened at

                  <p>That the King for the publick peace of the Realm,<note place="margin">Conclusion taken, touching the Popish Lords.</note> and to remove all troubles and the
occasion thereof, after mature deliberation and conference kept with the Ministers, had
by the advice of the Commissioners elected by the Estates, declared, and by irrevocable
Edict ordained, That the true Religion established in the first year of his Majesties reign,
should be onely professed and exercised in all time coming within the Realm, and that
none should supply or resset any Iesuits Priests, and other adversaries of Religion under the
pains contained in the Acts of Parliament.</p>

think it difficile so to do, for any scruple of Conscience, that they should depart forth of the
Realm to such parts beyond Sea, as his Majesty should appoint, betwixt and the said day,
and not return till they were resolved to imbrace the truth and satisfie the Church, they

discharging the Iustice, Advocate and other Officers present and to come of all calling,
and proceeding against them and their heires therefore in time coming. But in case they
have sent, or after this time shall send any pledges forth of the Realm for fulfilling of
Conditions tending to the overthrow of Religion, in that case the said abolition should be

them.</p>
                  <p>That such of the said Earls and others as should resolve to obey his Highnesse Lawes in

                  <p>That the Earls of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Arroll</hi> should before the 1 of <hi>February</hi> remove out of

Religion and the State when they are abroad, and till their departing keep no intelligence
with any of that Sect.</p>
                  <p>That they should declare their choice of the two conditions before the 1 of <hi>January</hi> to
the King and Church, otherwise in case they doe not accept the same in manner, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the time above specified, they should injoy no benefit by vertue thereof, but should be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to triall and punishment of Law, as if the same had never been proponed nor offered
unto them.</p>
                  <p>That the Church should in the mean time call all suspected persons before them, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

that they may be punished; and that Masters and Landlords be holden to answer for
persons so suspected, as for other crimes.</p>
                  <p>These were the conclusions taken in this meeting by the Deputies of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and signed by the King and them, which likewise were to be subscribed by
the 3 Earls and their complices in token of their acceptation; what effect the same
took, we shall afterwards hear.</p>

                     </note> there fell out great troubles in the west marches, some
of the surname of <hi>Iohnston,</hi> having in the <hi>Iuly</hi> preceding made a great depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon thelands of <hi>Sanwhare</hi> and <hi>Drumlanrig,</hi> and killed eighteen persons that
followed for rescue of their goods; a Commission was given to the Lord <hi>Maxwell,</hi>
then Warden for pursuing the doers with all hostility. Not long before, a great
friendship had been contracted betwixt him and the Laird of <hi>Iohnston,</hi> and bonds
interchanged for assisting one another, which the Lord <hi>Sanwhare, Drumlanrig,</hi> and
others interessed by the <hi>Iohnstons</hi> feared should make him remisse in executing the
Commission, yet considering his disposition, and that he loved above all things to
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:50008:213"/>
be followed, they took advice to offer their services so as he would joyn with
them for suppressing the power of the <hi>Iohnstons. Maxwell</hi> thinking this to be a
good occasion for bringing all <hi>Niddisdale</hi> to depend upon him, embraced the offer;
whereupon a bond was formed, and subscribed by them and these others, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of their friendship. This bond being negligently kept, fell into the hands
of one <hi>Iohnston</hi> of <hi>Commertries</hi> who served the Lord <hi>Maxwell,</hi> and was by him car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the Laird <hi>Iohnston,</hi> who resolving to dissemble his knowledge of the Bond,
sent a Gentleman to learn of the Lord <hi>Maxwell</hi> himself, if any such friendship was
made up amongst them as was noysed in the Countrey. <hi>Maxwell</hi> at first denied
that there was any such thing, but having missed the Bond, and suspecting the same
to have fallen into <hi>Iohnstons</hi> hands, he excused the matter by the Commission that
was sent to him, saying, He must obey the King, and doe as he was directed.</p>
                  <p>

called <hi>Oliphant</hi> in <hi>Lochmaben</hi> to attend his coming to <hi>Annandale,</hi> resolved to
prevent him and cut them off, and so falling upon them unexpected, killed the
Captain and divers of the souldiers. Some fled to the Church thinking to save
themselves, but the same being set on fire,<note place="margin">

<hi>Annandale</hi> with displayed banner as the Kings Lieutenant, intending to rase the
houses of <hi>Lochwood</hi> and <hi>Lockerby. Iohnston</hi> not equalling his forces, kept aloof,
and after the Border fashion, sent forth some prickers to ride, and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.
Against them a number went out of <hi>Maxwells</hi> Army, who encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
with a great company were beaten and chased back to the stall or main host,
which by their breaking in was wholly disordered. <hi>Iohnston,</hi> that stood in a piece
of high ground, beholding the issue of the skirmish, took the advantage of their
confusion, and breaking upon them, without any resistance made, put them all
to flight.</p>

a Nobleman of great spirit, humane, curteous, and more learned then Noblemen
commonly are, but aspiring, and ambitious of Rule: his fall was pittied of many,

Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> his slaughter (that was the pretext) and with them did the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Ambassadour keep intelligence.</p>
                  <p>This being discovered to the King,<note place="margin">The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours dealing with <hi>Bothwell</hi> discovered.</note> one of his servants, who had been spied in
<hi>Bothwells</hi> company, was committed in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Being examined,
he confessed, that by direction of his Master he had spoken with <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Iohn Colvill,</hi> and that he believed they had some enterprise in hand, but what
it was he knew not. The King perceiving by his Confession, that the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
had a secret dealing with <hi>Bothwell,</hi> was greatly offended; yet because he
would not seem to infringe the priviledges of Ambassadors, after he had checkt
him with some sharp words, he dimitted his servant, and the Ambassador depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the King not vouchsafing him a farewell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bothwell</hi> in the mean time with the forces that he had gathered in the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,<note place="margin">The Roade of <hi>Leith.</hi>
                     </note>
being about 400 horsemen, or thereby, advanced and came to <hi>Leith</hi> the 2. of
<hi>April</hi> at 3 of the clock in the morning.<note place="margin">The King Commanded the people to Arm.</note> The King remained at the time in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
not well accompanied, yet hearing that <hi>Bothwell</hi> was come so high he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Citizens and those that were with him to arm. He himself going to
Church, made a speech at the end of the Sermon to the people, for the removing
the suspicions conceived of his favouring the Popish Lords: and recounting
<hi>Bothwells</hi> treacherous attempts, desired them to remember that he was their
King, to whom they owed all fidelity, and to consider in what case they themselves
should be, if <hi>Bothwell</hi> with his Borderers, men given to theft and robbery, should
get the upper hand. The hearers moved with his speeches, shewed great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse,
and went incontinent to armes. The Lord <hi>Hume</hi> was commanded to
take the fields, and lead the horsemen that were in town; The King stayed with
the foot, and before them marched the Canon, which was brought forth of the
Castle, and making directly towards <hi>Leith.</hi>
                  </p>

he could not equall them in number, he removed from <hi>Leith,</hi> and dividing his
men in three troops, took the way by <hi>Restalrig</hi> towards <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> The Lord <hi>Hume</hi>
with the horsemen followed to observe what course he held, and the King with
the foot removing to the other side of the town made his stand in the field, called
the <hi>Borrow moore.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Conflict betwixt <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and <hi>Hume.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Hume</hi> with his company being advanced so far as <hi>Muddry</hi>
edge, <hi>Bothwell</hi> turned upon him, and being far superiour in horsemen, gave him
the chase, which they that stood by the King perceiving, advised him to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the town, but he refusing to stir, answered, <hi>That he would never quit the fields to
a Traytor:</hi> yet the danger was great, and in the opinion of many, if <hi>Bothwell</hi> had
taken his course directly to the King, and not pursued the chase so hotly, he might
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:50008:214"/>
have carried the day; but in following, it happened his horse to stumble and fall
to the ground, and he bruised with the fall was forced to retire. That night he
went to <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and on the morrow dissolved all his troops, which when <hi>Atholl</hi>
heard, he also went back into his Countrey. The <hi>Fiffe</hi> Captains with their soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
arriving at <hi>Leith</hi> about midnight, when they understood how things had passed
turned saile, and went sundry wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This purpose so defeated,</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>the King sent the Lord</hi> Colvill <hi>and M.</hi> Edward Bruce
<hi>to the Queen of</hi> England <hi>to complain of the misdemeanor of her Ambassador, and
the resset that</hi> Bothwell <hi>found in her kingdome: In his letter to the Queen using
a round plainness, he said,</hi> That although it had pleased her to commend the Ambassador
she had imployed,<note place="margin">The Kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> for a wise, religious and honest man; yet he had in his opinion been
fitter to carry the message of an Herauld, then a friendly Commission betwixt two neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Princes. That he had seen nothing in him but pride, and wilfulness, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
denying to give him any answer, he chused to send the same by his own messengers;
whom he desired her to credit as himself in all that they had in charge to deliver. <hi>For</hi> Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
<hi>he said,</hi> That he wondred how notwithstanding of the many solemn promises made as
well by her Ambassadors, as by letters of her own hand, that he should have no harbor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her Countrey, yet was he not only resset by her people, but suffered to reside in some of her
proper houses, and had received a good summe of English monie, wherewith he waged both
<hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English</hi> in this late treacherous attempt. To think this was by her direction or
privity he would not, so farre it was against all princely honour; on the other part, that
she being so wise, and prudent a Prince, and having so long, and so happily governed her
kingdoms, should be so slighted and contemned by a number of her subjects, as that such
things should be done without her knowledge, it could hardly be believed; wherefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it to her self to solve these doubts, he would onely remember her of the promise made at
the delivery of <hi>Ororick</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> rebell, and desire her not to put him in ballance with such
a traiterous counterpoise, lest he should be constrained to say with the Poet, <hi>Flectere si ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queo

                  </p>
                  <p>This was the substance of the letter,<note place="margin">The Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion given to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</note> the credit committed to them was to assure
the Queen, <q>That seeing the Popish Lords had not imbraced the conditions

confiscate their lands; and to crave of her, as one whom that cause equally touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
a supply of moneys, till either they were expulsed the Realm, or their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

                  </p>
                  <p>The Queen excusing the oversight given to <hi>Bothwell</hi> by the slow pursuit of the
Popish Lords,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> and the favour shewed to them, promised that from thenceforth he

King should lack no supply that was in her power to give.<note place="margin">The Queen dischargeth <hi>Bothwell</hi> his resset in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> With this answer did
Mr. <hi>Edward Bruce</hi> return, for the Lord <hi>Colvill</hi> went from that into <hi>France</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
the victorious and happy successe of the <hi>French</hi> King against those of the
League, and invite him to assist the Baptisme of the Prince, which was to be in

                  <p>The Queen of <hi>England</hi> immediately upon the Ambassadours return,<note place="margin">An Assembly of the Church.</note> by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
in all the Borders did inhibit the resset and harbouring of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and
the aiding of him in any sort; which the king did so kindly accept, as rendring her
many thanks for the same, he did therewith intreat her to assist the Baptisme of the

                  <p>The Parliament being in the mean time indicted to the 27. of <hi>May,</hi> the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Church conveened at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the seventh of the same moneth, where
the Excommunication of the Popish Lords was ratified and ordained to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in all the Churches of the Kingdome. The King did reside then at <hi>Striveling;</hi>
and thither were Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Patrick Simson,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Iames Melvill,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Nicholson</hi> directed by the Assembly to represent the
dangers wherein his Majesties Person, Crown and Liberty of the Countrey
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:50008:215"/>
stood, and to propone such remedies as in their judgement were fittest for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the same.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Both the one and the other were conceived in this form;</head>
                     <p>The perills which oft before were threatned by the pernicious practices of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,<note place="margin">Petitions dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Church to the King.</note>
and the malicious, unnaturall and treasonable conspiracies of the Earl of <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
Arroll</hi> and <hi>Angus</hi> and their complices, in betraying their native Countrey to the
cruell and mercilesse <hi>Spaniard,</hi> are no lesse urgent, and now more to be feared, then
when the danger seemed to be greatest, as may appear by the reasons following.</p>
                     <p>1. It is certain that the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance of the perills threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> who with so great preparations in the year
1588. enterprised the Conquest of the whole Isle, retaineth the same inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wanting an occasion onely to accomplish his promise, as is manifest by
the intelligence he hath kept with the Popish Lords, ever since the disputation of
that Navie.</p>
                     <p>2. The open rebellion of the said Lords, at the bridge of <hi>De Falkland, &amp;c.</hi> with
their continuance in the like treasonable attempts, notwithstanding his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
clemency in pardoning the same, doth evidence their obstinacy in prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the same conspiracies.</p>
                     <p>3. Whereas the Church hath not ceased at all occasions to lay open these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and humbly intreated that some remedy should be provided, nothing hath
been obtained: to the emboldening of the enemies in their practices and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
                     <p>4. Notwithstanding, that it was enacted in Councell, that none should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to request for the said Popish Lords, under the pain of losing their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Offices, yet none are in such credit as their favourers, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their promises labour still to procure them oversight and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
                     <p>5. The Masses openly celebrated in the house of <hi>Balgawy</hi> pertaining to Mr.
<hi>Walter Lindesay,</hi> the house of <hi>Birnes</hi> appertaining to the young Laird of <hi>Bony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
the houses of <hi>Douglas, Strathbolgy, Logyamont</hi> and <hi>Slams</hi> pertaining to the said
Earles, do shew, that either they think themselves assured of favour in the Court,
or of such assistance in the Countrey, as may maintain their cause, or then that they
are perswaded to be supplyed by strangers.</p>
                     <p>6. The Act of oblivion offered to them, with the great discontent of all good
subjects, would not have been rejected, except they had looked for greater favour
and better conditions.</p>
                     <p>7. The disobedience they have shewed in entering to their wards when they
were charged, doth prove that they think themselves assured of the aid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of others.</p>
                     <p>8. The arriving of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Bark lately at <hi>Montrosse</hi> declareth, that they have
some practice to be put in execution presently, if the same shall not be timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                     <p>9. The open conventions they keep since the arriving of the said Bark, do
shew that they esteem their plots so substantially laid, as they regard not what can
be done for resisting the same.</p>
                     <p>10. The diligence they use in preparing, and putting their friends and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in armes, specially in the North parts, is an argument of some interprise they
go about.</p>
                     <p>11. And last, whereas his Majesty and Estates did upon the first discovery of
their plots and practices, apprehend a great danger to Religion; the Kings Estate,
and liberty of the Countrey; notwithstanding, that the cause is not removed,
there is no care taken to withstand their courses, which declareth that there is either
a purpose to cover, extenuate and bear forth their wickednesse, or that the Lord
hath in his judgement blinded and hardened the hearts of all Estates, that while the
danger is greatest, they can neither see, nor apprehend the same.</p>

                     <head>The remedies of the foresaid dangers were proponed,
as followeth:</head>
                     <p>1. That the Parliament indicted to the 27.<note place="margin">The remedies of the dangers.</note> of the same moneth should not be
prorogated, but the time thereof precisely kept, and the Popish Lords forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and to that effect, the Advocate sufficiently instructed for maintaining the
relievancy of the summons and probation in due time provided.</p>
                     <p>2. That none suspected in Religion be chosen upon the Articles.</p>
                     <p>3. That after the forfeiture, they be pursued with all extremity, their Lands
and Rents annexed to the Crown, and no part thereof disponed in favours of the
persons forfeited.</p>
                     <p>4. That the Guard be imployed for apprehending Mr. <hi>Walter Lindesay,</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of <hi>New-Abbey, Iames Wood</hi> of <hi>Bonyton</hi> younger, Mr. <hi>George Ker</hi> (who had
made an escape out of the Castle the year before) Mr. <hi>Alexander Lesley, Thomas
Tyrie</hi> and other Traffiquers and Jesuits.</p>
                     <p>5. That the houses of the Rebells be possessed, and their livings intrometted
with, to his Majesties use.</p>
                     <p>6. That all persons be inhibited to resset, supply or entertain any intelligence
with the said Lords, especially their vassals and dependers, and that none under
whatsoever pretext contravene the same.</p>
                     <p>7. That the subjects be charged to put themselves in armes by all good means,
and be in readinesse to pursue and defend, as they shall be warned by his Majesty,
or otherwise upon urgent occasions.</p>
                     <p>8. That the Bark arrived at <hi>Montrosse</hi> be apprehended, and the persons that
were within her, with such others as have had any dealing with them, and that they
be examined diligently for the discovery of the practice they have presently in
hand.</p>
                     <p>Somewhat was adjected concerning the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Hume</hi> reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Church.</note> but he compeiring in the
same Assembly, gave satisfaction to the Church, and was absolved from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Excommunication. All the remedies the King allowed, promising how
soon the forfeiture was past, to follow forth the same: Onely at the 7. he tooke

                           </gap>ccasions,</hi> for he had not as yet forgotten the stirs of the year preceding; and
would have none to arm but upon his own warrant.</p>
                     <p>Withall he sent Sir <hi>Robert Melvill,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Instructions sent from the King to the Church and Assembly.</note> and <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> of North <hi>Berwick</hi> with
certain instructions to the Assembly; whereof one was, <hi>That they should inhibit
the Ministers to utter any irreverent speeches in Pulpit against his Majesties person,
Councell or Estate, under pain of deprivation:</hi> and because one of their number cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Iohn Rosse,</hi> had in a Sermon preached before the Synod of <hi>Perth,</hi> uttered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
treasonable and irreverent speeches of his Majesty, it was craved that they
should censure him as his fault had deserved. Another was, <hi>That they should excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
Mr.</hi> Andrew Hunter, <hi>for the scandall he had brought upon their profession, he
being the first open Traitor of their function against a Christian King of their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and their naturall Soveraign.</hi> A third instruction was, <hi>That by Act of Assembly
Ministers should be ordained to disswade both by publick and private exhortation, their
flocks from concurring with</hi> Bothwell <hi>in his treasonable attempts, or any other that
should make insurrection against the authority established by God in his Majesties person.</hi>
The last was assented unto and an Act made thereof, but the censure of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Rosse</hi> was carried more slightly, and he onely admonished to speak in time
coming so reverently and discreetly of his Majesty, as there might be no just cause
of complaint against him. <hi>Hunter</hi> was deposed from the Ministery, as a desertor of
his flock, and one suspected to have joyned himself with the Kings rebells, but the
excommunication was not pronounced.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament did hold at the time appointed,<note place="margin">A Parliament wherein the Lords are forfeited.</note> yet because the Noblemen
convened slowly, 3 or 4. dayes were spent without doing any thing. In end when
by the excuses that divers made a greater number was not expected, they that
were present assembled in the Parliament house, and keeping the form accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:50008:216"/>
made choice of a number for the Articles of Noblemen, there were three Earls,
and six Lords onely present. Beginning was made at the summons of forfeiture,
the Letters and blanks intercepted with Mr. <hi>George Ker</hi> presented, and the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writs
cognosced by witnesses. Some question there was about the Blancks, and that
which should have been insert in them, but the presumptions were so clear, as none
would doubt what the subject should have been. Yet the Noblemen urged a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
of the triall to a more full convention: which the King would not admit,
knowing what misinterpretings that would make, and so by pluralities of voices,
the crimes of Treason were found to be sufficiently proved, and the sentence of
forfeiture pronounced against the three Earls, and <hi>Achindown;</hi> their Scutcheons of
Arms (as the manner is) torn by Herauld, and they declared to have lost their
honours, lands and estates for treasonable practises against the King, and their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Countrey.</p>
                     <p>In this Parliament divers Statutes were concluded, some in favours of the
Church, and others very beneficiall to the Countrey, as the Stature made for
punishment of theft, robbery, and oppression; another against usury, and a third
against buying of Pleas by Judges and other members of the Court of Justice.</p>
                     <p>The next moneth passed in receiving the Ambassadors that came to assist the
Baptisme, which in the latter end of <hi>August</hi> next was performed with great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
from <hi>England</hi> the Earl of <hi>Sussex</hi> was sent; the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Brunswick, Megelbrugh,</hi> with the Estates of the united Provinces, had
their Ambassadours present. But from the <hi>French</hi> King there came not any,
though they also were expected at the day appointed for the solemnity. The
Prince was brought from his own chamber to the Queens Chamber of presence,
and laid in a bed dressed in a most stately form; the Ambassadours entered into the
Chamber, the Countess of <hi>Marre</hi> accompanied with a number of Ladies took up
the Prince, and delivered him to the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who presented him to the
Ambassadors. <hi>Sussex</hi> as having the first place received him, and carried him in his
arms to the Chappell, the rest marching in their ranks, and followed by the Ladies
of honour, the Mistresse nurse, and others of inferiour note. Before them went the
Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> carrying the Ducall Crown, the Lord <hi>Levingston</hi> carried the Towell
or Napkin, the Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> the Bason, and the Lord <hi>Semple</hi> the Laver. Above
the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour there was a Pale or Canabie born by the Laird of <hi>Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
Buclerogh, Duddope</hi> and <hi>Traquier.</hi> The Princes train was sustained by the
Lords <hi>Sinclar</hi> and <hi>Urqhart.</hi> In this manner they walked toward the Chappell, a
guard of the youths of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> well arrayed, standing on each side of the way,
and the trumpets sounding.</p>
                     <p>Being entred the Chappell, the King arose from his seat, and received the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
at the doore of the Quire, and then was the Prince delivered to the
Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who gave him to the Nurse: After which the Ambassadours
were conveyed to their places, which were ordered in this manner: Upon the
Kings right hand a chair was set for the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour, but this was empty;
next to him the Ambassadour of <hi>Denmark</hi> was placed; on the left the <hi>English</hi>
Ambassadour and Legier did fit, and next after them the Ambassadours of <hi>Bruns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,
Megelburgh,</hi> and the States; every chair had a tassell boord covered with fine
Velvet, and the Ambassadour of <hi>England</hi> besides the others had office men stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by him to wait.</p>
                     <p>The Service did then begin, and upon the end thereof, the <hi>English</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
arose and presented the Prince to the Bishop, who was appointed to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Sacrament. This was Mr. <hi>David Cunningham</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdene.</hi> The
action finished, Mr. <hi>David Lindsey</hi> Minister at <hi>Leith,</hi> had a learned speech in <hi>French</hi>
to the Ambassadours. After which they returned to the Chappell in the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that they came. Then was the Prince laid upon a bed of honour, and his Titles
in this sort proclaimed by the Lyon Herauld, <hi>Henry Frederick Knight and Baron
of</hi> Renfrew, <hi>Lord of the Isles, Earl of Karrick, Duke of</hi> Rothsay, <hi>Prince and</hi> Stewart <hi>of</hi>
Scotland: This done, certain pieces of silver and gold were cast forth at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
among the people, and a number of Knights created at night (for it was in
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:50008:216"/>
the afternoon that the Baptisme was ministred) The Ambassadours with their
train, and the Noblemen present were royally feasted, nothing lacking that was
required to such a triumph. The rest of the moneth was spent in Playes, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at Tilt, and such other exercises as might give delight to the strangers.</p>
                     <p>Amidst these joyes the King was not forgetting his own serious affairs, sent his
Secretary Sir <hi>Richard Cockborne</hi> of <hi>Clerkinton</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> to desire the Queens assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in pursuing the Popish Lords according to the many promises made by the
Lord <hi>Souche</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> that how soon he should enter into action against them
she would have an honourable consideration of him and his burthens. And that
now the sentence of forfeiture being pronounced, it concerned him both in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and safety not to permit their longer stay in the Realm. For the support desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and quantity thereof, he was commanded to follow the instructions given to
Sir <hi>Robert Melvill</hi> in his last Ambassage, and was injoyned to complain of one Mr.
<hi>Lock</hi> his intertainment in the Court, who professed himself an Agent for <hi>Bothwell;</hi>
as likewise of Mr. <hi>Iohn Colvill</hi> his publick residence in <hi>Twedmouth.</hi> In the last
points he received satisfaction; and shortly after, Mr. <hi>Iohn Colwill</hi> wearied of
<hi>Bothwells</hi> courses, by mediation of friends obtained his pardon: But for the matter
of moneys, divers shifts and excuses were made; onely some part of the money
was advanced, which was due otherwise to the King.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> the Ambassadours were dimitted with many
thanks, nor were they sooner gone, then a new conspiracy was detected. <hi>Bothwell</hi>
having joyned himself with the Popish Lords, and received a part of the forain
gold sent to them, did undertake to raise such perturbations in the South parts, as
the King should be compelled to relinquish the expedition he intended to the
North; and if he could apprehend his person to carry him to <hi>Blacknesse,</hi> (the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
whereof he had <unclear>corrupted</unclear>) and there detain him captive, till they might come
and make their own conditions.</p>
                     <p>This enterprise was concluded in an hostlary at the Church of <hi>Memmure</hi> in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust;</hi>
where <hi>Huntley, Arroll, Angus, Bothwell, Achindown</hi> and divers others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
and subscribed a Bond, which was given in custody to Sir <hi>Iames Scot</hi> of
<hi>Balwery.</hi> By the apprehension of Mr. <hi>Allan Orme</hi> servant to <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and some
papers that were found with him, the whole purpose was discovered; which the
King caused to be published, that people might see what trust was to be given to
<hi>Bothwells</hi> religion.</p>
                     <p>This Gentlemans case at his dying was greatly pitied and much intreaty made
aswell for him, as for <hi>Iames Cockram</hi> keeper of <hi>Blacknesse:</hi> but the clemency shewed
in former times to the followers of <hi>Bothwell</hi> was judged so hurtfull, as the King
against his nature was compelled to use rigour. Thus the two Gentlemen were
condemned, and executed in the publick street of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the beginning of
<hi>October.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Immediately after, the Parliament upon intelligence had arrived in the Barque at
<hi>Montrosse,</hi> and brought with them some gold for supply of the Popish Lords,
Commission was given to the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> and <hi>Atholl,</hi> the Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> and a
number of Barons to go and expulse them forth of the Countrey. But <hi>Argile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
young, and the rest declining the imployment till his forces or he himself
should take the fields, nothing was done. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Robert Bruse</hi> taking
with him Mr. <hi>Iames Balfour</hi> made a journey to <hi>Argile,</hi> and partly upon promises
of recompence from the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> partly upon hopes given that the lands
of the Rebels should be at his bestowing, perswaded the Earl to undertake the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
So gathering his forces he set forward about the end of <hi>September,</hi> and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
through the mountains came to <hi>Badenoch</hi> the 27. of that moneth, where
he laid siege to the Castle of <hi>Ruthven,</hi> but this was by the <hi>Clampherson</hi> so strongly
defended as he was forcedto leave the siege &amp; turn unto the Low-lands for joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Lord <hi>Forbes,</hi> the Lairds of <hi>Balqhain, Drum,</hi> and <hi>Mackenze,</hi> who were
all preparing to meet him.</p>
                     <p>In his own company was the Lairds of <hi>Tillibarden, Grant, Macklain, Mackintosh,
Clangregory,</hi> and <hi>Mackneill</hi> of <hi>Baray</hi> with their friends and followers, reckoned in
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:50008:217"/>
whole to 10000. and above. <hi>Huntley</hi> advertised of his coming did resolve to fight
him before his joyning with <hi>Forbes</hi> and those of the Inland, and was thereunto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by the Earl of <hi>Arroll,</hi> who brought with him a small number of five or
six score at most, but resolute Gentlemen all. They of <hi>Huntleys</hi> part were thought
not to exceed 900. With this small number did he adventure, marching the first
day from <hi>Strathbolgie</hi> to <hi>Achindowne,</hi> where he encamped the second of <hi>October,</hi>
Captain <hi>Ker</hi> that had served him many years, a man of good experience, being
sent the next morning to try what way <hi>Argile</hi> took, did quickly return, and shew
that the enemy was at hand. The two Earls hereupon diving their forces, <hi>Arrol</hi>
tooke the leading of the Vantguard wherein were 300. the rest abode with <hi>Huntley</hi>
and made the battell.</p>
                     <p>How soon the forces came in sight one of another, <hi>Argile</hi> was somewhat troubled,
for he was made to believe he should see no enemy, yet trusting to his numbers he
command <hi>Macklain</hi> who had the leading of his Vant to advance, he himself keeping
the advantage of the ground, made the army stay on the side of a hill which was
full of moss and bogs. <hi>Huntley</hi> he carried with him certain Field peeces wherewith
he plaid upon them in his approach, and therewith put them in great confusion, for
the Highlanders casting themselves on the ground, as their custome is, could hardly
be raised so long as they heard the noise of the Ordinance. <hi>Arroll</hi> perceiving this
made to give the charge, but by reason of the steep ascent he was driven to make a
little compass turning his side to the adversaries, who by that time were got on foot
and resuming a new courage did rain upon <hi>Arroll</hi> and his men in their passing
such a shower of darts and arrows, that as they affirmed who were present, for the
space of a quarter of an hour the light of day was palpably eclipsed. <hi>Achindown</hi> was at
this time killed and <hi>Arroll</hi> dangerously wounded in his arme and and leg, many had
their horses killed, and were compelled to take them to their feet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Macklain</hi> whose number were greater environing <hi>Arroll</hi> and his company held
them so engaged betwixt himself and <hi>Argile,</hi> as they had been all cut in pieces if
<hi>Huntley</hi> had not with speed come to their relief. But he perceived the danger and
charged with such fury as the Vant and many of both Armies being joyned they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a cruell fight, which continued almost two hours; in the end <hi>Argiles</hi> men
were disordered and put to rout, the Earl himself laboured all he could to rally them
again together, but it would not be, so amazed they were as without once looking
back down they went to the other side of the hill with all the speed they could make.
<hi>Macklain</hi> with a few Isles men stood long unto it after the rest were gone, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in good order with the smal company he had; <hi>Huntley</hi> persued the chace to the
foot of the hill, though the steepness of it be such that a man can scarce walk down it
on foot, but the eagerness made all dangers forgotten: There in a little burn or brook
called <hi>Alwhaunachy</hi> he had his horse killed, and before he could be again moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the enemy was gone to another hill whereas horsemen could not follow, and so
the chace ceased. In this conflict <hi>Argile</hi> lost two cousens, <hi>Archibald Campbell</hi> of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinzell,</hi>
his brother <hi>Iames Campbell, Mackneill Baray</hi> and about 700 common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>souldiers,
on <hi>Huntleys</hi> part besides his uncle <hi>Achindown</hi> 12 only were killed, but
many were hurt and wounded.</p>
                     <p>This fight happened on Thursday the 3 of <hi>October</hi> 1594, and is called by the
Countrey people <hi>the battell of <unclear>Glenlivat</unclear>,</hi> albeit it was fought on a hill three quarters
of a mile distant. The victory fell happily on <hi>Huntleys</hi> side for the Countrey people,
who should otherwise been miserably spoiled, if <hi>Argile</hi> with his forces had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> with the Lairds of <hi>Bughan</hi> and <hi>Drumchat</hi> were advancing to
assist <hi>Argile;</hi> upon advertisement of his defeat and that he was turned back, made
after him, thinking to perswade him return. But by the way a gentleman of the
name of <hi>Irwyn</hi> being killed by the shot of a Pistol in the dark of the night there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
such a distrust and jealousie amongst them, none knowing who was the doer,
as presently they separated and went home.</p>
                     <p>The King had the news of <hi>Argiles</hi> defeat brought him to <hi>Dundee,</hi> which made
him hasten his journey to the North. The 16 of <hi>October</hi> he came to <hi>Aberdene,</hi> where
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:50008:217"/>
councell was taken for demolishing the houses of <hi>Strathbolgy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An. 1595.</note> 
                        <hi>Slains</hi> and <hi>Newton.</hi> In
this service the Earl of <hi>Marshall</hi> was imployed, having some Companies of horse
and foot allowed him till the same was accomplished.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Arroll</hi> during that time did lurke in <hi>Sutherland,</hi> thinking how soon
the King returned Southto come back into their Countreys; but the Duke of <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi>
being left Lieutenant in those parts by the counsell and assistance of those that
were appointed to attend him, put them to such extremity as they made offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
forth of the Realm, and laid surety neither to return without his Majesties li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
nor to practise against Religion and the State whilest they stayed abroad. It
was debated a while, whether or not such a capitulation might stand with the Kings
honour, and his Majesty being thereupon consulted in regard of the many difficulties
that pressed him in the time, and that it made for the quietness of the kingdome to
have them put away, the surety offered was accepted; which done, the Duke of
<hi>Lennox</hi> having stayed in those parts three moneths returned about the third of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi>
to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bothwell</hi> now was in miserable plight being hated of the Queen of <hi>England</hi> for his
combining with the Popish Lords, Excommunicated by the Church and forsaken
of his fellowes, especially M. <hi>Iohn Colvell,</hi> who had followed him in all his troubles,
and knew the places of his resset; for he had made his peace, and (as the rumor went)
betrayed <hi>Hercules Stewart Bothwells</hi> brother, who the same time was executed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
in the street of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> These things did so increase his fears, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whom to trust he stole away privately to <hi>France.</hi> The King hearing that he was
gone and had taken land at <hi>New haven</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> sent a Gentleman to the <hi>French</hi>
King to demand him as one who was declared a traitor: and if that was denyed, to
desire that he might be banished <hi>France.</hi> The answer of the <hi>French</hi> King was, <hi>That
he should give him no Countenance; but since he had taken his refuge thither, he could not
but suffer him enjoy the free ayre of his Countrey.</hi> Some moneths he remained there,
till either wearied of the bad entertainment he found; or, as it was said, for chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
a Gentleman to combate against the Kings edict, he was forced to quit
those partes and fly into <hi>Spain;</hi> from thence he went to <hi>Naples,</hi> where he lived in a
poor estate unto his death, which happened some years after the King his going into
<hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How soon <hi>Bothwell</hi> was gone,<note place="margin">The bond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Lords and <hi>Balwery</hi> exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</note> all his followers did sue for pardon: Sr. <hi>Iames Scot</hi>
of <hi>Balwery</hi> offering to exhibite the bond made at the Church of <hi>Menmore</hi> betwixt
<hi>Bothwell</hi> and the Popish Lords, which he had in custodie, was brought before the
Councell, and having produced the same, laid open all their plots. By his deposition
it appeared that Sir <hi>Iames Duglas</hi> of <hi>Spot</hi> was the principal worker of that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Whereupon the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were called,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iames Duglas</hi> of <hi>Spot</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</note> and the bonds shewed
unto them bearing a mutuall concurrence in all things, Religion not excepted.
Whereupon they were desired to pronounce <hi>Spot</hi> excommunicated as one that had
made defection from the truth, and was otherwise suspected of haynous crimes; but
they excusing themselves, the Commissioners of the generall Assembly were called
to meet at <hi>Striveling,</hi> who after some debating, the sentence was pronounced against
him. <hi>Balwery</hi> after a few days imprisoned, was set at liberty and remitted, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prospered after that time, and ruined his house utterly, for an ensample to all that
will be medling with factious and seditious Rebells.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The year following an Assembly of the Church was kept at</hi> Montrose <hi>in the
moneth of</hi> Iune,<note place="margin">An. 1695.</note>
                        <note place="margin">An assembly of the Church at <hi>Montrose.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>where the Commissioners for the King did urge these Articles.
First,</hi> Whosoever did medle or practise in any treasonable enterprise against his Majesties
person and estate being found and declared culpable by law, they should likewise incurre the
sentence of Excommunication,<note place="margin">Articles sent from the King to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> that so there might be an inseparable union betwixt the two
swords. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that no Excommunication, should be pronounced at the appetite of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men, but that a sufficient number of the Church should be first Assembled, and the
same determined by publick consent. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That none should be Excommunicated, for
civill causes, crimes of light importance, or particular wrongs of Ministers, lest the censure
should fall into contempt and become like the Popes cursing. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That no summare
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:50008:218"/>
Excommunication should be thenceforth used,<note place="margin">An. 1595.</note> but that lawfull citation of parties should go
before in all causes whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>To the first the Assembly agreed with the clause <hi>Legitimâ cognitione Ecclesiasticâ
praeeunte.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Assemblies answer.</note> To the second they likewise condescended. But to the third and fourth
they answered, that those being points of great weight and craving a mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
could not on the sudden be determined; and so continued the resolution
thereof to the next Assembly, discharging in the mean time any summary Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
to be used, with this exception, <hi>Nisi salus ecclesiae periclitetur.</hi> The exception
displeased the King, for he thought it would serve the turbulent sort for a colour to
all their proceedings.</p>
                     <p>But there fell out in the mean time a business which made all these things be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.<note place="margin">The Queen seeketh to have the Prince in custody.</note>
The Queen moved by some that envied the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> his credit, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to have the Prince her son in her own custody and had drawn the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
and divers of the Councell to promise their assistance. Advertisement given
of this to the King, who was then at <hi>Falkland,</hi> he came to the Queen at <hi>Halyrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi>
and inhibiting any of the Councell to come towards him till he should call
them, dealt so with the Queen that he diverted her from that course, and made her

of my own mouth being in the company of those I like otherwise for any charge or necessity
that can come from me you shall not deliver him. And in case God call me at any time see
that neither for the Queen nor Estates their pleasure you deliver him till he be 18 years of
age, and that he command you himself.</hi> Striveling <hi>the 24 of</hi> July 1595. This war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
as it shewed the Kings displeasure at those that had combined in the plots, so it
declared the great trust he put in the Nobleman.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Shortly after the Chancellor taking to heart the Kings offence contracted a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
sickness at his house of</hi> Lawder,<note place="margin">The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor contracteth sickness and dieth.</note> 
                        <hi>and sending his Cousen the secretary to the King
who remained then at</hi> Hamilton, <hi>did by him excuse the dealing in that matter, and
with a solemn protestation of his fidelity in all his Majesties services, seriously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his Lady, children and friends, now that he was to end his life, to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
protection. The King was much troubled with the news, and wrote unto him
with his own hand the letter following.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Kings letter to the Chancellor.</note> Chancellor, how sorry I am of these newes I
leave it to your self to judge, I was never a dissembler of my affections. And yet I trust that
God will not spoil me of you so untimely; Therefore will pray you, so farre as you may, with
a valiant heart resist the assaults of your sickness, hoping in the goodness of my fortune that
God will reserve you yet to me as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was to his people, for the necessity between
Prince and subject is reciproque, nor can any sickness how heavy soever it be take away the
life, if God cut not the threads thereof. As to your suits, if God calls you, I need no remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:
for since I made you a pattern of my constant favour during your life (as your
self hath oft time said) I am much more bound of Princely duty to make your wife and
posteritie that bears your image a vive representation of my thankfull memory. And
to comfort you in this, remember what I have done to the Duke, and my Lady <hi>Huntley,</hi>
for their fathers sake. This may assure you that in case of the worst (which God forbid) your
thoughts shall be prevented herein by my thankfull behaviour to them; and for your cousin
the Secretary, he shall be the better at my hand in losing you. But I green to hear better
newes: And if time and distance of place could have permitted me in any way, I should
not have spared to have carried my own message my self. God send you your health, and keep
you to me, and to your Native Countrey.</p>
                     <p>This shewed in what account the King held him!<note place="margin">The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</note> and in truth he deserved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lesse; for he was a man of rare parts, and of a deep wit, learned, full of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and most faithfull to his King and Master. In that last businesse which the
Queen went about of taking the Prince from the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> he was consenting;
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:50008:218"/>
(for the two Noble men had their private emulations, but it was ever with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of his Majesties pleasure.) No man did ever carry himself in his place
more wisely, nor sustain it more courageously against his enemies then he did. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
visited in his sicknesse by Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> and the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he
expressed a great contempt of the world, and of the vanities of it, lamenting that
he had not done the good which he would and might have done in his place, being
impeded as he said by the malice of his adversaries, who were ever plotting his
death and ruine. Two moneths he continued under that languishing sicknesse, and
ended his dayes most happily the 3. of <hi>October,</hi> 1595. The King did greatly lament
his death, and honoured him with this Epitaph.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>Others for all this spared not to expresse their malice in Libells and Rythmes
after his death; some whereof were cast in the Kings Chamber at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> and
other places: but as the Authours were not known, so were the Rythmes despised

                     <p>This year was by the vulgar people reckoned among the ill years,<note place="margin">Great death of Corns, and great bloodshed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> because of
the dearth and scarcity of Corns, which the aboundance of winds in the Harvest
time had caused, yet for the bloodshed and slaughters committed in all quarters of
the Countrey was it more justly to be so accounted; For in the South parts the
<hi>Iohnstons</hi> and <hi>Maxwells</hi> had a bloody conflict, wherein divers were killed; the
greatest losse falling upon the <hi>Maxwells</hi> that went from the West parts besides
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> to assist their friends in the South.</p>
                     <p>In the Isles and Highlands were likewise great troubles: nor was the Incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
more quiet, bloods and slaughters dayly falling out in every place. Among
which none was more odious then the slaughter of <hi>David Forrester</hi> Citizen of
<hi>Striveling,</hi>

his life. The Lairds of <hi>Arth</hi> and <hi>Dunnypearce,</hi> were thought to have hounded out
the committers upon a spleen conceived against the Gentleman for the credit he
had with his Master the Earl of <hi>Marre:</hi> for no other quarrell could be pretended.
The Nobleman taking this greatly to heart, caused to bring the body of his servant
to <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> (for he was killed nigh to <hi>Linlithgow</hi>) &amp; with his whole friendship
conveyed the same to <hi>Striveling</hi> there to be interred, carying along the portraite
of the dead with the wounds he had received in a white sheet, to move the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to a great detestation of the fact. The Corps buried, &amp; the Earl following the
course of Law, the Lords <hi>Levingston</hi> and <hi>Elphingston</hi> did partie the Committers.
And though the King by his Proclamation did prohibit the assisting either of the
pursuit or defenders, commanding Justice to be done, nothing could take effect in
that troublesome time; so powerfull was the combination of parties. But that
which by the ordinary way of Justice could not as then be required, we have since
visibly punished in the fall and ruine of those Families, for a lesson to all men to
fly and abhorre the shedding of innocent blood.</p>

did grudge exceedingly,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners possesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with offices of Estate.</note> that all occasion to do good to themselves or
their friends was this way cut off. Nor was it long before these Commissioners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
extremely disliked, partly for their strict dealing with the subjects,
and partly for drawing all the offices into their own hands. Beginning was
made at M. <hi>David Magill</hi> Advocate, whom they pressed to dimit and resigne his
office by reason of his age and imbecillitie as they pretended, and when by no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
he could be moved unto it, they did associate with him in office M. <hi>Thomas
Hamilton</hi> one of their own number; which bred him such a grief, as shortly after he
ended his days. Next they fell upon the Master of <hi>Glamys</hi> Treasurer and his deputy
Sir <hi>Robert Melvill,</hi> and by examining their accompts found them liable in such sums
to the King, as to obtain a <hi>Quietus est</hi> they were glad to resigne the Treasurer, which
was bestowed on the Prior of <hi>Blantyre:</hi> Then did they labour the Secretary Sir
<hi>Richard Cockborne</hi> to resigne his place, and exchange it with the office of Privie Seal,
which <hi>Blantyre</hi> had dimitted in favour of Mr. <hi>Iohn Lindesey.</hi> This was easily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
the gentlemen not liking to contend or fall in question with them. The
office of the Collectorie, resigned by the Provost of <hi>Linclowden,</hi> was given to Mr.
<hi>Iames Elphinston.</hi> The President they intended to make Chancellor; but to this
the King would not condescend, knowing how he stood affected in Religion, and
that his preferment to that chief place would open the mouths of the Ministers,
and raise a clamour in the Countrey. These proceedings did work them much
hatred, and (as is the lot of those that rule in Estates) whatsoever was amisse, they
carried the blame albeit in many things they were innocent.</p>
                     <p>The next year begun with a trouble in the borders,<note place="margin">An. 1596.</note> which was like to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the peace betwixt the two Realms, and arose upon this occasion: The Lord
<hi>Scroope</hi> being then Warden of the West-Marches of <hi>England;</hi> and the Laird of
<hi>Baclugh</hi> having the charge of <hi>Liddisdale,</hi> they sent their Deputies to keep a day of
Truce for redresse of some ordinary matters. The place of meeting was at the
<hi>Dayholme</hi> of <hi>Kershop,</hi> where a small Brook divideth <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>Liddisdale</hi> from <hi>Bewcastle.</hi> There met as Deputie for the Laird of <hi>Baclugh, Robert
Scott</hi> of <hi>Hayninge;</hi> and for the Lord <hi>Scroope,</hi> a Gentleman within the West War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denrie,
called Mr. <hi>Salkeld.</hi> These two, after truce taken and proclaimed, as the
custome was, by sound of Trumpet met friendly, and upon mutuall redresse of such
wrongs as were then complained of, parted in good tearms, each of them taking his
way homewards. Mean while it happened one <hi>William Armstrong,</hi> commonly
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:50008:220"/>
called <hi>Will of Kinmouth</hi> to be in company with the Scottish Deputie, against whom
the English had a quarrell for many wrongs he had committed, as he was indeed a
notorious thief.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>William Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong</hi> called <hi>Will of Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> taken Prisoner.</note> This man having taken his leave of the Scots Deputie, and riding
down the River of <hi>Liddell</hi> on the Scotish side towards his own house, was pursued
by the English that espied him from the other side of the River, and after a chase of
three or four miles, taken prisoner, and brought back to the English Deputie, who
carried him away to the Castle of <hi>Carlile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Laird of <hi>Baclugh</hi> complaining of the breach of truce (which was alwaies
taken from the time of meeting unto the next day at sun rising) wrote to Mr. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keld,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Laird of <hi>Baclugh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of the breach of truce.</note>
and craved redresse; he excused himself by the absence of the Lord <hi>Scroope;</hi>
whereupon <hi>Baclugh</hi> sent to the Lord <hi>Scroope,</hi> and desired the prisoner might be set
at liberty without any bond or condition, seeing he was unlawfully taken. <hi>Scroope</hi>
answered, that he could doe nothing in the matter, it having so happened, without
a direction from the Queen and Councell of <hi>England,</hi> considering the man was
such a Malefactor. <hi>Baclugh</hi> loath to inform the King of what was done, lest it might
have bred some misliking betwixt the Princes, dealt with Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> the Resident
Ambassadour of <hi>England</hi> for the Prisoners liberty, who wrote very seriously to the
Lord <hi>Scroope</hi> in that business, advising him to set the man free, and not to bring the
matter to a further hearing; but no answer was returned: the matter thereupon
was imparted to the King, and the Queen of <hi>England</hi> solicited by Letters to give
direction for his liberty; yet nothing was obtained: which <hi>Baclugh</hi> perceiving,
and apprehending both the King and himself as the Kings officer to be touched in
honour, he resolved to work the Prisoners relief by the best means he could.</p>
                     <p>And upon intelligence that the Castle of <hi>Carlile,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">No satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clugh</hi> sets the Prisoner at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</note> wherein the Prisoner was kept,
was surprisable, he imployed some trusty persons to take a view of the Postern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
and measure the height of the wall, which he meant to scale by ladders; and if
those failed, to break through the wall with some iron instruments, and force the
gates. This done so closely as he could, he drew together some 200 horse, assigning
the place of meeting at the Tower of <hi>Morton,</hi> some ten miles from <hi>Carlile</hi> an
hour before sun-set. With this company passing the water of <hi>Esk</hi> about the falling,
two howers before day he crossed <hi>Eden</hi> beneath <hi>Carlile</hi> bridge (the water through
the rain that had fallen being thick) and came to the <hi>Sacery,</hi> a plain under the
Castle; There, making a little halt at the side of a small Bourn which they call <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi>
he caused 80 of the company to light from their horses and take the ladders
and other instruments which he had prepared with them, he himself accompanying
them to the foot of the wall, caused the ladders to be set to it, which proving too
short he gave order to use the other instruments for opening the wall nigh the
Postern, and finding the business like to succeed, retired to the rest whom he had
left on horse-back for assuring those that entred upon the Castle against any erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Town.<note place="margin">The Castle of <hi>Carlile</hi> surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the Prisoner freed.</note> With some little labour a breach was made for single men to
enter, and they who first went in brake open the Postern for the rest; the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and some few the noise awaked, made a little restraint, but they were quickly
repressed and taken captive, after which they passed to the Chamber wherein the
Prisoner was kept, and having brought him forth, sounded a trumpet, which was a
signall to them without that the enterprise was performed. My Lord <hi>Scroope</hi> and
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Salkeld</hi> were both within the house, and to them the Prisoner cried a good night.
The captives taken in the first encounter were brought to <hi>Baclugh,</hi> who presently
returned them to their Master, and would not suffer any spoil or booty, as they
tearm it, to be carried away: he had straitly forbidden to break open any door but
that where the Prisoner was kept, though he might have made prey of all the goods
within the Castle, and taken the Warden himself captive; for he would have it
seen that he did intend nothing but the reparation of his Majesties honour. By this
time the Prisoner was brought forth, the Town had taken the Alarum, the drums
were beating, the bells ringing, and a beacon put on the top of the Castle to give
warning to the Countrey. Whereupon <hi>Baclugh</hi> commanded those that entred
the Castle and the Prisoner to horse, and march again by the <hi>Sacery,</hi> made to the
River at the stony bank: on the other side whereof certain were assembled to stop
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:50008:220"/>
his passage, but he causing sound the Trumpet took the River, day being then
broken, and they chusing to give him way he retired in order through the <hi>Grahams</hi>
of <hi>Esk</hi> (men at that time of great power and his unfriends, and came back into
Scotish ground two howers after sun-rising, and so homewards.</p>

Queens pleasure.<note place="margin">This matter debated in Councell.</note> 
                        <hi>Baclugh</hi> compiering and charged with the fact made answer, <hi>That

wrong to any of her Subjects, but onely to relieve a subject of</hi> Scotland <hi>unlawfully taken
and more unlawfully detained; That in the time of a generall assurance in a day of truce
he was taken prisoner against all order, neither did he attempt his relief till redress was
refused; and that he had carried the business in such a moderate manner as no hostility
was committed, nor the least wrong offered to any within the Castle: yet was he content ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ancient treaties observed betwixt the two Realms, when as mutuall injuries
were alleadged, to be tryed by the Commissioners that it should please their Majesties to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
and submit himself to that which they should decern.</hi> The Convention esteeming
the answer reasonable did acquaint the Ambassadour therewith, and offered to
send Commissioners to the borders with all diligence to treat with such as the
Queen should be pleased to appoint for her part.</p>
                     <p>But she not satisfied with the answer refused to appoint any Commissioners;<note place="margin">The trouble quieted by <hi>Baclugh</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note>
whereupon the Councell of <hi>England</hi> did renue the complaint in <hi>Iuly</hi> thereafter, and
the business being of new agitated it was resolved of as before, and that the same
should be remitted to the triall of Commissioners: the King protesting, <hi>That he
might with great reason crave the delivery of the Lord Scroop for the injury committed by
his deputy, It being less favourable to take a prisoner then relieve him that is unlawfully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
yet for the continuing of peace he would forbear to do it, and omit nothing on his part
that could be desired either in equity, or by the laws of friendship.</hi> The borderers in the

                        </gap>t to the worse; neither were they made
quiet till for satisfying the Queen the Laird of <hi>Baclugh</hi> was first committed in S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
and afterwards entered in <hi>England,</hi> where he remained not long.</p>
                     <p>At the same time for bringing the Isles to obedience Collonell <hi>Steward</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to levy 1000 men,<note place="margin">Col. <hi>Stewart</hi> design'd Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant for the Isles.</note> every shire furnishing 20 horsemen and 30 foot, or so much
money as would sustain them, allowing the horsemen 24 pounds monthly and the
foot 12 pound, besides the supply of the free burghes. These companies were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to meet at <hi>Dumbalton</hi> the 20 of <hi>August</hi> for aiding the King or his Lieutenant
for the space of 40 days according to the customes, and when the days were come
were commanded to follow the Colonell as designed Lieutenant assigned by the
King. But upon the bruite of this expedition the principals of the Isles did all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves, offering obedience to appear before the King at the time his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
should appoint: so that expedition ceased, the Colonell going no further then
<hi>Ila,</hi> where he remained a few days and took assurance for their appearance.</p>
                     <p>In the March preceding the Assembly of the Church convened at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
for consulting upon the dangers threatned to religion by the invasion of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An Assembly of the Church at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                        </note>
which was then generally noised. Some brethren directed to lay open the
perils to his Majesty returned with this answer; <hi>That albeit there was no great cause
to fear any such invasion at that time, yet they should do well to give their advice as if the
danger were at hand, which would serve when necessity did require.</hi> The Assembly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this thought meet to enter into consideration both of the dangers and
remedies,<note place="margin">A search of the causes of the present fear of invasion.</note> and first to enquire upon the causes that had provoked God to threaten
the Realm with that tyrannous Nation, to the end the same might be removed;
then to deliberate how by ordinary lawfull means the enemy should be resisted.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:50008:221"/>
The causes they condescended to be sins of all estates, and especially the sins of the
Ministery; which they held best should be penned and drawn to certain heads, that
the corruptions being laid open the remedies might be the better provided. For
this work some of the brethren were named &amp; set apart, who after a day or two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in writing a number of Articles touching the corruption of Ministers as well
in their offices as in their lives and manners; the offences in the Kings house; in the
Court and in the Judgment seats; the defection and faults commune to all estates;
and the remedies which in their opinion were fit to be used.</p>
                     <p>The Assembly allowing their labours and acknowledging their own guiltiness in
that which concerned themselves,<note place="margin">A new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made by the Ministers for abiding to the profession of the truth and living accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the same.</note> ordained a day of humiliation to be kept on Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the week following by the Ministers that were there present, for reconciling
themselves to God, and making up a new Covenant for the better discharge of their
duties.</p>
                     <p>This is the Covenant that by some is so often objected and said to be violated by
those that gave obedience to the Canons of the Church, albeit in it there is not a

By this Covenant all did bind themselves to abide in the profession of the
truth, and to walk according to the same as God should enable them. But for the
rules of policy or ceremonies serving to good order or decency, let inspection be
taken of the Register which is extant, and it shall plainly appear, that at the time
there was not so much as any mention thereof made.</p>

                        <hi>The advices they gave for resisting the practises of the enemy
was,</hi> That all who had kithed in action with the Popish Lords should enter their persons in
ward, till assurance was given that they should neither keep intelligence with the Rebels,
nor joyn with them in case they did return into the Countrey. That the rents and livings
of the Rebels should be uplifted for entertainment of souldiers, and supporting other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
affairs. That in every Parish Captains should be chosen for the mustering and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of men in Armes, and some Commanders in every Shire appointed for convening the
County at needfull occasions. Lastly, that they who were Sureties for the good behaviour
of the Rebels without the Realm should be called, and to pay the summes contained in their
bonds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This advice presented to the King went much against his minde;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to have the Noblemen reclaimed.</note> 
                        <hi>for his desire
was to have the banished Lords reclaimed and brought to obedience, which he
esteemed to be the greatest assurance both of his own peace and the Countries
quiet; therefore did he onely answer, That</hi> if it could be proved that the Lords since
their departing from <hi>Scotland</hi> had traffiqued with strangers to the prejudice of Religion
or State, they should be used with all extremity; but otherwise neither could their Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
be convicted, nor would he change the course which he had kept with their wives and
children.<note place="margin">He communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his mind with M. <hi>Robert Bruce.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Not long before this Assembly, the King had communicated his minde
to Mr.</hi> Robert Bruce <hi>touching that business, hoping that by the sway he carried in
those meetings some such Propositions as tended to the reclaiming of the banished
Lords should have been made by the Assembly; but finding his expectation not
answered, he brake to him the matter of new, and shewed</hi> how greatly it concerned his
estate to have them reduced and called home; That the Queen of <hi>England</hi> was grown
old, and if any should after her death withstand his Title, he would have need of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
assistance. And that having so many Nobles exiled he would be lesse respected of
strangers, and be a great deal weaker at home. If he could therefore win them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their offence, and so embrace the true Religion (without which they should never get
any favour from him) he believed the course would not be disallowed of wise men, and those
that loved him. Alwaies he desired to know his judgment, for as yet he had not shewed his
minde in that matter to any person.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> being as then in great favour and credit with the King,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> said
<q>that he did think well of his Majesties reasons; and that he should not doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
to bring home <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arroll,</hi> so as they would conform themselves in
Religion. But that <hi>Huntley</hi> could not be pardoned being so hated as he was of
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:50008:221"/>
the subjects.</q> The King reasoning to the contrary, <q>that if <hi>Huntley</hi> be willing to
satisfie the Church and fulfill the Conditions which he would require of him, he
saw no reason why he should not be received as well as the other two;<note place="margin">The King rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth with him to the contrary of his advise.</note> And as he
could not but know that his care of that man was great; and he having married
his Cousin, whom he accounted his own Daughter; so was he the man of greatest
power, and one that could stand him in most stead. Therefore desired Mr. <hi>Robert</hi>
to think of that matter, and after a day or two give him his advice in it</q>. At the
next meeting being enquired what he had thought of the business, he answered as
before, saying, That <hi>Huntley</hi>'s return would be ill interpreted, and offend all good
men. The King repeating the former Reasons, and adding. That if he brought one
home he would bring them all;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Robert's</hi> saucy Reply to the King.</note> he replied, <hi>I see Sir that your resolution is to take</hi>
Huntley <hi>in favour; which if you doe, I will oppose, and you shall choose whether you will
lose</hi> Huntley <hi>or me; for us both you cannot keep.</hi> This saucy reply the King did never
forget, and it was this which lost him the favour which formerly he carried with
the King.</p>
                     <p>The exiled Lords not finding that respect given unto them in forain parts which
they expected,<note place="margin">Shortly after the Lords exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led return.</note> took a resolution to return, and to use all means for reconciling
themselves to the King &amp; Church. And that their return might be the more secret,
they separated one from another; <hi>Arroll</hi> taking his journey homewards through
the United Provinces was intercepted and delivered into the hands of Mr. <hi>Robert
Danielston</hi> Conservator of the <hi>Scotish</hi> priviledges, to be kept by him till the King
should be advertised.<note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Arroll</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys escapeth.</note> But whether by the Conservators knowledge, or otherwise,
he made an escape and came into the Countrey. <hi>Huntley</hi> came some moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and lurking secretly in the North, sent a supplication to his Majesty, and the
Convention which met at <hi>Falkland</hi> the 12 of <hi>August,</hi> the effect whereof was, that
he might be permitted to return and remain within any part of the Countrey his
Majesty should appoint,<note place="margin">A Convention at <hi>Falkland.</hi>
                        </note> he giving sufficient surety for his quiet and peaceable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
                     <p>The King having heard the Supplication,<note place="margin">The King's judgment of <hi>Huntley</hi>'s sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</note> took occasion to say, <q>That one of
the two courses was needfull to be followed with him and the rest that were in his
condition; that is, either utterly to exterminate them, their race, and posterity, or
then upon their humble acknowledgment of their offence and surety made for
the state of Religion to receive in favour; for to continue in the condition
wherein they presently were, could not stand either with the safety of Religion,
or with his own honour and estate. The first course, said he, hath the own diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and will not be performed without great trouble; And for my self, so
long as there is any hope that they may be reduced to the profession of the truth,
I desire not their destruction, but like rather to extend my clemency towards
them; which I believe is the minde of all good and peaceable men. As to the
present offer made by <hi>Huntley,</hi> I do not think it well generall, and to no purpose;
therefore by your advise I would have particular Conditions condescended upon,
such as may serve for security of Religion, mine own honour, and the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Countrey; such Conditions being offered and security found for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
I should then think that license might be granted him to return, he
being confined in such a part of the Countrey as should be thought most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient</q>.
The Convention approving his Majesties judgment, resolved upon this
as the fittest course, remitting the Conditions to be formed by his Highness and
the Lords of Councell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>September</hi> the same conclusion was ratified at another Convention of the Estates

                        </note> and that such an Act
was passed in their favours, the Commissioners of the Church assembled at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
where falling to consider the dangers threatned to Religion by their return,
it was thought necessary to acquaint all the Presbyteries with the present state of
things; particularly that the forfaited Earls were returned into the Countrey
without his Majesties warrant and approbation, that they remained peaceably in
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:50008:222"/>
the same, using all means to be restored to their livings: albeit they had neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
their offence in that treasonable dealing with the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor
their defection and apostasie from the truth. And that they had maintained an
Act of Councell in their favours at the Convention of <hi>Falkland,</hi> which was rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
thereafter at <hi>Dunfermling,</hi> whereby they were licensed to remain upon certain
Conditions to be prescribed unto them by his Majesty and Councell, to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
hazard both of Church and State, considering their continuance in the same
disposition to work mischief as before: of these things they were desired to inform
their flocks; and both in publick doctrine and private conference to stirre up the
Countrey-people to apprehend the danger, and to be in readiness to resist the same
so farre as lawfully they might.<note place="margin">A publick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.</note> It was further thought meet, that publick humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

and the cause thereof declared to be the return of the excommunicated Lords,
and dangers thereby threatned to Religion, which the Ministers should enlarge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

their Entertainers, Reffetters, and such as kept company with them, and proceed

to conferre with the most moderate of the Ministery, and use their best means for
satisfying them touching the return of the forfeited Lords. Mr. <hi>David Lindesey,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Patrick Gallaway,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iames Nicholson,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Melvill</hi> being sent for to

mean to shew them any favour) they might be pardoned and restored to their
estates.</q> The Ministers answered, <hi>They came only to hear what was proponed and in a
matter of that importance could say nothing unacquainting their brethren.</hi> The Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was delayed till afternoon. At which time returning they said, <hi>That the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
were glad of the respect carried by his Majesty to the Church; and that his resolution
was to give no favour to those Rebels till the Church was first satisfied. But in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they having by Gods law deserved death, and being by the most soveraign Court of
the Kingdome sentenced to have lost their estates, they could not be lawfully pardoned nor
restored. And if the King and his Councell would take on them to doe it, they had God and
the Countrey to answer unto; but for them they would give no assent, but protest to the
contrary that they were free thereof before God and man.</hi>

<hi>That the Church indeed could not refuse their satisfaction, if it were truly offered; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
the King stood obliged to doe justice.</hi> When by no reasoning they could be
wrought from these extremities, the Conference brake off, and the effects thereof
being reported to the King, he was greatly commoved, inveighing against Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
at his table,<note place="margin">Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners directed to his Majesty.</note> in Councell, and every where. The wiser sort that foresaw the
ill effects this rancour would breed, advised the Ministers to send some of their

<hi>the countenance given to the Lady</hi> Huntley, <hi>and her invitation to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of the Princesse, the putting her in the hands of the Lady</hi> Levingston, <hi>an
avowed and obstinate Papist; and which grieved them more then any thing else, the

                        <hi>To this last the King did first reply, saying,</hi> That they had
given him too just cause by their railing against him, and his proceedings in their Sermons.
<hi>for the</hi> Popish Lords, he had granted nothing to them, but what the Estate had found
needfull for the peace and quiet of the Realm. <hi>As to the Lady Huntley,</hi> he esteemed
her a good discreet Lady and worthy of his countenance; and that she was a Papist they
might blame themselves, who had never taken care to enform her of the truth. <hi>Lastly, for
his Daughter the Princesse,</hi> he had trusted her to the Lord <hi>Levingston,</hi> a Nobleman
known to be of good Religion, and not to his Lady who should not be suffered to take any

and so farre he prevailed with the Commissioners of the Church, as they sent
certain of their number to intreat the deserting of the Diet, saying, <hi>It would be ill
taken to draw Ministers in question upon trifling delations, when as the enemies of the
truth were spared, and overseen.</hi> The King some daies before, had published the
Conditions upon which he was to grant a Protection to <hi>Huntley,</hi> and asking those
Commissioners, if they had seen the Conditions, said, <hi>That both he and the rest should
either satisfie the Church in every point, or be pursued with all extremity, so as they should
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:50008:223"/>
have no reason to complain of the oversight of Papists.</hi> For Master <hi>Blake</hi> he said he
did not think much of that matter, onely they should cause him appear and take
some course for pacifying the <hi>English Ambassadour. But take heed,</hi> said the King,
<hi>that you doe not decline the judicatory; for if you doe, it will be worse then any thing yet
fallen out.</hi>

conjunctly and severally for five thousand pounds of the said summe) that he
should faithfully observe and fulfill the whole Articles undermentioned, and every
one of them, as first, that betwixt and the first day of <hi>April</hi> next to come, he
should either satisfie the Church for his Apostasie, and return to the bosome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in uniformity of Religion, or before the expiring of the said time depart again
forth of the Countrey, and not return again without his Majesties license.</p>
                     <p>2 Next, that during the said space, he should not receive in his company any
Jesuit, Masse-priests, or excommunicate Papists, nor have any dealing, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or intelligence with them, especially with his Uncle Mr. <hi>Iames Gordon,</hi> nor
suffer his Children, in case any be brought forth in the mean time, to be baptized

                     <p>3 That so long as he remained in the Countrey, as likewise in case of his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the time aforesaid, he should not traffick with any stranger or others whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
for alteration of the true Religion, or disquieting the state of the Countrey
in any sort.</p>
                     <p>4 That his former Cautioners should remain obliged, in case after lawfull triall
it should be found that since his last departing he had trafficked with strangers for

                     <p>6 That within fifteen daies next he should enter his eldest Son and apparent
Heir as a Hostage to his Majesty for observing the Articles before and after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and that his said Son should abide in such company, ward, or Castle, as his
Majesty should appoint, where most conveniently he might be instructed in the
true Religion, and not escape by his Fathers knowledge or assistance.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, that he should compeir personally before the Councell whensoever he
should be called upon fifteen daies warning, for trying the contravention of any of
the Articles above expressed: providing the cause for which he should be charged
were expressed in the Letters, and warrant given him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that he should not be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
for any other fact done before his last passing forth of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Articles the King caused to be imprinted,<note place="margin">The Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons give no content.</note> that all men might see he meant
not to bestow any favour either upon him or the rest, unlesse they joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Religion publickly professed, yet this served not to stop the mouths
of people, nor did it remove the jealousie of the Preachers, who were daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, <q>That Papists were favoured, the Ministers troubled for the free rebuke of
sin, and the scepter of <hi>Christs</hi> kingdome sought to be overthrown. The processe,
they said, intended against Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> was but a policy to divert the Ministers
from prosecuting their suite against the Popish Earls; and if he should submit his
Doctrine to the triall of the Councell, the liberties of the Church and spirituall
government of the house of God, would be quite subverted. In any case therefore
they concluded,<note place="margin">A Declinatour advised to be droponed.</note> that a Declinator should be used, and protestation made against
these proceedings.</q> This was held a dangerous course, and earnestly disswaded by
some few, but they were cried down by the greater number, that said <hi>it was the cause
of God, whereunto it concerned them to stand at all hazard.</hi> So a Declinator was formed
and given Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> to present, bearing this in substance:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="421" facs="tcp:50008:223"/>
                        <q>That howbeit the conscience of his innocency did uphold him sufficiently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the calumnies of whomsoever, and that he was ready to defend the doctrine
uttered by him, whether in opening the words,<note place="margin">M. <hi>David Blake</hi> his Declinator.</note> or in application; yet seeing he
was brought thither to be judged by his Majesty and Councell for his doctrine,
and that his answering to the pretended accusation, might import a prejudice to
the liberties of the Church, and be taken for an acknowledgement of his Majesties
jurisdiction in matters meerly spiritual, he was constrained in all humility to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
that Judicatory for the reasons following: First, because the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> of
whom he had the grace of his calling, had given him (albeit unworthy of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to bear his name) his Word for a rule, to his preaching, and that he
could not fall in the reverence of any Civill law, but in so farre as he should be
tried to have passed his instructions, which trial belonged onely to the Prophets
and Pastors, the spirits of the Prophets being subject to them alone; for as first it
must be declared whether he had kept his instruction or not.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>2 In regard the liberty of the Church, and discipline presently exercised was
confirmed by divers Acts of Parliament, and the office-bearers thereof peaceably
possessed therein, particularly in the judicatory of the word preached, (as was clear
by divers late examples) he ought to be remitted for his preaching to the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick
Senate, as his competent Judge, in the first instance. For which and for other
weighty considerations, and namely for eschewing the inconveniencies that might
fall to Religion, and his Majesties own estate, by the appearance of distraction and
alienation of his Majesties mind from the Ministry and the cause of God in their
hands; he for himself, and in name of the Commissioners of the general Assembly,
who had subscrived the same Declinatour, did humbly beseech his Majesty not to
infringe the liberty of the Church, but rather manifest his care in maintaining the
same.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Diet came, and the summons were read,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Blakes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Diet.</note> being desired to answer, he
said, That albeit he might object against the citation, the same being directed <hi>super
inquirendis,</hi> contrary to the form prescrived by Parliament, and no particular speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
therein; yet he would take him to the usuall remedy of law, and desire to be
remitted to his own Ordinary. Being asked whom he meant? he answered, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
where the doctrine was taught. The King then replying that the matter
laid to his charge was Civill, and that the generality of the summons was restricted
to the particular letter produced by the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador; he said, <hi>That the
speeches wherewith he was charged being uttered in pulpit, must be judged by the Church,
In prima instantia.</hi> Again being inquired whether the King might not judge mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Treason, as well as the Church did matters of Heresie? he said, <hi>That
speeches delivered in pulpit, albeit alledged to be treasonable, could not be judged by the King
till the Church took first cognition thereof;</hi> but that he was not come thither to solve
questions, and so presented the Declinatour. The King notwithstanding that he
was greatly offended, (because the day appointed for the baptisme of the Princesse
was approaching) continued all further proceeding to the last of <hi>November.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mean while had the Commissioners for the Church sent a copy of M. <hi>Blakes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatour
with a letter to all the Presbyteries requiring them for the greater corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their doings to subscrive the same,<note place="margin">The Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour sent to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serived.</note> and to commend the cause in hand in
their private and publick prayers to God, using their best credit with their flocks,
and employing all their labours for the maintainance thereof. The King being
mightily incensed with this doing as tending to a direct mutiny, and the stirring up
of the subjects to rebellion, gave forth a Proclamation, wherein he said,</p>
                     <p>That certain persons of the Ministery, abiding in the town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commissioners</note> had of long
time continued together devising plots prejudiciall to his Majesties authority, and usurping
a power over their brethren, had directed letters for subscriving a Declinatour formed, and
already subscrived by themselves, requiring them with the return of their subscriptions to
send some of their number to assist their proceedings as though they were not subjects, and
that the King had no power, nor authority over them, intending, as appeared by convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and the like tumultuous forms, to break the peace, and make an insurrection in the
Countrey; whereas no care in the mean time was taken of their flocks, but the same left
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:50008:224"/>
comfortless and destitute of the preaching of the word, all which they coloured with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Commission alledged to be given by the last generall assembly, albeit there was no such
Commission; that which he produced, containing only a power to consult, and report, and
not to set down Acts, or exercise any jurisdiction: and granting that such a Commission
had been given, the same could not be lawfull, as given without the consent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Majesties Commissioners who were present at the time. Therefore to prevent
the disorders and confusion which therethrough might arise, his Highness with the advice of
the Councell, discharged the said Commission, as unlawful in it self, and more unlawfully
executed by the said Commissioners; commanding the persons under written, namely,
M. <hi>Andrew Melvill,</hi> M. <hi>James Melvill,</hi> M. <hi>Iohn Davidson,</hi> M. <hi>Nicoll Dalgleish,</hi>
M. <hi>James Nicolson,</hi> M. <hi>James Carmichaell</hi> and <hi>John Clapperton,</hi> to depart home
to their severall flocks within 24 hours, after the charge, and to attend upon the lawfull
discharge of their callings, and no ways to return for keeping such unlawfull convocations
either within the said burgh or without, under the pain of Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>The Commissioners upon information that such a charge was directed fell to
consult what course they should take;<note place="margin">The Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of the Church upon this discharge enter into a new consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and first they resolved, <q>That since they
were convened by the warrant of Christ, in a most needfull and dangerous time
to see unto the good of the Church, <hi>Et ne quid Ecclesia detrimenti caperet,</hi> they
should obey God rather then man; and notwithstanding of any charge that
should be given, continue together so long as conveniently they might, and in
the mean time send some of the number to the <hi>Octavians</hi> (this was the title com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
given to those eight Counsellors that were trusted with all affairs) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise
them,<note place="margin">They sent a Commission to the <hi>Octavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                           </note> that seeing the Church at their entry to their places enjoyed a full
peace and liberty, and that now it was cast into great troubles, and the enemies
of the truth spared, and overlooked, they could not but think that all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from their counsells; and therefore whatsoever the event should be, the
Church would take her self to them,</q> and they onely should bear the blame. The
President answering in choler said, <q>That these controversies were begun without
their advice, &amp; so they should end; that for their good service they had reaped smal
thanks, and drawn upon themselves much envy, and therefore would have no med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in that business betwixt the King &amp; them, but leave it to him &amp; his Nobility</q>.</p>
                     <p>This answer put them to a second advice,<note place="margin">Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners sent to his Majesty for surceasing M. <hi>Blakes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eess.</note> and thinking they were mistaken and
that these Commissioners were not in the fault, but that all proceeded from the
King himself, they sent M. <hi>David Lindesay,</hi> M. <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> M. <hi>Iames Nicolson</hi>
and <hi>Iames Melvill,</hi> to declare unto his Majesty the great inconveniencies that were
like to arise upon this hard dealing with the Church, and humbly intreat a surcease of
the Process intended against M. <hi>David Blake,</hi> and that all other controversies might be
left off till some order was taken with the Papists, and an Assembly convocated for
deciding these questions to his Highness content. The King answered, <q>That it
was not his fault,<note place="margin">His Majesties offer to the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> and that he was no less displeased then they were with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
arisen, and that yet if they would pass from the declinator, or declare at
least, that it was not a general, but only a particular declinator, used in the cause of
M. <hi>David Blake</hi> as being a cause of slander, and partaining to the judgement of the
Church, he should also pass from the summons and cease his pursuit.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This yeelding offer of the King was by the advice of the wiser sort thought
good to be accepted,<note place="margin">The wiser sort of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters advise to accept of the offer, but they are over-ruled.</note> that there might be an end of contention; <hi>For if,</hi> said they,
<hi>we go to try our strength with the King, we shall be found too weak; as yet the Court stands
in some awe of the Church, and whilest they are in this conceit, it shall be meet to take the
best conditions we can have; for if by our strictness matters go to the worst, our weakness
shall soon appear; and thereafter shall the Church be no more feared nor regarded; too
great stiffness doth seldom succeed well, and it is often seen, that they who will have all
their wills, do lose all in the end.</hi> This was the reasoning of the wise and more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
sort. Others flattering themselves in their preciseness held, <hi>That the onely way
to prevail, was to stand by their grounds; the cause was Gods, which he would maintain;
that worldly powers were not to be feared, and that God had in his hand the hearts of
Princes to turn them whither he pleased, whereof in the present business they had seen a
proof.</hi> The debate held long, and in end by most voices it was concluded that they
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:50008:224"/>
should stand to the Declinator, unless the King would pass from the summons, and
remitting the pursuite to the ecclesiasticall Judge make an Act of Councell, that no
Minister should be charged for his preaching, at lest before the meeting of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Assembly. The King perceiving this offer neglected was in great wrath, and told
them who were sent unto him, that he would hearken to no agreement unless they
would pass simply from the declinator,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Blake</hi> cited to the last of <hi>November.</hi>
                        </note> and cause M. <hi>Blake</hi> compeir, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Judicatory; Which being refused, the Proclamation was published, the
Commissioners charged to depart forth of the Town, and M. <hi>Blake</hi> by a new sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
cited to the last of <hi>November.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next day being Sunday and the day of the Princes Christening,<note place="margin">The Baptisme of the Princess <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                        </note> the same
was kept in the Palace of <hi>Halyrudhouse</hi> with great joy and feasting. The <hi>English</hi>
Ambassador did name the Princess <hi>Elizabeth</hi> after the Queen his Mistresse; the
Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> by the Magistrates assisting as witnesses, such honor did the
King unto them. But all that day in the Town Churches were bitter invectives
made against the two Proclamations; for besides the charge given the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
to leave the Town, by another Proclamation the Barons, Gentlemen, and
all other subjects were discharged to convene with the Ministry, either in Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
or Synods, or any other Ecclesiasticall meetings under whatsoever colour or
pretence, without his Majesties licence. These things were mightily aggravated by
the preachers, and the people exceedingly stirred, at which the King more and
more offending, he resolved to keep the Diet assigned for M. <hi>Blakes</hi> appearing in
the Councell house of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> accompanied with his Nobles, that were present
at the Baptism.</p>
                     <p>The Commissioners advertised of this (for all that time some Gentlemen of the
Chamber in hatred of the <hi>Octavians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Petition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and Councell.</note> gave intelligence of every thing that was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
did form a Petition, to be presented to his Majesty and the Noblemen, consisting
of three heads. <q>First, they entreated the King, that seeing the decision of such thorny
and intricate questions as was moved at that time to the trouble of the Church,
could work no good, and was subtilly urged, onely to ingender a dissension be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Majesty and the Ministers, he would be pleased to remit the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof to a lawfull Assembly, and not to incroach upon the limits of
Christs Kingdom upon any pretence, bending his actions according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
necessity, against the common enemies of Religion and State. Next, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
the Noblemen to give his Majesty a free and faithfull counsell in that
business; and as to the honour of God, and their own just praise they had kept
themselves free both in counsell, and action from working any prejudice to the
liberty of the Gospell, so they would not suffer themselves to be drawn at that
time under the guiltiness of so great a sin, by the craft of those who were subtilly
seeking the thraldom of the Gospell, and thought to make their honors the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
of their malicious devices. And thereby that by their credit they would
procure a continuation of all controversies unto a free and lawfull Assembly,
where the same might be gravely reasoned,</q> and concluded. This Petition was
given to M. <hi>David Lindesay,</hi> M. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> and M. <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> to be presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and if the same was refused they were enjoyned to protest against the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Councell.</p>
                     <p>The King receiving this Petition,<note place="margin">The Petition rejected.</note> after he had overviewed it did reject the same
as not worthy of answer, commanding to call M. <hi>Blake,</hi> and read the summons.
Therein he was charged,<note place="margin">The points laid to M. <hi>Blaks</hi> charge.</note> First, to have affirmed in Pulpit that the <hi>Popish Lords</hi> were
returned into the Countrey with his Majesties knowledge, and upon his assurance,
and said that in so doing he had <hi>detected the treachery of his heart.</hi> Secondly, that
he had called all <hi>Kings</hi> the <hi>Divels Barns,</hi> adding that the Divell was in the Court and
in the guiders of it. Thirdly, in his prayer for the Queen, he had used these words,
<hi>We must pray for her for the fashion, but we have no cause, she will never do us good.</hi>
Fourthly, that he had called the <hi>Queen of England,</hi> an <hi>Atheist.</hi> Fifthly, that he had
discussed a suspension granted by the Lords of Session in Pulpit, and called them
<hi>miscreants</hi> and <hi>bribers.</hi> Sixthly, that speaking of the Nobility, he said they were
<hi>degenerated, Godless, dissemblers,</hi> and <hi>enemies to the Church;</hi> likewise speaking of the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:50008:225"/>
                        <hi>Councell,</hi> that he had called them <hi>Holliglasses, Cormorants &amp; men of no Religion.</hi> Lastly,
that he had convocated divers Noblemen, Barons &amp; others within S. <hi>Andrews</hi> in the
month of <hi>Iune</hi> 1594, caused them take arms, &amp; divide themselves in Troops of
horse &amp; foot, &amp; had thereby usurped the power of the King and Civill Magistrate.</p>
                     <p>After reading of the summons Mr. <hi>Robert Pont</hi> protested, that the processe in
hand and whatsoever followed thereof,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Robert Pont</hi> protesteth for the liberties of the Church.</note> should not prejudge the libertie of the
Church in matters of Doctrine. The king answered, <hi>That he was not to meddle with
any matter of doctrine, but to censure the treasonable speeches of a Minister in sermon,
which he and his Councell would judge, except by clear scripture it should be proved, That
Ministers were not subject in these cases to his Iudicatory.</hi> Thereafter Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> being
commanded to answer, said, that all these accusations were false, untrue calumnies,
producing two testimonials,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth the Councell of new.</note> one of the Provost Baylies and councell of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
the other of the Rector, Dean of facultie, Professors and Regents of the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which he alledged should be preferred to any report whatsoever. Next he said
for the first six points, the Lords of the Councell were not competent Judges; the
speeches alledged being uttered in pulpit, but the same ought to be censured by the
Presbytery, where the Sermon was delivered: And then repeating his former decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,
<note place="margin">The Councell write the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatour.</note> presented a new one, in substance the same with the first. For the last point
he made offer to submit himself to the triall of the King and Councell. Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
and the Declinatour put to voices, it was found, <q>That the crimes and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
contained in the summons were seditious and treasonable, and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
his Councell and other Judges substitute by his authority were competent
Judges in all matters either criminall or civill, as well to Ministers as to other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</q>
This pronounced the witnesses were called and admitted, but their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was delayed to the next day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>After the Councell dissolved, the Prior of</hi> Blantyre <hi>Treasurer and</hi> Alexander
Hume <hi>Provost of</hi> Edinburgh <hi>were sent from the King to the Ministers, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of that his proceeding against Mr.</hi> Blake,<note place="margin">The Kings care to keep peace with the Church.</note> 
                        <hi>hee did not mean to use him
with rigour, but if they should move him to come and resolve his Majestie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the truth of the points libelled, he would rest upon his own declaration, and
send him back to his charge: so carefull was the King of peace, and so desirous to be
in good termes with the Church. Night was then fallen, and the Commissioners
gone to their lodgings, yet finding Mr.</hi> Robert Bruce, <hi>Mr.</hi> Robert Rollock, <hi>Mr.</hi> Iames
Nicolson <hi>and Mr.</hi> Iames Melvill <hi>together, they declared what they had in Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to have declared to the whole number. Mr.</hi> Robert Bruce <hi>answering in the name
of the rest, said,</hi> That if the matter did touch Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> alone the offer might be accepted,
but the libertie of Christs kingdome had received such a wound by the Proclamations publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Saterday preceding and that Day by the usurpation of the spirituall Iudicatorie, as if
Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> life and the lives of twentie others had been taken, it would not have grieved
the hearts of good brethren so much, as these injurious proceedings had done; and that either
these things behooved to bee retreated, or they would oppose so long as they had breath.</p>
                     <p>This answere reported,<note place="margin">The King conferreth with some Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters touching Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse.</note> the King the next morning called some two or three of
the Ministers unto him, did confer with them a long space, shewing that he was so
farre from impairing the Spirituall Jurisdiction or abridging any of the Church Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
as he would not only maintain them in what they enjoyed, but would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
and amplisie the same, when he saw it to be for their good; But <hi>this licencious
Discoursing,</hi> said he, <hi>of affaires of state in Pulpit can not be tolerated. My claime is only to
Iudge in matters of sedition and other civill and criminall causes, and of speeches that may
import such crimes, wheresoever they be uttered; for that the Pulpit should be a place privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
and under colour of Doctrine People stirred to sedition, no good man. I thinke will
allow. If treason and sedition be crimes punishable when they are committed, much more if
they be committed in the Pulpit, where the word of truth should only be taught and heard.</hi>
One of the Ministers answering, that they did not plead for the priviledge of the
place, but to the respect that was due to the message and Commission they carried,
which having received from God, the same ought not to be controlled in any ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Judicature. <q>Would you keep you to your message, <hi>said the King,</hi> there would
be no strife; but I trust your message be not to rule estates, and when courses dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:50008:225"/>
you to stirre the people to sedition; and make your King and those that rule
under him odious by your railings and outcries.</q> If any doe so, said the Minister,
and be tried to have passed the bounds, it is reason he be punished with all extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but this must bee cognosced by the Church. <q>And shall not I, <hi>said the King,</hi>
have power to call and punish a Minister that breaketh out in treasonable spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but must come to your presbyterie and be a complainer? I have good proof
in the processe with <hi>Gibson</hi> and <hi>Rosse,</hi> what justice you will doe me: and were it in
a doubtfull and ambiguous case, where by any colour the speeches might be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
it were some way favourable to say that the Minister should be called and
convict by his brethren;</q> but as in the present action with M. <hi>Blake,</hi> who hath
said, <hi>The treachery of the Kings heart is discovered; all Kings are the Devils Barns,</hi>
                        <q>&amp;c. who sees not the man hath passed his bounds, and not kept him to his
message? I am not ignorant what agitations <hi>France</hi> of late, and <hi>England</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, hath suffered by the violence of such spirits, and I have been in my
time reasonably exercised with them, and ye must not think that I will tolerate
such licentiousness. As for any lawfull power or liberty ye or your Assemblies
have granted either by the word of God, or by the laws of the kingdom, I mean
not to diminish the same; and if ye think meet, I will publish so much by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration

                     </p>
                     <p>With this the Ministers were dimitted,<note place="margin">The Ministers desire a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be made in favour of Church Assemblies.</note> who having related the conference they
had with his Majesty to the rest of their brethren, it was agreed in regard of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inconveniencies which might ensue upon these distractions betwixt his Majesty
and the Church, that if they could obtain a Declaration in Councell that by the
Acts and Proclamations published his Majesty did not intend to discharge any
Church Assembly, nor to annull any conclusion thereof, but that the same should
stand in force as they had been in use by the warrant of the word and approbation
of his Highness laws; and that the discharge of Barons and Gentlemen to convene
with the Ministers, was not extended to any Ecclesiasticall conventions, but onely
meant of their convening in Arms, matters should be passed over for the present;
the interloquutor in M. <hi>Blakes</hi> business not being used against him, nor any other
Minister unto a lawfull generall Assembly, wherein the question concerning the
limits of the Civill and the Spirituall Jurisdiction might be reasoned and defined.</p>
                     <p>This being propounded the King assented to the Declaration craved,<note place="margin">His Majestie consenteth to the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> offering
further to delete the Acts whereupon the Proclamations were founded. And for
M. <hi>Blake,</hi> he was content that he should be brought to his presence, and declaring
upon his conscience the truth of the points libelled, in the hearing of M. <hi>David Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desay,</hi>
M. <hi>Iames Nicolson,</hi> and M. <hi>Thomas Buchannan,</hi> they three should have power
to determine what they thought meet. The business was now thought to be at an
end, but in the afternoon by the suggestion, as it was supposed, of the President, the
King would have M. <hi>Blake</hi> to come before the Councell and acknowledge his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to the Queen;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg his offence to the Queen.</note> which done he should be pardoned of all. This M. <hi>Blake</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
saying, he would neither condemn himself, nor approve the proceedings of the
Councell, who have taken upon them to judge of his Sermons, had admitted a sort
of ignorant, and partially affected people to be witnesses against him, rejecting the
testimonies of the Town and University.<note place="margin">The witnesses examined, and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> found guilty.</note> When by no perswasion he could be
moved unto it, the King went to Councell, and the same day, it being the second
of <hi>December,</hi> caused read the deposition of the witnesses, who did clearly testifie that
all the speeches libelled were uttered by M. <hi>Blake</hi> in Pulpit. Thereupon sentence
was given that he had falsely slandered, and treasonably calumniated the Kings
Majesty, his bedfellow the Queen, his neighbour Princess the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> the
Lords of his Highness Councell and Session, and therefore (his punishment being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the King) it was ordained, that till his Majesties pleasure should be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he should be confined beyond the North water, and enter to his ward within six
days.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding of this Sentence the day following a new Treaty began,<note place="margin">A new treaty for making an accord.</note> which
continued some ten daies, and was like to have produced an agreement, for the King
was content, as before, to delete the Acts of Councell at which the Ministers took
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:50008:226"/>
offence, by writing on the margent of the book according to the custome of dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<hi>This matter is agreed, and the Act delete.</hi> He was likewise pleased to mend the
Narrative of the Proclamation, turning that upon the <hi>Papists</hi> and enemies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that was said of <hi>Ministers;</hi> and for Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> businesse, was content that
the Interloquutor pronounced should not be made a preparative against any other
Minister, and that none should be called upon their preaching before the Councell,
till it was found in a lawfull Assembly, that the King might judge of those that
passed their bounds in Doctrine; Provided he might in the mean time be assured
of the good behaviour of the Ministers, and that they should not speak unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
of him, or of his Councell,<note place="margin">Conditions craved by his Majesty.</note> which assurance he would have in writing. Some
punishment also he would have afflicted on Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> as either to transport him
from S. <hi>Andrews</hi> to another Congregation, or suspend him for a time from his
charge: punishments not very rigorous, nor answerable to the quality of the offence.</p>
                     <p>The Commissioners being herewith advised liked well of all,<note place="margin">The Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners refuse to agree to any censure of M. <hi>Blake.</hi>
                        </note> the last excepted.
<hi>A punishment,</hi> they said, <hi>could not be afflicted where no cognition had proceeded: for as
to the triall taken, neither was it done by the proper Iudge, nor was that equity observed
which ought to have been; witnesses that were under the Censures of the Church, and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to Mr.</hi> Blake, <hi>being admitted to depone against him.</hi> This reported to the
King, he made offer to name twenty persons, against whom no exception could
be alledged, and to give Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> his choice of seven or eight of that number, who
should be new examined touching the verity of the speeches whereof he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
if they upon their consciences did absolve him, he should rest satisfied, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
he would crave him to be deposed. But this came to no effect, nor could
any overture, albeit divers were proponed, serve to work an accord, so as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning
broke off, and greater displeasures arose on both hands, then afore. For
the Commissioners having directed two of the Brethren to shew the King,<note place="margin">The Ministers indict a fast, and complain of wrong done to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ.</note> 
                        <hi>That
since they could obtain no redresse for the wrongs done unto Christs kingdome, and saw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the enemies of the truth were favoured, and the faithfull Pastors of the Church
reviled, and pursued, they could not abstain from opposing these proceedings with the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
armour given them by God;</hi> and did therefore indict a <hi>Fast</hi> to be kept the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
following, being the 12 day of <hi>December,</hi> with solemn prayers for averting the
judgments which the present courses did threaten.</p>
                     <p>The King on the other side, made his displeasure and the scorn he took of these
proceedings known by a Declaration,<note place="margin">His Majesties Declaration published.</note> published on the 15 day, wherein he shewed,
<hi>That out of a desire he had to keep peace with the Ministers he did condescend to abstain
from troubling in any case bygone, untill by a convention of Estates, and a Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the Ministery the difference between the Civill and Ecclesiasticall judgments
might be removed; providing they should promise not to disgrace him and his proceedings
in their Sermons, which he was in hope to obtain by sundry Conferences and meetings that
he had kept with some of them, till at last publickly they had opposed themselves in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
by approving the doings of Mr.</hi> David Blake <hi>accusing himself of persecution,</hi>

falsly suggesting to the people that all Church Assemblies were discharged; whereas his
resolution was, and is to maintain Religion and the Church discipline established by law,
and to suffer nothing to be done in prejudice thereof by whomsoever: which his Highnesse
thought good to make known to all his subjects, ordaining all Ministers to subscrive their
obedience to his Majesty, and set their hands to the bonds which should be presented to them
for that effect, under the pain of sequestring their rents &amp; stipends ay and while they gave
the obedience required.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Master <hi>Blake</hi> charged to go to his ward, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners to leave the Town.</note> The same day was Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> charged to go unto his ward,

                     <p>But they refusing to enter in any communing, except the Commissioners were
recalled by as publick a Proclamation as that whereby they were discharged; hope
was given that the next day the same should be done, and all questions laid over
unto their return; which some of the Kings Chamber having understood, and
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:50008:226"/>
fearing if matters were once accorded, the <hi>Octavians</hi> (against whom they were
chiefly set) should contine in their imployment; among other reports they infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the King that a mighty watch was kept in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> about the Ministers hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for fear of some violence to be offered unto them; which laid an heavy imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon his Majesty, and that the Ministers would never be quiet till these facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
people were put forth of the Town. The advice, as truly meant, was hearkned
unto, and direction given to some 24 of the Burgesses that were best affected to the
Ministers,<note place="margin">The Ministers deluded by a counterfeit Letter.</note> to depart the Town within the space of six hours. This they knew would
be ill taken by the Ministers, and to put them in a greater fear, they did advertise
them by a counterfeit Letter to look unto themselves, because <hi>Huntley</hi> had been
with the King that night late, and caused that charge to be given. This Letter sent
to Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> was by him communicate to Mr. <hi>Walter Balcanquall,</hi>

to be true, did think it the safest way for themselves to make the people advertised
of the danger; so when the hour of Sermon came, the Preacher reading his Text
out of the book of <hi>Canticles,</hi> which was his ordinary at that time, and taking occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the present troubles of the Church; he made a particular relation of the
proceedings and <hi>treacherous forms</hi> (so he called them) wherewith they were used by
the Court, laying the whole blame upon the President, Controller, and Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,<note place="margin">He exhorteth the Noblemen and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whom he particularly named, and used with most reproachfull tearms. Then
turning to the Noblemen and Barons, he put them in minde of the zeal which their
predecessours had shewed in planting Religion, and exhorted them with the like
courage and constancy to maintain the same. Having closed the Sermon with a
Prayer, as use is, he requested the Noblemen and Barons to meet in the little
Church, for assisting the Ministery with their best advice.</p>
                     <p>There assembled in the place many people,<note place="margin">A Petition di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the King from the meeting.</note> besides those that were desired, and
so great was the throng, as the Ministers could hardly finde entrance. Mr. <hi>Robert
Bruce</hi> at last having made way unto himself, went to the table where the Noblemen
and Barons were placed, and after a short Prayer, declared in what danger the
Church was brought by the return of the Popish Lords; how they had regrated the
case to the King, and when they expected that order should have been taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
a new business was moved, and one of their Brethren called in question for
his preaching, about which they had been in long conference, but could come to no
end; and that now at last the best affected of their people were charged to leave
the Town, whereby they were brought to suspect some worse practises.<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>R. Bruce</hi> his Speech to those that convened.</note> They did
therefore request them humbly to intercede and intreat his Majesty, that they might

reasonable: the Lords <hi>Lindesey</hi> and <hi>Forbes,</hi> with the Lairds of <hi>Bargenny</hi> and
<hi>Blaquhan,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Watson</hi> were chosen to preferre the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
                     <p>By some occasion the King was that day come to the Session,<note place="margin">The King of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the meeting.</note> and being in the
Upper House, the Lords with these others were admitted, where Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi>
taking the Speech, said, <q>That they were sent by the Noblemen and Barons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
in the little Church to bemoan the dangers threatned to Religion by the
dealing that was against the Ministers and true professours.</q> 
                        <hi>What dangers see you,</hi>
said the King? <q>Under communing, said he, our best affected people, that tender
Religion, are discharged of the Town; the Lady <hi>Huntley</hi> a professed Papist enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at Court, and it is suspected that her husband is not farre off.</q> The King

                        <hi>That they durst doe more then so, and that they
would not suffer Religion to be overthrown.</hi> Numbers of people were at this time
thronging unmannerly into the room: whereupon the King not making any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
arose, and went down to the Lower House where the Judges doe sit, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the doors to be shut. They that were sent returning to the Church shew
that they were not heard, nor was there any hope, so long as the Counsellours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
about the King, that they should receive any favourable answer, and were
therefore to think of some other course.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="428" facs="tcp:50008:227"/>
                        <hi>No course,</hi> said the Lord <hi>Lindesay, but one, let us stay together that are here, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

                        <hi>and advertise our friends and the favourers of Religion to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us; for it shall be either theirs or ours.</hi> Upon these speeches followed such a clamor,
and lifting up of hands, as none could hear what another spake. The sedition increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
some cried to Arme, others to bring out <hi>Haman,</hi> (for whilest the Lords were
with the King, M. <hi>Michael Cranstone</hi> Minister of <hi>Cramond</hi> had been reading to the
people that story) others cried, <hi>The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon:</hi> and so great
was the fury of people, as if one of the Deacons of Crafts-called <hi>Iohn Wat,</hi> had not
kept them back,<note place="margin">A Deacon of the Crafts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaseth the fury of the people.</note> with a guard of Crafts men that followed him, they had undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
forced the doors, and wrought some mischief. Sir <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> Provost
of the Town, was then lying sick, yet being told what a tumult was raised, he came
to the street, and as he was wise and skilfull in handling the people, with his fair
speeches brought them after a little time to lay down their weapons and retire to
their lodgings.</p>
                     <p>The commotion thus raised,<note place="margin">Noble men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected from the King to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the cause of the tumult.</note> the King directed the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Pittenweem</hi> and Laird of <hi>Traquair</hi> to confer with the Ministers, and ask the cause of
the tumult. They were then walking at the back of the Church, (for the tumult
had scattered the meeting) and professing a great dislike of that which had happened,
besought the Noble men to shew the King, that they were not in fault, and had
done their best to appease the multitude. The cause, they said, to their conjecture was,
that his Majesty refused to hear their Petition, which they knew came not from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
but of others. The Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> replied, that any reasonable Petition would be
heard and answered,<note place="margin">The Ministers purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> being preferred in a dutifull manner; wherefore they should do
wisely to go together and supplicate his Majesty for remedy of these things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were grieved. Whereupon they returned to the little Church, and after a
short deliberation, sent the Lord <hi>Forbes,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Bargenny</hi> and M. <hi>Robert Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>
with these Petitions. <q>First, that all which have been done in prejudice of
the Church the last four or five weeks,<note place="margin">A new Petition moved to the King.</note> might be rescinded. Next, that in the
things that concerned the Church, the President, Controller and Advocate
should have no voice, as being suspected in Religion, and opposite enemies to the
Church. Thirdly, that the Citizens of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> who were charged to leave the
Town, might be permitted to stay at home, upon surety to appear whensoever
they were called.</q> The King answered very calmly, <hi>That his doings had been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mistaken by the Ministers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proponed</note> 
                        <hi>and that as these controversies were moved against his will,
so he wished nothing more then to have them quietly setled. But that it could not stand with
his honour to rescind so hastily the conclusions taken in Councell, nor to remove Counsellors
from their places upon naked suspicions, except somewhat could be verified that might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them. At afternoon he should call the Councell and satisfie them in every thing, which
with reason they could desire.</hi> For the <hi>Citizens,</hi> he said, <hi>that the supplications made in their
behalf, would come better from the Provost and Baylifs of the Town, and the same upon
their Petition should be granted.</hi> With these answers the Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> and the rest
returned; and with them the Lord <hi>Ochiltry,</hi> and Laird of <hi>Cesford</hi> were sent by the
King to desire them to put their Petitions in reasonable terms, and await on the
Councell at two of the clock. Matters thus quieted, the King with the Lords went
down the street peaceably to his palace.</p>
                     <p>At afternoon the Noblemen, and Barons assembling with the Ministery, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
long reasoning did condescend upon the supplication and Articles fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>In most humble manner,<note place="margin">Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended upon to be proponed to his Majesty.</note> we the Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses
and Ministers, this day by the mercy of God convened, do beseech your Majesty
to apprehend the great danger wherein the state of Religion, Common-wealth
and your Majesties own honour and person are brought, by the means of crafty
and deceitfull Counsellours, who respecting onely their own preferment and
standing, labour to file your Majesties eyes that you should not perceive their
courses: for albeit it hath pleased God to endue your Majesty with knowledge,
wisdome and graces, beyond all Princes that have ruled this kingdome at any
time, yet it is no strange thing to behold good Kings brought upon ill courses,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:50008:227"/>
by the devices of such as pretend love, but in very deed hate them maliciously.
That such courses are now in hand, please your Majesty to consider what a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is made and entertained between your Majesty, and the Church, who was
ever to this time inseparably joyned; and how under colorable pretexts the liberty
of preaching and faithfull applying of the word, is sought to be restrained and
taken away, which cannot but bring many evils and inconveniencies with it, as
this days tumult may partly teach. And now seeing, blessed be God, the same
is setled without the harm of any person, for preventing the like, or worse, we
humbly desire the Articles following to be weighed and considered by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>1 That professed Papists, processed by the Church, be not suffered to reside at
Court, and that the Lady <hi>Huntley</hi> and Lord <hi>Sauwhar</hi> be removed and sent
home.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>2 That <hi>Alexander Seaton</hi> President, Mr. <hi>Thomas Hamilton</hi> Advocate, and
Mr. <hi>Iames Elphingston</hi> be not admitted to sit in Councell, at least when the cause
of Religion, and matters of the Church are treated, seeing they are enemies to
the quietness thereof, and have by their devices raised the troubles that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
do vex the same</q>.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>3 That the Acts of Councel, Proclamations, Decrees, and Interloquutors passed
in prejudice of the Church and Ministers these last five weeks, be rescinded and
annulled.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>4 That the Commissioners of the Church be recalled by Proclamation, and
the Burgesses of the Town permitted to remain and attend their callings.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>5 That the bond advised by the foresaid enemies to be subscrived by all the
Ministers under the pain of losing their Benefices and stipends, be discharged, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same is prejudiciall to the Gospel, and that Commission, as use is, to
modifie stipends, for the present year.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>Lastly, that an Act of Councell be made allowing the proceedings of the
Church, and the concurrencie given them by the Noblemen, Barons and others
in the present action.</q>

their coming the Councell had concluded not to receive the Petitions, as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and to commit those that did present them, yet doubtfull what might be
the event thereof, it was thought fitter to terrifie them from presenting the same;
for this effect the Lord <hi>Ochiltry</hi> was appointed to meet them at the utter gate, who
drawing <hi>Bargenny</hi> aside advised him to go back, because of the anger which the King
had conceived, and to meddle no more in that business; for the King he said knew
he was brought upon it unwillingly, and would excuse his part, if he went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                        <hi>Bargenny</hi> forthinking his imployment and not knowing how to colour it
to his associates, the Lord <hi>Ochiltry</hi> drew them aside, and said that he had brought
the Laird of <hi>Bargenny</hi> to the Town for affairs that did neerly touch him, and that
he did not think to meet with such business at his coming, therefore desired them to
have his friend excused for that time; and seeing they were a number sufficient
to doe the errand they might goe to it, or if they pleased to delay the same to the
next morrow, he should be with them. They answered, that they were alse little
foreseen at their coming of those matters as he was, and seeing they were all
joyned in one Commission, if he was the principall did decline it, they could doe
nothing by themselves; and so the businese was left for that night.</p>
                     <p>In the morning early the King and Councell departed to <hi>Linlithgow,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The King with the Councell departeth to <hi>Linlithgow.</hi>
                        </note>
leaving a Proclamation which was presently published at the Market Cross of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bough,</hi> of this Tenor. <q>That the King considering the late treasonable uproar
moved by certain factious persons of the Ministery of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> (who after
they had uttered most seditious speeches in Pulpit, did convene a number of
Noblemen, Barons and others in the little Church and sent some of their
number to his Majesty being then in the upper house of Session, using him in a
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:50008:228"/>
most irreverent manner and with speeches ill-beseeming any subject. And that
a multitude of the Townsmen by perswasion of the said Ministery had treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
put themselves in Armes,<note place="margin">A Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on discharging all Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to sit in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                           </note> intending to bereave his Majesty and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of their lives) did think the said Town an unfit place for the ministration of
justice, and had therefore ordained the Lords of Session, the Sheriffs, Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
and Justice, with their severall members and Deputies to remove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
forth of the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and be in readiness to repair unto such
places as should be appointed; commanding in like sort all Noblemen and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
to dispatch unto their houses, and not to presume to convene either in that
or any other place without his Majesties licence, under the pain of his Highness
displeasure.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Proclamation with the Kings suddain departing wrought a great alteration
in the mindes of the people.<note place="margin">A great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the mindes of people.</note> They began then to see their errour, and lookt heavy
one upon another; the better sort being in a great perplexity what they should
doe, called their Councel together, but could not resolve what course to take: To
follow the King and plead for the Town, they could not think any of them would
be accepted; (and it being the last day of the week, hardly would any others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the imployment) so as they saw no way but to be quiet till they heard what
the King and Councell concluded to doe. But the Ministers persisting in their first
resolution laboured to have the Noblemen and Barons remain together, and to
send for others well-affected in Religion, who as they thought would joyn in the
cause.<note place="margin">A Bond for mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence.</note> A Bond to this effect was drawn up, and subscrived by some few. The
Councell of the Town excused themselves, saying. Their good will was known,
and that they were not to leave their dwellings; which made divers keep back their
hands. Alwaies it was thought meet that the Ministers should write to the Lord
<hi>Hamilton</hi> and the Laird of <hi>Bacleugh,</hi> of whose assistance they held themselves assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
intreating them to repair to the Town and countenance the cause, as likewise
that the rest of the Ministers in the Countrey should be convened as unto a Generall
Assembly, and desired to bring with them the best affected Gentlemen within their
Parishes.</p>
                     <p>They were at the same time in a long deliberation,<note place="margin">The excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the President deferred.</note> whether or not they should
excommunicate the Lord President and Advocate, which divers urged. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller
was in some better opinion with them by reason of a Message sent quietly
to M. <hi>Rob: Bruce.</hi> But in end they resolved to continue that business to the meeting
of the Assembly,<note place="margin">A Fast in the City.</note> when the Sentence might be pronounced with greater authority.
Mean while to keep the people in a good disposition, a Fast was proclaimed through
the City, and Sermons of preparation ordained to be made that afternoon in all
the Churches.</p>
                     <p>A Minister named Mr. <hi>Iohn Welch</hi> making offer to supply the place in the high
Church,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Welch</hi> and his Sermon.</note> was allowed to preach, who taking for his theam, the Epistle sent to the
Angel of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> did rail pitifully against the King, saying, <hi>He was
possessed with a Devil; and one Devil being put out seven worse were entred in place. And
that the subjects might lawfully rise, and take the sword out of his hand:</hi> which he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the example of <hi>a Father that falling in a phrensie might be taken by the Children
and servants of the family, and tied hand and foot from doing violence.</hi> A most execrable
Doctrine and directly repugnant to holy Scriptures; which yet was taken by many
of the hearers, as a sound and free application: so ready are men to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in wickedness,<note place="margin">A rumour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed that <hi>Arroll</hi> had some forces assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</note> and even to justifie impiety it self. A rumour was then also
dispersed about the Town, that in the day of tumult the Earl of <hi>Arroll</hi> did come to
the <hi>Queens ferry</hi> with 500 horse, and was gone back upon report of the stirre. This
upon the Sunday took up a great part of the Ministers Sermons, and was brought
to justifie the multitudes proceedings, as though they had been directed by a secret
providence to disappoint the wicked practises that were in hand. A manifest for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
it was, yet believed at the same time by foolish and credulous people.</p>
                     <p>The Messenger sent to the Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> was at his coming well received;<note place="margin">The copie of the Letter sent to the Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> shewed to the King.</note> at
first the Nobleman made a shew that he would go for <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but upon better

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:50008:228"/>
unto him (for he rendred the principall to the bearer) he shewed the King what an
invitation he had from those at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The King at sight of the Letter grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
angry, for therein after a short narrative of the injuries the Church had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the malice of some Counsellors, it was said, That <hi>the people animated by the
word, and motion of Gods Spirit had gone to Armes, and that the godly Barons and other
Gentlemen that were in Town, had convened themselves and taken on them the patrocinie
of the Church, and her cause: only they lacked a Head and speciall Noblemen to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the matter, and since with one consent they had made choice of his Lordship, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
was that he should come to</hi> Edinburgh <hi>with all convenient diligence, and utter his
affection to the good cause, accepting the honour which was offered unto him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Letter endited by Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi>

Balcanquell,</hi> was of all that yet had happened the worst, nor could it receive any
good construction; for albeit in an apologie afterwards set forth, it was said to be
penned only to please the Nobleman, who was of an ambitious humour; yet put
the case he had accepted, and taken before him to be their Head as he was desired,
who can tell what mischief might have ensued, and if it might not have turned to
the wrack and ruine of many innocents? But faults follow one upon another, and
when men have once passed bounds, they run easily into errour.</p>
                     <p>On Munday early,<note place="margin">A charge for apprehending the Ministers.</note> a Charge was directed to the Provost and Bailiffs for impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning

in <hi>England.</hi> The Town the same day sent <hi>Iohn Arnot, Hugh Brown, George
Heriot,</hi> and <hi>Iohn VVat,</hi> to purge themselves of the Tumult, and offer their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in every thing his Majesty and Councell should be pleased to enjoyn for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
the indignity and dishonour done to his Highness; providing they should
not be thought guilty of the crime,<note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation offered by the Town. The tumult declared trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by act of Counsell.</note> which from their hearts they detested. But
the King would receive no purgation, saying, <hi>That fair and humble words could not
excuse such a fault, and that he should come ere it were long, and let them know he was
their King.</hi> The next day in Councell, the Tumult was declared to be treason,
and the Devisers, Executors, and Partakers to be Traitors, as likewise all that
should thereafter partake and assist the committers thereof.</p>
                     <p>This put the Town in a great fear,<note place="margin">The Town employed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers towards the King.</note> neither did they expect any other then an utter
ruine. All the Judicatories were removed to <hi>Leth;</hi> the Session ordained to sit at
<hi>Perth</hi> after the first of <hi>February;</hi> their Ministers were fled, the Magistrates not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded;
and those of greatest power about the King their enemies; what they
should doe they were doubtfull: after divers opinions given, they are resolved that
some should be sent who would be more acceptable, to supplicate the King, and
excuse the Towns part, for that perhaps would be taken better at other mens
hands then any of their own. To this errand none was held so sit, as Mr. <hi>David
Lindesey</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Preston,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Sharpe,</hi> men in favour with the King, and
free of all faction.</p>
                     <p>These coming to the King at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by those that were sent by the Town.</note> after they had shewed the miserable
estate of the Town, and how grieved all honest men were for the displeasure he
had conceived against them; did beseech him not to use the extremity of rigour,
but to put a difference between the innocent and guilty. <q>In great Towns such
as that was, <hi>they said,</hi> there would ever be some bad spirits, and if the insolencies
of a rascall multitude should be imputed to the Town, it would be thought hard,
specially since the Magistrates had done their duties and repressed the Tumult.
If on their part there had been any connivence, or the smallest appearance that
they did favour the sedition, they protested, that they would not have opened
their mouths in their favour, but since it was known that none were more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the Tumult then they, and that they were carefull to finde out the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
and present them to punishment, they could not but humbly entreat his
Majesty to relent his wrath, and to be mitigated towards the Town.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The King after a little pause answered,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Majesties answer.</note> That he could not think the Town to be free,
for if some of the Principalls had not approved the Multitude in their doings, the Tumult
could not have been so great, but howsoever the Magistrates negligence could not be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
in so farre as they did not prevent the disorder; alwaies his resolution was to proceed
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:50008:229"/>
by form of law, and not to use any violent course; but he had appoynted the Estates to meet
in the same place where the dishonor was done unto him, and would follow their advice
both in the triall and punishment. <hi>With this answer they were dimitted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last of <hi>December,</hi>

                        </note> which was the day preceding the Convention, the King
came to <hi>Leth</hi> and stayed there all night, giving order for his entry into the Town
the next morning, which was in this manner, The keys of the Town being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to one of the Kings Officers, a guard of armed men was placed in the streets,
and the Citizens being commanded to stay within their houses and forbidden to
carry any weapon. The Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> with the Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> and <hi>Ochiltrie</hi> had
the charge of the Town given them, without the admission of the Magistrates;
and they having disposed all things in the best fashion, the King accompanyed
with a great train of Nobles, entered the Town, and riding up the street lighted at
the <hi>Tolbuith;</hi> where the Estates were appointed to meet; after some generall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of the Tumult, the King was advised to call the Magistrates and hear
what they could say in behalf of the Town.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> of <hi>North-berwick</hi> Provost,<note place="margin">Offers made by the Town for pacifying his Majesties anger.</note> 
                        <hi>Roger Matmath, George Todrick,
Patrick Cothran,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Hunter</hi> Bayliffes, with a number of the Town
Councell compeiring and falling on their knees, after some few words delivered by
the Provost, did present in writing the offers following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That for pacifying his Majesties wrath and satisfying the Lords of Councell,
they should upon their great oath purge themselves of all foreknowledge and
partaking in that seditious Tumult. And as already they had made a diligent
search to find out the authors, so they should not cease till they had brought the
triall unto the uttermost point: or if his Majesty and Councell doe think any
others more fit to take the examination, they should willingly resigne their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to such as his Highnes would appoint, and assist them at their power. And
because his Majesty had taken that Tumult to proceed from certain Sermons
preached by their Ministers, who were now denounced Rebels, they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
never to readmit any of those Ministers, unless his Majesty did command
otherwise. As also that the like should not fall out thereafter, the Town should
be obliged never to receive any Minister in time coming, but by his Majesties ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and approbation; and in the election of their Magistrates, they should
yearly present their lites to his Majesty and the Lords of Session, to be allowed
or disallowed at their pleasure, and propone such others as his Majesty should
think more apt and sufficient for the Charge, and to that effect, should alter the
time of their election, and make the same on some day of <hi>November,</hi> when the
Lords of Session were conveened a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d might give their advice thereto. They
did lastly offer to fulfill whatsoever his Majesty and Councell should think fit to
be done in the premises, under protestation that they did not take upon them
the crime, and that it should not be thought to have been committed of their
foreknowledge.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus it proved true,<note place="margin">The effects of the mutiny contrary to that which was intended.</note> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith, that <hi>all conspiracies of the Subjects, if they
succeed not, advance the Soveraignty:</hi> for by this Tumult was the Kings authority

thereafter.</p>
                     <p>The offers of the Town,<note place="margin">Advice given to raze the Town.</note> howbeit made in great submission, were not accepted,
and counsell given by some Noblemen to raze the Town, and erect a Pillar in

nothing was concluded.</p>
                     <p>The Queen of <hi>England</hi> upon notice sent to her of these broiles, did write to the
King a letter, which (for the loving advice it contained) I thought meet here
to insert.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>

now Pen-speech, as being carefull of your quiet, and mindfull of your safety. To omit
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:50008:229"/>
the expressing of both, by letting you know how untimely I take this new begun phrensie
that may urge you to take such a course as may bring into opinion the verifying of such a
scandall, as ye avowed to me to be farre from your thought. In this sort I mean it, some
members of the Church with their companies, have over audaciously emboldened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to redress some injurious acts that they feared might overthrow their profession,
which though I grant no King for the manner ought to bear with, yet at the instant when
the new banished Lords returned, and they seen to be winked at without restraint, and the
spring time going on, when promised succour is attend, together with many letters from
<hi>Rome</hi> and elsewhere sent abroad, to tell the names of men authorized by you, as they say,
(though I hope falsly) to assure your conformity, as time may serve you, to establish the
dangerous party and fail your own. I wail in unfeigned sort, that any just cause should be
given you, to call in doubt so disguised acts, and hope that you will so try this cause, as
that it harm not you, though it ruine them.</p>
                           <p>Of this you may be sure, that if you make your strength of so sandy a foundation, as to
call to your aid such as be not of your flock, when as the one side be foolish, rash, headstrong,
and brainsick, yet such as may defend you, having no sure anchorage for themselves, if
you fail them; and the others, who have other props to sustain them, though they lack you,
yea such as though your private love to their persons, may inveigle your eyes, not to pierce
in the depth of their treason; yet it is well known, that their many petitions for forain
aid, might have tended to your perill, and your Countreys wrack; for seldome comes a
stranger to a weaker soyl, that thralleth not the possessour, or indangereth him at least.
I trust you think no less; or else they must justifie themselves to condemne you, for without
your displeasure, not feared for such a fact, no answer can shield them from blame. Now
to utter my folly in seeming busie in anothers affairs, I suppose you will not mislike, since
the source of all is care of your good, to desire that nought be done that may embolden
the enemy, decrease your love, and endanger your surety: This is in summe the line whereto
I tend, and God I beseech to direct your heart in such sort, as ye please not your worst sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,

                     <p>This letter was to the Kings mind, for albeit he judged the offence great,<note place="margin">The letter pleased the King well.</note> yet it
was not his purpose to use rigour,<note place="margin">The tumult declared Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Convention of Estates.</note> but to assure the obedience of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in time coming, and make his own advantage of their disorders. Therefore
in the next meeting, which was kept at <hi>Halyrudhouse,</hi> the tumult being of new
declared to be treason by the Estates, no further was done, but a conclusion taken
to pursue the Town criminally before the Justice;<note place="margin">The Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> charged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at <hi>Perth.</hi>
                        </note> and to charge the Provost,

                     <p>In this convention the <hi>Octavians</hi> not according well amongst themselves (for

hands. They pretended the many burthens, which they sustained otherwise,
their services in Councell, and Session, with the charge of the Queens Rent and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
but the true cause was, the malice and envy caried unto them for the credit
and place they had with the King, which their service had well deserved; for never
were the rents of the Crown so thriftily, and so rightly used as in that short time of
their employment. But the King loved to have peace though with his owne losse,
neither did they like to be the instruments of his trouble.</p>
                     <p>A little before these stirres with the Church,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Iames Stewart</hi> killed.</note> Captaine <hi>Iames Stewart</hi> (who had

<hi>Iames Dowglas</hi> of <hi>Torthorald.</hi> This man after he was put from Court had lived ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
in the North parts, and was entertained by the Lady <hi>Salton</hi> his sister in-law,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:50008:230"/>
being in some hope to come again by the office of Chancellarie, which was yet
void by the death of the Lord <hi>Thirlestan,</hi> he came South, and had a long conference
with the King, which did greatly encourage him, but till matters might be better
prepared, he took purpose to visit his friends in <hi>Kyle.</hi> Taking his journey by <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington</hi>
nigh unto <hi>Dowglas,</hi> he was advised by his friends in those parts to look to
himself, and not ride so openly because of <hi>Tortherald</hi> that lived not farre off,
whose Uncle he had followed (as they spake) to the death. His reply (as he was a
man proud and disdainfull) That he would not leave his way for him, nor for all the
name of <hi>Dowglas,</hi> being overheard by a fellow, and reported to <hi>Tortherald,</hi> did
so inflame him, the old ulcer remaining uncured, as he avouched to have his life at
all hazards. So getting intelligence that he had taken horse, he made after him
with three of his servants, and overtaking him in a valley called <hi>Catslack,</hi> after he
had stricken him from his horse, did kill him without any resistance. It is said that
when Captain <hi>Iames</hi> saw the horsemen following, he asked how they called the
piece of ground on which they were, and when he heard the name of it, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the company to ride more quickly, as having gotten a response to beware
of such a part: he was a man full of violence, and when he was in place of rule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
it with much cruelty, which was now payed home in the end.</p>

for treating and determining the bounds and exercise of the spirituall jurisdiction;
and to the end that all might come the better prepared, and be duly advised with

imprinted with a Preface,<note place="margin">Articles pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in print for the better preparation to the Assembly.</note> wherein he <hi>took God the searcher of all hearts to record, that
his intention was not to trouble the peace of the Church by thorny questions, nor yet to claim
to himself any tyrannicall or unlawfull government over the same, but only to have these
doubts solved, which might either in his time, or in the time of his successours engender

upon another, or any other Schisme falleth out, should not a Christian King
amend such disorders?</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>How soon these Questions were divulged,<note place="margin">The Ministers greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with these Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and that its seen they all touched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the abuses crept into the discipline, the Ministers that stood affected to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
order were much perplexed, neither did any thing more offend them, then
that the government should be brought in dispute, which they had given out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to be a part of the Gospel. This at any hand they thought was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented;
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:50008:231"/>
and many private Conferences were kept to this purpose: neither did
the King neglect to provide himself of a party against that meeting; and thinking
he should gain most easily the Ministers in the North parts,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Patrick Murray</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the North to deal with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> he employed Sir <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Murray</hi> Gentleman of his Chamber, to deal with them, giving him direction
first to shew what a slander the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> had brought upon Religion
by stirring up of the late uproar, and the inciting of the Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and others
of the Nobility to open Rebellion against him; how for the same they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Fugitives, and denounced his Majesties Rebells; and thereupon to desire
them by some publick Act or Declaration to utter their dislike of the seditious
and treasonable courses. He was next desired to urge their subscription to the
Bond, which was appointed to be subscribed by the Ministers for acknowledging
his Majesties Royall power above them in all causes of sedition, treason, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
civill and criminall matters, and in all speeches uttered by them in Pulpits,
Schools, or otherwise, which might import the said crimes, or any of them. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, To
require them to accept the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> his offers for satisfying the Church, and
to absolve him from his Excommunication, they finding his offers reasonable,
seeing <hi>the bosome of the Church ought alwaies to be open to penitents;</hi> and that they
should be more ready to receive then cast out; wherefore as the Presbytery of
S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> to the which he was not subject, had pronounced him excommunicate,
they under whose jurisdiction he lived, might and ought with better reason declare
him absolved. Neither should the pretext of the Generall Assemblies ratification
of the sentence be a stay unto them, considering it was done many moneths after the
pronouncing of the sentence, and that the absolution they should give might in the
like manner be ratified at the next Assembly; much lesse ought the prohibition of
the Presbyterie of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> (whereof his Majesty was informed) be any hindrance,
to them, seeing they were neither subject, nor subordinate to them, but as free in
all respects as themselves.</p>
                     <p>And if any doubt should arise upon the form of the Earls satisfaction, he was
to remember them, that the same is expresly defined in the Act of Parliament, <hi>An.</hi>
1572, made against Apostates, and other adversar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es of the true Religion, where it
is said, <hi>That they which have made defection from the truth, should not be received to our
Soveraigne Lords mercy and favour, till they have given of new the confession of their
faith, and promised to continue in the profession thereof all time coming, and to fortifie the
Preachers of the same against whatsoever enemies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Last of all, he was appointed to deliver them a Copie of the imprinted Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to desire the most discreet of their number to be sent Commissioners to
the Assembly appointed at <hi>Perth,</hi> with promise of speciall favour to them in all
their businesse, his good will towards the Ministery being no way altered by the
wrong he had received from those insolent Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> This was the
substance of his instructions.</p>
                     <p>The Ministers with the reverence that was due,<note place="margin">The Ministers Answer.</note> That for <hi>the Tumult
of Edinburgh</hi> they were ignorant of the Ministers behaviour therein, as likewise of
their flight; and having no jurisdiction over them, they could give forth no
judgment or censure; only in the generall they would say, that whosoever with
just triall should be found authors of that Insurrection deserved to be punished as
Traytors, and if they were Ministers, to be doubly punished.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>their subscription to the Bonds,</hi> They answered, That at their acception of the
Ministery they had taken oath for acknowledging his Majesties power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and would not decline the same; but where the Bond did mention speeches
uttered in pulpit, because the same concerned application of doctrine, which his
Majesty had proponed, as a Question to be decided in the approaching Assembly,
they did humbly entreat his Majesty to spare them in that point, unto that time,
which they promised precisely to keep.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>the Earl of Huntley,</hi> they said, His repentance should be most acceptable to
them; that they were content to give him conference, and use all means for his
resolution; but they did not finde him so willing to conform as they wished, nor
very earnest for his absolution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="438" facs="tcp:50008:232"/>
This was the summe of their Answer; which the King did accept the better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the hopes given to his servant of all satisfaction on their parts at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Perth:</hi> which they also performed; for both then and afterwards in all As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
and conventions they did stick fast unto him. But the King being made
to understand that <hi>Huntley</hi> did linger and delay to make offers for satisfying the
Church, he sent him the Letter following written all with his own hand.</p>

guilty persons being fugitive for the crimes, or the declaration of an Assise, or their
excommunication for the same.</p>
                     <p>4 That every Minister in his particular application have onely respect to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of his own flock, and present auditory, without expatiating in other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
no way pertinent to their congregation.</p>
                     <p>5 That every particular Presbytery be commanded to take a diligent accompt
of the doctrine of their Ministers, and see that they keep themselves within bounds
in the premises.</p>
                     <p>6 That summar excommunication be utterly discharged, and that three lawfull
citations at least of eight daies intervall betwixt every one of them, precede the
sentence.</p>
                     <p>7 That no Session, Prebytery, or Synod use Censures upon any but those that
are within their bounds, otherwise their decreets and sentences to be null.</p>
                     <p>8 That all summons contain a speciall cause and crime, and none be used <hi>super
inquirendis, quod est merè tyrannicum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9 That no meeting or convention be amongst the Ministers without his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
knowledge and consent, except the ordinary Sessions, Presbyteries and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</p>
                     <p>10 That in the principall Burghs no Ministers be placed without the consent of
his Majesty, and the flock; and this order to begin presently in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11 That all matters concerning the rest of his Majesties Questions be suspended,
and neither condemned nor rebuked, either in pulpit, or any other judicatory, till
the same be decided in the next Generall Assembly; especially that no matters be
called before the Ecclesiasticall judicatories, as importing slander, wherein his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
authority may be prejudged; but that they meddle only with causes meerly
Ecclesiasticall.</p>
                     <p>12 That some wise and discreet Ministers to the number of seven or eight, be
authorised by Commission, to reason upon the rest of the Questions, when oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of time shall serve.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, that the present Assembly grant Commission to the Ministers of the
North Countrey, to absolve the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> from his Excommunication, if he
satisfie the Church.</p>
                     <p>For the better determining of the said Articles.<note place="margin">The advice of certain Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren set apart to consider the Articles,</note> it was thought meet that some
brethren should be desired to conferre of them apart, and report their opinions to
the Assembly, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they did the next morning. Touching the <hi>first Article,</hi> they said,
that they held it not expedient to make any law, or act concerning that matter, lest
a door should be opened thereby to turbulent spirits; otherwise they did think it
lawfull to his Majesty by himself or by his Commissioners to propone in a Generall
Assembly whatsoever point his Majesty desired to be resolved in, or to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>in specie externi ordinis,</hi> seeing <hi>substantia externae administrationis Ecclesiasticae,
est plenissimè prodita in sacris literis.</hi> And as the Generall Assembly hath accepted
well of this manner of doing in all times past, so in their opinion they should doe the
like in time coming.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>second</hi> their advice was, that the Acts already made which are hurtfull
to Religion and prejudiciall to the liberty of the Word, should be discharged, and
no Act thereafter past concerning Religion without the advice and consent of the
Church. As for matters of Estate mentioned in the Article, they craved a further
explanation of that point.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> they esteemed reasonable, that no mans name should be expressed to
his rebuke in pulpit, unlesse the fault was notorious and publick, but they esteemed
<hi>notoriety</hi> must be defined otherwise then by the three waies set down in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle;
for contumacy after citation, the publick commission of a crime, such as
was <hi>Bothwell's</hi> treasonable contempt at <hi>Leth,</hi> the Burning of <hi>Dumebirsell,</hi> and the
like, make also a notoriety. As to the <hi>vive description,</hi> said to be <hi>equivalent,</hi> they
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:50008:233"/>
thought it hard to set any law to that, seeing every guilty person will think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
descrived, when his fault is rebuked, albeit the Minister doth not think of
him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>fourth,</hi> and <hi>fift</hi> Articles they judged lawfull: but for the <hi>sixth,</hi> which craves
a simple charge of summar Excommunication, they advised to remit the same to
the next Assembly, suspending the practice thereof, in the mean time: the <hi>seaventh,</hi>
they thought likewise was to be remitted: to the <hi>eighth</hi> they agreed; and for the
<hi>nineth</hi> that concerned the meeting of Pastors, they said that besides Sessions, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries
and Synods, Pastors are accustomed to meet, for visitation of Churches,
admission of Ministers, taking up of feods, resolving of questions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>tenth</hi> they esteemed reasonable; the <hi>eleventh</hi> Article seeming to import a
discharge of many points of discipline, they said, was so large that it could not be
presently answered; and the <hi>last two</hi> they remitted to the full Assembly judging
that they ought to be granted.</p>
                     <p>These answers shewed to the King were not liked,<note place="margin">The Assembly required to meet with the Estates.</note> and held unsufficient; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Assembly was desired to repair to the place where his Majesty and the
Estates were convened for treating upon the foresaid Articles: at their coming the
King had a speech much to this purpose; <q>That they could not be ignorant either of
the occasion or of his purpose in calling the present Assembly; and for the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it grieved him to remember it, not for any injury or displeasure done to
himself, but for the shame and slander cast upon Religion; for have not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
said he, too just a ground against us, who say that our profession teacheth
the contempt of Princes, and maintains insurrections against them? I know it is
the fault of men and not of the profession, and none of you that are met here, I
take to be guilty of the late attempt, but it is in your hands to clear your selves,
if any think otherwise, and so to free your profession of that scandall. As for the
purpose for which I have called you together at this time, it is to mend such things
as are amisse, and to take away the questions that may move trouble afterward: if
you for your parts be willing to have matters righted, things may yet go well.
I claim nothing but what is due to every Christian King within his dominion, that
is to be <hi>Custos &amp; vindex disciplinae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> Corruptions are crept in, and more daily
growing by this liberty, that preachers take in the application of their doctrine,
and censuring every thing that is not to their mind. This I must have mended;
for such discourses serve onely to move sedition and raise tumults. Let the truth
of God be taught in the Chair of truth, and wickedness be reproved but in such
sort as the offender may be bettered, and vice made more odious. To rail against
men in Pulpit, and express their names as we know was done of late, there being
no just cause, and make the word of God which is ordained to guide men in the
way of salvation, an instrument of sedition, is a sin, I am sure, beyond all other that
can be committed on earth: hold you within your limits, and I will never blame
you, nor suffer others to work you any vexation. The civill Government is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to me, it is not your subject, nor are ye to medle with it.</q> After such words
as these he began to speak of the Articles proponed, desiring to hear what reasons
they had to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Buchannan,</hi> as he was appointed, did first protest in the name of the
Assembly,<note place="margin">Protestation made by Mr. <hi>Tho: Buchannan</hi> in name of the Church.</note> 
                        <q>That their coming to that place, was onely to testifie their obedience
to his Majesty, and to hear what shall be proponed, but not to submit matters
Ecclesiastick, either concerning doctrine or discipline. to their Judicatory; or yet
to make themselves one Assembly with the Estates; and that therefore they
should be permitted to return to the place of their Assembly to treat, reason, and
conclude in the points moved unto them according to the word of God and good
consciences: which protestation was admitted.</q> Then he did humbly thank his
Majesty for his good affection to the Church, and care he had to redress things that
were amiss in so peaceable a manner. And for the particulars proponed, he shewed
what was the minde of the Assembly, and the reasons that led them unto it, saying,
they were willing to hear and give place to better information. Hereupon ensued a
reasoning, which kept a long time, and ended in a good agreementL: so the ministers
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:50008:233"/>
were dimitted, and Assembling again in the ordinary place, they corrected their first
answers in this sort.</p>
                     <p>1 That it is lawfull to his Majesty by himself or his Commissioners,<note place="margin">The answers of the Articles reformed.</note> or to the
Pastors, to propone in a generall Assembly whatsoever point his Majesty, or they
desire to be resolved, or reformed in matters of externall government, alterable
according to circumstances, providing it be done in right time and place, <hi>animo aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficandi
non tentandi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 That no Minister should reprove his Majesties Laws, Acts, Statutes, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
unto such time as first he hath by the advice of his Presbytery, Synodall or
generall Assemblies, complained and sought remedy of the same from his Majesty,
and made report of his Majesties answer before any further proceeding.</p>
                     <p>3 That no mans name should be expressed in Pulpit to his rebuke, except the
fault be notorious, and publick; which notoriety is thus defined; if the person be
fugitive, convict by Assise, excommunicate, contumax after citation or lawfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition;
nor yet should any man be descrived vively by any other circumstances
then publick vices always damnable.</p>
                     <p>4 That no Minister should use application, wherein he hath not a principall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the edifying of his own flock, and present auditory.</p>
                     <p>5 That every Presbyter take diligent accompt of the Pastors doctrine, and that
he keep himself within the bounds of his words.</p>
                     <p>6 That the answers of the sixth Article shall be superseded unto the next generall
Assembly, suspending in the mean time all summary excommunication unto the
said Assembly.</p>
                     <p>7 That the seventh Article be remitted to the next Assembly.</p>
                     <p>8 That all summons contain the speciall cause and crime, and none to be given
out <hi>super inquirendis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9 That no conventions shall be amongst the Pastors without his Majesties know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and consent; except their Sessions, Presbyteries and Synods the meetings of
the visitations of Churches, admission or deprivation of Ministers, taking up
of deadly fewds, and the like which have not been found fault with by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</p>
                     <p>10 That in all principall Towns the Ministers shall not be chosen without his
Majesties consent, and the consent of the flock.</p>
                     <p>11 That all matters concerning remnant questions shall be suspended, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
damned nor rebuked in Pulpit or other Judicatories till they be decided in the
generall Assembly; and that no matters importing slander shall be called before them
in the mean time, wherein his Majesties authority is prejudged, causes Ecclesiasticall
onely excepted.</p>
                     <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Persons nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to reason the questions.</note> for reasoning the said questions according to his Majesties desire the
Assembly did ordain Mr. <hi>Iames Nicolson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Coldelewch,</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew

Mr. <hi>Robert Howy, Iohn Duncanson,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Bryson</hi> to convene at such time
and place, as his MaJestie should be pleased to appoint, and to report their opinion
and advice to the next generall Assembly.</p>
                     <p>These conclusions taken, which for a beginning did satisfie the King,<note place="margin">Commission given for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving the Popish Lords.</note> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
was also given at his Majesties desire to the Ministers of <hi>Aberdene</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi>
with some others of <hi>Mernis</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> for reconciling the Popish Lords. The
conditions required of <hi>Huntley</hi> to be fulfilled before his absolution were</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>1 That he should appear before the Commissioners appointed by the Assembly

                           </note> and remain in that City during the time of their
conference with him, to the effect he might be instructed in the truth, and brought
to condescend with knowledge unto the religion professed, and to the detestation
of the contrary. 2 That he should acknowledge the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be a
true Church, and adjoyn himself thereto, hear the Word, receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and be obedient to the discipline thereof. 3 That he should solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to remove forth of his company, and from the bounds that were under his
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:50008:234"/>
power, all Jesuits, Priests, and excommunicate persons. 4 That he swear and
subscribe the confession of the faith in presence of the whole Commissioners.
5 That he acknowledge the sentence of excommunication to have been justly
pronounced against him for his apostasie from the truth, the slaughter of the
Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> and burning of <hi>Dumbrissill,</hi> and that he declare himself penitent
therefore, promising asfithment to the partie whensoever he should be moved
to accept the same. 6 That he provide sufficient maintenance to the Churches
within his bounds by the advice of his best advised friends, and have an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Minister to reside with him in his family. And lastly, that he be content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
with all that he is esteemed to carry any grudge unto; and profess no
quarrell to any of those that assisted the King in his pursuit.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like conditions were required of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arroll</hi> (that which concerned
the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> only excepted.)<note place="margin">The like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arroll.</hi>
                        </note> All matters being thus peaceably accorded,
the King caused publish the good agreement he had made with the Church, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in his protection the Ministers with their families, goods and possessions,<note place="margin">The King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</note> and
charging all Papists (those excepted that were in tearms of satisfaction) to depart

                     </p>
                     <p>The Assembly finding the King so well pleased,<note place="margin">The Assembly intercedes for the Ministery of <hi>Edunburgh,</hi> and others charged with the tumuls.</note> made bold to intercede for
the Ministers, the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the Gentlemen that were challenged
for the tumult. For the Town his Majesty answered, <hi>that he was not minded to
trouble innocent men, and should shortly settle with them.</hi> Touching the Gentlemen he
said, <hi>they should doe well to present their supplications by their friends;</hi> But for the
Ministers, <hi>he esteemed them most guilty, and knew not what course to take with them.</hi> It
being replyed, that by the examinations taken it appeared that they all, especially
Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> was a chief instrument in the staying of the tumult, and that they
should therefore be rather rewarded then punished.<note place="margin">The Kings answer.</note> He answered, <hi>that granting they
did stay the tumult, yet they were the cause of it, and if they for that fault were first cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
he would not not be much troubled with their reward.</hi> Nottheless at the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
request he would be content they should be relaxed upon caution to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the triall of Law. Thus an end was put to that meeting, and the next As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
by his Majesties consent appointed to be at <hi>Dundy</hi> the 10. of <hi>May</hi>
following.</p>
                     <p>This year Mr. <hi>Iohn Lesly</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi> departed this life at <hi>Bruxels</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The death of Mr. <hi>Iohn Lesly</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rosse.</hi>
                        </note> where for the most part he abode after the Queen of <hi>Scotlands</hi> execution.
A man (though differing from us in Religion) worthy to be remembred for his
fidelity to the Queen his Mistress, and the extraordinary pains he took to procure
her liberty, travelling with all the neighbour Princes to interpose their credit with
the Qu. of <hi>England</hi> for her relief: neither was he deficient otherwise in ministring
the best consolations he could furnish for bearing patiently her cross, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one treatise he afterwards published full of piety and learning. How heavily
he took her death, it cannot well be expressed: yet comforting himself in the
best sort he could, he put off to this time, and being much weakned by a languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sickness that held him some moneths he ended quietly his days. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of his Countrey from the beginning of the Nation unto these last times
written by him in the Latin Tongue, doth witness both his learning and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It being just to give unto every man (albeit an enemy) his due commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
I could not pass him unremembred. Mr. <hi>David Lindesay</hi> Minister at
<hi>Leth</hi> was in the year following provided to that Sea.</p>
                     <p>The Diet assigned for the appearing of the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> at <hi>Perth</hi> was
upon their petition continued first to the 15 day of <hi>February,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</note> and from the 15
again put off to the 1 day of <hi>March,</hi> with a declaration, <q>That if two of the
Bayliffes, with the Deane of <hi>Guild,</hi> Treasurer, four of the principall Deacons,
four of the Councell and their Clerk, making 13 in all, did enter themselves the
said day and bring a sufficient Commission from the Provost, Bayliffes, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
and Community of the Town for underlying the order that should be taken
with them,</q> as representing the whole body, their compeirance by so many
should serve for all the rest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="443" facs="tcp:50008:234"/>
It was the 5.<note place="margin">An. 1597.</note> of <hi>March</hi> before they were called, at which time there appeared
a number of persons and presented a procuratory under the seal of the Town,
and the subscription of the Clerks thereof, which his Majesty caused to be read.
Then asked if all contained in the Commission were present: it was answered
that they were all there, <hi>William Mauld</hi> excepted, who had his Majesties letter of
dispensation, which they produced; But the same being granted the 11, of <hi>Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
long before the deliverance upon their petition, which expressely ordained
that they should have thirteen persons present for undergoing the triall, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be no warrant, and so for not fulfilling the Ordinance of the Councell
the Town was denounced, the burgesses declared Rebels, and their <hi>Common goods</hi>
(so they call the rents belonging to the Town) arrested to the Kings use.</p>
                     <p>It was pitifull to behold the desolation wherein the Town was then cast, The
Magistrates renounced their Offices and would carry no more Charge, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were left without direction wanting both Magistrates and Ministers,<note place="margin">The Town re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of Noblemen.</note> and in this
state did they continue for the space of fifteen days. At last by the intercession
of some Noblemen, the King was pleased to receive the Town in favour, and
the Provost, Bayliffes, Councell and Deacons of Crafts being brought unto his
presence at <hi>Halyrudhouse</hi> the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> and falling upon their knees did with
tears beg pardon for their negligence in not timely preventing that Tumult, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
(as they said) by a number of ill disposed people, beseeching his Majesty to
take pity of the Town which did submit it self simply to his Hghness mercy.
The King after he had sharply rebuked them, and shewed in many words the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their offence, commanded them to remove that he might think what was
fittest to be done. Then calling for their Officers they had formerly made he
caused eke unto them the Articles following.<note place="margin">Articles injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Town.</note> 
                        <q>That the lodgings in the Church
`yard wherein the Ministers dwelt, and kept their consultations, should be given
to his Majesty and used at his pleasure. That the Ministers that should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
serve in the Town should dwell in their own quarters and live dispersed,
That the Town should be obliged, for the indemnity of the Lords of Session du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their sitting, under the penaltie of forty thousand marks. That the neather
Councell house wherein the Provost and Bayliffes did keep their meetings should
be appointed for the Exchequer; and that for the offence committed the Town
should be fined in twenty thousand marks to be paid in four moneths.</q> These
conditions accepted, the King did pardon the Town giving order to receive them
to his peace, and by Proclamation recalled the Session to sit in their former place.
Never did any King, considering the offence, temper his authority with more
grace and clemency then did his Majesty at this time: which the people did all
acknowledge, ascriving their life and safety only to his favour.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after, the Ministers were also permitted to return, and had their peace
granted,<note place="margin">The Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> suffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to preach.</note> but were not suffered to preach in their places, the King taking now the
occasion of finishing the work, which some two years before had been moved, for
distributing the People in severall Parishes and planting more Ministers among
them. The let he knew was in the Town that still put off the business, because
of the burthen it would draw upon them; and knowing that the desire they had
to have their old Ministers reponed, would make them the more forward that way,
he refuses to readmit them untill the distribution intended was perfected, and other
four Ministers adjoyned to them for the better instruction and more orderly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the People. The Ministers themselves did also profess that they were
wearied of that <hi>confused Ministery,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An Assembly at <hi>Dundy.</hi>
                        </note> as they called it, and compeiting in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
which held at the time appointed in <hi>Dundie,</hi> they resigned their offices, denying
to serve any longer, unless they had a particular flock designed. But because that
work required a longer time, then the Assembly could well abide together, the
same was committed to certain delegates, and the Ministers dwelling neer unto <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi>
ordained to furnish the Pulpits for the interim.</p>
                     <p>In the Assembly Mr. <hi>Robert Rollock</hi> was elected to preside,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Robert Rollock</hi> elected to preside,</note> though he was not

Ministers travells with the Earls of <hi>Angus, Huntley, Arrol,</hi> and of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the injunctions given in the former Assembly. This was testified by the
Ministers that had the charge, to have been in all points so well performed, as no
more could be required of them. For verifying thereof their severall subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
were produced, together with an humble supplication to the Assembly for
accepting their satisfaction, and receiving them in the bosome of the Church:
which accordingly was decerned, and order given that they should be received by
the same Commissioners,<note place="margin">Order given for absolution of the Popish Lords.</note> who were appointed to meet at a certain time, and
pronounce their absolution.</p>
                     <p>The next thing proponed was touching the questions left unresolved in the last
Assembly,<note place="margin">Proceedings of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> and because exception was taken by some brethren that were absent at

The Assembly will be very glad to have his Majesties authority interponed

                     <p>Howsoon the Assembly dissolved,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Patrick Murray</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the North.</note> Sir <hi>Patrick Murray</hi> was sent by the King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the North to see the Conditions made by the three Earls to the Church
performed, and to assist the Commissioners appointed for their absolution. He
had further in charge to cause them to subscrive the generall bonds for the peace
and quietness of the Countrey, and to find caution each of them under the pain of
Twenty thousand pounds, to traffick nor keep intelligence with any forainers
without his Majesties licence by word or writing; particularly for the Earl of
<hi>Huntly</hi> it is injoyned, that he should follow the counsell of certain Barons, and
Ministers that the King did nominate unto him, and proceed by their advice in all
weighty affaires, especially in matters that concerned his Majesties service. The
Barons nominated to him were, the Laird of <hi>Finlatour,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Innes,</hi> the
Laird of <hi>Phiborth,</hi> the Tutor of <hi>Cromartie,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Pitlarge</hi> and Laird of

Blackburne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Forbes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Howy</hi> the Parson of <hi>Turresso,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Alexander Dowglas,</hi> or any three of them.</p>
                     <p>Whilest the King was thus busied to reconcile <hi>Huntly</hi> to the Church,<note place="margin">A Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against Mr. <hi>Iames Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                        </note> Mr.
<hi>Iames Gourdon</hi> Jesuit came into the Countrey of intention to divert him from
giving obedience, against whom a strict Proclamation was made, inhibiting the
subjects to resset, supply, or intertain any intelligence with him under pain of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and a Thousand Crowns promised to any that should apprehend and bring
him to the King. And at the same time was discovered a practice of fortifying
the Isle of <hi>Elsay</hi> in the West seas, for receiving certain forces that the Spanisih
King had promised to send thither. The contriver of this plot, was one <hi>Hugh
Barclay of Lady-land,</hi> who being committed the year before in the Castle of
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> had made an escape and gone to <hi>Spain:</hi> this year returning to make
good what he had undertaken, with some few assisters he entered into the Isle
(a huge rock it is, four miles in compass, wherein an old ruinous Tower built on
the ascent of the rock of difficult access) meaning to have victualled the same.
Mr. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> (the same who took Mr. <hi>George Ker</hi> with the blanks some five years
before) getting intelligence of the purpose, came upon him unlooked, and landing
in the Isle did encounter him in the very shore: for the most of his company being
gone to seek their sport, he had stayed to see who those were that he espied co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Isle, not thinking that his purpose was known,<note place="margin">The Laird of <hi>Lady-land</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving surprized the rock <hi>Elsa.</hi> is drowned.</note> or that any would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
him; but when he perceived them to be unfriends, and to be set for his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
he ran into the Sea, and drowned himself. The King did esteem this, as it
was indeed, a peece of good service; and the newes thereof going to the Popish
Lords made them more willing to fulfill that which they had promised: So that
on the 26. of <hi>Iune,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Huntly</hi> and <hi>Arroll</hi> upon their solemn repentance,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:50008:236"/>
oaths and subscriptions to the Articles of faith were absolved in the Church of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdene.</hi>
The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> in the same manner was received by the Ministers of
<hi>Mernis</hi> and <hi>Angus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This businesse ended, the King for repressing the barbarous fewds which aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at that time in the North parts,<note place="margin">The Kings care for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of deadly fewds.</note> sent a Commission to the Bishop of <hi>Aberdene,</hi>
with concurrence of Sir <hi>Patrick Murray</hi> and some Ministers, for taking up their
quarrels, and with charges to cause the parties give assurance one to another which
should endure to the first of <hi>April,</hi> 1598. The fewds mentioned in the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
sent to Sir <hi>Patrick Murray</hi> were the fewds betwixt the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> and Lord
<hi>Forbes,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arroll</hi> and the Laird of <hi>Ladwherne,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Drum</hi> and
young <hi>Frendraucht.</hi> with a number more: but the most deadly and dangerous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the families of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> the King reserved to be his own work,
and ceased not till the same was removed, and a friendship made up by marriage,
which should in all reason be most lasting. Those others were by the diligence of
the Bishop and Ministers setled, and so the North parts reduced unto quietness.</p>
                     <p>In the end of <hi>Iune</hi> the King called the Commissioners of the Assembly to a
meeting at <hi>Falkland;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A meeting of the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of the Assembly at <hi>Falkland.</hi>
                        </note> where amongst other business a complaint was preferred by
Mr. <hi>Iohn Lindesay of Balcarres</hi> Secretary, against Mr. <hi>Robert Wallace</hi> Minister at
S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> for certain injurious speeches uttered in his Sermons, having called him
a <hi>briber,</hi> and said, <hi>That albeit he had made conquest of fifty Chalders victuall in</hi> Fife, <hi>and
built a house to the skyes, yet his posterity should beg their bread, which some of his Auditors
should see; and that it was doubtfull if ever God should grant him repentance.</hi> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
had complained of this to the Presbyterie,<note place="margin">The Secretary complaineth of Mr. <hi>Robert Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> Minister at S. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                        </note> but they refused to admit his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
unlesse the same was assisted by <hi>two witnesses,</hi> who could affirm that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
had just cause to pursue the complaint, which they alledged to be the Apostles
Canon in the 1 of <hi>Timothy,</hi> ch. 5. v. 19. and shewed themselves so partially affected,
as he was forced to pursue the complaint before his Majesty and Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Wallace</hi> being summoned to that Diet,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Wallace</hi> declineth the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> and desired to answer to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
refused to acknowledge the judgment, alledging, <q>That the general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
had given them no Commission in that particular, and that the accusation
once before the Presbyterie of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> ought to have been orderly taken out
of their hands,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Nicoll Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleish</hi> protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> which was not done. This Declinatour being proponed, compeired
Mr. <hi>Nicoll Dalgleish</hi> Moderator of the Presbyterie, and in their name protested
against the proceedings of the Commissioners in that cause as being once inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
before them, seeing by that form of doing all the Presbyteries of <hi>Scotland</hi>
should be prejudged, and that the Generall Assembly, of whom they had their
Commission, would not take unto them the triall of any cause, with a neglect of
the inferiour judicatories.</q> Then said the King, <hi>I will likewise protest, that seeing
one of the principall motives which induced me to crave, and the Generall Assembly to
yeild unto this Commission, was to have the like of these offences, when they did arise, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
and justice done by the Ministers themselves, rather then to be brought before the
Councell, ye either proceed in examining the complaint and doe that which is right, or
hold me excused, if I take order with it by another form that will not please you so well.</hi>
The Commissioners having advised the Reasons of the Declinatour, and Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
did finde them all invalid and of no force,<note place="margin">The declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared invalid.</note> and that they had warrant suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to proceed and minister justice in that action, as well in respect of the generall
power contained in their Commission, as of the particular commended to their care
in the planting of the Church of S. <hi>Andrews.</hi> So the complaint was admitted, and
the 5 of <hi>Iuly</hi> appointed at S. <hi>Andrews</hi> for trying the same.</p>
                     <p>At the day the Secretary compeiring accompanied with Master <hi>Robert Mauld</hi>
Commissar of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Iohn Arnot</hi> Clerk to the Commissar (whom
he produced as assisting Witnesses to take away the Presbyteries exception) did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in his complaint.<note place="margin">The Witnesses examined doe verifie the complaint.</note> Mr. <hi>Wallace</hi> being askt, if he had any thing to oppose against
the Witnesses, refused to answer in respect of his Declinatour; whereupon they were
admitted, and upon oath declared that they knew the accusation to be just, and that
the Secretary had not intended the same of any purpose to calumniate or slander
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:50008:236"/>
the said Mr. <hi>Robert,</hi> but only to be repaired to his credit and honour, as one who had
been greatly wronged by him. The Witnesses for probation being then called,
and Mr. <hi>Wallace</hi> inquired if he had any exception against them, refused,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Wallace</hi> his obstinacy.</note> as before,
to answer. So they likewise were received, and being sworn, deponed, that they
heard the said Mr. <hi>Wallace</hi> utter the words complained of, in his Sermon. Notthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the Commissioners for their better information did think it meet to call to
his Auditors of the University, who were of better judgment, and could truly relate
what they heard. The Masters of the new Colledge refusing to give any testimony
in respect of the Presbyteries Protestation at <hi>Falkland,</hi> all the rest affirmed what
the Witnesses had deponed. After which Mr. <hi>Wallace</hi> being again called, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to shew what reason, or warrant he had for uttering such speeches, refused
still to make answer; nor could any perswasion break his obstinacy, though he
was earnestly laboured by Mr. <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Melvill</hi> apart; who
did offer upon the confession of the fault, that the processe should cease.</p>
                     <p>The Commissioners seeing no way to eschew the pronouncing of sentence,<note place="margin">A visitation of the Church of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews.</hi>
                        </note> in
regard of his obstinacy, did yet take counsell to visit the Church; and inquire both
of his, and Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> behaviour in that Ministery, before they went further. A
Visitation for this effect being appointed the 11 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> summoned
to the same day; the Elders and Deacons of the Church were inquired touching
the behaviour of them both, and the verity of the accusations laid against them, who
all upon oath deponed, that the accusations were true, and that <hi>Blake</hi> had spoken all
that whereof he was convicted before the Councell; as also that the Secretaries
complaint of Mr. <hi>Wallace</hi> was most just. And being askt touching their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
otherwise, they declared that both the one and the other were given to facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that they did not carry themselves with that indifferency which became
Preachers.</p>
                     <p>This Declaration made clear way to the Commissioners for ending that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

where divers innocent women, through the credulity of the Minister M. <hi>Iohn Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
were condemned and put to death. In end she was found to be a meer decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
(for the same persons that the one day she had declared guilty, the next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
presented in another habit, she cleansed) and sent back to <hi>Fife,</hi> where first she was
apprehended. At her triall she affirmed all to be false that she had confessed, either
of her self or others,<note place="margin">A discharge of proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Witches, except in case of voluntary confession.</note> and persisted in this to her death: which made many forthink
their too great forwardness that way, and moved the King to recall the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
given out against such persons, discharging all proceedings against them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in case of voluntary confession, till a solid order should be taken by the Estates,
touching the form that should be kept in their triall.</p>
                     <p>In the Borders at the same time great troubles were raised by the broken men of

                        <note place="margin">Troubles in the Borders.</note> who made incursions on the Scots side, and wasted all the
Countrey of <hi>Liddisdale.</hi> The Laird of <hi>Baclugh</hi> that had the keeping of those parts,
to be repaired of that wrong, made a road into <hi>England,</hi> and apprehending 36 of the
doers, put them all to death, and brought away a great spoil. Sir <hi>William Bowes</hi>
being sent to complain of this, after much debating it was agreed, that for keeping
peace in the Borders, Hostages should be delivered of either side, <hi>English</hi> men into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and as many <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Baclugh</hi> failing to deliver his in

                     <p>This Act gave occasion to the indicting of a Generall Assembly,<note place="margin">An. 1598.</note> which conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

of Mr. <hi>David Lindesay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway,</hi> to suffer the old
Ministers preach again in their places upon their faithfull promises to observe the
Conditions following:</p>

                        <pb n="450" facs="tcp:50008:238"/>
1 That they should not in Pulpit make any apology for themselves further
then to say, that they had satisfied his Majesty touching their intentions in the day
of the tumult, and that they condemned the raisers thereof, and all that took Arms,
or gave command, or allowance thereunto, praising the calme and clement course
his Majesty hath taken in censuring the same.</p>
                     <p>2 That they should at no time thereafter, tax, quarrell, or reproach, directly or
indirectly, privately or publickly, any inhabitant of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> that did shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
affectionate to his Majesty; and if any of them should happen to fall in any
offence, meriting the censure of the Church discipline, they should in the triall,
and censuring thereof use them indifferently, as if they had never kithed contrary to
the said Ministers.</p>
                     <p>3 That they should not in Pulpit speak otherwise then reverently of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Councell, and their proceedings, and in their Sermons labour to imprint in
the peoples hearts a reverent conceit of his Majesty and his actions, so farre as in
them lies; and when as they should hear any slanderous or offensive reports of his
Majesty, or of any of his Counsellors, his or their intentions, or proceedings, they
should address them in all humility to his Majesty, and with due reverence make him
acquainted with the reports, receiving his Majesties own declaration therein, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they should give credit, and generally should conform themselves to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
set down in the late generall Assembly thereanent.</p>
                     <p>4 That they should never hereafter refuse to give accompt of any of their
speeches in Pulpit, or of their proceedings elsewhere, but when his Majesty should
require the same, they should plainly declare the truth of that they should be asked,
in all humbleness and simplicity, without claiming to the generall warrant of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
not founded upon reason.</p>
                     <p>The Ministers upon these conditions being licenced to preach,<note place="margin">Four others named to be joyned with the <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

going on in dividing themselves in Parishes, as they had promised, a lite was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
of twelve persons, out of which number the Commissioners of the Church
were to elect four, besides the old Ministers, to bear charge in that Ministery, having
his Majesties approbation. The four on whom the choice fell, was Mr. <hi>Robert Rollock</hi>
Principall of the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Hall</hi> Minister at <hi>Leth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter
Hewat,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exception ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at two of the number.</note> and Mr. <hi>George Robertson.</hi> Against the two last exception was taken because
of their youth, and that they were not men of that gravity which was required in
Ministers of such a place. Yet the Commissioners, after triall taken of their qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
proceeded, and decerned all the four to be admitted.</p>
                     <p>Hereof the old Ministers complained,<note place="margin">The providing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners in the planting of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> allowed.</note> with whom the Synod of <hi>Lothian</hi> joyned,
who repaired in great numbers to the Assembly, thinking to carry the matter by
voices; but when after a long contestation it came to be judged, the decreet of the
Commissioners was approved, and a new Commission given to Mr. <hi>David Lindesay,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Robert Pont,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> Mr. <hi>George Gladstaves,</hi> Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Iames Nicolson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Buchannan,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Duncanson,</hi> to place the
Ministers in their severall parishes; or if any should refuse to accept, to depose
them from the function of the Ministrey, and plant the Church with such others as
they should think meet.</p>
                     <p>Mean while,<note place="margin">Anact desining the number of Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from Presbyteries to Assemblies.</note> because of the number that came from <hi>Lothian,</hi> an Act was made,
<hi>That no Presbytery should thereafter send above two or three Ministers at most in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the Assembly, with one Baron of the bounds and one Commissioner from every
burgh,</hi> Edinburgh <hi>excepted, who in all publick meetings were allowed to have two.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the end of the Assembly,<note place="margin">His Majesty pleaseth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all offences past of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> a motion was made for removing all offences
conceived by his Majesty against any of the Ministers, and particularly against the
Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> whereupon the King was pleased to declare, <q>That for
any offences past he did freely remit them, and should never at any time call the
same to minde,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Iohn Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidson</hi> protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against the conclusions of the Assembly.</note> in hope they would so behave themselves in time coming, as they
should still deserve his good opinion.</q> And so did this meeting close with the
great content of all; Mr. <hi>Iohn Davidson</hi> onely a man given to contention, finding
that things went not to his minde, especially in the planting of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to the
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:50008:238"/>
Ministery whereof he was always aspiring, did protest in his own name, and in the
name of certain other brethren, <q>That none of the conclusions taken in that
Assembly should be of any force, in regard the same was not a free Assembly, but
overawed by the King.</q> The Moderator enquiring if any of the brethren would
adhere to this Protestation, none was found all condemning it and the uncivill form
he used in making the same; he himself, as his custome was when he made any such
trouble, fled away, and lurked a while till his peace was again made.</p>
                     <p>It was now thought that the planting of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> should receive no more delay,<note place="margin">Question mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Bruce</hi> who refused the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands.</note>
yet a new impediment cast in, made no less ado then the former. Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi>
had preached ordinarily in the Town some ten years, but had not received Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Ministery, and being urged therewith, refused, pretending the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the generall Assembly to be equivalent to any ordination. It was replied,
<hi>That the approbation he had of the Church, was a licence onely to preach, but being now
to receive an office, it concerned them to observe the form prescribed by divers Acts.</hi> But
this not satisfying, he denied to yeeld a jot to that, which might question his former
calling. And abeit it was offered to be declared at his entry. <hi>That the ordination they
used was not to question his former calling, but rather to allow, and confirme the same;</hi> he
would not be content, except the declaration was given him in writing. This also
yeelded unto, a new difference arose among them upon the form of the declaration,
the Commissioners offering <hi>to declare the lawfulness of his calling, and that the impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hands they were to use, was not given him as a new intrance to the Ministery, but as one
that was taken to be entred to the charge of a particular flock;</hi> he requiring to have it
expresly said, <hi>That they did acknowledge him a lawfull Pastor of</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>as being
called by the generall Assembly thereto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ten days and more were spent in the setting down this form,<note place="margin">A declaration made for his satisfaction.</note> and after many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,
at last they came to agree on this, <hi>That the Commissioners did acknowledge his
calling to be a Pastor in</hi> Edinburgh <hi>lawfull, and that the imposition of hands was not used
as a ceremony of his ordination to the Ministery, but of his ordination to a particular
flock.</hi> The Declaration thus formed, a day was appointed for his admission, and
Mr. <hi>Robert Pont,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A tumult in the Church as his admission</note> Mr. <hi>Thomas Buchannan,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Nicolson,</hi> chosen to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the same. Mr. <hi>Robert Pont</hi> having preached, and beginning to shew what was
the business they met for; Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> arose, and stepping into the Pulpit, fell
a complaining of the strict forms wherewith the Commissioners had used him; which
the people hearing, such a tumult was raised, as to all appearance the Ministery that
was to use the imposition of hands had been in danger, if the Commissioner
Mr. <hi>Iohn Nicolson</hi> a man well respected (being there as one of the Elders, to testifie
the Churches consent to his admission) had not by his wise and grave speeches
reduced them to quietness. Always the business was put off for that day.</p>
                     <p>The King advertised of this,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners purgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the tumult.</note> was greatly offended, and commanded the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
to cite Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> and censure him for the trouble he had made;
he compeiring, excused himself, laying the blame on the people, and being charged
under pain of deprivation to give obedience, and accept the charge after the form
prescribed, was upon the 9 of <hi>May,</hi> the day assigned for his acceptation, admitted
by Mr. <hi>David Lindesay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">He is admitted and receives imposition of hands.</note> and Mr. <hi>Alexander Douglas</hi> with imposition of hands. Thus
ended that business which made more noise then was needfull, and was judged to
proceed rather of wilfulness on his part, then of any good zeal.</p>
                     <p>The day appointed of the Synods drawing near the King sent <hi>William Melvill</hi>
Commendator of <hi>Tungland,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Patrick Murray,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners directed to Synod of <hi>Fife.</hi>
                        </note> to attend the Assembly of

them was, not to suffer any of the Conclusions taken in the last generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to be drawn in question, and to see that in the other heads left undecided, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should be concluded <hi>definitivè.</hi> But they found the Synod more peaceable
then was expected, and all things caried therein to the Kings minde, Mr. <hi>Thomas

Mr. <hi>George Gladstaves,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Fairfoull</hi> being chosen Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
for meeting with these that should be sent from the other Synods.</p>
                     <p>The report of this gave the King hopes of a good issue to the conference inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;<note place="margin">A meeting at <hi>Falkland</hi> for determining the vote of Parliament.</note>
whereupon letters were sent desiring the Doctors of the Universities, and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:50008:239"/>
Commissioners of the Synod to be at <hi>Falkland</hi> the 29 of <hi>Iuly.</hi> There after along
deliberation, it was with an unanime consent agreed,</p>
                     <p>1 Touching the manner of his Election, who should have voice in Parliament,
that the Church should name for each Prelacy that was void, six of their number, of
whom the King should take one; or if his Majesty did not like any of those six, that
as many others should be recommended by the Church, of which number he should
accept one, without any more refusall.</p>
                     <p>2 That the nomination should be made by the generall Assembly, with advice of
the Synods, and Presbyteries, who should present the generall Assembly in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the names of the persons as well without, as within the bounds of their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
providing if there was any person within the bounds meet and qualified, he
should be preferred, <hi>caeteris paribus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3 Concerning his rent, that the Churches being sufficiently planted, and no
prejudice done to Schools, Colledges, and Universities already erected, he should
be provided to all the rest of the Prelacy whereunto he is preferred.</p>
                     <p>4. The Cautions to preserve him should be these.</p>
                     <p>1. That he should not propone to Councell,<note place="margin">Caveats for eschewing of corruption.</note> Convention, or Parliament, in
name of the Church, any thing without express warrant, and direction from the
Church, neither should he consent, nor keep silence in the said Conventions if any
thing was moved prejudiciall to the weal, and liberty thereof, under pain of deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from his office.</p>
                     <p>2 Next he should be bound to give an accompt of his proceedings in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of his Commission to every generall Assembly, and obtain their ratification
of the same; submitting himself to their judgement, without making any appeal,
under the pain of infamy, and excommunication.</p>
                     <p>3 He should content himself with that part of his Benefice which should be given
him for his living, and not hurt nor prejudice the rest of the Ministers within his
Benefice, planted or to be planted, nor any other Minister in the Countrey whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
and this clause to be inserted in his Provision.</p>
                     <p>4 He should not delapidate his Benefice in any sort, nor make any set, or dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
thereof, without the speciall advice or consent of his Majesty, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Assembly. And for the greater warrant should interdict himself, and be content
that inhibition be raised against him to that effect.</p>
                     <p>5 He should be bound to attend the congregation faithfully, at which he should
be appointed Minister, in all the points of a Pastor, and be subject to the triall, and
censure of his own Presbytery, or provinciall Assembly, as any other of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that bear no Commission.</p>
                     <p>6 In the administration of discipline, collation of benefices, visitation, and
other points of Ecclesiasticall government, he should neither usurp, nor claim to
himself any more power or jurisdiction, then any of his brethren, except he be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
under pain of deprivation; and in case he do usurpe any part of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
government, the Presbytery, Synod, or generall Assembly opposing and
making impediment thereto, whatsoever he should do thereafter should be null
<hi>ipso facto,</hi> without any declaratour.</p>
                     <p>7 In Presbyteries, Provinciall, and generall Assemblies he should behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in all things as one of the brethren, and be subject to their censure.</p>
                     <p>8 At his admission to the office of Commissionary he should swear and subscrive
all these and other points necessary, otherwise he should not be admitted.</p>
                     <p>9 If it should happen him to be deposed from the Ministery by the Presbytery,
Synod or generall Assembly, he should lose his place in Parliament, and the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

                     </p>
                     <p>10 That he should be called Commissioner of such, or such a place, if so the
Parliament be induced by his Majesty to accept that title; otherwise the generall
Assembly should consider and determine the same; as also how long he should
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:50008:239"/>
continue in office, whether <hi>ad vitam,</hi> except some offence make him unworthy, or
for a shorter space, at pleasure of the Church.</p>
                     <p>It was neither the Kings intention,<note place="margin">His Majesties purpose in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to these conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> nor the minds of the wiser sort, to have these
<hi>Cautions</hi> stand in force, (for to subject the decrees of Parliament to the Assembly,
as in the <hi>second</hi> caution; or to interdict Churchmen, as in the <hi>fourth,</hi> and serve Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions
upon them, were things absurd) but to have matters peaceably ended, and
the reformation of the policy made without any noise, the King gave way to these
conceits, knowing that with time the utility of the Government, which he purposed
to have established, would appear, and trusting that they whom he should place in
these rooms, would by their care for the Church, and their wise and good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
purchase to themselves the Authority which appertained.</p>
                     <p>He had also matters of greater importance in hand,<note place="margin">Ambassadors directed to the Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                        </note> which made him desire to be
setled in some sort, with the Church: from <hi>Iune</hi> preceding he had directed an
Ambassage to the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> wherein <hi>David</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdene</hi> and
Sr. <hi>Peter Young</hi> his Elemosynar, men of good abilities and learning, were employed.
Their Commission was, to inform the Princes of his right and title to the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> after the death of the Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and to request their assistance, if he
should stand in need thereof. The Queen was then stricken in years, and diverse li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
and pamphlets divulged against his title to that Crown, which made him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to have his friends rightly informed, and to understand what aid he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
if opposition should be made; <q>Not that he minded (this they were willed to
declare) to wrong or offend the Queen in any sort, whom he loved, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as his Mother; wishing her many and happy days, but onely to strengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
against injust pretenders; and if in the mean time they should be pleased by
a common Ambassage to entreat the Queen to declare in her own time the right
successour, for preventing the plots and practises of enemies, he would take it for
a singular friendship at their hands.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was a painfull Ambassage,<note place="margin">The success of that Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</note> and by them faithfully discharged; for taking their

of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and having comunicated their message to them all severally
returned not before the end of the year. Of all the Princes they obtained an answer
in substance, which was, <hi>That albeit his Majesties right was not unknown unto them,
they did esteem it an act of great wisdome in him, to make his friends acquainted with the
exceptions taken against his Title, that when occasion required, nothing might be wanting
that lay in their power. But to move the Queen for declaring her successour, they held it
dangerous, and feared it should not so much promove the business, as offend her. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
they should advise, and take counsell with their confederates and allies, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the course which was most likely for his benefit.</hi> This was the summe of the answer
they returned.</p>

lamented. This man was born not farre from <hi>Striveling,</hi> and trained up in letters
under Mr. <hi>Thomas Buchannan,</hi> who did then keep a famous School in that time.
He passed his course in Philosophy at S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and no sooner received the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of a Master in Arts, then he was chosen Regent of the Colledge of S. <hi>Salvator,</hi>
where he had studied. In the year 1583 he was removed to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and made
Principall of a Colledge, which the Town had there erected; where by his Lectures
of divinity in the Schools, and his Sermons to the people (in both which he was
assiduous) he came to be greatly esteemed. But the 17 days tumult and troubles
that followed thereupon, withdrawing him against his minde to the keeping of
Assemblies, and other Commissions of the Church, he was thereby much weakned;
for he was of an infirm body, and grievously pained with the Stone, whereof at
last he died.<note place="margin">His behaviour in the time of his sickn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other pious exhortations, he did earnestly beseech them, <hi>to carry themselves more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
towards the King, lamenting he should be so ill used by some of their number:</hi> and
gave them a most comfortable farewell. His torments were extreme, yet was he
not heard to use an impatient word; but was still calling on God, with these and
the like sayings, <hi>Hast Lord Iesus, and tarry not, put in thy hand and take this soul away
to thy self.</hi> At other times, <hi>Goe out silly life, that the better life of God may enter in.</hi> Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neer his end, he repeated a part of the 6 Psalm, and framing a most pithy prayer
out of the same, as one exulting after victory, he cried aloud, <hi>Christ hath taken my
yoake to bear, and now strengthened by his grace, I will follow:</hi> with which words he
yeelded up his spirit. A rare example of holiness he was both in his life and death;
albeit now dead, still preacheth by his learned works, which it is pity should not be
collected in one volume, and preserved to posterity. He deceased the last of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
and had his corps honourably interred in the buriall place, an innumerable
multitude accompanying the same to the grave.</p>
                     <p>To return to the Estate,<note place="margin">An. 1599.</note> the necessities of the King by forain Ambassages, and

the Laird of <hi>Wedderburne</hi> was put from his place, and the office of Controllerie
given to Sir <hi>David Murray,</hi> who was afterwards preferred to the Lordship of <hi>Scone.</hi>
The Prior of <hi>Blantire</hi> who was Treasurer, for that he had offended the King by
his partiall behaviour in an action betwixt Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> and the Ministers of
<hi>Angus,</hi> was committed to the Castle, and forced to resigne his office, which was
conferred upon the Earl of <hi>Cassils</hi> by his Ladies procurement.<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Cassills</hi> made Treasurer.</note> She was the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

of their age, he being a young Nobleman never matched to any, and she a woman
past childbirth. But the desire he had to keep his estate made him take that
course, and she loving to stay at Court and have her husband a ruler of affaires,
made offer to advance some moneys so as he might carry the place, which was
readily accepted. Yet was it not long before they did both forthink the bargain,
being pressed with a multitude of precepts for the laying forth of money, and
so were glad to quit the office,<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Elphing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> succeeded Treasurer.</note> with the losse, as was said, of Fourty thousand
marks, which he did advance at his entry. In his place was the Lord <hi>Elphingston</hi>
chosen by the recommendation of his brother, then Secretary.</p>
                     <p>Whilest these things were a doing in Court, Sir <hi>William Bowes</hi> came Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
from <hi>England,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sr. <hi>William Bowes</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour from <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> upon some rumours that the King wes declining to Popery,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:50008:240"/>
and had offered his obedience to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> by a letter, the copie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was brought by the Master of <hi>Gray</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> and shewed the Queen, of
purpose to divide the two Princes, and dissolve the amity which was amongst
them.</p>
                     <p>The Queen, though she did take the letter to be faigned, and that the same
was devised to breed a jealousie between her and the King, thought meet to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
what was rumoured, and to advise him not to build upon the friendship of
<hi>Rome.</hi> The King did take the advertisement well, and made the Ambassadour
very welcome, assuring him that they were false and faigned calumnies: neither
did the King think any other at that time. Such a letter indeed was sent to the
Pope, and the Kings hand surreptitiously gotten thereto, for which the Secretary
Mr. <hi>Elphingston,</hi> was some years after upon his own confession convicted, as we
shall hear.</p>
                     <p>Whilest this Ambassadour remained in the Countrey,<note place="margin">One <hi>Ashfield</hi> conveighed privately to <hi>Berwick</hi> by two of the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> there fell out an accident
which had almost wrought great trouble: an English man called <hi>Ashfield,</hi> who
had brought some hunting horses to the King, and cunningly abused the English
Warden, did make his aboad at Court, and was there well entertained. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour,
whether desired by the Queen or the Warden, it is uncertain, caused
some of his servants keep company with the man, and allure him one day to <hi>Leth,</hi>
where having drunk liberally, he was by Coach, instead of returning to Court,
carried to <hi>Berwick.</hi> This being told the King, he was greatly offended, and giving
order to watch the Ambassadours lodging, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to <hi>Berwick</hi> to bring back the
man. The Governour prayed the King to have him excused, for that the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come within his charge, he could not dimit him without the Queens know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>The King receiving this answer, did challenge the Ambassadour as not
having carried himself dutifully, and wronged both him and the Countrey; but
he denying the fact, affirmed the same to have been contrived by two of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
without his knowledge and direction. This none did believe, neither did
the King vouchsafe him any more countenance. Whereupon he parted in a
great discontent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Soon after the King went to S.</hi> Andrewes <hi>for a new visit of the Universitie,</hi>

and jurisdiction upon the students and professors of Theologie, that the Deans of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy

that he who was elected Dean, should not till after three years space be received again into

                     <p>At this time came forth sundry Discourses touching the succession of the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> some oppugning, some maintaining the Kings title: amongst
others Mr. <hi>Iohn Colvill</hi> taking upon him one of the opposite Treatises did publish
a recantation, wherein having confuted all the contrary reasons he professed, <hi>that in
malice in time of his exile he had penned the Treatise, which then out of conscience he
refuted.</hi> This was believed of many, and helped greatly to discredit the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
writings; yet was he not the Author of that which he oppugned; only to
merit favour at the Kings hands he did profess the work that came forth without
a name to be his: and indeed a more pithie and perswasive Discourse was not pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all that time in that subject.</p>
                     <p>The same year did the King publish his <hi>Doron Basilicon</hi> upon this occasion;<note place="margin">The King publisheth his <hi>Basilicon Doron</hi> by occasion of a libell.</note> Sir
<hi>Iames Semple</hi> one of his Majesties servants (whose hands was used in transcribing
that Treatise) upon an old familiarity with Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvill,</hi> did give it him
to read, who offending with some passages that touched the Ministery and present
discipline, took copies thereof and dispersed the same amongst the Ministers; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
a Libell was formed, and cast in before the Synod of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrews,</hi> wherein
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:50008:241"/>
the passages at which they excepted, being first set down; it was asked, <hi>What Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
should be inflict upon him, that had given such instructions to the Prince,</hi> (for that
Treatise was directed to Prince <hi>Henry) and if he could be thought well affected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that had delivered such precepts of Government?</hi> Sir <hi>Patrick Murray</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Iames Nicolson</hi> being present in the Synod, as Commissioners for the King, and
apprehending the libell to concern his Majesty, made diligent enquiry to find out
the presenters. The whole number pretending ignorance, the Commissioners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the doors to be shut, and the Roll of the Ministers names to be called, who
being put to their oath one by one did purge themselves, yet was it tried the very
next day to be laid on the table by Mr. <hi>Iohn Dikes</hi> Minister at <hi>Anstruther,</hi> who
being therefore cited before the Councell was fugitive and denounced Rebell.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Iohn Dikes</hi> fugitive for the libell.</note> The
rumor by this occasion dispersed, that the King had left certain directions to his
son, prejudiciall to the Church and Religion; he took purpose to publish the
work, which being come abroad, and carried to <hi>England,</hi> it cannot be said how
well the same was accepted, and what an admiration it raised in all mens hearts of
him,<note place="margin">The book well received in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> and of his piety and wisdome. Certain it is that all the Discourses that
came forth at that time (and those were not a few) for maintaining his right to
the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> prevailed nothing so much as did the Treatise, against
which such exceptions had been taken.</p>
                     <p>In the end of the year happened some new jarrs betwixt the King and the
Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A trouble for receiving some English Comedians.</note> because of a company of English Comedians whom
the King had licensed to play within the Burgh: The Ministers offending with
the liberty given them, did exclaim in their Sermons against <hi>Stageplayers,</hi> their
unruliness and immodest behaviour; and in their Sessions made an Act <hi>prohibiting
people to resort unto their plaies under pain of the Church censures;</hi> The King taking
this to be a discharge of his Licence called the Sessions before the Councell, and
ordained them to annull their Act, and not to restrain the people from going to
these Comedies; which they promised, and accordingly performed; whereof
publication was made the day after, and all that pleased, permitted to repaire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same, to the great offence of the Ministers.</p>
                     <p>The next year which by publick Ordinance was appointed to have the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the Calends of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Church.</note> and from thenceforth so to continue (for before

kept at <hi>Montrosse</hi> the 28 of <hi>March,</hi> where the King himself was present.
Therein that great business of the Churches voice in Parliament was determined;
and first the conclusions taken at <hi>Falkland</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1598, were ratified. Then
touching the continuance of those that should be chosen to give voice for the
Church,<note place="margin">The voice in Parliament determined.</note> it was after much debating concluded; <hi>That be who was admitted should
yearly render an account of his Commission to the generall Assembly, and laying the same
down at their foot should be therein continued, or if his Majesty and the Assembly did
think fit to employ another, he should give place to him that was appointed.</hi> Two points
more were adjoyned to the former; one was,<note place="margin">Two Cavears more added.</note> 
                        <hi>That they who had voice in Parliament,
should not have place in the generall Assembly, unless they were authorised by a Commission
from the Presbyters, whereof they were members.</hi> The other caveat was, <hi>That</hi> crimen
ambitus <hi>should be a sufficient reason to deprive him both of his place and office.</hi> And
now there rested no more but to nominate persons to the Bishopricks that were
void; <hi>Aberdene</hi> and <hi>Argile</hi> had their own incumbents at the time, both actual

<hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Isles</hi> were so dilapidated, as scarce they were remembred to

space of 10 years. A man earnest and zealous in every thing he gave himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but too credulous (a fault incident to the best natures) and easily abused by
those he trusted; which bred him great trouble whilst he remained at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
In <hi>Montrosse</hi> where he was first confined, and whereof soon after he became Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
he lived well respected, and in great quietness: making it appear, that the
many contests and strifes he had in former times, proceeded not from his own
disposition, so much as from the suggestion of others. For all the sixteen years
he lived there, no man did carry himself with greater modesty, nor in a more duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
obedience, and was therefore well beloved and esteemed by the King. He
wished earnestly to have lived unto the meeting of the Assembly, that he might
have declared his mind touching the matters then in hand; but when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his sickness increasing, and that he should not continue so long, he intreated
some brethren to visit him, to shew the Assembly as from him, <hi>that there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of restoring the ancient government of the Church, because of the unruliness of
young Ministers, that could not be advised by the elder sort nor kept in order; and since
both the estate of the Church did require it, and that the King did labour to have the
same received, he wished them to make no trouble therefore, and to insist only with the King,
that the best Ministers and of greatest experience might be preferred to places.</hi> This as
he directed was reported to the Assembly, and of the greatest part well received:
for he was certainly a sound hearted man, and farre from all dissimulation, ever
professing what he thought, and following the course he thought most expedient
for the Church. To the poor he was exceeding helpfull, compassionate of those
that were in any distresse, and mercifull even when he seemed most severe. He
dyed the last of <hi>February</hi> in the 63 year of his age.</p>
                     <p>It was in <hi>August</hi> this year,<note place="margin">The conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Earl of <hi>Gowry.</hi>
                        </note> that the conspiracy of <hi>Gowry</hi> fell forth; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
plotted by him alone, and only communicated to M. <hi>Alexander</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
two youths of great hope, at whose hands no man could have expected such
an attempt. Their father had been taken away by form of justice in the 1584,
whilest the King was yet Minor, and forced he was unto it as unto many other
things that agreed not with his mind.<note place="margin">The Kings kindness to his brethren and sister.</note> But the care he took of the Noblemans chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and kindness wherewith he used them, did shew how much he disliked that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding;
for he restored the eldest to his fathers honour and living, his brother <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>
he made one of his bedchamber; a sister of theirs he preferred to be chief
maid about his Queen, and had a purpose to advance the Earl himself to a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
office of the Kingdom. Such and so great benefits might have endeared
the most barbarous and heard hearted. But benefits are no benefits to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
and those that are set for revenge.<note place="margin">The plot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapping the King.</note> The device was, to allure the
King to the Earls house in <hi>Perth,</hi> and there to kill him. The King was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in <hi>Falkland,</hi> and one day early in the morning (it was the fifth of <hi>August</hi>) as
he was going to take his sport in the Park, <hi>Alexander</hi> meets him, and telleth that
his brother had intercepted a man, a Jesuit as he supposed, with a great quantity of
gold, and that he kept the man fast in his house at <hi>Perth,</hi> and sent him with the
newes, praying the King to make hast, for that he doubted not he should learn
things worthy of his travell. The King moving some questions touching the
mans stature and habit, and the place where he was taken, received no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
but that his brother would satisfie all those things at his coming; which put
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:50008:242"/>
him in a suspicion that the Gentleman was distracted, for he observed in him some
perturbation; yet because of the instance he made he yielded to goe, willing him
to ride back, and shew that he would be with his brother before dinner.</p>
                     <p>After a short chace and a Buck killed the King made towards <hi>Perth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The King go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>Perth.</hi>
                        </note> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
with the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> and a few Gentlemen more,
all in their hunting coats. By the way, the King did ask the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> if
he had known Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> (for the Duke had married his sister) at any time
troubled or distempered in his wits. The Duke answering that he had never known
any such thing in him; the King insisted no further. Being come to the Town
the Earl did meet him,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gowry</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King was much troubled.</note> and was noted by all the company to be in some trouble
of mind, the very imagination of the fact he went about, perplexing his thoughts.
But he coloured all with the want of entertainment, saying, that he did not expect
the King, and that his dinner was not prepared. The King wishing him not to
trouble himself with those thoughts, because a little thing would content him; and
for the Noblemen a part of his dinner would suffice them, they discoursed of
hunting and other common matters till meat was dressed. Howsoon the King had
taken a little refreshment,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> did move the King to goe with him.</note> and the Lords were placed at a table in another room,
Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> did round in the Kings ear, that the time was fit whilest the Lords
were at dinner, to goe and examine the stranger: at which word the King arose,
and went up stairs, Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> going before him. The King did call Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Areskin</hi> (afterwards Earl of <hi>Kelly</hi>) to follow him, but Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> turning
at the door, after the King was entered, said that the King willed him to stay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
whereupon Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> went back. Thus the door was shut, and Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
guiding him to an inner room, the King did perceive a man standing alone,
whereupon he asked if that was the man? nay said Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
business in hand,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> professeth what he was about.</note> and with that word covering his head, You remember, said
he, how you used my father, and now must you answer for it. <hi>Your father!</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the King; <hi>I was not the cause of his death; it was done in my minority by
forme of Iustice. But is this your purpose, and have you trained me hither to murther me?
Did you learn this lesson of Mr.</hi> Robert Rollock <hi>your Master? or think you when you
have done your will to goe unpunished?</hi> Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> stricken with the speeches, and
the man who was placed there to assist him, trembled for fear, desired the King
to be quiet, and make no noise, for that he would go speak with his brother, and
pacify him; this said he went down a back way, as it seemed, to the Court
below.</p>
                     <p>Whether he did meet with his brother at that time or not, is unknown, but
his stay was short, and when he returned, he said to the King, There is no
remedy, you must die. Then making as though he would tie the Kings hands,
they fell a wrestling, and the King drawing him by force to a window in
the corner that lookt toward the street, as he espyed the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> cryed,
<hi>Help Earl of</hi> Marre, <hi>help.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Kings voice heard, and is discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> The voice and words were discerned by all the Lords,
and Gentlemen, who thereupon ran to seek the King, by the way that went
up; but the doors being shut, there was no entry that way till the same
was broke by force, which took up a large time. Upon the first cry Sir
<hi>Thomas Areskin</hi> suspecting treason did flee upon <hi>Gowrie,</hi> and taking him by
the gorge said,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reskin</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth <hi>Gow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Thou art the traitour;</hi> but they were quickly sundered by his
servants that stood by. The first that came to the King was a Page called
<hi>Iohn Ramsey,</hi> who falling upon a back passage by which the Traitours
after the deed committed had purposed to escape, found the King and
Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> strugling, the King calling to him and bidding him strike the
Traitour,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iohn Ramsey</hi> doth first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the King.</note> he gave Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> two or three wounds with his Dagger,
and so parted him from the King. The man who was placed there to assist Mr.
<hi>Alexander,</hi> did steal away secretly; and he himself perceiving that the treason was
discovered made down the stairs, where being encountred by Sir <hi>Thomas Areskin,</hi>
and askt how the King was, because he gave no direct answer, and only said, <hi>that
he took God to witness, that he was not in the fault,</hi> he thrust him through the body,
and killed him outright.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="459" facs="tcp:50008:242"/>
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was followed by <hi>Hugh Hereife</hi> Doctor of Medicine, and a Foot-boy
named <hi>Wilson,</hi> who seeing the King safe, were not a little joyed, and placing him in
a little room,<note place="margin">The Kings servants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to defend.</note> and shutting the door, they prepared to defend the entry. <hi>Gowry</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with three or four servants breaketh presently into the chamber, and
with his two swords one in each hand, puts them all to their shift, and had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
overthrown them, but that one of the company crying, <hi>You have killed
the King our Master, and will you also take our lives?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gowrie</hi> ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and after a little space is killed.</note> He became astonished and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the points of his two swords to the earth, as if he minded to cease from any
more fight, he was instantly stricken by the Page with a rapier which pierced the
heart, so as he fell down dead. The servants seeing him fall made away; only Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Thomas Cranston</hi> being sore wounded, and not able to shift for himself was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.
In this fight Sir <hi>Thomas Areskin</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hereife</hi> were both hurt,
but nothing dangerously.</p>
                     <p>By this time the doors of the other passage being made open,<note place="margin">The Lords come to the King.</note> the Lords and a
number with them entred into the room, who hearing what happened went all to
their knees, and the King himself conceiving a prayer, gave thanks to God for his
deliverance, and that the device of those wicked brothers was turned upon their
own heads. The danger that ensued was not much lesse, for the people of the
Town taking up armes did inviron the house, crying <hi>to give them out their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The danger by the people of the Town.</note>
                        <hi>otherwise they should blow them all up with powder.</hi> The rage of the multitude
was great, (for they loved the Earl, as being their Provost, beyond all measure) and
with great difficulty were they kept back from using violence: at last the Bayliffs
and certain of the Citizens being admitted to enter, and brought to the King, when
they were informed of the truth of things, returned and pacified the people. After
which, the King took horse and returned to <hi>Falkland,</hi> where he was welcomed (the
rumour of the danger having prevented his coming) with great acclamations of
joy.</p>
                     <p>It was observed not without some wondering, that after <hi>Gowrie</hi> was killed there
issued no blood for a good space from his body,<note place="margin">The Caracters found at the Earls girdle.</note> till his girdle being loosed and
taken from him, the same gushed from him in abundance: this was supposed to be
the effect of some Characters that he did alway carry in a little bag at his girdle,
which being viewed, were found to be certain spells of Necromancers, and added
much to the infamy of his death.</p>
                     <p>A diligent search was made the daies following for the man the King saw standing
in the room, and large rewards promised to those that should finde him out.<note place="margin">Some servants of <hi>Gowrie</hi> executed.</note> In this
search one of the Earls servants called <hi>Henry Younger,</hi> hiding himself out of an idle
fear among some growing corns, was killed, and for some daies was supposed to
have been the man, till <hi>Andrew Henderson</hi> Chamberlain to <hi>Gowrie,</hi> discovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Controller, did offer upon promise of his life, to enter and shew all that
he knew in that business. An other of <hi>Gowries</hi> servants surnamed <hi>Craigengelt</hi> was
some 2 daies after apprehended, and both he &amp; M. <hi>Tho: Cranston</hi> executed at <hi>Perth,</hi>
though at their dying they declared that they knew nothing of the Earls purpose,
and had only followed him as being their Master unto that room, where, if they had
known the King to have been, they would have stood for him against their Master
and all others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Henderson</hi> at his examination declared,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Andrew Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> That the night preceding the attempt,
the Earl had directed him to attend his brother Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> and doe what he
commanded. That accordingly he accompanied him the next morning to <hi>Falkland,</hi>
and when they were returned being commanded by Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> to dresse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in armour, and go wait til he came unto him in an upper room, he obeyed. But
that he could not imagine any purpose against the King, either in him or in the
Earl, nor would have believed it unlesse he had seen the same with his eyes. Being
demanded, why he did not take the Kings part when he did see them fall a wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
he excused himself by a sudden fear that overtook him in the time; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he lookt ever after that time as one half distracted. It was much marvelled that
in so high an attempt the Earl should have made choice of such a one: but the man
was of a servile spirit, and apt enough to doe mischief; and many have conjectured
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:50008:243"/>
that if the treason had taken effect, it was in the Earls purpose to have made away
both his brother and him, that he might not be supposed to have had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof. I remember my self that meeting with Mr. <hi>William Cowper</hi> then
Minister at <hi>Perth</hi> the third day after in <hi>Falkland,</hi> he shewed me that not many daies
before that accident visiting by occasion the Earl at his own house, he found him
reading a book entituled, <hi>De conjurationibus adversus Principes:</hi> and having asked
him what a book it was, he answered, <q>That it was a Collection of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
made against Princes, which he said was foolishly contrived all of them, and
faulty either in one point or other; for he that goeth about such a business should</q>
not, <hi>said he,</hi> put any man on his counsell. And he not liking such discourses,
desired him to lay away such books, and read others of a better subject. I verily
think he was then studying how to go beyond all Conspirators recorded in any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story:
but it pleased God, <hi>who giveth salvation to Kings,</hi> as the Psalme speaketh, to
infatuate his counsels, and by his ensample to admonish all disloyall and trayterous
subjects to beware of attempting against their Soveraigns.</p>
                     <p>Advertisement sent the next day to the Councel,<note place="margin">The Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> required by the Councell to give thanks for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> which then remained at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
the Ministers of the Town were called and desired to convene their people,
and give thanks unto God for his Majesties deliverance. They excusing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>as not being acquainted with the particulars, nor how those things had fallen out;</hi>
it was answered, that they were only to signifie, how the King had escaped a great
danger, and to stirre up the people to thanksgiving. They replied, <hi>That nothing
ought to be delivered in pulpit but that whereof the truth was known,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their excuse, and refusing to obey.</note> 
                        <hi>and that all which

through age was compelled to quit the Charge, departed this life. This man
whilest he lived was held in great esteem, a great Divine and excellent Preacher, of
a grave behaviour, sincere, inclining to no faction, and which increased his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
living honestly, without oftentation or desire of outward glory; many tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
and troubles he endured in his time, for being left young and his Father killed
at <hi>Flowdon,</hi> after that he had got an entrance in Letters, and passed his course in
Philosophy in S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> he went to <hi>England</hi> and waited as Pedagogue on the
Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> his children the space of two years. Warres then arising betwixt the
two Kingdomes, he returned home, and became one of the Dominican Order;
but had not lived long among them when upon suspicion of heresie, he was put in
prison. Being cleared of that imputation, he went back again into <hi>England,</hi> and
thinking by the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> means to have got a place in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> because that
failed, he went to <hi>France,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Rome.</hi> There he won such favour
with Cardinall <hi>Pole,</hi> as by his recommendation he was received among the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans
of <hi>Bononia,</hi> and by them first appointed to instruct the Novices of the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
afterwards when they perceived his diligence and dexterity in businesses, he
was employed in all their affairs throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> and sent in Commission to
<hi>Chios,</hi> an Isle situated in the <hi>Ionick sea,</hi> to redresse things that were amisse amongst
those of their Order.</p>
                     <p>Therein he discharged himself so well, that at his return he was made Rector of
the School, and thereby had accesse to the Libraries, especially to that of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
where falling on the <hi>Institutions</hi> of <hi>Iohn Calvin,</hi> he was taken with a great
liking thereof; and one day conferring with a reverend old man of the Monastery,
was by him confirmed in the opinion he had taken, but withall warned in any case
not to utter himself, or make his minde known, because the times were perilous:
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:50008:244"/>
yet he neglecting the counsell of the aged man, and venting his opinions too freely,
was delated of heresie, and being sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> after examination imprisoned nine
moneths, he lay there in great misery; at the end whereof, being brought before
the Judge of the Inquisition, and giving a cleer Confession of his Faith, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to be burnt the next day, which was the 19 of <hi>August.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It happened the same night Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth to depart this life, upon the
noise of whose death, the people came in a tumult to the place where his statue in
marble had been erected, and pulling it down, did for the space of three daies drag
the same through the streets, and in the end threw it in the River of <hi>Tiber.</hi> During the
tumult all the prisons were broke open, the Prisoners set free, and among those
Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> had his liberty; as he sought to escape, for he held it not safe to stay in
the City, two things happened unto him, not unworthy of relation; first, in the
Suburbs,<note place="margin">Accidents that befell M. <hi>Craig</hi> in his flight.</note> as he was passing, he did meet a sort of loose men, whom they called <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti;</hi>
one of the company taking him aside, demanded if he had been at any
time in <hi>Bononia?</hi> He answered, that he had been some time there. Doe ye not
then remember, said he, that walking on a time in the fields with some young
Noblemen, there came unto you a poor maimed Souldier, entreating some relief?
Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> replying, that he did not well remember. But I doe, said he, and I am
the man to whom ye shewed kindness at that time; be not afraid of us, ye shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
no danger; and so conveying him through the Suburbs; and shewing what
was his safest course, he gave him so much money as might make his charge to
<hi>Bononia;</hi> for he intended to go thither, trusting to finde some kindness with those
of his acquaintance; yet at his coming he found them look strange, and fearing to
be of new trapped, he slipped away secretly, taking his course to <hi>Millain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the way another accident befell him,<note place="margin">A strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods care over him.</note> which I should scarce relate, so incredible
it seemeth, if to many of good place he himself had not often repeated it as a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
testimony of Gods care of him. And this it was, when he had travelled some days
declining the highways out of fear, he came into a forrest, a wild and desert place,
and being sore wearied lay down among some bushes on the side of a little brook
to refresh himself; lying there pensive and full of thoughts (for neither knew he in
what part he was, nor had he any means to bear him out the way, a dog cometh
fawning with a purse in his teeth, and lays it down before him; he stricken with a
fear, riseth up, and construing the same to proceed from Gods favourable provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
towards him, followed his way till he came to a little village, where he met
with some that were travelling to <hi>Vienne</hi> in <hi>Austria,</hi> and changing his intended course
went in their company thither.</p>
                     <p>Being there,<note place="margin">He preacheth to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, but is forced to leave those parts.</note> and professing himself to be one of the Dominican order, he was
brought to preach before <hi>Maximilian</hi> the second, who liking the man, and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of teaching, would have retained him, if by letters from Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the third, he
had not been required to send him back to <hi>Rome,</hi> as one that was condemned for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.
The Emperour not liking to deliver him, and on the other part not willing to
fall out with the Pope, did quietly dimit him with letters of safe conduct. So tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
through <hi>Germany</hi> he came to <hi>England,</hi> and being there informed of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
begun at home, he returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and made offer of his service
to the Church, but his long dissuetude of the Countrey language (which was
not to be mervailed, considering that he had lived abroad the space of 24 years)
made him unusefull at first; now and then to the learned sort he preached in
Latine in the <hi>Magdalens</hi> Chappell at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and in the year 1561 after
he had recovered the language,<note place="margin">He cometh to <hi>Scotland</hi> and is appointed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister at <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudhouse.</hi>

next year he was taken to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and served as Collegue with Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>
the space of nine years; then by the ordinance of the assembly he was translated to
<hi>Montross,</hi> where he continued two years, and upon the death of <hi>Adam Heriot</hi> was
removed to <hi>Aberdene,</hi> having the inspection of the Churches of <hi>Marre</hi> and <hi>Buchan</hi>
committed to his care; in the year 1579 he was called to be the Kings Minister,
and served in that charge till born down with the weight of years, he was forced to
retire himself; after which time, forbearing all publick exercises he lived private
at home, comforting himself with the remembrance of the mercies of God, that he
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:50008:244"/>
had tasted in his life past,<note place="margin">An. 1601.</note> and this year on the 12 of <hi>December</hi> without all pain dyed
peaceably at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the 88 year of his age.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the next year there happened a great stirre in the Court of
<hi>England,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A trouble in the Court of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> which concerning the King in some sort I must needs touch: the Earl of
<hi>Essex</hi> who had been a long time in speciall favour with the Queen, and was then
upon some displeasure kept from the Court, not enduring to be thrust down (as he
complained) by his adversaries into a private life, did resolve to make his way unto
the Queen by force, to seise upon her person, and remove from her company those
he judged to be his adversaries. But the purpose failing, he was taken himself and
committed to the Tower. A little before he had written letters to the King full of
respect, informing that they who had the managing of all affairs under the Queen,
were inclining to the Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> and advising him to send Ambassadors into
<hi>England.</hi> and urge the declaration of his title of succession. The King, though he
could have wished his title to be declared, did not think that time fitting for such
propositions, yet upon the report of his apprehension he resolved to employ some
in Commission to the Queen.<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> sent Ambassadour to <hi>England</hi>
                        </note> And to this effect made choice of the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi>
joyning with him the Abbot of <hi>Kinlosse,</hi> who coming to the Court some days after
the execution of <hi>Essex,</hi> and having access to the Queen did congratulate her good
success in repressing that audacious attempt. This she took well, and was glad to
hear so much from them, because of the rumours which were then dispersed, <hi>That</hi>
Essex <hi>was made away for favouring the King of Scots title, and that if the Ambassadors
had come in time, they would have dealt for him.</hi> A good answer was hereupon given
to all their instructions, and whereas among other points of their Commission, they
were willed to seek an assignment of some portion of land in recompence of the
lands belonging to the Lady <hi>Lennox,</hi> the King being her lawfull heir; the Queen
excusing herself touching the lands, was content to adde to the annuity formerly
paid, the summe of 2000 pounds yearly, as long as he kept fast, and held one course
with her. Besides this satisfaction obtained of the Queen, they did so work with the
principall Noblemen and Counsellors, as they won them to be the Kings friends,
and at their return gave his Majesty assurance of a peaceable reception of that
Crown after the decease of the Queen, which was some two years after really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                     <p>Much about this time,<note place="margin">Pope <hi>Clement</hi> sends his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> to <hi>England</hi> for excluding the King.</note> had Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight sent his <hi>Breves</hi> (as they call
them) into <hi>England,</hi> warning all the Clergy and laity that professed the Roman
faith, not to admit after the Queens death any man, how near soever in blood, to be
king, unless he should binde himself by oath, to promove the Catholick Roman
Religion at his power. And at the same time came Mr. <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
Hay</hi> Jesuits into <hi>Scotland,</hi> two factious and working spirits, and therefore
much suspected by the King, the first especially, for that he was known to have been
a chief instrument of the seditions raised in the City of <hi>Paris</hi> in the time of the
league.<note place="margin">A Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against some Jesuits.</note> How soon the King understood of their repairing into the Countrey, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
was given out inhibiting their resort under the pain of treason. In this
Proclamation to make them the more odious, they were compared to <hi>Bothwell</hi> and
<hi>Gowry,</hi> the King declaring that he would judge no otherwise of their receptors, then
of those that did treasonably pursue his own life. This notwithstanding, they
found lurking holes amongst the Papists in the North, and kept the Countrey till
after some years that Mr. <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> was apprehended, and carried to the
Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where he died.</p>
                     <p>The Church of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> remained all this while destitute of a number of their
Ministers,<note place="margin">An Assembly at <hi>Brunt-island.</hi>
                        </note> the conditions prescribed unto them, when they were pardoned, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
performed: of the four onely Mr. <hi>Iohn Hall</hi> having given obedience was licenced
to return to his charge; the other three, upon I know not what pretext, deferred
to make their declaration, as was appointed, and were thereupon in the Assembly
convened at <hi>Brunt-island</hi> the 12 of <hi>May,</hi> ordained to be transported from the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and placed in such parts of the Countrey, as the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Countrey should think meet. This Assembly was called by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

                        <hi>did begin with a regrate

said,</hi> was so great, that it must of necessity at last conclude either in Popery or Atheisme, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a substantious remedy were in time provided. And because the ill could not be well cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unless the causes, and occasions thereof should be ript up, he exhorteth those that were
assembled, to consider seriously both of the cause of the defection, and the remedies that
were fittest to be applyed.</p>
                     <p>After long conference,<note place="margin">The defection in Religion complained of, and the causes searched.</note> the causes were condescended to be, the wrath of God kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
against the land for the unreverend estimation of the Gospel, and the sinnes
in all estates, to the dishonour of their profession; lack of care in the Ministery to
discover Apostates; too hasty admission of men unto the Ministery, Ministers
framing themselves to the humors of people; the desolation of the Churches of
<hi>Edinburgh;</hi> the advancing of men to places of credit, that were ill affected to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
the education of his Majesties children in the company of Papists; the
training up of Noblemens children under suspect Pedagogues; the decay of
Schools; and the not urging of the reconciled Lords to perform their conditions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For remedy of the foresaid evills it was ordained,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The remedy of the evils.</note> That a publick humiliation should
be kept throughout the realm, the last two Sundays of <hi>June,</hi> with fasting and prayer, for
appeasing the wrath of God kindled against the land; that the Ministers of every Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
should after the dissolving of the Assembly, take up the names of the Recusants within
their bounds, and send them to the Kings Ministers; that places of greatest need should be
furnished with learned and wise preachers, and in the mean time, till that might take effect
by a constant provision of Ministers to those places, that the meetest for that purpose should
be appointed to attend for a certain time in the families of the reconciled Lords, for their
better confirmation in the truth. <hi>The rest of the remedies resolved all in Petitions to
his Majesty,</hi> for the planting of Churches, the not permitting of those who were under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
for Popery, to have access to Court, and a care to be taken of the good education of the
children of Noblemen. <hi>To all which the King gave favourable answers, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of the Princess his daughter from the Lady</hi> Levingston, <hi>which was earnestly
entreated by the whole Assembly, his Majesty did promise to bring her to his own
house before the Terme of</hi> Martinmas <hi>next.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>there was delivered a letter sent by
Mr.</hi> Iohn Davidson <hi>to the Assembly, wherein as if he would awake his brethren
fallen asleep, he began with a strong cry,</hi> How long shall we fear or favour flesh and
blood, and follow the counsell and command thereof? Should our meetings be in the name of
man? Are we not yet to take up our selves, and to acknowledge our former errors, and
feebleness in the work of the Lord? <hi>And a little after,</hi> Is it time for us now, when so many
of our worthy brethren are thrust out of their callings without all order of just proceeding,
and Iesuits, Atheists and Papists are suffered, countenanced and advanced to great rooms
in the realm, for the bringing in of idolatry, and captivity more then Babylonicall, with an
high hand, and that in our chief City: Is it time for us, I say, of the Ministery to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled
and blindfolded with pretence of preferment of some small number of our brethren
to have voice in Parliament, and have titles of Prelacy? Shall we with <hi>Samson</hi> sleep still
on <hi>Dalilahs,</hi> knees, till she say, <hi>The Philistines</hi> be upon thee <hi>Samson? Then scoffing at the
Kings doings, he said,</hi> But <hi>Bonyton</hi> is executed, an infamous thief in the highest degree:
what is that to the cause of Religion, whereof no question was moved? Is there no Papist,
nor favourer of Papists in <hi>Scotland</hi> but <hi>Bonyton?</hi> But the King is sound in Religion,
what can the adversaries do? Being sound, the danger were the less; but there is nothing
either in Church or King according to our calling &amp;c. <hi>In postscript to the same let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he wished them to be wary of determining any thing touching the planting of</hi>
Edinburgh, <hi>in respect of any promises against Papists, and to remember that</hi> Melius
&amp; optabilius est bellum pace impiâ, &amp; à deo distrahente.</p>
                     <p>This letter laughed at by some did greatly offend the wiser sort,<note place="margin">The letter offended great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wiser sort.</note> who would have

<pb n="465" facs="tcp:50008:245"/>
willing to leave the punishment to him, and go on with their own affairs, as they had
begun. So the letter being cast by, the planting of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was next handled,
and after some reasoning it was concluded, that the three Ministers, Mr. <hi>Walter
Balcanquell,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A combustion touching the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

others placed in their rooms. The care of this among other things was entrusted to
certain Commissioners deputed by the Assembly, who had power given them for
all matters that concerned the Church unto the next generall meeting.</p>
                     <p>After this a proposition was made for a new translation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Psalmes in meeter: his Majesty did urge it earnestly, and with many
reasons did perswade the undertaking of the work, shewing the necessity and the
profit of it, and what a glory the performing thereof should bring to this Church:
speaking of the necessity, he did mention sundry escapes in the common Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and made it seen that he was no less conversant in the Scriptures, then they
whose profession it was; and when he came to speak of the Psalmes, did recite
whole verses of the same, shewing both the faults of the meeter and the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pance
from the text. It was the joy of all that were present to hear it, and bred not
little admiration in the whole Assembly, who approving the motion did recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the translation to such of the brethren as were most skill'd in the Languages,
and revising of the Psalmes particularly to Mr. <hi>Robert Pont;</hi> but nothing was done
in the one or the other; yet did not the King let this his intention fall to the
ground, but after his happy coming to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> set the most learned
Divines of that Church awork for the Translation of the Bible; which with great
pains, and the singular profit of the Church they perfected. The revising of the
Psalmes he made his own labour, and at such hours as he might spare from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

There went with him Sir <hi>Thomas Ereskin,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Levingston</hi> of <hi>Kilsithe,</hi>
two of his Majesties privy Councell; Mr. <hi>Iohn Spotswood</hi> then Parson of <hi>Calder,</hi>
was directed to attend him as his Chaplain or Preacher. The Duke taking his
journey by sea arrived at <hi>Deepe,</hi> the 24 of that moneth, and upon the 10th day after
entered into <hi>Paris,</hi> accompanied by <hi>Iames</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and a great train
of Scotishmen, who did meet him at S. <hi>Denis;</hi> he had presence of the French King
at S. <hi>Germans</hi> some seven leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> and was very kindly accepted. A

few daies after the King went to <hi>Fountayn-bleau,</hi> where the Queen was to lye of
Childe-birth. Thither the Duke did follow him, and was entertained with hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the like sports, unto the Queens delivery, which fell out the 17 of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>

Going then unto the Countrey to salute his mother Madam <hi>D' Aubigney,</hi> and
other his friends; whilest he was about these offices of kindness, the King went by
post to <hi>Callais</hi> upon some intelligence, as it was said, from <hi>England,</hi> that the Queen
was fallen sick; he himself gave out that the affairs of <hi>Flanders</hi> did occasion his
journey, for as then the Archduke was besieging <hi>Ostend.</hi> But whatsoever the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
was no man doubted but that he had an eye upon the succession of <hi>England;</hi>
and if he could have found a faction, would have foisted in <hi>another Bastard of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
which oftentimes in a merriment and gallantry he spared not to utter.</p>
                     <p>The Duke after his return to <hi>Paris</hi> made no long stay, but taking his leave of
the French King, who was then come back from <hi>Callais,</hi> took journey towards <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and came to <hi>London</hi> in the beginning of <hi>November:</hi> A Parliament was then
sitting at <hi>VVestminster,</hi> (the last that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> held) which with his coming
upon that instant gave many to think that he was come to urge a Declaration of
the Kings right of succession, and not a few they were, nor of small note, that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to assist, if he should move any such business: but he told them, that neither
had he any such Commission, nor would the King ever agree to any thing that
might breed a jealousie in the Queen. And his Commission indeed was no other,
but to salute the Queen in the Kings name, and let her know the kinde and filiall
affection he carried unto her, whereof he should be willing to give proof at all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
And for that he was given to understand, that the Irish Rebells had drawn
in some Spanish forces into <hi>Ireland</hi> to fortifie themselves in their Rebellion, he
would, if his ayde should be thought necessary, employ the same for their expulsion.
The Queen giving the King many thanks, said, That if those troubles continued,
she would take his help, and hire some of his High-landers and Isles men, but she
trusted to hear other news shortly, and not be vexed long with those strangers. As
also it came to passe, for the very next moneth, the Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> her Deputy did
in a battell fought neer <hi>Kinsale</hi> defeat the <hi>Irish</hi> utterly, and afterwards forced the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> that had taken the Town, to render upon condition of their lives saved,
and that they might be transported again into their Countrey.</p>

<hi>December;</hi> where having related his proceedings in Councell, they were all appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
The Lord <hi>Elphingston</hi> had in his absence resigned the office of Treasury upon
an offence, as was thought, he conceived for adjoyning some others unto him in the

Quirie preferred to the office. which he discharged by his Deputy, Sir <hi>Iohn Arnot,</hi>

<hi>Iames Forret</hi> of <hi>Fingaske:</hi> These Gentlemen furnishing themselves with armes and
shipping, and having conduced a number of souldiers, took sea, and in the third or

base son to old <hi>Macklond</hi> who carried himself as Lord of the Isle, made at the

them with great tyranny, he fled and forsook the Isle, leaving the Indwellers to the
discretion of the Invaders: they how soon he was gone, did all submit themselves,
and accept such conditions as were offered by the undertakers.</p>

                     <p>First, that they should purchase to them? remission from the King of all crimes
and offences past.</p>
                     <p>Next, that they should resigne to <hi>Norman</hi> all the right that they had acquired of

such a surety given of the Isle, as he could devise.</p>

who never shewed himself difficile (especially to Ministers that professed peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie

Commissioners of the Church at <hi>Perth.</hi> the 25 of <hi>Iune</hi> where his Majesty was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
acknowledged his error, professed his resolution touching the guiltiness of

thereto as Witnesses. This done, he was admitted to kisle his Majesties hand, and
licenced to return to his place: but as the King had conjectured, so it fell out, for

promised and subscribed, he left the Town, pretending that his Ministery should

had confirmed ill-disposed people in their suspicions.</hi> Yet this Ordinance did not content
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:50008:247"/>
him, and so delaying to give satisfaction, he was by the Commissioners of the
Church discharged from the Ministery of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the year following.</p>
                     <p>In this Assembly Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway</hi> being chosen to preside,<note place="margin">Petitions to his Majesty in name of the Church.</note> made a Speech to
the King, wherein he shewed, <q>That the Church was oppugned by two sorts of
enemies, to wit, <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>sacrilegious</hi> persons, and therefore in the name of the
whole Church entreated his Majesty, that as he had with great travell and happy
successe made the principalls of the Popish profession to conform themselves in
outward obedience: so he would use his princely authority towards the other
sort, and compell them, if not to restore all, at least to grant a competent allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to Ministers forth of the tithes they possessed.</q> The King accepting the
Petition graciously, said, <hi>That it should not be well with the Church so long as Ministers
were drawn from their Charges to attend the yearly modification of stipends, and that he
held it fittest once to condescend upon a competent provision for every Church, and deal
with those that possessed the tithes to bestow a part thereof to the foresaid uses: and seeing
that business would require a longer time then they could well continue together, that they
should doe well to make some overtures to those that had the Commission for Stipends,
promising for himself that he should stand for the Church, and be an advocate for the
Ministers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After a long deliberation these overtures were proponed: <q>First, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
having stipends assigned to them forth of the tithes of the Churches
where they served,<note place="margin">Overtures for provision of the Ministers.</note> a perpetuall security should be made to the Takesmen, and a
certainer gressome condescended on for every chalder of victuall which should
be paid for nineteen years lease; at the expiring whereof, another lease upon the
like conditions should be renewed for as many years, the principall Takesmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged to grant the like security for his Subtakesmen. 2. That the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
should be disponed to actuall Ministers, the Churches annexed thereto being
sufficiently provided, and the tenth of the superplus paid to the King; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that all the great Benefices should be dissolved, the Prelate enjoying the
principall Church and temporall lands, and the Churches annexed disponed to
Ministers, both they and the Prelate paying a yearly duty to the King. And 3.
that all inferiour Benefices should be provided to the Ministers serving the
Cure.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first of these overtures the King held reasonable and most advantagious to
the Church,<note place="margin">The overtures deferred to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time.</note> but the Assembly esteeming it dangerous to make tithes heretable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to give their consent, so as nothing at that time was concluded, and the
overtures remitted to a more deep consideration.</p>
                     <p>The Synod of <hi>Fife</hi> did after this present some grievances, complaining, <q>That
the Generall Assemblies were not kept at the ordinary times,<note place="margin">Grievances of the Synod of <hi>Fife.</hi>
                           </note> and both places and
daies altered, without the knowledge of Presbyters and Synods. That Ministers
were called before the Councell <hi>in prima instantia,</hi> for matters of doctrine and
discipline. That the government of the Church continued in the hands of a few
Ministers under the name of a <hi>Commission,</hi> to the prejudice of the liberty of the
Church. That Doctors being an ordinary calling in the Church were debarred
from coming to Assemblies. That no triall was taken concerning the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Caveats. That the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> being the principall watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower
of the Church, were not permitted to attend their charge. That the land
was polluted with the French Ambassadors masse, and excommunicates suffered
to abide in the Countrey. And lastly, that the letters and practises of Papists
were kept secret, and not communicated to the watchmen.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>These complaints being known to proceed from the private discontents of such
as grieved to see the affairs of the Church carried by others then themselves,<note place="margin">An answer to the grievances.</note> were
not much regarded, yet to shew that they had no just cause to complain, a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
answer was made to every one of them. And first it was said, <q>That the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
both were, and should be kept, according to the Act of Parliament.
That Ministers should not be called before the Councell but upon just grounds.
That Commissions given by the Assembly, and rightly discharged were lawfull.
That Doctors authorized with a Commission from the University, where they
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:50008:247"/>
lived, were not denied a voice in Assemblies, and that if the Caveats were not
observed, they might instance the point, and have the person after triall censured.
To the rest of the heads his Majesty by himself made this reply, That the French
Ambassadors masse was private, and could not be refused to him, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Minister directed with his owne Ambassadours the yeare before
was permitted to preach within the City of <hi>Paris;</hi> And for the Ministers of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh</hi>
they had received all the favour they desired. As to him that lay back,
it was his own fault, and no mans else: But where, saith he, it is craved, that the
letters and practises of Papists should be communicate to Ministers, as that were
the ready way to procure the escape, and no punishment of the practises, so the
proponers would remember, that secrets must be imparted at the Kings pleasure,
and not otherwise.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Some other Acts were concluded in the same Assembly,</hi>

                        <hi>as</hi> That in memory of his

fifth of <hi>August</hi> solemnly kept as the Parliament had prescribed in all the Churches of the
Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Ministers should not refuse the Sacrament of Baptisme to Infants, nor delay the
same upon whatsoever pretext, the same being required by the parents, or others in their
name:</hi> for as then, except at ordinary hours of preaching, Ministers denied to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize.
And because they had taken a custome not to celebrate marriage upon the
Sunday, pretending that the day was profaned by feasting, dancing, and the like,
it was ordained, <hi>They should hereafter at the parties desire celebrate the same, either on the
sunday or week day.</hi> These things concluded, and Commissioners chosen to attend
the common affairs of the Church, the Assembly dissolved, having appointed the
next meeting at <hi>Aberdene</hi> the last Tuesday of <hi>Iuly, Anno</hi> 1604.</p>
                     <p>All this time were the enemies of our Religion, the Jesuits especially busied,<note place="margin">The businesse of Jesuits in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> to
stirre up a party against the King, and his title to <hi>England.</hi> They had lost all hope
of gaining his affection, or obtaining any promise of toleration when he should come
to that Crown; and had found their writings and pamphlets for the <hi>Infanta</hi> of
<hi>Spain</hi> her right, to move few or none. Thereupon they fell to treat of a marriage
betwixt Lady <hi>Arbella</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Prince of <hi>Savoy:</hi> and that not succeeding, to
speak of a match betwixt her and a grandchilde of the Earl of <hi>Hartfords,</hi> judging
that their pretensions being conjoyned, many would befriend them to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the King of <hi>Scots;</hi> but the Queen who truly favoured his right though she
would not openly professe so much, dashed all those projects, and caused an eye to
be kept upon that Lady and such as resorted unto her.</p>
                     <p>About the same time the King had intelligence given him,<note place="margin">The story of <hi>Francis Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> and an Italian.</note> that one <hi>Francis
Mowbray</hi> son to the Laird of <hi>Barnebowgall,</hi> who had lived a while in the <hi>Infants
Court</hi> at <hi>Bruxells,</hi> had undertaken to kill him. This brake out first at <hi>London</hi> by
an Italian, a fencer, whose name was <hi>Daniel;</hi> which coming to the Queens ears, she
commanded Sir <hi>Robert Cecill</hi> her Secretary to call the persons (for they were both
in the City) and examine them; the Italian abode by his speeches, <hi>Mowbray</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
and offered to prove him a lyar in combat, which the other accepted. Both
being sent unto <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were tried first severally, then confronted before
certain of the Councell; the Italian produced Witnesses, who verified all that he
had deponed: whereupon <hi>Mowbray</hi> was committed to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
where seeking to escape by night at a window of the chamber, where he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
the sheets proving too short by which he thought to descend, he fell from
a great precipice, and was found the next morning dead at the foot of the rock.
The corps was the same day, being the last of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> presented to the Justice, and
sentence of forfeiture pronounced against him; his body hanged for a space upon
the gibbet, and afterwards quartered, and affixed on the gates and most open pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Town. His friends (for he was well born, and a proper young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
gave out that he had been strangled and his corps thrown down at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
But this carried no appearance, and was believed of few.</p>
                     <p>The Queen of <hi>England</hi> in the winter being perceived to wax heavy and dull,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>England</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sick</note>
and the rumour thereof dispersed (as there is nothing that can be worse concealed
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:50008:248"/>
then the sickness or death of a Prince) there was much business every where,
and she held for the most part dead. The French King had sent the summer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
two Ambassadors,<note place="margin">A Conference betwixt the French Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour &amp; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

colour of impeaching the courses of <hi>Spain,</hi> but in effect to observe the strength and
affection of both people. He that was sent into <hi>England</hi> brought a Letter from the
French King to Secretary <hi>Cecill</hi> of infinite kindness; and breaking with him one
day upon the miseries of the Kingdome when it should please God to translate the
Queen, fell to speak of the losse he should sustain by the exchange, and the case
wherein he would be, if the Scotish King did succeed; which to his apprehension,
should be more hard and miserable then any others, being likely to undergoe the
revenge of faults laid upon his father about matters concerning the Kings mother,
and other courses that he was esteemed to have run himself since the death of his
Father. The Secretary that was no childe, knowing that the Ambassador did
but sound him, for making some other project, answered, <hi>That this was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of unspotted duty, when Ministers did only regard the service of their Soveraigns,
without respect of their own particular; And that for himself he should never grieve to
endure trouble for so just a cause, the same being to a man that valued his credit more
then his security, a kinde of martyrdome: notwithstanding he supposed that things passed,
would not be called to minde, or if so were, and that he saw his case desperate, he should flee
to another City, and take the benefit of the Kings royall offer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ambassador being so answered, made a fair retreat, saying,<note place="margin">The King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised of this conference.</note> 
                        <hi>That in case the
King of</hi> Scots <hi>did carry himself towards the King of</hi> France <hi>with the respect which was
due, he was not purposed to impeach his interest.</hi> The Secretary replying, <hi>That it was
a wise resolution his Master had taken.</hi> The Ambassadour ceased to tempt him any
further in that businesse. Hereof the King was advertised by Letters from the
Secretary, who therein did assure him of his true and honest service when occasion

                        <note place="margin">His Majesties letter to the Secretary.</note> As
I doe heartily thank you <hi>(said he)</hi> for your plain and honest offer, so may you assure your
self, that it would doe me no pleasure that you should hazard either your fortune or reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
since the losse of either of these would make you the lesse vailable to me. No, I love
not to feed upon such fantasticall humours, although I cannot let busie-bodies to live upon
their own imaginations. But for my part I hold it the office of a King as sitting on the
throne of God to imitate the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> and by his steady and ever constant course
to govern all the other changeable and uncertain motions of the inferiour planets. And
I protest in Gods presence, that for your constant and honest behaviour in your Soveraigns
service, I loved your virtues long before I could be certain that you would deserve at my
hand the love of your person; wherefore go on, and serve her truly that reigneth as you
have done; for he that is false to the present, will never be true to the future.</p>

                        <hi>In another letter directed to the E. of</hi> Northumberland <hi>(that we may know the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and piety of the King) who had sent him advertisement of the Queens weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A letter from the King to the Earle of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>and advised him to make sure his title by apprehending possession in time, he
said,</hi> That man can neither be religious, nor just, that dealeth worse with his neighbour
then he would be dealt withall, and in a man of quality it can be no wisdome to leap hedge
and ditch, and adventure the breaking of his neck for gathering forbidden fruit before it be
ripe; when as by attending the due time, he may be sure to finde all the gates of the orchard
open, and with free scope enter, take and tast at liberty. Sure it were a great weakness and
unworthiness in me to come in as an Usurper with offence and scandall to the laws and
present estate of government, when I may in the right time claim the Crown as nearest
Heir to the Prince deceased, and possesse with equity: should I out of untimely ambition
fall to break the long continued and faithfully preserved amity, that by the proof of many
kinde offices hath taken root among us, it were an error inexcusable. And howbeit I doe
acknowledge your kinde affection in the offers you make of assistance, I must tell you freely,
that no Prince can presume of any subjects loyalty to himself, that hath been unsound and
unfaithfull to his own Soveraign: nor would I ever look to be secure in a Kingdome so
trayterously disposed. <hi>In end, he advised the Earl to forbear such writing, and when
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:50008:248"/>
he wrote (which he wished him to doe rarely,<note place="margin">An. 1603.</note> and not but upon great occasions) to
beware of any thing that might justly offend the Queen,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>England</hi> her death.</note> lest by interception or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
misadventure he might be disabled to serve him another day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was the Kings resolution, which God so blessed, as it brought him within a
short time after, against the opinions and desires of many, to the quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
possession of his right and inheritance; for in the Spring the Queens disease
encreasing (which was judged to be a melancholy incorrigible, and by some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to proceed from a sorrow for <hi>Essex;</hi> others ascribed it to the accepting of
the Rebell <hi>Tyrone</hi> to peace) and all apprehending it to be deadly, the hearts of
people did so incline to the King, as a great many in that State did write unto him,
<hi>That all</hi> England <hi>was grown to be</hi> Scotish. The Queen her self continuing constant
in her affection, when she was askt a little before her death by the Lord Keeper and
Secretary (who were directed by the Councell to understand her will touching
her Successor) answered, <hi>None but my Cousen, the King of Scots.</hi> After which words,
she spake not much: only being desired by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (whom
she would not suffer to go from her all that time) to fix her thoughts upon God, she
said, <hi>So I doe, neither doth my minde wander from him:</hi> and then commending her
soul to God in devout manner died most patiently and willingly. A Queen imcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
for wisdome and fidelity of government; she departed this life the 24th of
<hi>March,</hi> in the 70 year of her age, and 44 of her Reign. The same day in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was proclaimed King first at the Palace of <hi>whitehall,</hi> next at
the Crosse in <hi>Cheapside</hi> within the City of <hi>London</hi> with an infinite applause of all
sorts of people.</p>

Lord, as we cannot but confess unto your Majesty, that the grief we have
conceived by the loss of our late Soveraign Lady, whose soul in your palace of
<hi>Richmond</hi> passed from her earthly body to the joyes of heaven, betwixt two and
three of the clock this morning, was nothing less then our loyalty and love to her
whilest she lived, being a Princesse adorned with vertues meet for Government,
prosperous in the success of her affairs, and under whose obedience we have lived in
greater tranquillity these many years, then commonly happeneth to Princes; so we
must acknowledge that our sorrow is extingushed by the impression we have of those
heroicall vertues of wisdome, piety and magnanimity, which we know to be in your
Majesties person, to whose right the lineall and lawfull succession of all our late
Soveraigns dominions doth justly and onely appertain: wherein we presume to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
this much, as well for the honour, which will thereby remain to our posterity, as
for your Majesties security of a peaceable possession of your kingdomes, that we have
never found, either of those of the Nobility, or of any other of the Estates of this
realm, any divided humour about the receiving and acknowledging your Majesty
to be the onely head that must give life to the present maimed body of this kingdome,
which is so happy, as with an universall consent to have received one sole uniform and
constant impression of bright blood, as next of kin to our Soveraign deceased, and
consequently by the Laws of this realm, true and next heir to her kingdomes, and
dominions; whereof we have made outward demonstration by publick Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this very day a fore noon, first in the City of <hi>Westminster,</hi> at your Majesties

palace gate at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and next at the Cross of <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> within your
Majesties City of <hi>London,</hi> with an infinite applause of your people, and with such
solemnity as the shortness of time would permit. Of all which we have thought it our
duty immediately to advertise your Majesty by these two Gentlemen, Sir <hi>Charles
Percy</hi> brother to the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Somerset</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr>
son to the Earl of <hi>Worcester,</hi> of whom we have made choice to be the bearers of
our Letters, humbly beseeching your Highness to accept the same as the first fruits
and offering of our tender and loyall affections towards you our gracious Soveraign,
and to rest assured, that the same shall be ever hereafter seconded with all faith,
obedience and humble service, which shall be in our power to perform, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
that which we have begun with the sacrifice of our lives, lands and goods,
which we with all our other means do here humbly present at your Majesties feet:
craving of your Highness, that seeing hereby you may perceive in what estate we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
as body without a head, or rather without that spirit here amongst us, which
from the head might give vigor to every member to exercise the duty to it belonging,
thereby to keep the whole body from confusion, you will be pleased to enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
how soon and in what manner it shall seem best to your Majesties excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
wisdome, to inspire a new life into this languishing body, the circumstances
whereof are wholly to be left to your Majesty, holding it enough for us humbly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

you with all, that as we have hereby as many of us as have underwritten this

power and right, so we do know by all good proofs, that the minde of the rest of the
Nobility, and all others who are absent, in their severall qualities, places and charges,
whom the time permitted not without the prejudice of your affairs to assemble, so soon
as we were desirous this should be performed, are wholly and absolutely with us in
all zeal and duety for all things that shall be imposed upon them by your royall will
and pleasure.</p>
               <p>Further we have thought meet and necessary to advertise your Highness, that
Sir <hi>Robert Cary</hi> this morning departed from hence towards your Majesty, not
onely without the consent of any of us who were present at <hi>Richmond,</hi> at the
time of our late Soveraigns decease, but also contrary to such commandement as we
had power to lay upon him, and to all decency and good manners and respect, which
he ought to so many persons of our degree, whereby it may be, that your Majesty hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a bare report onely of the death of the late Queen, and not of our care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in establishment of your Majesties right here, in such manner as is above specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
may conceive doubts of other nature, then (God be thanked) there is cause you
should, which we would have clearly prevented, if he had born so much respect to us,
as to have stayed for a common relation of our proceedings, and not thought it better
to anticipate the same: for we would have been loath that any person of quality
should have gone from hence, who should not with the report of her death, have been
able to declare the first effects of our assured loyalties.</p>
               <p>And lastly it may please your Majesty to receive this advertisement, that of late there
was made ready by the commandement of the Queen our Mistresse a good fleet of eight
or ten of her ships well manned, and furnished under the charge of Sir <hi>Richard
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:50008:250"/>
Lawson</hi> Knight, to have been employed upon the coast of <hi>Spain;</hi> which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
by her decease is ceased for want of Commission to exercise the saine, and
now is kept together in the narrow Seas to prevent any suddain attempt against the
Low Countreys; and that now there is nothing either of land or sea, that is not yours,
it may please your Majesty to signifie your pleasure concerning that Fleet, and whether
you will have it or any part thereof resort to your coast of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where it may
serve you, either for the safe convoy of your person to this realm, if there shall because
to use it in this manner, or to transport any of yours, whilest you come by land, or
any other service. In which point we humbly beseech you, to make known under
whose charge it shall beyour pleasure, the whole Fleet, or any part thereof shall come
unto you. And this being all that for the present doth occurre to be advertised to
your Majesty by us whose mindes are occupied about the conservation of this your
realm in peace, as farre forth, as by any power for your Majesties service onely
assumed the interruption thereof may be prevented, saving that we have sent a
Copy of the Proclamation made here to your Majesties deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in that kingdome, we will and with our humble prayers to Almighty God,
that we may be so happy, as speedily to enjoy the comfortable presence of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
royall person amongst us, the onely object of that glory, and those felicities which
in the earth we have proponed to our selves. Written in your Majesties City of
<hi>London,</hi> the 24 of <hi>March</hi> 1603 at ten hours of the clock at night.</p>

               <p>The King having imparted this letter to the Councell,<note place="margin">The contents of the letter published.</note> it was thought meet,
that the Contents thereof should be published, for begetting a greater kindness
betwixt the people and the two Kingdomes; whereupon a Proclamation was
made, shewing <q>That the Queen before her death continuing in that loving af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,

him her only true heir and successor in the imperiall Crownes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

by the Lord Maior of <hi>London,</hi> and others of the Gentry of good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
had upon the 24 of <hi>March</hi> last, proclaimed him their only liege Lord and
undoubted Soveraign, which being the most cleer demonstration that a people
could give of their affection, and a sure pledge of their future obedience, ought
to move all true hearted subjects, to account of them no otherwise then as their
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:50008:251"/>
brethren and friends, and to forget and bury all quarrels, and grounds of former
dissensions; That therefore none should pretend ignorance, nor carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in any unkind sort towards the inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> his Majesty with
the advice of the Lords of Councell, had ordained Proclamation to be made
of the premisses, assuring them that should so apply themselves of his gracious
favour when occasion presented, and certifying such as did in the contrary, that
they should incurre his wrath, and extreme displeasure.</q>

               <p>Things thus ordered, the King went the next morning to S. <hi>Giles</hi> to hear a
Sermon;<note place="margin">He goeth to S. <hi>Giles</hi> to hear sermon.</note> Mr. <hi>Iohn Hall</hi> (whose course it was) preaching took occasion to remember
the great mercies of God towards his Majesty, reckoning the peaceable succession
to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> none of the least. <hi>This,</hi> he said, <hi>was Gods own proper work,
for who could else directed the hearts of so numerous a people with such an unanime consent

               </p>
               <p>The King accepting his exhortation in good part, did upon the end of the
Sermon make a speech to the people, which at the time were frequently conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and promising to have care of them, and their good, gave them a most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and kind farewell. This was followed with such a mourning and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all sorts, as cannot be well expressed. For albeit they joyed not a little at
first to hear of that accession of honour to their King, yet considering they should
be deprived of his presence, and have no more a resident King among them,
they were grieved out of all measure. This affection of the people moved also
the King greatly: therefore when the Magistrates, Ministers, and others of the
better sort, came to receive his commandments, he spake gratiously unto them;
willing them <hi>not to be troubled with his departing, for that they should finde the fruits
of his government as well afarre off, as when he was neer at hand; and as his power
was now encreased, and made greater, so his love towards them should not be a whit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished.</hi>

               <p>In this sort did he part,<note place="margin">The King cometh to <hi>Berwick.</hi>
                  </note> and beginning his journey on <hi>Wednesday</hi> the fourth of

with a most eloquent Sermon by <hi>Toby Matthew</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> (for he went
first to the Church) which finished he was conveyed to the Palace by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and garrison, the munition playing from the walls, and the Citizens with

showts and acclamations testifying their gladness. The ninth of that moneth
he went to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> where he aboad some few days, and because multitudes of
people from all quarters were daily coming to see the King and offer their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
Order was taken, that no strangers should have access granted, till the

the Countrey, out of the hatred he bare to those that had hand in that work,
and carried with him all the writs and evidents of the Sea of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> with the

worth: for besides those of ordinary use, there belonged to that Church, the

King at his majority did restore him to his dignity, honour, and living, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
him likewise for his Ambassadour in <hi>France:</hi> a man honourably disposed,
faithfull to the Queen while she lived, and to the King her son, a lover of his
Countrey, and liberall according to his meanes to all his Countreymen; in his last
Will he bequeathed all his means to pious uses, leaving as was said ten thousand
Crownes for the education of poor Scholars, being Scottish men born. The
evidents, vessels, and ornaments of the Sea of <hi>Glasgow</hi> he consigned in the hands
of the <hi>Carthusians</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> appointing the same to be redelivered, how soon
<hi>Glasgow</hi> should become Catholick, and this year being the 66 of his age departed
peaceably this life.</p>
               <p>The King having destinated Mr. <hi>Iohn Spotswood</hi> for his successor,<note place="margin">The Queen falleth sick at <hi>Striveling.</hi>

she made a pitifull abortion.</p>
               <p>Advertisement of this being sent unto the King, he caused the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> to
return, and after him sending the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> with a warrant to receive the
Prince, and deliver him to the Queen; he was brought unto her at <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi>

about the end of <hi>May:</hi> yet she not satisfied herewith complained bitterly of the
dishonour she had received, and by a letter written to the King, full of passron and
anger, which she gave her Elemosynar to carry, required a publick reparation, by
the punishment of the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> and his servants. The King who knew
the Earl himself to be blameless, and desired not to be troubled with such busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
especially at that time, returned this answer, <q>That she should doe wisely to
forget the grudges she carryed to the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> and thank God of the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable
possession they had obtained of these Kingdomes, which next unto God
his goodness</q> he ascribed to the last negotiation of the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
This reported to the Queen (for the messenger was commanded to speak so much)
she in a great choler replyed, <q>That she rather would have wished never see <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  </q>
then to be in any sort beholden to him for the same. Yet as she was a most
mild Princess, and very carefull to please the King in every thing, at her coming to
<hi>Windsor,</hi> which was about the end of <hi>Iune,</hi> she was reconciled to the Earl of
<hi>Marre,</hi> and he by Act of Councell declared to have done nothing in that accident
at <hi>Striveling,</hi> that might touch her in honour.</p>

At the same time was the Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was brought alongst with

towards them, and having spared the L. <hi>Cobham,</hi> &amp; <hi>Grey,</hi> because in the dispensing

               <p>The next year began with a conference of the Clergy at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ann. 1604.</note> divers
petitions had been exhibited to his Majesty for reformation of abuses in the
Church,<note place="margin">The confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton</hi> Court.</note> whereupon he took purpose to call certain of the Bishops, Deans, and
Doctors together, and with them some of the most grave and modest among the
complainers. The Bishops were, the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Durham, Winchester, Worcester,</hi> S. <hi>Davids, Chichester, Carlile,</hi> and <hi>Peterborough.</hi> The

Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> and Dr. <hi>King:</hi> for the petitioners Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>Spark,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stubb,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Chatterton</hi> were present.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">His Majesties proposition at the meeting.</note> 
                  <hi>the King spake unto them to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
That following the ensample of all Christian Princes, who in the Commencement
of their reign do usually begin with the establishment of the Church, he had now at his
entrance to the Crown taken course to assemble them, for settling an uniform order in the
same, for planting unity, removing dissensions, and reforming abuses, which <hi>(he said)</hi>
were naturally incident to all politick bodies. And yet that he should not be mistaken, and
his purpose in assembling them misconstrued, he declared, that his meaning was not to
make any innovation of the government established, which he knew was approved of God,
but to hear and examine the complaints that were made, and remove the occasions thereof,
whereof he willed the petitioners to begin, and shew what the things were that grieved them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:50008:252"/>
Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> with the other three,<note place="margin">An. 1603.</note> falling upon their knees, after a short
gratulatory preamble,<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> speech in behalf of the Petitioners.</note> reduced the matters questioned to two heads, some he
said concerned <hi>the matters of the Church,</hi> and others <hi>the Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that in the <hi>Book of Articles</hi> of religion, some things were
<hi>obscure,</hi> and some things <hi>defective,</hi> which they wished to be supplied, and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Being desired to name the particulars, he condescended upon some Articles,
whereof after they had conferred a while, and he professed to have received satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,<note place="margin">The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</note>
the King said, <hi>That if these were the greatest matters that grieved them, such
importunity needed not, as was used to him, and that a more private course had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
Then falling to speak of the Government of the Church, the want and
scarcity of <hi>sufficient Ministers</hi> in every Parish was much complained of with the
<hi>subscription</hi> urged to the <hi>Communion book,</hi> the <hi>censures</hi> inflicted by <hi>lay Chancellors,</hi>
and other moe points, which are to be seen in the Conference imprinted: after
some three houres debating,<note place="margin">The meeting continued to 18 of <hi>Ianuary.</hi>
                  </note> they were commanded to meet again in the same
place, the 18 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> at which time they should know his Majesties pleasure
in these matters.</p>
               <p>At the day the Bishops,<note place="margin">The effect of the meeting and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note> Deans, and Doctors of the <hi>Arches</hi> being first called,
the Archbishop presented certain notes of explanation of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which the
King had commended to the Bishops care, and thereafter his Majesty questioning
them touching the exercise of the <hi>high Commission,</hi> the Oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> the censure
of <hi>ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cmmunication,</hi> and the matter of <hi>subscription;</hi> when as they had answered in
all these points to his Majesties content, Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> and the others were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to come into the chamber, and the foresaid explanations read unto them,
wherewith they professed to be satisfied. The King upon this expressing a great
contentment with that which had passed among them, did seriously exhort them
to the preservation of unity, willing the Bishops to use their inferiors with all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and take the fairest waies for reclaiming those that were otherwise minded,
warning these others also to beware of obstinacy in their opinions, and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the orders of the Church: <hi>Obedience,</hi> said he, <hi>and humility, are the marks of
good and honest men, such I believe you to be, but it feareth me that many of your sort are
humorous, and too busie in the perverting of others. The exceptions taken against
the</hi> Communion book, <hi>as I perceive, are matters of meer weakness, and they who are
discreet will be gained with time, by gentle persuasions, or if they be und street, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is to remove them, then to have the Church troubled with their contentions. For the
Bishops I will answer, that it is not their purpose presently and out of hand to enforce obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
but by fatherly admonitions and conferences to induce such as are disaffected. But
if any be of an opposite and turbulent spirit, I will have them inforced to a conformity.
Neither tell me, that the wearing of a surplice, or using the Crosse in Baptism will diminish
the credit of Ministers that have formerly dissallowed the same; for that is just the</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
<hi>Argument, when any thing was concluded, that sorted not with their humour, the only
reason why they would not obey, was, that it stood not with their credit to yield, having been
so long of a contrary opinion. I will none of that, but that a time be limited by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of every Diocese to such, and they that will not yield whatsoever they are, let them
be removed; for we must not preferre the credit of a few private men to the generall peace
of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Throughout all this conference in every point that was moved, or came to be
talked of, the King did shew such knowledge, and readiness, as bred not a small
admiration in the hearers.<note place="margin">The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of <hi>England</hi> his judgement of the King.</note> Chancellour <hi>Egerton</hi> wondering to see him so expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
and perfect in all sort of Divinity, said, <hi>That he had often heard, and read, that</hi>
Rex est mixta persona cum Sacerdote; <hi>but that he saw never the truth of it untill
that day.</hi> Let me adde that which I was afterward told by <hi>Richard Bancroft</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (for <hi>Whitgift</hi> died the next moneth after the conference,
one of the great glories of the <hi>English</hi> Church) that when the Rolles were brought
in, of those that stood out and were deposed, which was some years after, they were
found to be fourty nine in all <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The number deposed for disconformity.</note> when as the Ministers of that Kingdome are
reckoned nine thousand and above: such a noise will a few disturbers cause in any
society, where they are tolerated.</p>

In the <hi>March</hi> thereafter,<note place="margin">An. 1604.</note> a Parliament was kept in <hi>England,</hi> where the King after
he had given thanks to the State for the generall applause they shewed in receiving
him to the place, which God by birthright,<note place="margin">A Parliament in <hi>England</hi> for the union.</note> and lineall descent had provided for
him, did earnestly move the <hi>union of the two Kingdomes,</hi> that <hi>as they were made one
in the head, so among themselves they might be inseparably conjoyned, and all memory of
by-past divisions extinguished.</hi> A motion that took well at first, and seemed to be
generally desired of both Nations, but did not succeed as was wished. The
Parliament alwaies at his Majesties desire, and for a demonstration of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

Prerogative,<note place="margin">The Kings speech to the Commissioners</note> 
                  <hi>in the</hi> preferment of men to offices and honours, <hi>in either kingdome:</hi> for

capacity of offices ought to be equall to both people; but the moderation of that equality must
be left to me, neither you to suspect that I will offer any manner of grievance to either of
the Countreys, or do any thing that may kindle emulation among them, considering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
I have to see you united in a fast and indissolveable amity. <hi>This said, he recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the prosecution of that business in the severall Parliaments to their fidelity and
trust; wishing them to lay aside all jealousies, needless fears and other worse passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in a matter that so nearly concerned the good and benefit of both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</hi>

in all Proclamations, Missives and Treaties, and the names of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>
to be discontinued (except in instruments of private parties, and where legality of
process would not admit the same:) this same in both kingdomes took ill, but his
Majesty esteeming those names whereby they had been called no better then names
of hostility, would needs have the antient name of <hi>Britain</hi> received, and these of
<hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> abolished. In like manner he did prohibite the name of the
<hi>borders</hi> to be used, and ordained all places of strength in these parts (the houses of
Noblemen and Barons excepted) to be demolished, their Iron gates to be turned
into Plow Irons, and the inhabitants to betake themselves to labour and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of peace; for the same purpose he did break the Garisons at <hi>Barwick</hi> and <hi>Carlile.</hi>
And in memory of the union so happily begun made divers pieces of gold and silver

was continued because of the union to the same moneth in the year following. The
King being informed of a great preparation that the Ministers made for keeping
that meeting, and that they intended to call in question all the conclusions taken in
former Assemblies for the Episcopall government, directed the Commissioners of
the Church to desert the Diet, and make no indiction of another till he should be
advertised. They accordingly did intimate his Majesties pleasure to all the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and therewith as they were desired declare that his Majesty did purpose to call
a number of the Bishops and disaffected Ministers to court; and for preventing such
disorderly meeting, hear the differences that were among them debated in his own

<pb n="488" facs="tcp:50008:257"/>
of Assemblies and present discipline with the introduction of the rites of <hi>England,</hi>
were the matters intended to be established, whereupon the declaration following
was by his Majesties command published.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whereas we have ever since it pleased God to establish us in the imperiall
Crown of great <hi>Britain</hi> equally regarded the good of both kingdomes,<note place="margin">His Majesties Declaration touching some rumours dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed.</note> now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
united in our royall person in one Monarchy, ever minding to maintain and
continue the good and laudable customes and laws, whereby each of them hath
been these many ages so worthily governed, nevertheless some malicious spirits,
enemies to common tranquillity, have laboured to possesse the mindes of our well
affected subjects with an opinion that we do presently intend a change of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
discipline of the Church, and by a suddain and unseasonable laying on of
the rites, ceremonies and whole Ecclesiasticall order established in this part of our
kingdome of <hi>Britaine,</hi> to overturn the former government received in these parts;
which none of our good subjects we trust will be so credulous to believe, knowing
how carefull we have been to maintain both Religion and Justice, and to reform
the evills that did in any sort prejudice the integrity of either of the two, whereby
justice hath attained under our government to a greater perfection and splendor
then in any of our predecessors times, and many abuses and corruptions in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
of the Church amended that otherwise might have brought the purity of
Religion in extreme danger; neither of which was done by our soveraign and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
authority (although we enjoy the same as freely as any King or Monarch
of the world) but as the disease of the civill body ever was cured by the advise of
our three Estates, so were the defects of the Church by the help and counsell of
those that had greatest interest therein.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And however in rule of policy we cannot but judge it convenient,<note place="margin">The King his resolution in making no sudden change in the Church policy.</note> that two
estates so miserably disjoyned should be drawn to as great conformity in all
things, as the good of both may permit; and that no Monarchy either in Civill
or Ecclesiasticall policy hath yet obtained to that perfection, that it needs no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
or that infinite occasions may not arise, whereupon wise Princes will
foresee for the benefit of their estates just cause of alteration; yet are we, and ever
have been resolved not to make any suddain and hasty change in the government
of that part of our kingdome either Civill or Ecclesiasticall, but with grave advise
and consent of our Estates, and the wisest and best sort of them whom it most
properly concerns, much less to trouble them with an unnecessary alteration of
indifferent and ceremoniall matters, and to do it upon such foreseen advantages
and prevention of confusion and evill to come, as the greatest enemies to peace
and obedience to Princes shall not obtrude any inconvenient to the contrary.
And as by Gods holy assistance we have drawn that part of our kingdome out of
infinite troubles, factions and barbarities reducing the utmost borders and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
thereof to Gods obedience and acknowledging of our laws, (a condition
never heard of since this Isle was first inhabited) so by the same divine providence
and our fatherly care over the whole Island, we intend to transmit the same in
good order, happy quietness and flourishing policy to the posterity wherewith God
hath blessed us, and after them to the worlds end: Like as for the more verification
of his own honourable intention, and to stop the mouths of those unquiet spirits,
raisers of that false scandall of alteration, we have appointed a generall Assembly
to be holden at <hi>Dundie</hi> the last Tuesday of <hi>Iuly,</hi> whereat we expect a reparation
of these disorders in as farre as belongeth to their censure, and to be freed in time
coming of all such calumnies. Given at our Honour of <hi>Hampton Court</hi> the 26 of
<hi>September</hi> 1605, and in the third year of our reign of <hi>Great Britain, France</hi> and
<hi>Ireland.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Copies of this Declaration were sent to the Ministers remaining in ward,
that they might see the vanity of these rumors, and be induced to acknowledge
their offence; but they still continuing in their obstinacy, and shewing no tokens of
penitency, were again called before the Councell the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> to receive their
censure for the disobedience of his Majesties commandements. At which time
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:50008:257"/>
being enquired what they had to say for themselves, and how they could excuse
the contempt of his Majesties directions; after some speeches tending to justifie
their doings, they presented a write, a Declaration formed in this sort:</p>
               <p>Please your Lordships, the approbation or disallowance of a Generall Assembly hath been,<note place="margin">The form of their Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</note>
and should be a matter spiritual, and alwaies cognosced and judged by the Church as Iudges,
competent within this Realm: and seeing we are called before your Lordships to hear and
see it found and declared, that we have contemptuously and seditiously convened and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
our selves in a Generall Assembly at <hi>Aberdene</hi> the first Tuesday of <hi>July</hi>

said Assembly to be declared unlawfull, as at more length is contained in the summons exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
against us; We in consideration of the premises and other reasons to be given by us,
have just cause to decline your Lordships judgment as no waies competent in the cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
specified, and by these presents we <hi>simpliciter</hi> decline the same, seeing we are most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

                  <hi>That he was troubled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
for the confession he had made, and that he would now take part with the brethren,
who stood to the defence of the good cause,</hi> as he termed it. The Councell repelling
the Declinatour, declared the Assembly to have been unlawfull, and those that
met in the same contrary to his Majesties command punishable. But because they
had added to their former fault, the crime of Treason, it was thought meet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the Censure till the King should be acquainted therewith, and his pleasure
known.</p>
               <p>No sooner was his Majesty advertised of the Declinatour,<note place="margin">Some of the Ministers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued criminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> then direction was

Certain of their brethren did supplicate the Justice for licence to conferre with
them apart, that they might perswade them to an humble submission and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of their offence. This obtained, they were most earnestly dealt with
(as well by their Brethren as by the Advocates that came to plead for them) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
their wilfulness, and not to exasperate the King by standing to the defence
of their Declinatour; but no perswasions could avail. So returning to the Barre
they were desired to answer, and shew a reason (if any they had) why the matter
should not passe the triall of a Jury. The Advocates that stayed with them (for
the two principalls refused to plead because of their obstinacy) excepting against
the Indictment,<note place="margin">Exception pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned by the Advocates.</note> said that the <hi>Statute</hi> 1592. Whereby it was declared, <hi>That the Act
made against declining of the Councells judgment should not derogate any thing from the
priviledges which God had given to the spirituall office-bearers in the Church concerning
heads of Religion in matters of heresie, collation and deprivation of Ministers, or any such
essentiall censures, having warrant of the word of God; and that thereupon inferred that
their meeting at the time libelled in</hi> Aberdene <hi>being an essentiall censure warranted by
Gods word, they might lawfully have declined the Councells judgment from taking cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was answered by his Majesties Advocate,<note place="margin">The Reply to the Exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <q>That the exception was naught,

was neither <hi>a head of Religion,</hi> nor <hi>matter of heresie,</hi> nor <hi>excommunication,</hi> nor an

their declining of the Councell when as they were called to answer for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

be in all things a good ensample to their inferiours: The Barons should set themselves to
procure the good of the Kingdome: And the Burgesses apply their mindes to the increase of
trade, especially the trade of fishing, which had been long neglected, and to the working of
cloth that had made their neighbour Countrey so famous. To them all be recommended
the rooting forth of barbarity, the planting of Colonies in the Isles, and peopling the same
with civil and industrious persons, assuring them that they so behaving themselves, their
liberty should be as dear to him as either his life or estate.</p>

of the <hi>barbarous fewds</hi> was recommended to the Councell, whereof they
were desired to make a Roll and urge the parties to reconcile, and if they refused,
then to assure them to the peace, and commit them to ward till the same was secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And whereas the custome had been to cause parties <hi>assure one another,</hi> the
King did prohibit the same as a thing dishonourable and arguing too great presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
in the subject, seeing the Law should be to every man a sufficient assurance.
The Councell reverencing his Majesties direction, did ordain that course from
thenceforth to be observed, and all <hi>assurances</hi> to be taken for the <hi>peace</hi> thereafter,
and not of <hi>one party to another:</hi> Beginning being made with the Lord <hi>Maxwell,</hi> and
the Lord of <hi>Iohnston,</hi> they were moved to joyn hands and reconcile in presence of
the Councell.</p>
               <p>This Summer the enterprise of the <hi>Lewes</hi> was again set on foot by <hi>Robert Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misdale</hi>
of <hi>Ardrie</hi> and Sir <hi>George Hay</hi> of <hi>Netherliffe,</hi> to whom some of the first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers
had made over their right. In <hi>August</hi> they took journey thither, and by
the assistance of <hi>Mackey Mackenzie</hi> and <hi>Donold Gorum</hi> forced the Inhabitants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
forth of the Isle, and give surety not to return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ardrie</hi> and his Copartners thinking all made sure, and that there was no more
danger, returned South about <hi>Martinmas,</hi> leaving some Companies to maintain
their possession, which they made good all that Winter, though now and then they
were assaulted by the Isles-men. In the Spring <hi>Ardrie</hi> went back taking with him
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:50008:258"/>
fresh provision, and fell to build and manure the lands. But this continued not
long, for moneys failing, the workmen went away, and the Companies diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
daily, the Natives having associated a number of Isles-men made a new inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
about the end of harvest, and by continuall incursions so outwearied the new
possessors, as they gave over the enterprise, and were contented for a little summe
of money to make away their rights to the Laird of <hi>Mackenzie.</hi> This turned to
the ruine of divers of the undertakers, who were exhausted in means before they
took the enterprise in hand, and had not the power which was required in a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that importance.</p>
               <p>In the end of the year a horrible Conspiracy was detected against the King,<note place="margin">The history of the Powder Treason.</note> and
the whole body of the State of <hi>England;</hi> the names of the Conspirators were <hi>Robert
Catesby, Thomas Percy, Thomas VVinter, Iohn VVright,</hi> and <hi>Guido Faulks,</hi> English men
all, and Papists by profession. These five meeting together and consulting by
what mean they might best relieve the <hi>Catholick Cause,</hi> (so they spake) <hi>Thomas Percy</hi>
proponed the <hi>killing of the King,</hi> and at his own perill made offer to perform the
same. <hi>Catesby,</hi> who had another plot in his head, answered, <q>That they would not
hazard him so, and that albeit it should succeed, the case of the Catholick cause
would be no better, the Prince and Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> being left alive; yea if both
these were cast away, yet the Counsellors, Nobility, Judges, Knights, and a great
many others addicted to Religion, would be remaining who should be able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to restore the estate, and crosse all their purposes: That therefore he had
bethought himself of a better and more safe way, which was at one time, and with
one blow to cut off all their enemies. This <hi>he said</hi> was by blowing up the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
house with gunpowder at the time when the King and Estates were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled.</q>
                  <note place="margin">The Jesuits approve of the enterprise.</note> The advice pleased them all; but first it was thought meet to ask the
opinion of their ghostly Fathers, and be informed of the lawfulness of the fact;
as of <hi>Henry Garnet, Oswould Tesmond aliàs Greenwall,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Gerard</hi> Jesuits, who
being consulted commended the enterprise, assuring them they might go on with
a good conscience and perform the deed, seeing they were Hereticks, and persons
<hi>ipso jure</hi> excommunicated against whom they were set.</p>
               <p>This resolution satisfying their consciences,<note place="margin">The Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers swear secrecy.</note> for their greater security they took
an <hi>Oath of Secrecy,</hi> 
                  <q>swearing each to other by the sacred Trinity and the blessed
Sacrament they were at that time to receive, that neither directly nor indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by word or circumstances they should discover the purpose they had taken
to any whomsoever, nor should desert from performing the same without licence
of their associates. This Oath was given upon a <hi>Primer</hi> in the presence of <hi>Gerard</hi>
the Jesuit, and having <hi>heard Masse</hi> and <hi>received</hi> the <hi>Sacrament, Thomas Percy</hi> was
appointed to hire a house nigh adjoyning to the Parliament for the more safe and
secret working of the myne.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This being obtained,<note place="margin">A Cellar hired for the myne.</note> yet with difficulty enough, they entred to work, and after
divers intermissions because of proroguing the Parliament, when they had brought
the myne to the midst of the wall, they found the opportunity of a Cellar under
the Parliament house to be let, and leaving the myne, for that the wall was hard
to be digged through, they hired the cellar, and put in it 36 barrels of powder, a
number of billets, faggots, and a great quantity of coles, wherewith they covered
the barrels. They had called in <hi>Christopher Wright, Robert Winter, Iohn Graunt,</hi>
and <hi>Thomas Bates, Catesby</hi>'s servant, and communicated the matter to them. This
last was troubled at first with the cruelty of the plot, and had forsaken them if he
had not been confirmed and encouraged by <hi>Tesmond</hi> the Jesuit to go with the rest.
After these <hi>Ambrose Rockwood</hi> and <hi>Robert Keyes</hi> were made of the Councell, all
taking the <hi>Oath of Secrecy,</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> the <hi>sacrament</hi> upon the same: And because
the charge in buying powder, billets, and hiring of houses had been a burthen hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
for <hi>Thomas Percy,</hi> it was thought meet to bring in some mo; whereupon Sir
<hi>Edward Digby</hi> and <hi>Francis Tresham</hi> were assumed.</p>
               <p>All things being now as they judged made sure,<note place="margin">A deliberation for the Kings children.</note> they began to think what course
was fittest to take after the deed was performed. The first doubt was made touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Prince and surprise of his person, or if he should accompany his Father to
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:50008:259"/>
the Parliament, how they might seise upon the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> his brother. But this
<hi>Piercy</hi> undertook to doe by reason of his acquaintance in the house, into which he
could enter without suspicion, and how soon the blow was given carry him away by
the help of such as he should have in a readinesse to assist. Of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
they made small question, for that she was kept in the Countrey by the Lady <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi>
near to <hi>Ashby, Catesby</hi>'s dwelling house.</p>
               <p>The next doubt they proponed,<note place="margin">Contribution for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.</note> where they should have money and horses: and
for this <hi>Digby</hi> made offer of fifteen hundred pounds <hi>English, Tresham</hi> two hundred,
and <hi>Piercy</hi> promised to bring all he could gather of <hi>Northumberland</hi> Rents, which he
thought would extend to four thousand pounds, and to provide ten horses for his
part. Neither doubted they but having the Heir apparent in their hands they should
finde means sufficient.</p>
               <p>A third question they made,<note place="margin">Catholicks to be stopped from coming to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> what Lords they should save from going to the
Parliament: which they agreed to be as many Catholicks as conveniently they
might.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">No forain Princes to be acquainted therewith.</note> it was moved among them what forain Princes they should acquaint
with the purpose, and whose aid they should seek. Concerning which it was agreed
that none of them should be made privie to the plot; fearing they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
secrecy to Princes, and for ayd after the deed performed there would be time
enough to intreat the same either of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> or the Countrey of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, because they saw no way to assure the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> his person,<note place="margin">Intention to proclaim Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen.</note> (for
<hi>Piercy</hi> his undertaking they held unsure) they resolved to serve their turn with the
Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and to proclaim her Queen: to which purpose they had a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
formed, wherein no mention was made of altering Religion because they
had no forces sufficient, and till they might make good their party, they would not
avow the deed to be theirs, but lay it so farre as they could upon the Puritans.</p>
               <p>Now there remained nothing,<note place="margin">The Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy detected.</note> all dangers being foreseen, and every thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
but the last act of the intended tragedy to be performed, when as that which
was so secretly hatched came to be discovered after a wonderfull manner: The
Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> son &amp; heir to the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> being in his lodging at seven of the
clock at night, had a Letter given him by one of his footmen, who received the
same upon the street from a person unknown, with a charge to put it in his Masters
hand. The tenor whereof was as followeth:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>OUt of the love I bear to some of your friends,<note place="margin">The Letter sent to the L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                           <hi>Mounteagle.</hi>
                        </note> I have a care of your preservation;
therefore would I advise you as you tender your life to devise some excuse to shift off
your attendance at this Parliament: for God and man have concurred to punish the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
of this time. Think not slightly of this advertisement, but retire your self into
your Countrey, where you may expect the event in safety: for though there be no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of any stirre, yet I say, they shall receive a terrible blow in this Parliament, and shall
not see who hurteth them. This counsell is not to be contemned, because it may doe you good,
and can doe you no harm: for the danger is passed as soon as you have burnt the Letter;
and I hope God will give you the grace to make good use of it, in whose holy protection I
commit you.</p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>It was some ten daies only before the Parliament that <hi>Monteagle</hi> received this
Letter;<note place="margin">The secrecy of so many very strange.</note> and but twelve hours before the meeting of the Estates that the Plot was
found out. Where it is a sort of wonder to think that so many being made privie to
the conspiracy, the same should not have burst out one way or other in so long a
time: For it was the eleventh of <hi>December</hi> 1604, when they began to work at the
myne, and so the space of a year and more the conspiracy went concealed. Some
advertisements were sent to the King and diverse of his Majesties Councell from
beyond sea, <hi>That the Papists were preparing to present a Petition for toleration of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
at the meeting of the Parliament, which should be so well backed as the King would be
loath to refuse it.</hi> But these advertisements were contemned, and thought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
for putting the King in fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="493" facs="tcp:50008:259"/>
Yea, and the Nobleman when he received the Letter, not knowing what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to make of it, doubted much that it had been a device to scare him from
attending the Parliament; notthelesse out of his care of the Kings preservation he
resolved to communicate the same with the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> his Majesties princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Secretary; and going the same night to <hi>Whitehall</hi> delivered the Letter to him.
The Secretary acquainting the Chamberlain, Admirall, and some others of the
Councell therewith, and examining every line thereof, resolved to shew the same
to the King at his return, (for he was then at hunting at <hi>Royston</hi>) and not to search
further in the matter till they should hear what was his judgment.</p>
               <p>The King returning to <hi>London</hi> the Thursday after, which was Alhallowes even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Letter was shewed him the next day in the afternoon, who having read
the same once or twice, said, <hi>That it was not to be contemned, and that the style seemed
more quick and pithy then is used in libells, pasquills and the like.</hi> The Secretary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the King to apprehend the matter more deeply then he expected told him,
<q>that the letter seemed to be written by a fool, or mad man, and pointing at the
passage, <hi>the danger is past as soon as you have burnt the letter;</hi> said, that the warning
was to little purpose if the burning of the letter might make the danger
eschewed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the King willing him to consider the former sentence, wherein it was said
that <hi>they should receive a terrible blow at the Parliament, and not see who did hurt them,</hi>
and when he should joyn that with the other, he should finde it to be <hi>suddain danger,</hi>
as by <hi>blowing</hi> up by <hi>Powder,</hi> that was thereby meant. Therefore willed all the
rooms in the Parliament house to be searched both above and below, to prevent
the danger if any there was.</p>
               <p>This belonging to the Chamberlain his office, he was desired to make the search,
and for staying the idle rumours to delay his going to Monday in the afternoon
the day before the first Session of Parliament. At which time the Chamberlain
taking with him the Lord <hi>Mounteagle,</hi> who was carefull to see what the warning gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
would prove, went and viewed all the rooms, where he perceived in the vault
under the upper house great store of fagots, billets and coals, and asking the keeper
of the guardrobe named <hi>Whinyard,</hi> to what use he had put those low Cellars (for
they appertained to him) he answered, that <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> had hired the house and
Cellar, and the billets and the coals were the Gentlemans provision for winter. The
Chamberlain casting his eye aside, and espying a fellow in the corner of the vault,
asked who he was, and received answer that he was <hi>Percies</hi> man who kept the house
for his Master.</p>
               <p>Thus having lookt upon all things in a careless manner as it appeared, he returned
to the King, and made report of that he had seen: which encreased his Majesties
first apprehension, and thereupon was order given for turning up those billets and
coals even to the bottome; if nothing should be found, it was devised, that <hi>Whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi>
should pretend the stealing of some of the Kings stuffe which he had in his
keeping, and that made the colour of search. Sir <hi>Thomas Knevet</hi> Gentleman of his
Majesties privie Chamber and Justice of Peace within <hi>Westminster</hi> being appointed
for this business, went thither with some few in company about midnight, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man standing without doors in his cloathes and boots, caused him to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.
This was <hi>Guido Faulks,</hi> whose hand should have fired the train, and gave
himself out for <hi>Percies</hi> man. Thereafter entring into the house he made the coals
and billets to be turned up, under which they found 36 barrells of Powder more
and less. Then turning to the fellow they had apprehended and questioning him
touching the Powder, he did instantly confess, swearing, <hi>That if he had been within
the house when they took him, he should have blown them up with the house and all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> taking the man a long went immediately to the place, and shewed the
Chamberlain and Secretary how he had sped; they making themselves ready and
warning the Counsellors that lay within the Palace, went all together to his Majesties
Bed chamber. The King awake, the Chamberlain not able to conceal his joy, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
aloud, that the <hi>Treason</hi> was discovered, and the traitor in hands. The command
was given to command the Councell to examine the Prisoner touching his parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:50008:260"/>
he nothing dejected nor moved a whit with so honorable a presence did bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avow the fact, repenting onely that he had failed in the execution, and saying,
<hi>The devill envying the success of so good a work had discovered the same.</hi> All that day no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be drawn from him touching his complices, taking all the blame upon
himself, and professing he had done it for <hi>Religion and Conscience sake.</hi> Speaking of
the King he denyed him to be his <hi>Soveraign,</hi> or <hi>anointed of God,</hi> in regard he was an
<hi>heretick,</hi> and that it was <hi>no sin to cut him off.</hi> This was his behaviour at first, but being
conveighed to the Tower and the Rack presented, he laid open the whole matter of
conspiracy, and confessed the truth. There were in the City at that time <hi>Catesby,
Percy, Tho: Winter, Francis Tresham,</hi> and the younger <hi>Wright,</hi> who hearing that all
was disclosed made away to the Countrey appointing to meet the next morning at
<hi>Dunchurch</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire Digbyes</hi> lodging. <hi>Iohn Graunt,</hi> with some Recusants that
he had associated to himself, had broke up the same night a stable of <hi>Bourch</hi> a Rider of
great horses, and carried away seven or eight belonging to certain Noblemen of
the Countrey; for he did think the conspiracy had taken effect, and was preparing
to surprise the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whose residence was not farre from the place. But
within a few hours <hi>Catesby, Percy,</hi> and the others that were fled from <hi>London</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
assurance that all was failed, they resolved upon a publick rebellion, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the quarrell of Religion laboured to draw some companies together, yet when
they had gathered all their forces they did not exceed fourscore in all.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Fulk Grevill</hi> Lieutenant deputy of <hi>Warwickshire</hi> hearing of the riot that <hi>Grant</hi>
had committed, and apprehending it to be the beginning of a Rebellion sent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise
the Towns about, and warned them to be on their gaurd. The Sheriffes of the
County convening the people likewise in armes pursued them from shire to shire.
Sir <hi>Richard Walch</hi> the Sheriffe of <hi>Worcestershire</hi> having tryed where they had taken
harbour, sent a Trumpet and Messenger to command them to render unto him in
his Majesties name, promising to intercede for their lives. But they hearing their
fault to be unpardonable returned answer, that he had need of better assistants then
the numbers that accompanied him before he could either command or compell
them. The Sheriffe provoked by their arrogant answer prepared to assail the house.
And they making defence it happened that a spark of fire falling among some
powder, which they were drying, did kindle and blew up the same, wherewith their
hands, faces and sides were sore scorched and burnt, as they lost courage, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the gate exposed themselves to the peoples fury. <hi>Catesby, Percy,</hi> and <hi>Tho. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
joyning backs and resolving rather to dye then to be taken, the two first were
killed with one shot, the other after some wounds made prisoner, the two <hi>Wrights</hi>
were killed, <hi>Rockwood, Grant, Digby,</hi> and <hi>Bates</hi> were taken, <hi>Tresham</hi> had stayed at
<hi>London,</hi> and changing his lodging thought to lurk till he he should find occasion to
escape by sea, but was in end found out. So were <hi>Robert Winter</hi> and one <hi>Littleton,</hi>
and all of them committed to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being examined <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> ingenuously confessed all, setting down the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
under his hand, and acknowledging the offence to be greater then could be
forgotten. <hi>Digby</hi> excused the crime by the despair they were driven unto, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
hopes given them at the Kings first coming to the Crown that the Catholicks
should have the exercise of their Religion permitted, which being denyed they had
taken these wicked courses. <hi>Tresham</hi> in his confession named <hi>Garnet</hi> the Jesuit as
privy to the conspiracy: but afterwards by his wives instigation did deny it, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had wronged him, and not seen him once these sixteen years. Yet <hi>Garnet</hi>
being apprehended some moneths after confessed that they met divers times within
the last half year. <hi>Tresham</hi> dyed in the prison, the rest were put to the triall of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and condemned; <hi>Digby, Grant, Robert Winter,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Bates,</hi> were executed
at the western gate of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> in the end of <hi>Ianuary; Thomas VVinter, Ambrose
Rockwood, Robert Keys</hi> and <hi>Guido Faulks</hi> who had wrought at the myne, suffered in
like sort in the Court near the Parliament house.</p>
               <p>This was the end of that conspiracy, the like whereof in no mans memory hath
been heard. We have heard of Kings treacherously killed, of practises against Estates
and Common-wealths; but such a <hi>Monster of conspiracies</hi> (as <hi>Thuan</hi> calls it) no
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:50008:260"/>
Country nor age did ever produce. The King, Queen, with their posterity, the
Nobility, Clergy, Judges, Barons, Knights, Gentry and in a manner the whole
kingdome to be in one moment all destroyed, was a wickedness beyond all expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but blessed be God, this monster which was long in breeding, in the very
birth was choaked and smothered.</p>
               <p>The King giving meeting of the Parliament the same day that the conspiracy
was discovered, made a long speech to the Estates, wherein having aggravated the
danger by many circumstances, and greatly magnified the mercies of God in the
discovery, when he came to the triall and punishment, was observed to keep a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous
temper in his discourse, wishing no innocent person either forain or domestick
should receive blame or harm thereby: <hi>For however</hi> said he, <hi>the blinde superstition
of their errors in religion hath been the onely motive of this desperate attempt, it must not
be thought that all who professe the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion are guilty of the same: for as it is
true</hi> (I keep his Majesties own words) <hi>that no other sect of Heretick (not excepting
Turke, Iew, or Pagan, nay not those of</hi> Calecut <hi>that adore the Devill) did ever maintain
by the grounds of their religion, that it was lawfull and meritorious to murther Princes or
people for the quarrell of religion; Yet it is as true on the other side, that many honest men
blinded peradventure with some opinions of Popery, as if they be not sound in questions
of</hi> Reall presence, <hi>the number of the</hi> Sacraments, <hi>and some such school questions, do either
not know, or not believe at least, all the true grounds of Popery, which is indeed the Mystery
of iniquity, and therefore do we justly confess that many Papists, especially our forefathers,
laying their onely trust upon Christ and his merits, may be saved, detesting in that point and
thinking that cruelty of Puritanes worthy of fire that will admit no salvation to any Papists.</hi>
And so concluding that part of his discourse, said, <hi>As upon the one part many honest
men seduced with some errors of Popery, may yet remain good and faithfull subjects, so upon
the other part none of those that truly know and believe the whole grounds of Popery, can
prove either good Christians or faithfull subjects.</hi> The speech is to be seen amongst his
Majesties works, and is worthy the reading for wise directions given in that business.</p>
               <p>The news of this conspiracy were speedily advertised to the Councell of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and a command given for a publick thanksgiving in all the Churches for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
deliverance, but the cause was left to every mans conjecture (albeit the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
did bear expresly, that <hi>the contrivers were Papists, and their onely quarrell
Religion)</hi> This being told, to the King, and that one of the Privy Counsellors had
said, <hi>that the conspiracy proceeded of a meer discontent the people had conceived at his
Majesties Government,</hi> he was mightily offended, and from that forth held his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to his service continually suspected.</p>
               <p>Information was made at the same time,<note place="margin">An. 1606.</note> that some of the Ministers imprisoned
at <hi>Blackness</hi> did blame the Chancellor for their meeting at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> offering <q>
                     <hi>that
they had warrant from him to meet, and his promise that they should incur no danger for
the same.</hi>
                  </q> The King to understand the truth thereof directed his servant Sir <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Irwyn</hi> to inquire at the imprisoned Ministers, what dealing they had with the
Chancellor in that business: their answer was, <q>That a little before their meeting
at <hi>Aberdene</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Forbes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn VVelsh</hi> had sought his advice touching
their convening and that he asking them what they intended to do; they answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that fearing the establishment of Bishops they were to do their best for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the same. And that he to encourage them did promise all the assistance
he could give that way: which they took to be an allowance of their meeting.</q> A
letter hereupon was directed to certain of the Councell to call the Ministers, and if
they stood to their saying to hear what the Chancellor would answer. They main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
that which they had said, and the Chancellor called to his Answer affirmed
that he was intreated by them to oppose the restitution of Bishops temporalities,
which then was in working, promising that he should not be questioned for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which they understood to be Popish. This denyed by the Ministers they fell
in a sharp contest; which continued some space withwords not seemly on either part.
The Ministers for clearing his approbation of their Assembly, did further alleadge
that he had uttered so much to Mr. <hi>VValter Balcanquell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Balfour</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who being examined touching their knowledge, Mr. <hi>VValter</hi> Balcanquel
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:50008:261"/>
                  <hi>Balcanquell</hi> did affirm, <q>That the Chancellor in private to himself had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them for maintaining the liberty of the Church, which was not a little preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
as he said by the continuation of Assemblies from year to year.</q> The same
he was said to have spoken to Mr. <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> but he excused himself by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness,
saying he did not remember any such speeches. This report made to the
King, he said, <hi>That none of the two deserved credit, and that he saw the Ministers would
betray Religion rather then submit themselves to government: And that the Chancellor
would betray the King for the malice he carried to the Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this contest always the Chancellor was made more tractable in the restitution
of Bishops temporalities, which he had strongly resisted unto that time; And in the
Parliament kept at <hi>Perth,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Iuly</hi> shewed a great desire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the same. This Parliament had been indicted to keep at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>Iune</hi>
preceding, and the Earl of <hi>Dunbar</hi> imployed to see all matters carried therein to his
Majesties minde. The Chancellor (whether out of emulation to shew his greatness,
or that he feared some affront by the Earl of <hi>Dunbar</hi>) went on the streets accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with the Burgesses in great numbers, who otherwise then was their custome
did walk with their swords. <hi>Dunbar</hi> taking this in ill part, yet dissembling his offence
caused adjourn the Parliament to the first of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and therewith presented a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for removing the same to the Town of <hi>Perth,</hi> which coming unlooked for, made
the Burgesses forthink their doing.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Perth</hi> it happened the very first day the Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to encounter the Earl of <hi>Glencarn</hi> in the Bridgegate, where drawing their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
against others a great tumult was raised, which continued a certain space and
disturbed the Councell, that as then was sitting: the Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> being tryed to
have invaded the other, which he did for revenge of his uncles slaughter, he was ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the Councell for troubling the Parliament; but leaving the town he went
home, and for his not appearing was denounced Rebell. It was held an ominous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and gave many to think that matters would not succeed well, but the Earl
of <hi>Dunbar</hi> did so wisely and with so great care prevent every thing that was like to
breed trouble, as all things were carried from that time forth in a most peaceable
sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There were attending in the town aboundance of Ministers labouring all they
could secretly to make some perturbation. The Earl calling them to his lodging did
rebuke them sharply, saying,</hi> That it seemed strange to him, that they who had so often
petitioned to have the Act of annexation dissolved should go about to hinder the same, now
when the King was to do it in part, specially considering there was nothing to be moved in
prejudice of their discipline. And that for removing the differences that were amongst
them in that point, his Majesty had resolved, as they knew by the letters some of them had
received, to call the most learned and discreet of both sides before himself, and have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
composed so far as might be to their content. More fitting, <hi>he said,</hi> it were for you to
whom his Majesty hath addressed his letters, to have been preparing your selves for the
journey. And I should advise you for your own good, and the peace of the Church, not to
write to the King any more, but rather study by your peaceable behaviour to procure favour
to your brethren that are in trouble. <hi>With these speeches he did quiet them, and so the
Parliament went on, and after some few days ended in great peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Parliament divers good constitutions were made, but the two principall
were the Acts of his Majesties <hi>Prerogative;</hi> and the Act entituled, <hi>The restitution of
the estate of Bishops,</hi> which title giveth many to mistake the truth of things, and
think that before this time the estate of Bishops was overthrown and cast down,
whereas the same was never so much as intended. Only by this Act the temporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Bishopricks, which by the Act of <hi>Annexation</hi> were made to belong to the
Crown, were restored in regard it was seen, that the Bishops were disabled to attend
their service in the Church and State by the want thereof.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Parliament dissolved such of the Clergy as his Majesty called to
Court went together, of the one side went the Archbishops of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> and
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Orkney, Galloway,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Nicolson</hi> who was destinate
Bishop of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> on the other part were Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvill,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iames Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:50008:261"/>
Mr. <hi>Iames Balfour,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Watson,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Scot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michall,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Adam Colt.</hi> All these arriving at <hi>London</hi> about the beginning of
<hi>Sept.</hi> had warning given them to attend the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of that moneth at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King had appointed some of the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> to attend during the
conference, and preach by course upon the subjects presented to them. Dr.
<hi>Barlow</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> began, taking for his text the 28 verse of the 20 chap. of
the <hi>Acts,</hi> whereby he took occasion to prove out of the Scriptures and Fathers
the supremacy of Bishops above Presbyters; and to shew the inconveniencies of
<hi>Parity</hi> in the Church; with the confusion arising from the same. Dr. <hi>Buckridge</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> took for his text the Precept of the Apostle, <hi>Omnis anima&amp;c.</hi>
Rom. 13. 1. where falling to speak of the <hi>Kings supremacy</hi> in causes <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi>
he did handle that point both soundly and learnedly to the satisfaction of all the
hearers: only it grieved the <hi>Scots</hi> Ministers, to hear the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Presbyterie</hi> so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
equalled in their opposition to <hi>soveraign Princes.</hi> Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Chichester</hi> followed, who choosed for his text the first verses of the 10 chapter of
<hi>Numbers,</hi> confirming thirdly the power of <hi>Kings</hi> in <hi>Convocating Synods</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</hi>
The fourth was Dr. <hi>King</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> he took for his theam the 11
verse of the 8 chapter of <hi>Canticles,</hi> and thereupon discoursing of the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
did prove <hi>lay Elders to have no place nor office in the Church, and the late device
to be without all warrant of Precept or example, either in Scripture or in Antiquity.</hi> This
course his Majesty took as conceiving that some of the Ministers should be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by force of reason to quit their opinions, and give place to the truth; but that
seldome happeneth where the minde is prepossessed with prejudice either against
person or matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first audience was at</hi> Hampton <hi>the 22 of</hi> September; <hi>at which<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> besides the
Bishops and Ministers from</hi> Scotland, <hi>were present the Earls of</hi> Dunbarre, Argile,
Glencarne, <hi>Sir</hi> Thomas Hamilton <hi>Advocate, and Sir</hi> Alexander Straiton: <hi>Of the</hi>
English <hi>Dr.</hi> Montague <hi>Dean of the Charpell was only admitted to stay: There
the King declaring the purpose for which he had called them, spake a few words
to this effect:</hi> That having left the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in peace at his parting forth of
it, he did now hear of great disturbances in the same; whereof he desired to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the true cause, and to have their advice, how the same might best be removed.
This being, <hi>said he,</hi> the errand in generall for which I have called you, I should be glad
to hear your opinions touching that meeting at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> where an handfull of Ministers
in contempt of my authority, and against the discharge given them did assemble; and
though they were neither a sufficient number, nor the accustomed order kept, they would
take upon them to call it a generall Assembly, and have since proudly maintained it
by declining my Councell and such other means as they pleased to use. The rather I
would hear your minds, because I am informed that divers Ministers doe justifie that
meeting, and in their publick preachings commend these brethren as persons distressed,
which in effect is to proclaim me a tyrant and Persecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Iames Melvill</hi> answering first,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Iames Melvills</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in name of the rest.</note> said, <q>that there was no such discharge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to those Ministers that met at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> as was alledged, adjuring, Sir <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander
Straiton</hi> who was said to have given the charge, to declare in his Majesties
presence how that matter was carried. As to the absence of Moderator and Clerk,
he said, that none of these were essentiall parts of an Assembly, and that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
absenting himself of purpose and the Clerk refusing to serve, the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
convened might lawfully create others in their places, so as the Ministers
having warrant to convene from the word of God, and from his Majesties laws,
as also coming thither by direction of their Presbyteries, he could not in his
conscience condemne them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Well then,<note place="margin">His Majesty proponeth three questions to them.</note> 
                  <hi>said the King,</hi> I shall desire you to answer me three things, that I will ask:
First, if it be lawfull to pray publickly for persons convicted by the lawfull Iudge as persons
being in distress, and aflicted? 2 Whether I may not being a Christian King, by my
authority royall, convocate and prorogue, and desert for just and necessary causes known to
myself any Assemblies or meetings within my Dominions? 3 Whether or not may I by my
authority-call, and convene before me and my Councell, whatsoever person, or persons,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:50008:262"/>
Civil, or Ecclesiastial, for whatsoever offences committed by them in whatsoever place within
my Dominions, and if I may not take cognition of the offence, and give sontence therein?
And further, whether or not are all my subjects being cited to answer before me and my
Councell, obliged to compeir and acknowledge me or them for judges in these offences?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Iames</hi> answering,<note place="margin">A time is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by them and granted.</note> said that the questions were weighty, and craved a great
deliberation; wherefore he would humbly entreat his Majesty to grant them a
time to conferre and advise together, that they might all give one direct answer.
This desire granted, they were commanded to advise and meet together that night,
and be ready to answer the next day.<note place="margin">The second audience.</note> At this meeting the Earls of <hi>Salisbury</hi>
and <hi>Northampton</hi> with divers of the <hi>English</hi> Clergy were present. The Ministers
desiring to have the meeting more private, requested the Earl of <hi>Dumbarre</hi> to
move the King therein, and that none but <hi>Scotsmen</hi> should be present; <hi>fearing</hi>
(as they said) <hi>that some unseemly words might escape them.</hi> But this was denied,
and they warned to speak with that respect which became subjects. It was believed
that the King should have begun with the questions proponed in the former meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">The Bishops judgement of the meeting at <hi>Aberdene.</hi>
                  </note>
but his Majesty taking another course, required them to declare one by one,
their judgements touching <hi>Aberdene</hi> Assembly. The Bishops (being first askt)
did all condemn the meeting as turbulent, factious, and unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvill</hi> then being enquired made answer,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Addrew Melvills</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer touching the same.</note> 
                  <q>That he could not
condemn the Assembly, being a private man; that he came into <hi>England</hi> upon
his Majesties letter, without any Commission from the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and though he had Commission <hi>in dicta causa,</hi> and not hearing what they could
say for themselves, he could not give his judgement; Sentence he said was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
against them in a justice Court; how justly, he did remit that to the great
Judge; but for himself he would say as our Saviour did in another case, <hi>Quis
me constituit judicem?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Iames Balfoure</hi> being next asked,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Iames Balfour</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> 
                  <q>Did pray his Majesty not to press
him with any answer, for that he knew nothing would be well taken, that
proceeded from his mouth, and that Mr. <hi>Andrew</hi> had answered his minde
sufficiently.</q>
               </p>

his coming to <hi>London</hi> he had received divers letters, and with them a Petition,
that should have been presented to the late Parliament in behalf of the warded
Ministers, which he was desired to offer unto his Majesty, and as he thought, the
Petition would make all their mindes known.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The King taking the Petition and falling to read the same, willed the Advocate
to goe on and receive the answer of the rest. And as the Advocate was question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mr. <hi>William Scot</hi> and urging him with a distinct answer (for he used many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocutions,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>William Scot</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by Mr. <hi>Andrew Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi>

according to the custome) Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvill</hi> in a great passion
said, <hi>That he followed the instructions of Mr.</hi> John Hamilton <hi>his uncle, who had poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned

Northampton</hi> asking what he meant by that speech? the King said, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him, <hi>the mickle Devill:</hi> and then foulding up the Petition, said, <hi>I see you are
all set for maintaining that base Conventicle of</hi> Aberdene? <hi>But what answers have you
to give to the questions I moved?</hi> 
                  <q>It was answered, that they had conferred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and finding them to concern the whole Church, they would not by their
particular voices prejudge the same. <hi>But you will not I trust,</hi> said the King, <hi>call
my authority in question, and subject the determination of the same to your Assemblies.</hi>
This they said was farre from their thoughts, but if his Majesty should be
pleased to set down in writing what he required, they should labour to give him
satisfaction.</q>

his Majesties pleasure concerning the warded Ministers, which to this time had

The letter to the Justice was as followeth; <q>Whereas in our Justice Court holden

Treason for their contemptuous and treasonable declining the judgement of
us and the Lords our secret Councell; by a Declinatour subscribed with
their hands and presented in judgement before the said Lords; and that the

our pleasure was declared; We now considering the great insolency committed

declared Traitours more then sufficient time to have acknowledged their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,

them but an obdured obstinacy, without any token of resipiscence: albeit the
greatness of the offence in men of their function, whose actions should be pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
of duty and obedience to others, hath demerited most justly the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

which you shall return them to their wards, there to remain for the space of

whereof, if they doe not depart wind and weather serving, or being departed
shall return unto our Dominions without our licence, the ordinary death usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to think, that for trespasses of this quality no greater rigour will hereafter be
used; to remove all such conceits, and that notice may be taken of our full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination

for withstanding their courses of discipline. If now one should take the like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and say, That God to whom the Bishop at his dying did commend his cause,
had taken a revenge of him, who was the chief instrument of his trouble; it
might be as probably spoken, and with some more likelyhood then that which
they blasted forth against the dead Bishop. But away with such rash and bold
conceits, the love of God either to causes or persons is not to be measured by
these externall and outward accidents.</p>
               <p>But leaving this, the King being very desirous to have the Church quieted,<note place="margin">An Assembly indicted at <hi>Linlithgow.</hi>
                  </note> and
a solid and constant Order established for preventing the like offences, did call a
generall Assembly to meet at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> the 10 of <hi>December;</hi> and for the better
ordering of business, directed the Earl of <hi>Dunbarre</hi> to attend the meeting. At
the day many convened both Ministers and others. Of Ministers there were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
one hundred thirty six: of Noblemen, Barons, and others, thirty and
three. Mr. <hi>Iames Nicolson</hi> elected to preside; the Earl of <hi>Dunbarre</hi> presented a
letter from his Majesty to this effect;<note place="margin">His Majesties letter to the Assembly.</note> 
                  <q>That it was not unknown what pains he had
taken whilest he lived amongst them, as well to root out Popery as to settle a
good and perfect Order in the Church; and that notwithstanding of his care
bestowed that way, he had been continually vexed by the jealousies of some
perverse Ministers, who traducing his best actions gave out amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that all he went about, was to thrall the liberty of the Gospell. Neither
content thus to have wronged him, they had in his absence factiously banded
themselves against such of their brethren as had given their concurrence to the
furtherance of his Majesties just intentions, upon the knowledge whereof he
did lately call the most calme and moderate, as he esteemed, of both sides unto
his Court, thinking to have pacified matters and removed the divisions arisen
in the Church; but matters not succeeding as he wished, he had taken purpose
to convene them for setting down such rules as he hoped should prevent the
like troubles in after times, which he had intrusted to his Commissioner the
Earl of <hi>Dunbarre:</hi> willing them to consider what was most fitting for the
peace of the Church, and to apply themselves to the obedience of his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as they did expect his favour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the reading of the letter the overture was presented, conceived in this
forme.<note place="margin">An overture sent from his Majesty to the Assembly.</note> 
                  <q>That his Majesty apprehending the greatest causes of the misgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Church affairs to be, that the same are often, and almost ordinarily
committed to such as for lack of wisdome and experience are no way able to
keep things in a good frame; for remedying this inconvenient, thinketh
meet, that presently there be nominated in every Presbyterie one of the most
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:50008:263"/>
grave, godly, and of greatest authority, and experience, to have the care of the
Presbyterie where he remaineth, till the present jarres and fire of dissension
which is among the Ministery, and daily encreaseth to the hinderance of the
Gospell, be quenched and taken away; and the Noblemen professing Papistry
within the Kingdome be either reduced to the profession of the truth, or then
repressed by justice and a due execution of the lawes; and for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the said Moderators, and the enabling them to the attendance of the
Church affairs, his Majesty is graciously pleased to allow every of them one
hundred pounds <hi>Scots</hi> or two hundred marks according to the quality of their
Charge: but where the Bishops are resident, his Majesty will have them to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and preside in these meetings. As likewise because it often falleth out
that matters cannot be decided in Presbyteries, by reason of the difficulties
that arise, and that the Custome is to remit the decision thereof to the Synod of
the Diocie; It is his Majesties advice that the moderation of these Assemblies be
committed to the Bishops, who shall be burthened with the delation of Papists,
and solicitation of justice against those that will not be brought to obedience, in
respect his Majesty hath bestowed on them places and means to bear out the
charges and burthens of difficill and dangerous actions, which other Ministers
cannot so well sustain, and undergoe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This overture seeming to import a great alteration in the discipline was not
well accepted of divers;<note place="margin">Some brethren deputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> but his Majesties Commissioner having declared that
it was so farre from the Kings purpose to make any change in the present Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
as he did not long for any thing more then to have it rightly setled and all
these eyelists removed which had given him so just occasion of discontent; they
desired a time to deliberate, and that a number of the most wise and learned
might be selected to conferre thereupon, and report their opinions to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</p>
               <p>The brethren named in this conference, having debated every point at length,<note place="margin">The overture embraced with some cautions.</note>
and considered the inconveniencies that might arise by the change, especially the
usurpation that was feared, these constant Moderators should make upon
their brethren, resolved that the overture proponed was not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused;
so as certain cautions were added which were condescended to in
manner following.
<list>
                     <item>First,<note place="margin">Cautions for the constant Moderators.</note> That the Moderators of Presbyteries and Provinciall Assemblies
should not presume to doe any thing of themselves without the advice and
consent of their brethren.</item>
                     <item>2 That they should use no further jurisdiction nor power then Moderators
have been in use of, by the constitutions of the Church.</item>
                     <item>3 If it should happen the Moderatours to be absent at any time from these
meetings, it should be in the power of Synods and Presbyteries to nominate
another for moderating in their absence.</item>
                     <item>4 When the place of a Moderatour in any Presbyterie should be void, the
election of one to succeed should be made by the whole Synod with consent
of his Majesties Commissioner.</item>
                     <item>5 If any of the Moderatours should depart this life betwixt Assemblies, it
should be lawfull to the Presbyteries to nominate one of the most grave and
worthy of their number for the place, unto the meeting of the next <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>6 That the Moderatours of the Presbyteries should be subject to the tryall
and censure of the Synod; and in case they usurped any further power over
the brethren, then is given them by the Assembly; the same should be a
cause of deprivation from their Office of Moderation, and they deprived
thereof by the said Synods.</item>
                     <item>7 In like manner the Moderatour of the Provinciall Assembly should
be tried and censured by the generall Assembly, and in case he was
found remiss, or to have usurped any further power then the simple place
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:50008:264"/>
of a Moderatour he should be deprived therefore by the generall Assembly.</item>
                     <item>8 That the Moderatours of every Presbyterie and Synod with their Scribes
should be astricted to be present at the generall Assembly, and be reputed
members thereof, by bringing with them the Registers of the Acts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in their meetings to be seen, that so their diligence and fidelity in
their Charges might be known.</item>
                     <item>9 That it should be lawfull to each Presbytery to send two or three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
to the generall Assembly, by and besides the Moderatour and
Scribe, if they should think it convenient.</item>
                     <item>10 That the Moderatour of the generall Assembly should be chosen by
the voices of the whole Assembly, lites being first made and proponed, as in
times passed.</item>
                     <item>11 That in the Synods where there is not a Bishop actually resident, the like
lite should be made of the Moderatours of the Presbyteries within these
bounds, and one of them elected to moderate the same Assembly, so as his
Majesties Commissioners give their advice thereunto.</item>
                     <item>And lastly, That the Rolls of Moderatours in every Presbyterie should be
examined, to see if there was any other of the number fit to use the said office,
and that they whom this present. Assembly should nominate, to accept
the said Moderation upon them without making any shift or excuse.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>These cautions being read in the full Assembly were approved of all,<note place="margin">The cautions and overture approved.</note> and the
overture thereafter put to voices was allowed, and the same enacted as a conclusion
of the whole Assembly, four only of the whole number disassenting; other four
refusing to vote because they had no commission, as they pretended, from their
Presbyteries, and two answering, <hi>Non liquet.</hi> This conclusion taken, the rolls of
Ptesbyteries were called, and none found more sufficient then they who did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
moderate these meetings; whereupon an Ordinance was made, that they
should continue in their Charges, and not be altered unlesse the Synod did make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
choice.</p>
               <p>This business ended,<note place="margin">A complaint of the Papists and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>insolencie.</note> a great complaint was made of the insolency of Papists,
chiefly in the North parts, and of the superstitions used at the burialls of the Lord
<hi>Ogilvy,</hi> and Laird of <hi>Gight,</hi> who had deceased a few moneths before. The Marquis
of <hi>Huntley</hi> being also returned lately from Court, had given out that he brought a
Warrant from his Majesty to stay all Ecclesiasticall proceedings against him, his
Lady and family: by which reports those of the Romane profession were not a little
encouraged, and were become open contemners of the Censures of the Church.</p>
               <p>These complaints being greatly taken to heart by the whole Assembly, it was
concluded that a Petition should be preferred to his Majesty in all their names,<note place="margin">Petition from the Assembly to his Majesty.</note> for
confining the Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arroll,</hi> with their Ladies,
in some Cities and Towns where they might by the hearing of the Word, and
conference with learned men be reduced from their errors, at least kept from doing
harm, and from the perverting of others. To present this Petition and the Act of
constant Moderators, choice was made of Mr. <hi>Iames Law</hi> Bishop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> and he
dispatched to Court; which done, the Assembly brake up and dissolved with the
good satisfaction of all.</p>
               <p>Nor was it long before the Kings answer returned in these particulars,<note place="margin">His Majesties answer.</note> and first
concerning the Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> his Majesty declared, <q>That he had obtained
no Warrant for impeding the Church discipline, neither against himself, or any
of his family; and that only (because he affirmed that he had kept all the injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
prescrived, except that he had not communicated) the Councell was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
after triall of his obedience in the rest of the particulars enjoyned, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Presbyteries of the North to stay their proceedings against him for his
not communicating, concerning which point he had certified the Marquis, that
howsoever some space was granted to him for his better resolution, if he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in his errors, and would not be reclaimed, he would make no other reckoning
of him then of one that studied to make himself the head of a faction, and rather
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:50008:264"/>
root him out,<note place="margin">An. 1607.</note> then nourish him in his follies by a preposterous toleration.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>confining</hi> of him, and the other Noblemen in the Cities and places set
down in the Assemblies Petition,<note place="margin">His Majesties pleasure touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popish Noblemen.</note> 
                  <q>his Majesty did think it too rigorous, unlesse
they were tried to have committed some offence deserving the same. Wherefore
he would have them called before the Councell, the Bishop of the Diocie, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
of the Presbytery, and the Minister of the Parish being present, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
concerning their behaviour, and whether they did resort or not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Sermon; wherein if they should be tried to have transgressed, his pleasure
was they should be confined within so many miles compasse, as are distant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the houses of their residence, and the City, wherein it was desired they
should be confined to the end they may repair to their houses, when the necessity
of their business requireth, and at other times resort to the City or Town de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for their instruction, where they should be tied to stay ten daies together,
and during their stay hear Sermons, admit conference, and forbear the company
of Jesuits, Seminary Priests and others of that profession. And if it should
happen them to have any business in Councell or Session, that license should be
granted unto them for repairing thither during a certain a certain space, providing
they did resort to the Church, and gave no scandall by their behaviour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>superstitious rites</hi> used at the buriall of the Lord <hi>Ogilvy</hi> and <hi>Gight,</hi> 
                  <q>his
Majesties pleasure was, that their sons should be called before the Councell and
committed, but no sentence should be given till the whole circumstances were
tried and notified to him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the conclusion taken for the <hi>constant Moderators,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Direction to the Councell for constant Moderators.</note> 
                  <q>his Majesty did
thank them for their travels; but whereas they were of opinion that the Act
should be universally received, (<hi>for so much the Assembly had written</hi>) he said, that
he knew them too well to expect any such thing at their hands. Their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
zeal to maintain parity, and a desire to keep all things in a continuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
volubility, he said was such as they would never agree to a setled form of
government. Besides, he knew that divers of these who were nominated to the
places of Moderation, would refuse to accept the same, lest they should be
thought to affect superiority above their brethren: That therefore he would have
the Councell to look to that business, and direct Charges as well for those that
were nominated to accept the moderation, as to the Ministers of every Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
to acknowledge them that were nominated.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The event justified his Majesties opinion, for all the next year there was no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that troubled the Councell as that of the constant Moderator.<note place="margin">The Synod of Perth dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> The Synod of
<hi>Perth</hi> convening in <hi>March</hi> thereafter, did in direct opposition of the Act concluded
at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> inhibit all the Presbyteries within their bounds to acknowledge the
conclusion taken in that meeting, and discharged Mr. <hi>Alexander Lindesay</hi> Parson of
<hi>Simmedose,</hi> who was nominated by the Assembly Moderator of <hi>Perth,</hi> to exercise
the said office under pain of the Censure of the Church. The Synod being cited
before the Councell for this presumption, was discharged to meet thereafter, and
the Presbyteries within the bounds commanded under pain of Rebellion to accept
their Moderators.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Fife</hi> the resistance was no lesse;<note place="margin">The Synod of <hi>Fife</hi> dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> for the Synod being continued twice, first
from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>Iune,</hi> then from <hi>Iune</hi> to <hi>September,</hi> meeting at that time in <hi>Dysert,</hi>
and pressed by the Lords, <hi>Lindesay Scone,</hi> and <hi>Halirudhouse,</hi> Commissioners from the
Councell, to accept the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> for their Moderator, did obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
refuse, and dissolved without doing any thing; hereupon was that Synod
likewise discharged, and all the Burghs inhibited to receive them, if perhaps they
should reassemble after the Commissioners were gone. The Presbyteries of <hi>Mers</hi>
were also very troublesome, and the Councell so vexed with complaints of that
kinde, as not a day passed without some one or other. But all this opposition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
vain, and they in end forced to obey, did finde by experience this setled course
much better then their circular elections.</p>
               <p>A Commission came in this mean time for planting some learned and worthy
person in the place of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvill</hi> at S. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Provest pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the new Colledge of S. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                  </note> The Commission was
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:50008:265"/>
directed to the Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Dunkeld, Rosse,</hi> and
<hi>Birchen,</hi> the Lord <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> the Advocate, the Laird of <hi>Balcomy,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missar
of S. <hi>Andrews;</hi> who meeting in the new Colledge the 16 of <hi>Iune,</hi> after the
reading of his Majesties Letter (whereby it was declared, That the said Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi>
being judged by the Councel of <hi>England</hi> to have trespassed in the highest sort
against his Majesty, and for the same committed to the Tower till he should receive
his just punishment, was no more to return to that charge) they according to the
power given them, did proceed and make choice of Mr. <hi>Robert Howy</hi> to be Provost
of the said Colledge, ordaining him to be invested in the said office with all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
and priviledges accustomed, which was accordingly performed in the
<hi>Iuly</hi> thereafter, and he entred to his Charge the 27 of that moneth.</p>
               <p>It remained that some course should be taken with the Ministers that were stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Ministers permitted to return from <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> as it was once purposed, were to be provided with some Livings in
<hi>England;</hi> but that Church not liking to entertain such guests, they were all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to return home upon their promise to live obedient and peaceable. M. <hi>Iames
Melvill</hi> was only retained, who lived a while confined at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> was after some
months licensed to come to <hi>Berwick,</hi> where he deceased. A man of good learning,
sober and modest, but so addicted to the courses of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvill</hi> his Uncle,
as by following him he lost the Kings favour, which once he enjoyed in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and so made himself, and his labours unprofitable to the Church.</p>
               <p>Now let us see what happened in the Kingdome during this time:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Spynie</hi> killed.</note> The King
was ever seriously commending to the Councell the removing of the barbarous
fewds wherewith he had been so greatly troubled, divers whereof by their travells
were this year agreed, yet new occasions daily arising they were kept in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
business. <hi>David Lindesay</hi> younger of <hi>Edyell</hi> seeking to revenge the slaughter of
his Uncle Mr. <hi>Walter Lindesay</hi> whom <hi>David Master</hi> of <hi>Crawford</hi> had killed, as he lay
in wait of the said <hi>Master</hi> (who was then by the decease of his Father succeeded in the
Earldome) through a pitifull mistake did invade <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Spynie,</hi> and killed
him in stead of the other. The Noblemans death was much regrated for the many
good parts he had, and the hopes his friends conceived that he should have raised
again that noble and antient house of <hi>Crawford</hi> to the former splendor and dignity,
all which perished with him: he that was in place and escaped the perill being a
base unworthy prodigall, and the undoer of all, that by the virtue of his Ancestors
had been long kept together.</p>
               <p>Another business no lesse troublesome did also then happen betwixt the Earl of
<hi>Morton</hi> and the Lord <hi>Maxwell</hi> for holding of Courts in <hi>Eskdale,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Trouble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> and Lord <hi>Maxwell.</hi>
                  </note> unto which both
did pretend right. The preparation on both sides was great, and like to have caused
much unquietness, if the same had not been carefully prevented; both parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
charged by the Councell to dissolve their forces, and not to come towards the
bounds: the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> obeyed, <hi>Maxwell</hi> contemning the charge went on, and
by a cartell did appeal <hi>Morton</hi> to the combate: whereupon he was committed in
the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Maxwell</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted maketh an escape.</note> and after some two moneths stay made an escape. No
sooner found he himself at liberty, then he fell a plotting the Laird of <hi>Iohnstons</hi>
murther, which he wrought in a most treacherous manner; he pretending to use his
friendship in obtaining his Majesties pardon, employed Sir <hi>Robert Maxwell</hi> of
<hi>Orchardtowne,</hi> whose Sister <hi>Iohnston</hi> had married, to draw on a meeting betwixt
them, as he did; at a little hill called <hi>Achmanhill</hi> they did bring each of them one
servant only as was agreed, the said Sir <hi>Robert</hi> being present as a friend to both. At
meeting after they had courteously saluted one another, and conferred a little space
very friendly, the two servants going aside, the one called <hi>Charles Maxwell</hi> a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Kirkhouse,</hi> the other <hi>William Iohnston</hi> of <hi>Lockerby, Charles</hi> falleth in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling,<note place="margin">The Laird of <hi>Iohnston</hi> most treacherously killed by <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>
                  </note>
the other shooteth a pistoll at him, the Laird of <hi>Iohnston</hi> making to part
them, the Lord <hi>Maxwell</hi> shooteth him in the back with two bullets; whereupon he
falleth, and for a while keeping off the Lord <hi>Maxwell</hi> who made to strike him with
his sword, expired in the place; it was the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> in the year 1608, that this
happened.<note place="margin">An. 1608.</note> The fact was detested by all honest men, and the Gentlemans misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
sore lamented, for he was a man full of wisdome and courage, and every way
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:50008:265"/>
well inclined, and to have been by his too much confidence in this sort treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
cut off, was a thing most pitifull. <hi>Maxwell</hi> ashamed of that he had done,
forsook the Countrey, and had his estate forfeited; some years after stealing
quietly into the Kingdome he was apprehended in the Countrey of <hi>Cathnes,</hi> and
beheaded at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 21 of <hi>May,</hi> 1613.</p>
               <p>The purpose of <hi>civilizing the Isles</hi> was this year again renewed,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> made Lieutenant of the Isles</note> and a long Treaty
kept with the Marquis of <hi>Huntley</hi> thereupon, but he breaking off by reason of the
small duty he did offer for the North Isles, the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> was made Lieutenant
thereof for the space of six moneths, in which time it was hoped that some good
should be wrought, and the people reduced to good manners; yet nothing was
done to any purpose, the great men of those parts studying only the increase of
their own grandeur, and striving whose command should be greatest.</p>
               <p>In the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> that held in <hi>November</hi> preceding,<note place="margin">A Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> for the union.</note> the matter of
<hi>union</hi> received many crossings, and of <hi>all the Articles</hi> condescended among the
Commissioners, only that was enacted which concerneth <hi>the abolishing of hostile
laws.</hi> The King grieved at this exceedingly, and conceiving that the work should
more easily be effected, if a beginning was made in <hi>Scotland;</hi> did call a Parliament
in <hi>August,</hi> which was kept by <hi>Lodowick</hi> Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> as Commissioner for his
Majesty, the Earl of <hi>Montrose</hi> being then deceased. The Estates to satisfie the
Kings desire did allow <hi>all the Articles</hi> concluded in the Treaty, with a provision,
<hi>That the same should be in like manner ratified by the Parliament of</hi> England,<note place="margin">Provisions for the union.</note> 
                  <hi>otherwise
the conclusions taken should not have the strength of a law.</hi> It was also declared, <hi>that if
the union should happen to take effect, the Kingdome notwithstanding should remain an
absolute and free Monarchy, and the fundamentall laws receive no alteration.</hi> But the
Parliament of <hi>England</hi> either disliking the union, as fearing some prejudice by it to
their Estate, or upon some other hidden cause, did touch no more the business, and
so that good work tending to the advantage of both Kingdomes was left and quite
deserted.</p>
               <p>In the Church a new trouble was moved by the revolt that <hi>Huntley</hi> and the two
Earls of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arroll</hi> made;<note place="margin">An Assembly in <hi>Linlithgow</hi> for restraining Papists.</note> divers especially in the North parts falling away
by their example. This being represented to the King, he gave order for calling
an Assembly, which convened at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> in the end of <hi>Iuly.</hi> Therein the Earls
of <hi>Dunbar, Winton,</hi> and <hi>Lothian</hi> sate Commissioners for the King. The Bishop of
<hi>Orkney</hi> elected to preside, having shewed the occasion of the present meeting to be
the growth and increase of Papists in all the quarters of the Kingdome, it was
thought meet to take up the names of those that made open profession of Popery,
and likewise of those that were suspected to favour the course, that their number
and forces being known the remedies might be the better advised and provided.</p>
               <p>The number was found to very great,<note place="margin">The Marquis of <hi>Huntley</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> chiefly in the North, and the Marquis of
<hi>Huntley</hi> delated by all as the only cause of the defection in those bounds: he being
cited to appear before the Assembly under the pain of excommunication, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
compeiring nor sending any excuse, was ordained to be excommunicated, and
the sentence accordingly pronounced in the hearing of the whole Assembly. This
was appointed to be intimated in all the Churches, and no absolution given upon
whatsoever offers in regard of his manifold apostasies without the advice of the
general Church: The like course was concluded to be kept with <hi>Angus, Arroll,</hi> and
the Lord <hi>Semple,</hi> how soon the processes intended against them were brought to an
end.</p>
               <p>This done,<note place="margin">The causes of the defection partly in the Church.</note> the Assembly began to rip up the causes of the defection more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
which they found to proceed from the Ministers in a part, their negligence
in teaching, and catechising of people, the too suddain admission of young men into
the Ministery, and the distraction of mindes among those that are admitted; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
whereof it was ordained as followeth:</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">The remedies of the same.</note> that they should apply themselves to the exercise of their function with
greater diligence then they were accustomed, and take a speciall care of young
children to see them instructed in the Belief, the Lords prayer, and ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:50008:266"/>
whereof they should examine every childe at the age of six years, and
yearly enquire of their profiting and increase in knowledge.</p>
               <p>2 That some longer time should be prescrived for the admission of men to the
Ministery, and the exceptions contained in the Act of the age of Ministers to be
admitted reserved to the cognition of the Generall Assembly.</p>
               <p>3 That they use a greater diligence in the processing of Papists, and that none
out of corrupt favour should grant them any oversight under the pain of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p>4 That all who carried office in the Church, should be carefull to eschew of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
and endevour to keep love and peace among themselves.</p>
               <p>5 And for the present distractions in the Church, seeing the same did arise part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from a diversity of opinions touching the externall government of the Church,
and partly from divided affections, the last of these two being the most dangerous,
as not suffering the brethren to unite themselves against the common enemy; they
were all in the fear of God exhorted to lay down whatsoever grudge or rancour
they had conceived, and to be reconciled in heart and affection one to another:
Which all that were present did faithfully promise by the holding up their hands.</p>
               <p>But the fault not being in the Ministers alone,<note place="margin">The cause of the defection proceeding from others.</note> and seen to proceed from other
causes also; as from the oversight of Jesuits and Priests, and their entertainment in
the Countrey; the preferment of men to publick offices that were suspected in
Religion; the favour shewed to Papists by them in places of chief authority;
Masie Priests admitted without his Majesties warrant, and no security taken for
their not returning; Licences granted to Noblemens sons for going abroad, and
their education trusted to men of contrary profession; advocation to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of matters properly belonging to the Ecclesiasticall Judicatories; and the lack
of Preachers in many parts of the land; It was concluded that certain Petitions
should be formed and presented to his Majesty by some selected Commissioners
for remedying these evils, which were formed in this manner:</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Supplication to his Majesty for redresse of these evils.</note> that an humble supplication should be made by the whole Assembly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
his Majesty not to permit any Papist, or suspected of Popery to bear
charge in Councell, Session, or in any Burgh or City, and where his Majesty did
know any such to occupie these places, humbly to crave that order might be taken
for their removing.</p>
               <p>2 That the laws made against Papists should receive execution and no favour
be granted unto them by the Officers of State, with a prohibition to the Councell
to meddle in affairs Ecclesiasticall, or to discharge the processes led by Ministers
against Papists and others contemners of Church discipline.</p>
               <p>3 That Papists abjuring their Religion in hope of preferment to Offices of
State,<note place="margin">Petitions to his Majesty for repressing Popery.</note> should not be admitted thereto till they had given five years probation at
least.</p>
               <p>4 That the sons of Noblemen professing Popery should be committed to the
custody of such of their friends as are sound in Religion.</p>
               <p>5 That a Commission should be granted to every Bishop within his Dioces,
and to such well affected Noblemen, Barons and Gentlemen, as the Commissioners
of the Assembly should nominate, for apprehending of Jesuits, Seminary Priests,
excommunicated Papists, and traffiquers against Religion.</p>
               <p>6 That the Searchers of ships should seise upon all Books that are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Countrey, and present them to the Ministers of the Town where the ships
shall happen to arrive.</p>
               <p>7 That excommunicate Papists be put in close prison, and none have accesse
unto them but such as are known to be of sound Religion.</p>
               <p>8 That the Deputies of excommunicates be not suffered to enjoy any office
under them, and that some others be appointed by his Majesty to serve in their
places.</p>
               <p>9 Finally, that his Majesty should be humbly intreated to plant the unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:50008:266"/>
Churches, especially the Churches of the Chappel Royall, with competent
Stipends.</p>
               <p>The Commissioners chosen to present these Petitions were, the Archbishop of
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> the Earl of <hi>VVigton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Kilsith,</hi> Mr. <hi>VVilliam Couper</hi> Minister at
<hi>Perth,</hi> and <hi>Iames Nisbit</hi> Burgess of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> together with the Petitions they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Letter from the Assembly conceived in these terms:</p>
               <p>HAving convened in this Generall Assembly by your Majesties favourable licence and
permission, and shadowed under your Majesties wings with the presence of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Commissioners, we did set our selves principally to consider the cause of the late growth
of Papists among us, and found by an universall complaint, the chief cause to be this, that
where the Church in these parts was accustomed to be nourished by your Majesties fatherly
affection as the most kinde parent of piety and Religion, we have been left in the hands of
unkinde stepfathers, who esteeming us an uncouth birth to them have intreated us hardly,
and cherished our adversaries by all means they could, as your Majesties highness will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more clearly by the overtures for remedy, which in all humble submission we present to
your Majesty by these honourable Commissioners and brethren, humbly intreating your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to take compassion upon us, your Majesties loving children in this land, that we may be
taken out of the hands of these who are more ready to deliver the heads of the Kings sons to
<hi>Jehu,</hi> if the time were answerable to their wishes, then to nourish and bring them up to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>There is no cause, Sir, why the Apostates who have lately grown up in this land should
be feared, whatever they be in estate or number; for with them are the golden Calves, which
God will destroy; with them is Dagon, whose second fall shall be worse then the first; but
with your Majesty is the Lord your God to fight for you, and under your standard are the
best of the Nobility, the greatest number of Barons, and all your Majesties Burgesses, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
in Religion, and resolute all of them for Gods honour, and your Majesties preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to spend their goods and lives and whatever is due to them: VVe also your Majesties
humble servants the Bishops and Ministers of the Gospel in this land, now reconciled to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with a most hearty affection, by your Majesties only means and the carefull labours of
your Majesties trusty Counsellor, and our very good Lord the Earl of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> are for out
parts most ready to all service in our callings to stirre up your Majesties subjects by the word
that God hath put in our mouths, to the performing of that obedience which God and nature
doth oblige them unto, and by Gods grace shall go before them in all good e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sample. These
things we leave to be delivered by our Commissioners, whom we beseech your Majesty to
hear graciously, and after some favourable consideration of our case, and present suits, to
give such answer as in your Highness wisdome shall be thought fittest. And now with our
humble thanks to your Majesty for the liberty granted to meet in this Assembly, and our most
hearty prayers to God Almighty for your Highness long life and prosperous reign, we
rest.</p>
               <p>This letter was subscribed by the Earls of <hi>Crawford, Glencarne</hi> and <hi>Kinghorne,</hi>
the Lords <hi>Lindesay, Baclugh, Salton, London, Torphichen, Blantire, Scone, Halirud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi>
and a great number of the Clergy and Barons.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor hearing of the Assemblies proceedings, and supposing himself
to be specially aimed at in all that business (wherein he was not mistaken) moved
the Secretary to take journey to Court, for obviating these courses so farre as he
might. But he at his coming did meet with a business that concerned himself more
nearly, for about the same time Cardinall <hi>Bellarmin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> had published an Answer to
the Kings Apology,<note place="margin">The Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries journey to Court.</note> and therein <hi>charged him with inconstancy, objecting a Letter that
he had sent to</hi> Clement <hi>the eighth whilst he lived in</hi> Scotland, <hi>in which he had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to his Holiness the Bishop of</hi> Vaison <hi>for obtaining the dignity of a Cardinall, that
so he might be the more able to advance his affairs in the Court of</hi> Rome. The Treatise
coming to the Kings hands, and he falling upon that passage did presently conceive
that he had been abused by his Secretary, W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he remembred had moved on a time
for such a letter, and thereupon began to think that among the letters sent to the
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:50008:267"/>
Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> at the time another might have been shuffled in to
the Pope, and his hand surreptitiously got thereunto.</p>
               <p>The King lay then at <hi>Royston,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is charged for writing a letter to the Pope, and stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties hand thereto.</note> and the Secretary coming thither, he inquired if
any such letter had been sent to the Pope at any time. The Secretary apprehending
no danger; and thinking that his policy in procuring the Popes favour to the King
should not be ill interpreted confessed, <q>that such a letter he had written by his
Majesties own knowledge. But perceiving the King to wax angry he fell on his
knees and intreated mercy</q>, <q>seeing that which he had done was out of a good
minde, and desire to purchase the Popes favour, which might at the time have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
his title to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The King then putting him in minde of the challenge made by the late Queen in
the year 1599, for writing the same letter, and how being at that time questioned
thereupon, he had not onely denyed his own knowledge thereof, but likewise mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Sir <hi>Edward Drummond,</hi> who carried the letter to the Pope to come into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and abjure the same; he answered, <q>That he did not think the matter would
be brought again in hearing, and that fearing his Majesties offence, he had deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the letter, and had moved his Cousin Sir <hi>Edward</hi> to do the like; but now that
he saw, that which he had done in the politick course turned to the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
with many tears he besought his Majesty to pardon his fault, and not to
undo him who was own creature, and willing to suffer what he thought meet
for repairing the offence. The King replying that the fault was greater then he
apprehended, and that it could not be so easily passed, enjoyned him to go to
<hi>London,</hi> and keep his chamber till he returned thither.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After some eight days the King returned to <hi>White Hall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Secretary charged with the fault before the Councell.</note> where the Secretary was
brought before the Councell, and charged with the fault; which the Lords did
aggravate in such manner, as they made the same to be the ground of all the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
devised against the King since his coming into <hi>England,</hi> especially of the
<hi>Powder Treason. For the Papists,</hi> said they, <hi>finding themselves disappointed of the hopes
which that letter did give them, had taken the desperate course which they followed, to the
endangering of his Majesties person, posterity, and whole estates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Secretary having heard their discourses,<note place="margin">His answer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Lords of the Councell.</note> kneeled to the ground, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a deep sigh, spake to this effect. <hi>Curas leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent,</hi> 
                  <q>My
Lords, I cannot speak nor finde words to express the grief I have conceived for
the offence committed by me against my gracious Soveraign; for on the one
side, when I call to minde his Majesties favors bestowed upon me, having raised
me out of the dust, to a fortune, (farre exceeding my merit) and on the other
side, I look to my foul fault in abusing his Majesties trust, bringing thereby such
an imputation upon his innocency as will hardly be taken away, but with the
forlorn childe to say, <hi>Pecavi in coelum &amp; terram:</hi> my offence is great, I confess,
nor am I worthy to be reckoned any longer among his Majesties subjects, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
his Majesties rare piety, singular wisdome, and unspotted sincerity in all
his actions, whereof I had so long experience, might have taught me, that when
he refused to have any dealing with the Pope, the event of the course I took,
could not be good; but I unhappy man would needs follow the way which to
me seemed best, and whereof I finde now the smart. If no other thing can libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
his Majesty of this imputation, caused by my folly, let neither my life, nor
estate, nor credit be spared, but as I have all by his Majesties favour, so let all go
even to the last drop of my blood before any reproach for my offence be brought
upon his Majesty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then rising up he said, <q>It shall not be necessary to remit my tryall to <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which I hear your Honours do intend, for I do simply submit my self to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
will, and had much rather not live then lye any longer under his Majesties
displeasure. Therefore my humble suit to your honours is, that in consideration of
my miserable estate, and ignominious confession you would be pleased to move
his Majesty for accepting me in will, and that without delay whatsoever may be
done for reparation of his honour, may be performed, whereunto most willingly
I submit my self.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:50008:267"/>
The Chancellor Sir <hi>Thomas Egerton</hi> without taking any notice of these last
words declared, that his Majesties pleasure was to remit the tryall of his offence to
the Judges in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chancellor <hi>Egerton,</hi> pronounceth sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. <hi>Sprot</hi> his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> and that he should be conveyed thither as a Prisoner, the
Sheriffes attending him from shire to shire, till he was delivered in <hi>Scotland;</hi> in the
mean time he did pronounce him deprived of all places, honours dignities, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing else that he possessed in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether or not, I should mention the arraignment and execution of <hi>George Sprot</hi>
notary in <hi>Eymouth,</hi> who suffered at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the <hi>August</hi> preceding, I am
doubtfull his confession though voluntary, and constant, carrying small probability.
This man had deponed, <q>that he knew <hi>Robert Logan</hi> of <hi>Restalrig,</hi> who was dead
two years before, to have been privy to <hi>Gowries</hi> conspiracy, and that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
so much by a letter that fell in his hand written by <hi>Restalrig</hi> to <hi>Gowry,</hi> bearing
that he would take part with him in the revenge of his fathers death, and that his
best course should be to bring the King by sea to <hi>Fascastle,</hi> where he might be
safely kept, till advertisement came from those with whom the Earl kept intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
It seemed a very fiction and to be a meer invention of the mans own brain;
for neither did he shew the letter, nor could any wise man think, that <hi>Gowry,</hi> who
went about that treason so secretly, would have communicated the matter with
such a man, as this <hi>Restalrig</hi> was known to be: as ever it was, the man remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in his confession, and at his dying when he was to be cast off the ladder (for he
was hanged in the publick street of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) promised to give the beholders a sign
for confirming them in the truth of what he had spoken, which also he performed
by clapping his hands three severall times, after he was cast off by the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner.</q>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>The King having read both the one and other said,</hi> That
the difference between the lawfull and unlawfull meetings might be perceived by the fruits
arising from both, for as that unlawful conventicle at <hi>Aberdene</hi> had caused a
schisme in the Church, and given the enemies of Religion a great advantage, so in this
Assembly they had not onely joyned in love among themselves, wich is the main point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but also had taken a solid course for the repressing of Popery, and superstition: that
he did allow all their Petitions, and would give order for a Convention which should rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the conclusions of the Assembly; assuring them, that the Church keeping that course, should
never lack his Patrociny and Protection.</p>
               <p>Letters were immediately directed to publish his Majesties acceptation of the
Assemblies proceedings,<note place="margin">A convention at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

the Earl of <hi>Arroll</hi> in <hi>Dumbritton.</hi> A convention was likewise indicted at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
the sixth of <hi>December,</hi> which was afterward prorogued to the 27 of <hi>Ianuary;</hi> The
Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was in the mean time sent home to inform the Councell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Balmerinoch</hi> his business, and how these matters had been carried in
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>

                  </note> as suspecting the next assault should have been made upon him
self. But the King who knew his disposition, and expected that the Chancellor
would carry himself more advisedly, especially in the matters of the Church, the
Secretary being gone, did hast the Earl of <hi>Dunbar</hi> home with a warrant to receive
the Chancellor in the number of the Counsellors of <hi>England,</hi> and therewith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him Commissioner with <hi>Dunbar</hi> in the Convention of Estates; all which
was done to make it seem, that his credit was no way diminished with his
Majesty.</p>
               <p>In this convention divers Acts were made in favours of the Church,<note place="margin">Acts made for Religion.</note> 
                  <q>As
first that Noblemen sending their sons forth of the Countrey should direct them
to places where the reformed Religion was professed, at least where the same was
not restrained by the Inquisition, and that the Pedagogues sent to attend them,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:50008:268"/>
should be chosen by the Bishop of the Dioces, wherin if they should happen to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
the Nobleman being an Earl should incur the pain of four thousand pounds;
if he was a Lord, five thousand Marks; and if a Baron, three thousand Marks.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And if their sons should happen to decline from the true Religion, that their
Parents should withdraw all entertainment from them, and finde surety to that
effect.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Bishop of the Dioces should give up to the Treasurer, Controller,
Collector and their deputies, the names of all persons excommunicated for
Religion, to the end they might be known; and that no confirmations, resignations,
nor infestiments should be granted to any contained in that Roll.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Director of the Chancery should give forth no briefes, directories,
precepts of returns, nor precept upon comprisement, till they produced the Bishops
Testificate of their absolution, and obedience; and that it should be lawfull to
Superiours, and Lords of Regalities to refuse the entry of all such to their lands by
precepts of <hi>Clarè constat,</hi> or any other way.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Lastly, that persons excommunicated for not conforming themselves to the
Religion presently professed, should neither in their own names, nor covertly in
name of any other enjoy their lands, or rents, but that the same should be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metted
with and uplifted to his Majesties use.</q>
               </p>

which was grown as then too common, his Majesty by a speciall letter did recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

widow, woman or maid should be forced, and abused against her will, the crime
should be capital, and not purged by the subsequent consent of the woman.</q>

                  <q>In like manner if any woman should be taken away, albeit no further injury
was done, and she relieved, either by her friends or by the Magistrate, or by what so
ever means, the onely violence intended should be punished by death in regard
the party had indevoured to do his worst.</q>

                  </note> A great gazing there was of people,
which troubled him not a little as he shewed by his countenance. The next day
he was delivered to the Lord <hi>Scone,</hi> who with a guard of horse did convey him to the

               <p>His indictment was to this effect,<note place="margin">His indictment</note> 
                  <q>That in the year 1598 by the instigation of
his Cousin Sir <hi>Edward Drummond</hi> a professed Papist he had stoln and surreptiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
purchased his Majesties hand to a letter written by the said Sir <hi>Edward,</hi>
and directed to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth in favour of the Bishop of <hi>Vaison</hi> for the
said Bishops preferment to the dignity of a Cardinall. And that notwithstanding
the many denialls the King gave him in that busines he had treasonably conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the said Sir <hi>Edward</hi> to deceive and abuse his Majesty, shuffling in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
among others that were to be signed, and filling it up after it was signed, with
the styles and titles usually given to the Pope, and sealed the letter with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
fignet, the keeping whereof was intrusted to him by virtue of his office, and
in so doing had mostundutifully and treasonably behaved himself, to the indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his Majesties Honour, Life, Crown, and Estate, and to the subversion of
true Religion, and the whole professors thereof.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon the reading of the indictment he was enquired if he would use any
friends or advocates to speak in his defence, as the order of the Court did allow
him: his answer was,</hi> That he stood never in so great need of a Proloquutor, the matter
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:50008:268"/>
concerning his life, estate and all that he possessed in this world; yet he had choosed to keep
silence, and not employ either friends or advocates, the offence he had committed being such
as could admit no defence;<note place="margin">The Secretary his speech and answer to the indictment.</note> for howsoever he conceived that the keeping of intelligence
with the Pope, might advance his Majesties succession to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he did his Majesties resolution never to use any crooked course, but to rest upon Gods
providence and his own right, it did not become him to have medled in a matter of that
importance. Therefore did he intreat all gentlemen and others that were present to bear
witness of his confession, and the true remorse he had for the offence committed, which he
esteemed so great, as neither his lands, nor life, may not twenty thousand lives such as his
could repair:<note place="margin">His protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two things.</note> onely two things he asked liberty to protest; one was that he never intended
to work an alteration of Religion, or a toleration of the contrary, the thing he had done
being a meer worldly course, whereby he judged some good might have been wrought at the
time. Next he protested that neither the love of gain, nor hope of commodity had led him on,
that having never received nor expected benefit from any Prince living (his Master the
King onely excepted) but an opinion he foolishly conceited that he might that way promote
his Masters right. <hi>In end he said,</hi> that he would not make the Iudges any more business,
that he had confessed the truth, and as he wished God to be mercifull to his soul in that great
day, his Majesty was most falsely and wrongfully charged with the writing of that letter to
the Pope, and that he never could move him to consent thereto.</p>

affixing of his Majesties signet to the said letter; and of assisting known and
professed Papists in their treasonable courses to the danger of Religion, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the true professors thereof, and drawing of his Majesties life, estate and
right of succession to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in most extreme perill; besides the

               </p>
               <p>The King being advertised of his conviction (for he had commanded before any

                  <note place="margin">The doom pronounced against <hi>Balme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinoch.</hi>

of the foresaid treasonable crimes. His life upon the Queens intercession was spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and he returned to his prison in <hi>Falkland,</hi> where he abode some moneths, being
thereafter licensed to go unto his house in <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> he dyed as was thought of
grief and sorrow. A man of abilities sufficient for the places he injoyed in Session
and Councell; but one that made small conscience of his doings, and measured
all things according to the gain he made by them: The possessions he acquired of the
Church kept him still an enemy unto it, for he feared a restitution should be made
of those livings, if ever the Clergy did attain unto credit. Not long before he fell in
his trouble the King had imployed him to deal with the Lords of Session, among
whom he carried a great sway, for restoring the Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction to the
Bishops; but he taking ways that he thought should not have been perceived, to
disappoint the errand, drew upon himself the Kings displeasure, and fared nothing
the better because of his miscarriage in that business, when this occasion was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It is not for those that serve Princes, and are trusted by them in the greatest affairs,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:50008:269"/>
to deal deceitfully with their Masters, for seldome have any taken that course
and have not in the end found the smart thereof.</p>
               <p>A Parliament was this year kept at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 24 of <hi>Iune,</hi>

the Justices of peace commanded to be setled in every shire, and a Statute made for
the <hi>Apparell of Iudges, Magistrates,</hi> and <hi>Churchmen,</hi> which were all remitted to his

given to every one whom the Statutes concerned, to provide themselves of

the Kings care to have those who were in publick charge held in due respect, and
dignosced whither soever they came.</p>
               <p>The King by his Letters was now daily urging the Bishops to take upon them
the administration of all Church affairs;<note place="margin">An. 1610.</note> and they unwilling to make any change
without the knowledge and approbation of the Ministers,<note place="margin">An Assembly at <hi>Glasgow.</hi>
                  </note> an assembly to this
effect was appointed to hold at <hi>Glasgow</hi> the 6 of <hi>Iune.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> Sir
<hi>Iohn Preston</hi> President of the Session, and Sir <hi>Alexander Hay</hi> Secretary (which two
had succeeded to <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> his places being Commissioners for the King) the
Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was elected to preside. There a Proposition was made by
the Commissioners of certain <hi>point of Discipline,</hi> which his Majesty craved to be
determined, <hi>That all things might be done thereafter orderly in the Church, and with
that consent and harmony which was fitting among preachers.</hi> Some three daies being
spent in reasoning, at last the conclusions following were enacted.</p>
               <p>1 The Assembly did acknowledge the indiction of all such generall Assemblies
of the Church to belong to his Majesty by the prerogative of his Crown, and all
convocations in that kind without his licence to be meerly unlawfull, condemning
the conventicle of <hi>Aberdene</hi> made in the year 1605, as having no warrant from his
Majesty and contrary to the prohibition he had given.</p>
               <p>2 That Synods should be kept in every Dioces twice in the year, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Aprill,</hi>
and <hi>October,</hi> and be moderated by the Archbishop or Bishop of the Dioces, or where
the Dioceses are so large, as all the Ministers cannot conveniently assemble at one
place, that there be one or moe had, and in the Bishops absence, the place of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
supplied by the most worthy Minister having charge in the bounds, such as the
Archbishop or Bishop shall appoint.</p>
               <p>3 That no sentence of excommunication, or absolution from the same be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against or in favour of any person, without the knowledge and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Bishop of the Dioces, who must be answerable unto God and his Majesty,
for the formall and unpartiall proceeding thereof. And the process being found
formall, that the sentence be pronounced at the Bishops direction by the Minister
of the Parish where the offender hath his dwelling, and the process did first
begin.</p>
               <p>4 That all presentations in time coming be directed to the Archbishop or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of the Dioces, within which the Benefice that is void lieth with power, to the
Archbishop or Bishop to dispone or conferre the Benefices that are void within the
Dioces after the lapse, <hi>Iure devoluto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 That in the deposition of Ministers upon any occasion the Bishop do associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to himself some of the Ministers within the bounds where the delinquent serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and after just triall of the fact, and merit of it pronounce the sentence of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
The like order to be observed in the suspension of Ministers from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their function.</p>
               <p>6 That every Minister at his admission swear obedience to his Majesty and to his
Ordinary according to the form agreed upon <hi>Anno</hi> 1571.</p>
               <p>7 The visitations of the Dioces be made by the Bishop himself, and if the bounds
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:50008:269"/>
be greater then he can well undertake, by such a worthy man of the Minsterie
within the Diocese as he shall choose to visit in his place. And whatsoever Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
without just cause or lawfull excuse shall absent himself from the visitation
or Diocesan assembly, be suspended from his Office and Benefice; and if he doe
not amend, deprived.</p>
               <p>8 That the convention of Ministers for exercise be moderated by the Bishop
being present, and in his absence by any Minister that he shall nominate in his Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</p>
               <p>9 And last it was ordained, that no Minister should speak against any of the
foresaid conclusions in publick, nor dispute the question of equality or inequality
of Ministery, as tending only to the intertainment of Schisme in the Church,
and violation of the peace thereof.</p>
               <p>These conclusions taken it was complained in behalf of the Moderators of
Presbyteries, who had served since the yeare 1606. <hi>That notwithstanding of their
promise made at their accepting of the Charge, they had received no payment at all of the
stipend allowed:</hi> Which the Earl of <hi>Dunbarre</hi> excused by his absence forth of the
Countrey, affirming, <hi>That unto that time there was never any motion made thereof to
him, and that before the dissolving of that Assembly he should cause satisfaction to be given
to them for the time past;</hi> declaring withall, <hi>That seeing order was taken for the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Presbyteries in time coming, his Majesties Thesaurer should not be any further
burthened with that paiment.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors paid of the stipend promised.</note> The Ministers therein <unclear>remiting</unclear> themselves to his
Majesties good pleasure gave his Lordship thanks for that he had offered; which
he did also see performed, som five thousand pounds <hi>Scots</hi> being distributed by
the Thesaurers servants among those that had borne the charge; certain of the
discontented sort did interpret it to be a sort of corruption, giving out, <hi>That this was
done for obtaining the Ministers voices;</hi> Howbeit the debt was known to be just,
and that no motion was made of that business before the foresaid conclusions
were enacted.</p>
               <p>In the Assembly a Supplication was presented in the names of the Marquiss of
<hi>Huntly</hi> and the two Earls of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arroll</hi> for their absolution,<note place="margin">A supplication in name of the Popish Lords.</note> and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
given to that effect, upon their satisfaction, they subscriving the confession
of faith and swearing to continue in the profession of the Religion presently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished.
The Marquiss of <hi>Huntly</hi> was at that time confined in <hi>Styiveling,</hi> and
to him were the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Cathnes</hi> and <hi>Orkney</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
They found him not unwilling to subscrive the confession of Faith and
make satisfaction for his Apostasie, but in regard of his many relapses did not
judge it fitting to absolve him; wheresore they gave order that he should conferre
with Mr. <hi>Patrick Sympson</hi> the Minister of the Town, a learned and moderate man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Huntly</hi> freed of his confining.</note>
that so he might subscrive with knowledge and resolution not to fall back. In
the <hi>December</hi> following, having professed himself resolute in all points, he was
liberated from his confinement at <hi>Striveling,</hi> and licensed to goe home to
<hi>Strathbogy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the Earl of <hi>Arroll</hi> the difficulty was greater;<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Arroll</hi> troubled for his simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> for when in a publick
meeting of the Councell within the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he had professed his
conformity in every point of Religion and made offer to subscrive, the very night
after he fell in such a trouble of minde, as he went near to have killed himself.
Early in the morning the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> being called, he confessed his
disinclination with many tears, and beseeching them that were present to bear
witness of his remorse, was hardly brought to any setling all that day. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
was of a tender heart, and of all that I have known that most conscientious
in his prosession, and thereupon to his dying was used by the Church with greater
lenity then were others of that sect.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> who lived confined at <hi>Glasgow</hi> took another course,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> goeth to Paris.</note> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
license obtained from his Majesty, went to <hi>France,</hi> where he might enjoy the

some years after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="514" facs="tcp:50008:270"/>
Shortly after the Assembly dissolved, the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was called to
Court,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> called to Court.</note> and commanded to bring with him two others such as he thought fit. The
Archbishop taking with him the Bishops of <hi>Brichen</hi> and <hi>Galloway</hi> came to Court
in the midst of <hi>September.</hi> At their first audience the King declared what the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
was for which he had called them, speaking to this purpose, <hi>That he had to
his great charge recovered the Bishopricks forth of the hands of those that possessed them,
and bestowed the same upon such as he hoped should prove worthy of their places; but since
he could not make them Bishops, nor could they assume that honour to themselves, and that
in</hi> Scotland <hi>there was not a sufficient number to enter charge by consecration, he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them to</hi> England,<note place="margin">The business proponed by his Majesty.</note> 
                  <hi>that being consecrated themselves they might at their return give
Ordination to those at home, and so the adversaries mouths be stopped, who said that he did
take upon him to create Bishops, and bestow spirituall offices, which he never did nor
would he presume to doe, acknowledging that authority to belong to</hi> Christ <hi>alone, and those
he had authorized with his power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Archbishop answering in the name of the rest, <q>That they were willing
to obey his Majesties desire,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> and only feared that the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> because
of old usurpations, might take this for a sort of subjection to the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>The King said, <hi>That he had provided sufficiently against that, for
neither should the Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>nor</hi> York, <hi>who were the only pretenders,
have hand in the business, but Consecration should be used by the Bishops of</hi> London, Ely,
<hi>and</hi> Bathe. The <hi>Scots</hi> Bishops thanking his Majesty for the care he had of their
Church, and professing their willingness to obey what he would command, the 21
of <hi>October</hi> was appointed to be the time, and the Chappell of <hi>London</hi> house
the place of Consecration.</p>
               <p>A question in the mean time was moved by Dr. <hi>Andrewes</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the consecration of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops,<note place="margin">The consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</note> who, as he said, <q>must first be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Dr. <hi>Bancroft</hi> who was by, maintained <q>That thereof
there was no necessity, seeing where Bishops could not be had, the Ordination gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the Presbyters must be esteemed lawfull; otherwise that it might be
doubted, if there were any lawfull vocation in most of the reformed Churches.</q>
This applauded to by the other Bishops, <hi>Ely</hi> acquiesced, and at the day, and in
the place appointed the three <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops were consecrated.</p>
               <p>At the same time did the King institute a <hi>High Commission</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> for the

such persons, and none permitted but those that received Orders to preach

and at the same time was the <hi>High Commission</hi> published, to the great discontent
of those that ruled the estate; for that they took it to be a restraint of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in matters ecclesiasticall, nor did they like to see Clergy men invested with
such authority.</p>
               <p>The King no less carefull to have all things ordered rightly in the Estate, did
prescrive the number,<note place="margin">Orders for the Councell.</note> attendants, and manner of proceeding which the Councell
should keep in their meetings. As <q>that the number should not exceed thirty

and seaven at least be present in every meeting:<note place="margin">An. 1611.</note> that at their admission they
should take the Oath of allegiance and swear fidelity and secrecy in matters
to be communicated unto them. That they should convene twice in the week;
once every <hi>Tuesday</hi> for matters of State, and once on the <hi>Thursday</hi> for actions.
That none should be permitted to stay with in the Councell house, but the Lords
and Clerks of the Councell, nor any solicitations be made within the house,
but that all should take their places at their coming in, and none stand on foot,
unless they be to answer for themselves, and in that case to rise and stand at the
head of the table. That four dayes absence of any Counsellor in the time of
sitting without license from the rest, should inferre the loss of their place. That
if any of the number were denounced Rebell, or did not at least once in the year
communicate, they should be likewise excluded. That wheresoever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
or happened to come, if they should be informed of any trouble like
to arise betwixt parties, they should charge them to keep the peace, and if they
refused, they should command them to enter in Ward, the disobedience
whereof should be punished as if the whole Councell were disobeyed. Lastly,
to keep their persons and places in the greater respect, they were commanded in
the streets either to ride with foot clothes or in coaches, but not be seen walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on foot.</q>

justice; wherein if they should fail, and yet be perceived to carry a grudge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him by whom they were injured, they should be called before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and if they refused to reconcile, be punished as despisers of the royall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

               <p>In the Isles of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Yetland</hi> at this time were great oppressions by the
Earl thereof,<note place="margin">The troubles of <hi>Orkney.</hi>
                  </note> for which he was committed in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the
Bishop of <hi>Orkney</hi> imployed by the Councell to examine the particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.
This Nobleman having undone his estate by riot and prodigality did seek
by unlawfull shifts to repair the same, making Acts in his Courts and exacting
penalties for the breach thereof,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and his Acts of Court discharged.</note> as if any man was tried to have concealed any
thing that might inferre a pecuniary mulct, and bring profit to the Earl, his lands
and goods were declared confiscated; or if any person did sue for justice before
any other Judge, then his deputies his goods were escheated, or if they went
forth of the Isle without his license, or his deputies, upon whatsoever occasion,
they should forfeit their moveables; and, which of all his acts was most inhumane,
he had ordained that <hi>if any man was tried to supply or give relief unto ships or any
vessels distressed by tempest, the same should be punished in his person, and fined at the Earl
his pleasure.</hi> These Acts produced by the Complainers, and confessed by the Earl
himself, were by the Councell decerned unlawfull, and the execution thereof in all
times thereafter prohibited.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Clangregore</hi> a barbarous and theevish race of people, that could by no

to be rooted forth, and the service committed to the Earl of <hi>Argile;</hi> who
made some beginning, and presented certain of the principalls to justice; but the
neglect of their children, and their exhibition as was appointed, made them in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times no less troublesome to the Countrey then before.</p>
               <p>In the end of the year the Earl of <hi>Dunbarre</hi> departed his life at <hi>whitehall,</hi> a man
of deep wit,<note place="margin">The deuh of the Earl of <hi>Dunbarre.</hi>
                  </note> few words, and in his Majesties service no less faithfull then fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
The most difficile affaires he compassed without any noise, and never return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when he was employed, without the work performed that he was sent to doe.
His death made a great change in our Estate. Sir <hi>Robert Ker</hi> a son of <hi>Farnherst,</hi>
who had served the King long in the quality of a Page, and was then grown
powerfull in Court, carrying all things by his credit.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Somerset</hi> his rising.</note> At first the Thesaurers
Office which was in the person of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> whilest he lived, was trusted to certain
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:50008:271"/>
Commissioners, but after a little space the same was bestowed upon the said Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
and he preferred to be Earl of <hi>Somerset.</hi> The guard that Sir <hi>William Cranston</hi> a
Gentleman of great worth did command, and wherewith he had performed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
notable services in the Borders, was taken from him, and given to Sir <hi>Robert
Ker</hi> of <hi>Ancram Somersets</hi> cousin.<note place="margin">Advocate made first Clerk Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</note> Sir <hi>Gedeon Murray</hi> his Uncle by the Mother
made Deputy in the Office of Thesaury; and Sir <hi>Thomas Hamilton</hi> his Majesties
Advocate who had married his sister, placed first in the office of Register, and
afterwards made Secretary, all which was ascribed to <hi>Somerset</hi> his credit. Yet
these things were not ill taken, the last excepted, for Sir <hi>William Cranston</hi> being
content to resigne his place, the King in remembrance of his good service did
preferre him to be a Lord of Parliament: Sir <hi>Gedeon</hi> his abilities for the services
he was trusted with, were known to all; and for the Advocate, his sufficiency was
undoubted, only the manner of his coming to be Register was not so well inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted.
Sir <hi>Iohn Skeen</hi> had enjoyed the place a good many years, and being
grown in age and infirme, thinking to get his son provided to his office, had sent
him to Court with a dimission of the place, but with a charge not to use it, unless
he found the King willing to admit him; yet he abused by some politick wits, made
a resignation of the Office, accepting an ordinary place among the Lords of Session.
The office upon his resignation was presently disponed to the Advocate: which
grieved the Father beyond all measure. And the case indeed was pitifull, and
much regrated by all honest men, for he had been a man much employed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with divers legations, which he discharged with good credit, and now in
age to be circumvented in this sort, by the simplicity or folly of his son, 'twas held
lamentable.<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Skeen</hi> dyeth of grief.</note> The King being informed of the abuse by the old mans complaint,
was very carefull to satisfie him and to have the son reconciled to his father, which
after some travell was brought to passe: yet so exceeding was the old mans dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
as within a few daies he deceased. The office of Register was shortly after
enterchanged with the Secretary Sir <hi>Alexander Hay,</hi> and he made keeper of the
Rolls, the Lord <hi>Binning</hi> Secretary, and Sir <hi>William Oliphant</hi> received to be his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Advocate.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the next year there happened diverse unhappy quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi> at Court,<note place="margin">An. 1612</note> which was like to have produced very bad
effects:<note place="margin">The Lord Samqhar exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in <hi>England</hi>
                  </note> and nothing worse taken then the slaughter of an <hi>English</hi> Fencer, by the
Lord <hi>Sanqhars</hi> instigation, who for an injury alledged, did hire one called <hi>Carleill</hi>
to kill the Fencer: this fact committed in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and so near to the
Kings Court, caused such a heart-burning among the people, as it was not farre from
breaking forth into a generall commotion. But his Majesty preventing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
made <hi>Sanqhar</hi> to be arrested, and brought to his triall, where being convicted
he was hanged publickly at the Palace-gate of <hi>Westminster.</hi> This act of justice
gave the <hi>English</hi> a great content, nor was the death of the Nobleman much regra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his own Countrey people, for he had lived all his time dissolutely and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in familiarity with a base Curtesan at <hi>Paris,</hi> had by her a son, to whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
his lands, intending to defraud the heir. But the King taking the matter
into his own cognition, did by compromise adjudge the succession to the just inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritour,
appointing a little portion to the base son, who in a short time made away
the same prodigally.</p>
               <p>Not long before his Majesty being informed of a course kept by the Church in
excommunicating persons that were fugitives for capitall crimes, sent to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Clergy a Letter of this tenor:</p>
               <p>The Ecclesiasticall Censure of Excommunication, which should be inflicted upon such as
having committed any scandalous offence, are contemners of the admonitions of the Church,<note place="margin">Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall cases if they become fugitive.</note>
is, as we have been enformed, so farre absued against the first institution, that we cannot
sufficiently mervail of the proceeding said to be commonly used among you; namely, that
persons fugitive for capitall crimes being cited before Ecclesiastical Iudicatories, although
it be known that they dare not compeir for fear of their life, are sentenced as persons contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious,
whereas the fear they stand in ought in reason to excuse their absence, since
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:50008:272"/>
they cannot be judged contemners of the Church, who upon just terrors are kept back from
giving their personall appearance. In a late Treatise the Venetian <hi>Padre Paulo</hi> did
learnedly confute the sentence pronounced by the present Pope against him for his not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to answer in the cause of heresie, only upon the just fear be pretended, and had his
appeal justified by all indifferent men, from the Popes sentence as abusive; your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for the manner is no other, and by the learnedst Divines in these parts resembled to
the <hi>Moscovites</hi> form, who if he be offended with any person, commandeth him to send his
head unto him: just so your citations are in the foresaid case, which is to will the offenders
come in and be hanged, which were they never so penitent is not to be thought they will doe;
for they will rather fall under your censure then hazard themselves in the hands of the
justice. This being the ready way to bring the Censures of the Church in contempt, Our
pleasure is, that hereafter there be no such form of proceeding used among you. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
if it shall happen such offenders to obtain our pardon, and that the fear they stand
in of their life be removed, we mean not but that they should be called before the Church,
and Censures used against such of those that are impenitent. Hereof perswading our
selves that you will have care and not give way to the abuse in time coming, We bid you
farewell.</p>
               <p>Upon the receipt of this Letter,<note place="margin">The Clergy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to reform this point.</note> the Bishops convening with certain of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
to advise what course was fittest to be held in these cases, a long reasoning was
kept, some maintaining, <q>That the form practised by the Church was not to be
changed, they having tried the good thereof, and that people were terrified by
this means from falling into these odious crimes. Others reasoned, That the
principall end of all Church censures, especially of Excommunication, was the
reclaiming of offenders, and the bringing of them to the acknowledgment of
their sin, and that where the principall use had no place, that other secondary ends
ought not to be respected; and so in case of Fugitives, what could any Censure
avail to their reclaiming, they not being in place to answer, or to receive any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition?
yea and might it not fall that by proceeding against men in such case,
men truly sorrowfull for their sin should be sentenced, and so the persons bound
by the Church, whom God hath loosed; They did therefore judge it more safe
in these cases to advertise people of the hainousness of the fact committed, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to make their own profit thereof, and to forbear all proceeding against
the fugitive person till his condition should be made known.</q> This turned to be
the resolution of the whole number, and thereupon direction was given to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
not to intend or follow any processe against fugitives in time coming.</p>
               <p>This year the Earl of <hi>Eglington</hi> departed this life,<note place="margin">The death of the earl of <hi>Eglington,</hi> and the disposition of his living to his Cousin.</note> who having no childe nor heir
male to succeed, made a disposition of his lands and honours to Sir <hi>Alexander
Seaton</hi> his Cousin germane, with a proviso, <hi>That he and his children should take the
name and use the arms of the house of Montgomery.</hi> The king, who was alwaies most
tender in the conveyance of honours, being informed of the disposition made by
the deceased Earl, did by a Letter written to the Councell witness his displeasure
at such alienations; shewing that howsoever he could not stay Noblemen to dispose
of their lands, he being the fountain of all honour within his Kingdoms, would not
permit the same to be sold or alienated without his consent: and thereupon did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
the said Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> to use the title of Lord or Earl, notwithstanding the
disposition made to him. Some two years after his Majesty was pleased to bestow
the honour upon him, and so was he received into the place and honour formerly
belonging to the house of <hi>Eglington.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the month of <hi>october</hi> a Parliament was kept at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Parliament in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> the Chancellor
being Commissioner for the King, wherein the conclusions taken in the Assembly
at <hi>Glasgow</hi> were ratified, and all Acts and constitutions, especially the Act made in
the Parliament 1592, rescinded and annulled, in so farre, as they, or any of them, or
any part of the same were derogatory to the Articles there concluded.</p>
               <p>In this Parliament a subsidy was urged,<note place="margin">A subsidy granted.</note> and a great contest made for the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
which was required in a more large measure then in former times, because of
his Majesties affairs, especially for the marriage of Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with the Pals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,
who in the same moneth arrived in <hi>England.</hi> The poverty of the Countrey,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:50008:272"/>
with a fear that what was then granted, should be made a Precedent for after times,
was pretended by those that withstood the motion, albeit the true cause was known
to be the dislike that the Popish faction had of the Match, which by all means they
laboured to crosse: nor was any more busie then the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> to impede the
subsidy, he being a little before come from Court, did affirm that the King in a
private speech with him touching the same, had said, That he required no more
then was granted in the Parliament 1606, and thereby made the opposition greater
then otherwise it would have been; yet in the end after long debating it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the supply should be more liberall in regard of the present occasion,
then at any time before.</p>
               <p>The King upon advertisement of the Lord <hi>Burleighs</hi> business gave order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
him from the Councel, and to inhibit him from coming any more at Court:<note place="margin">The L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                     <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> removed from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note>
which he apprehending to be the Lord <hi>Scones</hi> doing, and that he had informed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, took so ill, as he did send him a challenge, and appeal him to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.
Hereupon he was committed in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he remained
some two moneths; thereafter upon the acknowledgment of his offence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reconciled with the Lord <hi>Scone,</hi> he was put to liberty.</p>
               <p>In Court at this time was great rejoicing, and the marriage of the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
with Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> daily expected,<note place="margin">An. 1613.</note> when on the suddain all was turned to

greatly lamented both at home and abroad. The Councell esteeming it their duty
to express their doleance for that accident, made choice of the Chancellor and the
Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> for that business. But the King having received an hard
information of the Chancellors carriage in the late Parliament, sent his servant
<hi>William Shaw</hi> to discharge him from coming to Court, who encountring him at
<hi>Morpet,</hi> caused him to return. The Archbishop who was no further advanced

               <p>It was shewed before concerning the oppressions of the people of <hi>Orkney,</hi> that
the Acts made by the Earl in his Courts were judged unlawfull, and he discharged
to put the same thereafter in execution. Notthelesse going on in his wonted
course, he sent his base son called <hi>Robert</hi> into the Countrey, in shew to uplift his
rents and duties, but in effect to trie and punish the transgressours of these Acts:
whereupon new complaints being preferred to the Councell, the King was advised
to make purchase of Sir <hi>Iohn Arnots</hi> right to whom the Earl had impignorated
his estate, as being the only means to relieve that distressed people from his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;
the bargain shortly was made, and the King possessed in the lands, Sir
<hi>Iames Stewart</hi> Captain <hi>Iames</hi> his sonne being made Chamberlain and the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe
of the Countrey. The Earl himself was transported from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to
the Castle of <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> and had allowed to him six shillings eight pence ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a day for his entertainment, where he had not long remained, when as he
received advertisement, that the Castles of <hi>Kirkwall, Birsay,</hi> and other his Houses
in these Isles were all rendered to the Sheriffe. This put him in a great passion, and
many waies he essayed to make an escape, but finding no possibility he sent his base
son who was lately returned, with an expresse command to take back the houses
and expulse the Deputy Mr. <hi>Iohn Finlason,</hi> whom the Chamberlain had left there.</p>
               <p>The young man at his coming to <hi>Orkney</hi> being assisted with some loose people
made his first assault upon <hi>Birsay,</hi> expulsing <hi>Bernard Stewart</hi> The Keeper,<note place="margin">Rebellion in <hi>Orkney.</hi>
                  </note> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a Garrison therein of some thirty persons. The Deputy hearing what was
done, went speedily thither, charging them in his Majesties name to render; but
they despising the charge, and he not able to force them, he went from thence to
<hi>Kirkwall;</hi> the Rebels following at his heels compelled him in like sort to render the
Castle of <hi>Kirkwall</hi> in which he had entred.</p>

people to the number of five hundred, who were brought together more out of
fear of the Rebels, then of any desire to withstand, made a countenance to resist,
but how soon they perceived the Earls resolution to pursue, they gave back, their
leaders flying to the Castle which they meant to defend. This they made good
some five weeks or more till the Canon having beaten down a great part of the
walls,<note place="margin">Persons exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for the Rebellion.</note> they were forced to yeild themselves at discretion. The persons taken in the

certain space, and returning unto the Court, by the mouth of their Chancellor (the

any thing that might work prejudice to others:</hi> nor could he be induced either by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
or threatning to detect the persons with whom he had resorted. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
offending at his obstinacy, and meaning to extort a confession from him,
advised to keep him some nights from sleep; and this indeed wrought somewhat
with him, so as he began to discover certain particulars, but how soon he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

These Questions were sent inclosed in a Letter to the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi>
who assuming to himself the Provost of the City, the Principall of the Colledge,
and one of the Ministers as Witnesses, did in their hearing read the Questions, and
receive his Answer, which he gave under his hand, as followeth:</p>
               <p>I acknowledge the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Iudge unto his Majesty,<note place="margin">His Answer to the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and
to have power over
him in spiritualibus, and over all Christian Kings. But where it is askt, whether that
power will reach over him in <hi>temporalibus?</hi> I am not obliged to declare my opinion
therein, except to him that is Iudge in Controversies of Religion, to wit, the Pope; or one
having authority from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the second point,</hi> I think that the Pope hath power to excommunicate the King:
and where it is said, that the King is not of the Popes Church; I answer, that all who are
baptized are under the Popes power.</p>
               <p>To the third where it is askt, if the Pope hath power to depose the King being
excommunicate? I say that <hi>I am not tied to declare my minde except to him that is
Iudge in controversies of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the fourth and fifth, I answer, <hi>ut supra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being reasoned with a long time,<note place="margin">His Answer sent to his Majesty.</note> and the danger exponed, wherein he did cast
himself, by maintaining such treasonable opinions, he answered, <hi>That he would not
change his minde for any danger that could befall him,</hi> and speaking of the <hi>Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance,</hi>
that it was a <hi>damnable Oath, and treason against God to swear it.</hi> Some daies
being allowed him to bethink himself better of these points. When as no advice
could prevail, and answers were sent to his Majesty subscribed by himself, and
therewith a testification of such as were present at the giving thereof.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Councell was commanded to passe a Commission to the Provost
and Bayliffs of <hi>Glasgow</hi> for putting him to a triall;<note place="margin">Commission for the Jesuits triall.</note> there were assisting Iames Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Hamilton, Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Lothian, William</hi> Lord <hi>Sanqhar, Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi>
and <hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Boyd.</hi> Some daies before he was brought to the Barre, it was
told him, <q>That he was not to be charged with saying of Masse, nor anything that
concerned his profession, but only with the Answers made to the Questions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned,
which if he should recall, there being yet place to repentance, the triall
should be suspended till his Majesty were of new advertised.</q> His reply was, <hi>That
he did so little minde to recall any thing he had spoken, as when he should be brought to his
answer he should put a bonnet on it.</hi> And this indeed he performed, for when he was
placed on pannell, and the Indictment read, which was grounded all upon the Acts
of Parliament made against those that declined his Majesties authority, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
any other Jurisdiction within the Realm, and upon answer made to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-written
demands, subscribed with his hand, he brake forth in these speeches:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Under protestation that I doe no way acknowledge this judgment,<note place="margin">The Jesuits defence at his indictment.</note> nor receive
you that are named in that Commission for my Judges, I deny any point laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me to be treason; for if it were treason, it would be such in all places, and
all Kingdomes, which you know not to be so. As to your Acts of Parliament,
they were made by a number of partiall men, and of matters not subject to their
<hi>forum</hi> or judicatory, for which I will not give a rotten figge. And where I am
said to be an enemy to the Kings authority, I know not what authority he hath
but what he received from his predecessors, who acknowledged the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>
his jurisdiction. If the King will be to me as his predecessors were to mine, I will
obey and acknowledge him for my King, but if he doe otherwise and play the
runnagate from God, as he and you all doe, I will not acknowledge him more
then this old hat.</q> At these words being interrupted, and commanded to speak
more reverently of his Majesty, he said, <q>That he should take the advertisement,
and not offend, but the judgment he would not acknowledge. And for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
I doe you, to stand uncovered; I let you know it is <hi>ad redemptionem
vexationis,</hi> not <hi>ad agnitionem Iudicii.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The persons cited upon the Jury being then called,<note place="margin">The exception proponed by the Jesuit.</note> and he desired to shew,<note place="margin">The exception proponed by the Jesuit.</note> if he
would except against them, said, <q>That he had but one exception against them all,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:50008:274"/>
which was, that either they were enemies to his cause, or friends: if enemies, they
could not sit upon his triall; and if friends, they ought to assist him at the Bar. Only
he should wish the Gentlemen to consider well what they did, and that he could not
be judged by them. That whatsoever he suffered was by way of injury and not of
judgement; and that he was accused of treason but had not committed any offence,
nor could he beg mercy. <hi>And proceeding in this strain,</hi> I am, <hi>said he,</hi> a subject as
free as the King is a King; I came by commandement of my Superior into this
kingdome, and if I were even now forth of it, I would return, neither do I repent
any thing but that I have not been so busie as I should, in that which you call
perverting of subjects. I am accused for declining the Kings authority, and will
do it still in matter of Religion, for with such matters he hath nothing to do: and
this which I say, the best of your Ministers do maintain, and if they be wise will
continue of the same mind: some questions were moved to me which I refused to
answer, because the proferers were not Judges in controversies of Religion, and
therefore I trust you cannot infer any thing against me.</q> 
                  <hi>But I hope,</hi> said the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
<hi>you will not make this a controversie of Religion, Whether the King b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing deposed by
the Pope may be lawfully killed?</hi> To this he replied, <q>It is a question among the Doctors
of the Church; many hold the affirmative not improbably; but as that point is
not yet determined; so if it shall be concluded, I will give my life in defence of it,
and to call it unlawfull, I will not, though I should save my life by saying it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His speeches,<note place="margin">The Jesuite convicted and executed.</note> the more liberty was given him, growing the more intolerable
the Jurors were willed to go apart; who quickly returning, declared by the mouth
of their Chancellor Sir <hi>George Elphingston,</hi> that they found him guilty of all the
treasonable crimes contained in the indictment. Whereupon doom was pronounced,
and the same day in the afternoon he was hanged in the publick street of <hi>Glasgow.</hi> He
was, as it seemed, well instructed in that <hi>Iesuitical</hi> doctrine of deposing &amp; dethroning
Kings, and like enough to have played another <hi>Ravilliack,</hi> if he had not been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted:
which was the rather believed, that in lamenting his mishap to one that he
esteemed his friend, he did say, <hi>That nothing grieved him so much, as that he should be
apprehended in that time; for if he had lived unto</hi> Whitsunday <hi>at liberty, he should
have done that which all the Bishops and Ministers of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> England <hi>should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have helped; and to have done it he would willingly have been drawn in peeces with
horses, and not cared what torments he had indured</hi> But this did not burst forth till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Iames Moffet,</hi> another of the same Society,<note place="margin">Moffet another jesuit licenced to depart.</note> being apprehended neer about
the same time, took a safer course; for having condemned <hi>Ogilvies</hi> positions he was
suffered to depart the Countrey the King professing, as he ever did, <hi>That he would
never hang a Priest for his Religion;</hi> only these Polypragmatick Papists, that were
set upon sedition and to move disturbance in Countreys, he could not away
with.</p>

He left behinde him in writing a declaration of his judgement touching mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

               <p>In the end of this year there was at Court a great business for trying the murther
of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The History of <hi>Somersets</hi> fall.</note> who had dyed in the Tower some two years before. The
occasion and secret contriving of the murther, with the strangeness of the discovery,
and his Majesties impartiall proceeding in the triall, deserve all to be remembred.
The occasion was, <hi>Overburies</hi> free and friendly counsells to the Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> for
diverting him from the marriage he intended with Lady <hi>Francis Howard,</hi> who by
a sentence of nullity was freed from the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> her husband:<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Tho: Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie</hi> his free advice to <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erset.</hi>

disswaded <hi>Somerset,</hi> presuming upon the familiarity that he vouchsafed him, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
that Ladies company, and one night more freely, for that he saw <hi>Somerset</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on in the Match, came unto him, and spake to this effect; <hi>My Lord I perceive
you are proceeding in this match which I have often disswaded as your true servant, and
friend, I now advise you not to marry that woman: for if you do, you shall ruine your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and your self;</hi> adding, <hi>that if he went on in that business, he should do well to look to
his standing.</hi> The Earl taking his free speech more impatiently because he had
touched the Lady (with whom he was bewitched) in her honour, replyed in passion,
<hi>that his legs were strong enough to bear him up, and that he should make him repent those
speeches.</hi> Thus he parted in anger at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Overbury</hi> interpreting this to be a sudden passion onely,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Overbury</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower.</note> and not thinking that
their long continuing friendship would break off by this occasion, continued in his
wonted attendance, neither did the Earl wholly abandon him; howbeit having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to the Lady <hi>Overbury</hi> his counsell and the words he had uttered to her
prejudice, she never ceased to inflame him against the Gentleman, and by all means
sought to practise his overthrow. It falling out that <hi>Overbury</hi> was about this time to
be employed in an Ambassage to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ussia,</hi> the Earl whose counsell he askt advised
him not to embrace the service, but to make some fair excuse. This advice he
followed, taking the same to proceed of kindness, and for his refuse was committed
to the Tower.</p>
               <p>The Lady now had him where she wished,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Overbury</hi> poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> and meaning to dispatch him by
poyson, wrought so with the Lieutenant Sir <hi>Iervis Elways</hi> as he did admit one
<hi>Richard Weston</hi> upon her recommendation to be <hi>Overburies</hi> keeper, by whom the
very evening after he was committed a yellow poyson was ministred unto him in a
broth at supper, which provoked such extreme vomits and purging as it was lookt he
should not recover. But neither this, nor the other poisons that were continually put in
his meats, serving to dispatch him, Mistresse <hi>Turner</hi> the preparer of all, procured an
Apothecaries boy to give him a poysoned glyster, which brought him to his end.
<hi>Overbury</hi> thus dead, was presently buried, and because of the blanes and blisters that
appeared in his body after his death, a report was dispersed that he dyed of the
<hi>French Pox;</hi> which few believed, and still the rumour went according to the truth,
that he was made away by poyson. The greatness of the procurers kept all hidden
for a time, but God who never suffereth such vile acts to go unpunished, did bring
the same to light after a miraculous manner.</p>
               <p>It happenned the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> in conference with a Counsellour of Estate to
recommend the Lieutenant of the Tower to his favour as a man of good parts,<note place="margin">The murther discovered and laid open.</note> and
one that desired to be known to him. The Counsellour answering, <hi>that he took it for
a favour from the Lieutenant that he should desire his friendship,</hi> added withall, <hi>that
there lay upon him an heavy imputation of</hi> Overburies <hi>death, whereof he wished the

also did; thereupon certain of the Councell were appointed to examine and finde

out the truth. From <hi>Weston</hi> somewhat was found, whereupon he was made prisoner;<note place="margin">An. 1616.</note>
                  <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Franklin</hi> the preparers of the poyson being examined, confessed every
thing, and then all breaking forth the Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> with his Lady and the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
were Committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weston</hi> at his first arraignment stood mute, yet was induced afterwards to put
himself to the triall of the Countrey, and being found guilty was hanged at <hi>Tyburne.</hi>
Mistresse <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Iames Franklin</hi> were in like sort executed. The Lieutenant
who had winked at their doings was judged accessary to the crime, and condemned
to death, which he suffered, expressing a great penitency and assurance of mercy at
the hands of God.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>May</hi> following the Earl and his Lady were brought to their triall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Somerset</hi> and his Lady brought to triall.</note> which
by their friends they laboured earnestly to eschew, but the King would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
for the love he had to maintain justice. The Judge by Commission was
<hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Ellesmore,</hi> Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> and Lord High Stewart for that
time; his assistants were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> Lord Chief Justice of <hi>England;</hi> Sir <hi>Henry

               <p>The Peers by whom they were tryed was the Earl of <hi>Worcester</hi> Lord Privy-seal,<note place="margin">The persons of the Jury.</note>

Lord <hi>Dormer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the Lady there was not much ado, for she with many tears confessing the
fact desired mercy. The Earl who was the next day presented before the Judges
made some defences, but the confessions of those that were executed, and a letter he
had sent to his Majesty did so cleerly convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him
of being accessary to the crime
at least,<note place="margin">The Earl and his Lady con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced.</note> that they were both sentenced to be taken to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and
from thence to the place of execution and hanged till they were dead. It was a foul
and hatefull fact on the Earles part especially, who did betray his friend for satisfying
the appetite of a revengefull woman, yet by his Majesties clemency the lives of
both were afterwards spared.</p>
               <p>A new business was about the same time made by the Marquis of <hi>Huntly,</hi> some
eight years before he had been excommunicated,<note place="margin">The Marquis of <hi>Huntly</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> and giving hopes from time to

insolencies, had caused his officers discharge his Tenants from hearing the Sermons
of some Ministers, with whom he made shew to offend. Being for this called before
the high Commission,<note place="margin">He is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> he was committed in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and had not
remained there two or three days, when upon the Chancellors warrant he was put

would take this ill, said, that <hi>he cared not what their Church thought of him:</hi> whereupon
the Ministers made great exclamations in the pulpits as against one that abused his
place and power.</p>
               <p>Complaints hereupon were sent from all hands to the King.<note place="margin">The Bishops complain to his Majesty.</note> The Bishops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of the Chancellour his usurping upon the Commission, and to this effect
directed <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cathnes</hi> to Court. The Chancellour complained of
the turbulency of the Ministers, and the liberty they took to censure the publick
actions of Statesmen in their Sermons. The Marquis upon a suit he made before
his imprisonment, had obtained licence to come unto Court, and had taken his
journey thither. But the King upon the Clergies complaint,<note place="margin">A Command to the Marquis to return to his ward.</note> sent Mr. <hi>Patrick Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi>
then waiting as Secretary deputy at Court, to command the Marquis to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and enter himself in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for satisfying the high Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:50008:276"/>
withall he carried a letter to the Councell sharply rebuking them for releasing
the Marquis, he being warded by the Lords of the Commission.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman meeting the Marquis at <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> within a daies journey to
<hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Marquis permitted to come to Court</note> did use his message, who intreated him to go back, and shew the King that
he was come to give his Majesty satisfaction in every thing he would enjoyn, and
to beseech his Majesty since he was so farre on his journey, not to deny him his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
The offer of satisfaction pleased the King very well, and permitting him to
come forward to Court, directed him to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with whom
he offered to communicate. His excommunication standing in the way, and it
being contrary to the Canons, that one excommunicated by the Church, should
without their consent who had so sentenced him, be absolved in another, it was a
while doubted what course they should take. The King on the one side was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to win him home, and on the other loath to infringe the Order of the Church,
yet inclining to have the Marquis absolved, it was thought that the Bishop of <hi>Cathnes</hi>
his consent in the name of the Clergy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was a warrant sufficient. Thus
the Bishop consenting, the absolution was given him in the Chappell of <hi>Lambeth</hi>
by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in this form.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whereas the purpose and intendment of the whole Church of <hi>Christ</hi> is to
win men unto God,<note place="margin">The form of the absolution.</note> and frame their souls for heaven, and that there is such an
agreement and correspondency betwixt the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>
that what the Bishops and Pastors in the one, without any earthly or wordly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
shall accomplish to satisfie the Christian and charitable end, and desire of
the other, cannot be distastfull to either. I therefore finding your earnest intreaty
to be loosed from the bond of excommunication, wherewith you stand bound in
the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and well considering the reason and cause of that censure,
as also considering your desire on this present day to communicate here with us,
for the better effecting of this work of participation of the holy Sacrament of
Christ our Saviour his blessed body and blood; do absolve you from the said
excommunication, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy
Ghost. And beseech the Almighty God, that you may be so directed by the holy
Spirit, that you may continue in the truth of his Gospell unto your lives end, and
then be made partaker of his everlasting kingdome.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How soon it was known that the Marquis was absolved by the Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Majesties letter to the Bishops for justifying the absolution.</note> there were great exceptions taken by the Church, and the same inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
to be a sort of usurpation: whereof the King being advertised, in a long letter
written to the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> he did justifie the doing by these reasons;
<q>First, that in absolving the Marquis nothing was intended to the prejudice of the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but what was done was out of a Christian necessity, it being
needfull that the Marquis should be absolved before he was admitted to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of the holy Sacrament. Secondly, he willed the Church to consider
that his absolution at home was onely deferred upon the scruple he made of the
Presence of our Saviour in the Sacrament, and that upon his confession swearing
and subscriving the other points of Religion they themselves had suspended his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
the lawful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nesse whereof he would not dispute but remit the same
to the Canonists, yet the suspension standing, it was not much from an absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thirdly, that the absolution given him in <hi>England</hi> did necessarily imply
an acknowledgement of the authority of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereas if the
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had received him to the holy Communion and not first
absolved him, being excommunicated by the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the contempt
and neglect had been a great deal greater. Fourthly, that the Marquis being
come into <hi>England,</hi> and make offer to perform whatsoever should be required of
him, it was more fit to take him in that disposition then to have delayed it unto
his return into <hi>Scotland.</hi> For these reasons, he said, and especially because all that
was done, was with a due acknowledgement, and reservation of the power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
authority of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> which the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
                     <pb n="527" facs="tcp:50008:276"/>
had by his own hand testified it was his pleasure, that upon the Marquis his
return a full form of absolution should be given him, or a ratification made of
that which was done in <hi>England;</hi> so as neither the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his
doing should be disapproved, as unlawfull; nor the same so approved, as it might
seem that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was inferiour in any sort to that of <hi>England;</hi>
and that the Archbishops Letter written to that effect, should be put in record,
and kept as a perpetuall monument for ages to come.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Letter directed to the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> I have thought here meet

                           <note place="margin">The Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury's</hi> excuse for the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note>
I cannot but esteem it an office of brotherly love to yeild you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of that great action, which lately befell us here with the Marquis of <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</hi>
So it was then, that upon the coming up of the said Marquis, his Majesty
sharply entreating him for not giving satisfaction to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
for a time restraining him from his Royall presence, the Marquis resolving to give
his Majesty contentment, did voluntarily proffer to communicate when and
wheresoever his Highness should be pleased; whereupon his Majesty being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to make known that offer to me, it was held fit to strike the iron whilest it was
hot, and that his great work should be accomplished before his Majesties going
to progresse; whereunto a good opportunity was offered by the consecration of
the Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> which was to be in my Chappell of <hi>Lambeth</hi> the seventh of
this moneth, at which time a solemn communion was there to be celebrated.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The only pause was, that the Marquis being excommunicated by the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there was in appearance some difficulty how he might be absolved in
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> wherewith his Majesty being acquainted, who wished
that it should not be deferred, we grew to this peaceable resolution, which I doubt
not your Lordship and the rest of our brethren there will interpret to the best:
for first, what was to be performed might be adventured upon, as we esteemed,
out of a brotherly correspondency and unity of affection, and not only of any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
for we well know, that as the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> is a free and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Monarchy, so the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is entire in it self, and independent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other Church. Secondly, we finde by the advice of divers Doctors of the
Civil law, and men best experienced in things of this nature, that the course of
Ecclesiasticall proceedings would fairly permit that we might receive to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
a man excommunicated in another Church, if the said person doe declare
that he had a purpose hereafter for some time to reside among us, which the Lord
Marquis did openly professe that he intended, and I know his Majesty doth desire
it; and for my part I rest satisfied, that it can bring no prejudice, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
unto you, and to that Kingdom. Thirdly, it pleased God the night before
the celebration of the sacrament, to send in our brother the Bishop of <hi>Cathnes,</hi>
with whom I taking counsel, his Lordship resolved me, that it was my best way to
absolve the Lord Marquis, and assured me that it would be well taken by the
Bishops and Pastors of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> I leave the report of this to my
Lord <hi>Cathnes</hi> himself, who was an eye-witness with what reverence the Marquis
did participate of that holy sacrament. For all other circumstances, I doubt not
but you shall be certified of them from his Majesty, whose gracious and princely
desire is, that this bruised reed should not be broken, but that so great a personage;
(whose example may doe much good) should be cherished and comforted in his
coming forward to God: which I for my part doe hope, and firmly believe, that
you all will endevour according to the wisdome and prudence which Almighty
God hath given unto you. And thus as your Lordship hath ever been desirous
that I should give you the best assistance I could with his Majesty for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
or restraining this Nobleman, so you see I have done it with the best discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I could, which I doubt not but all our brethren with you will take as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from my desire to serve God, and his Majesty, and the whole Church
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:50008:277"/>
of <hi>Scotland.</hi> I send you herewith the form which I used in absolving the Lord
Marquiss in the presence of the Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord Bishop of
<hi>London</hi> and divers others. And so beseeching the blessing of God upon you
all, that in your Assembly with unity of spirit you may proceed, to the honour
of Christ and to the beating down of Antichrist and Popery, I leave you to the
Almighty.</q>

                  <q>That for as much as his Majesty had by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
recalled such as were gone forth of the Countrey to be educated in
the Colledges of Jesuits, or other Popish Universities, within the space of a
year upon pain to be declared uncapable of succession either to goods or lands;
a triall and exact search should be made of all those that were sent or gone into
forain parts within these last ten years, and that every Minister should send a
particular note unto his Ordinary of those within his Parish that were gone to
follow their studies in places abroad, with their age, profession and families
whereunto they appertained, to the end they may be known, and the dangers
prevented wherewith their corrupt education did threaten the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was likewise enacted, <q>That no man should be permitted to practise or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
any Physick, unless he had first satisfied the Bishop of the Dioces touching
his religion. That a Liturgie or book of Common prayer should be formed
for the use of the Church; That the Acts of the generall Assemblies should be
collected and put in form, to serve for Canons to the Church in their Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of discipline; That children should be carefully catechised, and confirmed
by the Bishops, or in their absence by such as were employed in the visitation of
Churches; That Grammar Schooles should be established in all Parishes where
the same might be conveniently done; And that a Register should be kept of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptismes,
marriages and burialls by the Minister of every Parish.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These Acts being put in form,<note place="margin">Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners directed to the King from the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</note> were ordained to be presented to his Majesty by

to intreat his Majesties confirmation of the thing concluded.</p>
               <p>By the answer returned, with them, his Majesties good liking of all that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the Assembly,<note place="margin">His Majesties answer return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> was understood; only against the Act of <hi>confirming young
children by Bishops,</hi> he excepted, saying, it was a <hi>meer hotch potch,</hi> and not so cleer as
was requisite; and therefore directed the same to be reformed; and among the
Canons of the Church the Articles following to be inserted.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Articles cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed among the Canons.</note> That for the more reverend receiving of the holy Communion the same
should be celebrated to the people thereafter kneeling, and not sitting, as had been
the custome since the reformation of Religion.</p>
               <p>2 If any good Christian visited with sickness, which was taken to be deadly,
should desire to receive the Communion at home in his house, the same should not
be denied to him, lawfull warning being given to the Minister the night before;
and three or four of good Religion and conversation, being present to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with the sick person; who must provide for a convenient place and all things
necessary for the reverent administration of the blessed Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="529" facs="tcp:50008:277"/>
3 That the Sacrament of Baptisme should not be longer deferred then the
next Sunday after the child is born, unless some great and reasonable cause decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and approved by the Minister, doe require the same. And that in the case of
necessity tried and known to the Minister it should be lawfull to administrate Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme
in private houses, the same being alwaies ministred after the form it would
have been in the congregation and publick declaration thereof made the next
Sunday in the Church, to the end the child might be known to have been received
into the flock of Christs fold.</p>
               <p>4 Seeing the inestimable benefits received from God by our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
his birth, passion, resurrection, ascension, and sending down of the Holy Ghost,
have been commendably remembred at certain particular dayes and times by the
whole Church of the World, every Minister from thenceforth should keep a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
of the said benefits upon these days, and make choice of severall
and pertinent texts of Scripture, and frame their doctrines and exhortations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
rebuking all superstitious observation and licentious profaning of the said
times.</p>
               <p>5 The Act of confirmation of Children his Majesty desired to be reformed in
this manner. Seeing the confirmation of Children is for the good education of
youth most necessary being reduced to the Primitive integrity, It is thought
good that the Minister in every Parish shall catechise all young children of eight
years of age, and see that they have knowledge, and be able to rehearse the Lords
prayer, the Belief, and ten Commandments, with answers to the questions of the
small Catechisme used in the Church, and that the Bishops in their visitations
shall cause the Children be presented before them, and bless them with prayer
for the encrease of Grace, and continuance of God his heavenly gifts with
them.</p>
               <p>The difficulty of admitting these Articles being represented in an humble let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to his Majesty by the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reasons why the Articles could not be inserted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</note> and a reason given why the
same could not be inserted with the Canons, as having at no time been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Church, nor proponed in any of their meetings, he was pleased to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
the pressing of the same for that time, thinking at his coming into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which he intended the next Summer, to satisfie such as were scrupulous, and to
obtain the Churches consent.</p>
               <p>Shortly after a letter was sent to the Councel, <q>To assure them of the Kings
resolution to visit the Kingdom,<note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching the Kings pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to visit the Countrey.</note> which he said did proceed of a longing he had
to see the place of his breeding, a <hi>Salmon-like instinct</hi> (as he was pleased to call
it) and because he knew that evill disposed persons would disperse rumours, as if
he came to make alterations in the civill and ecclesiasticall Estate, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Proclamation to be made for certifying the subjects of the contrary. It
was true, he said, that he desired to doe some good at his coming; and to have
abuses reformed both in the Church and Common-wealth; yet foreseing the
impediments that his good intentions would meet with, and regarding the love
of his people no less then their benefit, he would be loath to give them any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
and therefore willed all his good subjects to lay aside their jealousies,
and accommodate themselves in the best sort they could for his receiving, and
the entertainment of the Noblemen of <hi>England</hi> who were to accompany him
in the journey.</q>

a Commissioner or Deputie in the Kingdome, which was hearkened unto
by the King as that which would ease him of many vexations, and in his absence
maintain a face of court, and breed a great respect among the people; and so
farre was that purpose advanced, as both the King had made offer of the place to
the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> and he yielded to accept the same: but this breaking out and
coming to the Chancellors knowledge, whether that he desired not to have any
in place above himself, or as he pretended wishing the Noblemans good, he divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:50008:278"/>
him from accepting that charge, and brought him to embrace the office of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saurer

things so carefully and with such foresight, as when the King came he found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

pen a letter to the King, entreating his Majesty <q>for the offence that was taken

King, <hi>you can endure Lyons, Dragons, and Devills to be figured in your Churches, but
will not allow the like place to the Patriarchs and Apostles.</hi> His Majesty alwaies gave
order for some other form and staying the erecting of these portraits; which in the
same letter he said, <hi>was not done for ease of their hearts, or confirming them in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
but because the work could not be done so quickly in that kind as was first appointed.</hi>
This letter was of the date at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the 13 of <hi>March</hi> 1617.</p>
               <p>The King was much laboured to deferre his journey to the next year,<note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futech to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as he was desired.</note> when as

                  <note place="margin">His Majesties speech to the Estates.</note> 
                  <hi>where his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
made a long speech for the establishing</hi> Religion <hi>and</hi> Iustice, <hi>neither of which, he
said, could be lookt for so long as a regard was not had to the</hi> Ministers <hi>of both.
For</hi> Religion <hi>he complained,</hi> That notwithstanding of the long profession of the truth,
numbers of Churches remained unplanted, and of those that were planted few or none
had any competent maintenance: for this he wished some course to be taken, and certain
Commissioners to be chosen for appointing to every Church a perpetuall locall stipend, such
as might suffice to entertain a Minister and make him able to attend on his charge of justice.
<hi>He discoursed long</hi> remembring the pains he had taken as well when he lived among
them, as since his going into <hi>England,</hi> and how he had placed Iustices and Constables (a
most ladable kind of government) for the preserving of peace, and the keeping of the laws
in due regard; which he understood, as he said, to be much neglected, partly in default of some
that were named to those places, and held it a scorne to be employed in such a charge, and
partly by the opposition which the Lords and great men of the Countrey made unto them,
and to their settling: but he would have both the one and other to know that as it was a
place of no small honour to be a Minister of the Kings Iustice in the service of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth; so he did esteem none to deserve better at his hands then they who gave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
thereto; as on the other part whosoever should shew themselves hinderers thereof,
should be accounted with him enemies to his Crown, and the quiet of the Kingdom. <hi>In
end he said,</hi> that he had long striven to have the barbarities of the Countrey which they
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:50008:278"/>
knew to be too many removed and extinct, and in place thereof Civility and Iustice esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
and that he would still indevour to doe his best that way, till he might say of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as one of the Emperours said of <hi>Rome, Inveni lateritiam, relinquo marmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ream.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King having closed and the Lords gone apart to choose those that should
be upon the Articles,<note place="margin">A Trouble in choosing the Lords of the Articles.</note> the humours of some discontented Lords begun to kithe; for
whosoever were by the King recommended as fit persons, were passed by as men
suspected, and others named who stood worse affected to his Majesties service.
Another question they made for admitting the Officers of State, refusing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any but the Chancellor, Thesaurer, and Clerk of the Rolls. This being long
and sharply debated, was in end agreed by the admission of the whole number.</p>
               <p>Among these Articles proponed,<note place="margin">Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Majesties prerogative in ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ses Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.</note> the first was, of his Majesties authority in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Ecclesiasticall, concerning which it was desired to be enacted, <q>That whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
conclusion was taken by his Majesty with advice of the Archbishops and
Bishops in matters of externall policy, the same should have the power and
strength of an Ecclesiasticall law.</q> The Bishops interceding did humbly intreat
that the Article might be better considered, for that in making of <hi>Ecclesiasticall
laws,</hi> the <hi>advice</hi> and <hi>consent</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> was also required. The King replying,
<hi>That he was not against the taking of Ministers their advice, and that a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the most grave and learned among them should be called to assist the Bishops; but to
have matters ruled as they have been in your Generall Assemblies, I will never agree:
for the Bishops must rule the Ministers, and the King rule both, in matters indifferent and
not repugnant to the Word of God.</hi> So the Article passed in this form, <q>That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
his Majesty should determine in the externall government of the Church,
with the advice of the Archbishops, Bishops, and a competent number of the
Ministery, should have the strength of a law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This coming to the Ministers ears,<note place="margin">A stir among the Ministers because of the Article.</note> they began to stirre as if the whole Rites and
Ceremonies of <hi>England</hi> were to be brought upon them without their consents;
whereupon the Ministers that were in Town were called together, and warned to
be quiet, for that such a generall Act did not lay upon them any bond; and if any
particular was urged, the same should be communicated to them, and nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
without their consents. It was further told them, that there would not be
wanting informations enough to stirre them up unto unquietness, but they should
doe well not to irritate his Majesty, whom they knew to be a gracious Prince,
and one that would hear reason, and give way to the same. This they did all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
yet upon the suggestion of some discontented people, the very next day
Mr. <hi>William Struthers,</hi> one of the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> did unhappily break out
in his Sermon upon these matters, condemning the Rites received in the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and praying God to save <hi>Scotland</hi> from the same. This reported to the
King by some of the <hi>English</hi> Doctors that were his hearers, he became greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed:
But the Ministers not contented with this, did the same day in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
tumultuously convene, and form a Protestation, in the words following:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Most gracious and dread Soveraign,<note place="margin">The Ministers Protestation.</note> most honourable Lords and remanent
Commissioners of this present Parliament; We the Ministers of Christs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangel,
being here convened from all the parts of this your Majesties Kingdome,
doe in all reverence and submission intreat your Majesties and honours patient
and favourable hearing of this our reasonable and humble supplication; And first
it will please your Highness &amp; honorable Estates presently convened to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that we are here a number of the Ministery out of all the parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and that the Bishops have protested to a great many of us since our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that nothing should be agreed nor consented unto by them in this present
Parliament, in matters concerning the discipline &amp; order of the Church, without
our knowledge and advice, affirming that neither we nor they have any power to
consent to any novation, or smallest change of the order established, without the
advice of the Generall Assembly; whereupon we resting in security, have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a sudden report of an Article to passe for a law in the Parliament, decern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:50008:279"/>
and declaring that your Majesty with the advice of the Archbishops, and
Bishops, and such a competent number of the Ministery as your Majesty out of
your wisdome should think expedient, shall in all time coming have full power to
advise and conclude all matters of decency, and which any way may concern the
policy of the Church: And that such conclusions shall have the strength and
power of laws Ecclesiasticall; wherein it will please your Majesty and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Estates to hear our own just griefs, and to consider our reasonable desires,
and not to put us your Majesties humble subjects to that poor and simple part of
protestation. Which if remedy be not provided, we shall be forced to use for the
freedome of our Church and discharge of our consciences.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We then first plead our reformation, and that the purity of our Church in
doctrine, ministration of the sacraments, discipline and all convenient order with
the best reformed Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> hath been acknowledged rather as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
to be followed of others, then that we should seek our reformation from
those that never attained to that perfection, which we by the mercy of God this
long time past have enjoyed under your Highness protection.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Next, we plead the liberty of our Church, which by the laws of your Majesties
Kingdome and divers Acts of Parliament, is established with power of publick
meetings and annuall Assemblies, and allowance to make Canons and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
such as may serve for the comely order thereof, all which by this conclusion
that is intended will be utterly overthrown.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly, we plead for the peace and tranquillity of our Church, that being
nearest the Divine and Apostolicall institution hath lived without <hi>schisme,</hi> and
rent in the self; and by introduction of any novelty against order, may be miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
divided, and so our peace broken.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fourthly, we have been at divers times sufficiently secured from all suspicions
of innovation, and specially by your Majesties Letter, sent down this last Winter,
to take away all fear of any alteration which might arise upon your Majesties lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
intended journey; which Letter by your Majesties speciall will and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of your Highness Councell, was intimated in pulpits; as also by that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
given out the 26 of <hi>September</hi> 1616, when rumours of an intended
conformity with the Church of <hi>England</hi> were dispersed: whereby your Majesty
sufficiently avoided all such suspicion, and setled the hearts of honest men in a
confidence that no such thing should be attempted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>These, and many other reasons have moved us in all reverence by this our
humble supplication to entreat, your Highness, and honourable Estates, not to
suffer the aforenamed Article, or any other prejudiciall to our former liberties, to
passe at this time, to the grief of this poor Church; that the universall hope of
thousands in this land, who rejoiced at your Majesties happy arrivall, be not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into mourning; wherein as we we are earnest supplicants to God, to incline
your Majesties heart this way, as the most expedient for the honour of God, and
well of your subjects, so if we shall be frustrated of this our reasonable desire,
then doe we in all humility, (with that dutifull acknowledgment of our loyalty
to your Majesty, as becometh) protest for our selves and all our brethren that
shall adhere to this our Protestation, that as we are free of the same, so must we
be forced rather to incurre the censure of your Majesties law, then to admit or
obtemper any imposition that shall not flow from the Church orderly convened,
or others having power from the same.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Protestation was subscribed by Mr. <hi>Archibald Sympson</hi> Minister at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Protestation.</note>
in name of the brethren and supplicants. In another paper, the Ministers who were
present set down their names each of them with his own hand, for a testimony of
their concurrence, which was committed to the said Mr. <hi>Archibald</hi> in custody. But
as it falleth out in things unadvisedly done, and in the heat of humour, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palls
in that business quickly forthinking that which they had done, came the next
morning early to the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> intreating him to stop the present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof, which he shewed he might easily doe by taking the same from Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Hewet,</hi> in whose hand it was given to present.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="533" facs="tcp:50008:279"/>
This man being one of the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> had lately before been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Abbacy of <hi>Crossragwell,</hi> and having thereby a place in the Parliament
house,<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Peter Hewet</hi> undertakes the presenting of the Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> was held the most fitting to present the Protestation, which he willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook;
for he loved ever to be medling, and was alwaies set to make trouble.
The Parliament was that day to close, and the Archbishop knowing how ill the
King would take their doing, went the more timely to the Palace, where meeting
with the Abbot, he asked him concerning the Protestation, desiring to see it; and
having perused a few lines began to rebuke him for taking in hand such a business;
he making some excuse, and saying, it was a Protestation only which could not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
put forth his hand to take back the paper; but the Archbishop holding it fast,
the Protestation was neer rent betwixt them. It happened one of the Grooms
(called <hi>Iohn Levingston</hi>) to see them at strife, for they had met in the private gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
neer to his Majesties chamber, who shewing the King what he had seen; his
Majesty came forth being as yet undressed, and asked what the matter was? The
Archbishop answered, <q>That a number of Ministers having framed a Protestation
against the Article of his Majesties Prerogative, had given it to the man that he
had made Abbot to present, and that he had undertaken to doe the same, for
which he had been chiding him, it being an undutifull part in him without signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the matter to his Ordinary to take such a business in hand.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The man falling upon his knees, and trembling, said, <q>That he supposed the
Protestation would never offend his Majesty, and that he had promised to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the same in Parliament; but now that it appeared to him otherwise, he would
no more meddle therewith.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The King taking the Protestation, and perceiving it subscribed by one only Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
inquired who these others were that convened. The Abbot answered, that
they had all signed a paper besides, which the subscriver kept by him for his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
Then the King commanding the Bishop to keep the Protestation, went to
prepare himself for the meeting, and suspecting that some other might come and
protest against the Article, commanded the Register Sir <hi>George Hay</hi> (who upon the
death of Sir <hi>Alexander Hay</hi> had been preferred to the office the year before) to passe
by that Article as a thing no way necessary,<note place="margin">The Clerk of Register com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pass by the Article of Prerogative.</note> the prerogative of his Crown bearing
him to more then was declared by it. Thus when the hour of meeting came, the
Register, as he was commanded, laying by that Article, caused read the others that
were concluded, as the custome is, and the same being assented to by the Estates,
were ratified by his Majesty. Thereafter the King in a most grave speech having
commended the execution of the laws made to the Judges and other inferiour
Magistrates, gave the Estates a most kinde and loving farewell.</p>
               <p>The same night the Bishops had warning given them to meet his Majesty at S.
<hi>Andrews</hi> the tenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Bishops warned to meet at S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews.</hi>
                  </note> whither he minded to call the principall Ministers also,
that they might know his minde before he went away. The Diet held as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and there assembled with the Bishops, the Ministers of chief accompt to
the number of thirty six, who being convened in the Chappel of the Castle, the
King did speak to them to this purpose.</p>
               <p>What and how great my care hath been for this Church as well before as since my going
into <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Majesties speech at the meeting.</note> is so well known to you all, as I neither need, nor doe I mean to speak much
of it, lest any should think I am seeking thanks for that I have done. It sufficeth me, that
God knows my intention is, and ever was to have his true worship maintained, and a
decent and comely order established in the Church. But of you I must complain, and of your
causless jealousies, even when my meaning towards you is best. Before my coming home to
visit this Kingdom, being advertised that in your last Assembly an Act was made for gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Acts of the Church, and putting them in form, I desired a few Articles to be inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
one was for the yearly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
of our Saviour his greatest blessings bestowed upon
mankinde, as his Nativity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Resurrection, Ascension, and the descent of the holy
Spirit. Another for the private use of both Sacraments, in urgent and necessary cases. A
third for the reverent administration of his holy Supper. And a fourth for Catechising
and Confirming young Children by Bishops. It was answered, that these particulars had
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:50008:280"/>
not been moved in any of the Church Assemblies, and so could not be inserted with the rest;
which excuse I admitted, and was not minded to presse them any more till you after advice
did give consent thereto; yet when in the late Parliament I desired my prerogative to be
declared in the making of the Ecclesiasticall laws, certain of your number did mutinously as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
themselves, and form a Protestation to cross my just desires. But I will pass that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many other wrongs I have received at your hands: the errand for which I have
now called you, is, to hear what your scruples are in these points, and the reasons, if any you
have, why the same ought not to be admitted. I mean not to doe any thing against reason;
and on the other part my demands being just and religious, you must not think that I will
be refused or resisted. It is a power innated and a speciall prerogative which we that are
Christian Kings have, to order and dispose of externall things in the policy of the Church,
as we by advice of our Bishops shall finde most fitting; and for your approving or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approving,
deceive not your selves, I will never regard it, unlesse you bring me a reason
which I cannot answer.</p>
               <p>The Ministers at these words falling on their knees did beseech his Majesty to
think of them as his most humble and obedient subjects,<note place="margin">The Ministers promise obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of a general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> and to permit them
to confer a little space among themselves that they might return with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
answer. This granted, they went to the parish Church, and after some two
hours returned, making petition for a generall Assembly, wherein these Articles
being proponed might be with a common consent received. The King asking
<hi>what assurance he might have of their consenting;</hi> they answered, that they found
no reason to the contrary, and knew the Assembly would yeeld to any reasonable
thing demanded by his Majesty. <hi>But if it fall out otherwise,</hi> said the King, <hi>and that
the Articles be refused, my difficulty shall be greater, and when I shall use my authority in
establishing them, they shall call me a tyrant and persecutor.</hi> All crying that none could
be so mad as to speak so: <hi>Yet experience,</hi> sayes the King, <hi>tels me it may be so; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unless I be made sure, I will not give way to an Assembly.</hi> Mr. <hi>Patrick Galloway</hi>
saying, that the <hi>Bishop of</hi> S. <hi>Andrews should answer for them:</hi> the Bishop <hi>refused,</hi> for
that he had been deceived by them, they having against their promise in the time
of Parliament taken the course which they did. Then said Mr. <hi>Patrick. If your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
will trust me, I will assure for the Ministers.</hi> The King replying that he would
trust him; it was condescended that an Assembly should be called for that end
at S. <hi>Andrews</hi> the 25. of <hi>November</hi> next.</p>

King he asked for the bearer. This was Mr. <hi>David Catherwood,</hi> who carrying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unreverently, and breaking forth into speeches not becoming a subject, was
committed in the Town house of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and afterwards banished the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<hi>Sympson</hi> for his letter was warded in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
unto <hi>December</hi> following.</p>
               <p>The King after this taking his Journey to <hi>London</hi> by the west parts,<note place="margin">The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth towards <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> was all the

preached by the Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> which made the hearers burst out in
many tears.</p>
               <p>When the diet of the Assembly came,<note place="margin">An assembly at S. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                  </note> the Earle of <hi>Hadington,</hi> and Viscount
of <hi>Stormont</hi> were sent thither, as Commissioners from his Majesty; the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
made the exhortation, <q>wherein having deduced the Story of the Church
from the time of reformation, he shewed that the greatest hinderance the
Church received, proceeded from the Ministers themselves, who for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of ill disposed people spared not to provoke his Majesty to just anger: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
them for the glory of God, the honour of the Gospell and their own
good, to take another course, and preferre the favour of their King, under
whom they enjoyed so many blessings, to the vain applause of factious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</q>

It seemed at first, that matters should have gone well; for the first two dayes
there was much calmenesse, and the reasoning very formall and free, but then
upon a motion to delay the conclusion to another Assembly,<note place="margin">The Assembly inclineth to a delay.</note> that the Ministers
might have time to informe the people of the equity of the Articles, the greater
part went that way, and all almost cried for a delay.</p>
               <p>His Majesties Commissioners declaring that the King would take in ill part
the delay,<note place="margin">The Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners obtain a grant of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> and that nothing should be done considering the promises they had
made, if a generall Assembly should be granted to receive the whole Articles, a
fashion was made to a condescending to private Communion, and the Ministers
ordained to give the elements in the ministration of the holy Supper out of their
own hands to the people: which two acts with a letter of excuse for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the rest, were sent to his Majesty; how the same was excepted, may
appear by the answer that came a few dayes after, which was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We have received your letter,<note place="margin">The King offended with the Assemblies proceedings writeth to the two Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</note> and thereby understand what your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
have been in that Assembly of S. <hi>Andrews;</hi> concerning which we will have
you know, that we are come to that age, as we will not be content to be fed
with broath, as one of your Coat was wont to speak, and think this your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and we command you as you will avoid our highest displeasure, the one of you
by your Deputy in S. <hi>Andrews</hi> and by your self in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the other of
you in <hi>Glasgow,</hi> keep <hi>Christmas</hi> day precisely, your selves preaching, and
chusing your Texts according to the time. And likewise that ye discharge all
modification of Stipends for this year to any Minister whatsoever, such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
as have testified their affection to our service at this time by furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
at their power the acceptation of the Articles proposed, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
willing you not to fail we bid you farewell. <hi>Newmarket</hi> the 6 of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a postscript to the same letter it was said,</hi> So many Bishops as you can get
warned in time to preach at their Seas on <hi>Christmas</hi> day, urge them to it. Thus much
in haste for this time, after two or three daies ye shall hear further from us. <hi>With his
Majesties own hand after all was written;</hi> Since your Scottish Church hath so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
my Clemency, they shall now find what it is to draw the anger of a King upon them.</p>
               <p>This letter was directed to the Archbishops of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glasgow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Another letter to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of S. <hi>Andrews.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>After we had commanded the dispatch of our other letter, we received an
extract concluded (we know not how) in your Assembly, and subscribed by
the Clerk thereof. The one concerning private Communion, and the other
concerning the forme to be used at the receiving of the holy Sacrament; both
so hedged and conceived in so ridiculous a manner, as besides that of the
whole Articles proponed, these two were the least necessary to have been urged,
and hastned. The scornfull condition and forme of their grant makes us justly
wish that they had been refused with the rest: for in the first concerning the
Communion allowed to sick persons, besides the number required to receive
with such patients, and a necessity tying them upon oath to declare that they
truely think not to recover, but to dye of that disease, they are yet further hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in with a necessity to receive the Sacrament (in case foresaid to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
unto them) in a convenient room; which what it importeth we cannot guess,
seeing no room can be so convenient for a sick man (sworn to dye) as his bed,
and that it were injurious and inhumane from thence in any case to transport
him, were the room never so neat and handsome, to which they should carry
him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And as to that other Act ordaining the Minister himself to give the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the celebration out of his own hand to every one of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants;
and that he may performe this the more commodiously, by the advice
of the Magistrates and honest men of his Session, to prepare a Table, at which
the same may be conveniently ministred; Truly in this we must say that the
Ministers ease and commodious sitting on his taile, hath been more lookt to,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:50008:281"/>
then that kne eling, which for reverence we directly required to be enjoyned to
the receivers of so divine a Sacrament; neither can we conceive what should
be meant by that Table, unless they mean to make a round Table (as did the
Jews) to sit and receive it. In conclusion, seeing either we and this Church
here must be held Idolatrous in this point of kneeling, or they reputed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
knaves in refusing the same, and that the two foresaid Acts are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so scornfully, and so far from our meaning; it is our pleasure that the same
be altogether suppressed, and that no effect follow thereupon. So we bid you
farewell. <hi>Newmarket</hi> the 11 of <hi>December.</hi> 1617.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These letters were accompanyed with another to the <q>Councell for inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the payment of Stipends to any of the rebellious Ministers refusers of the
said Articles either in Burgh or Landwart,<note place="margin">Letters to the Councell for inhibiting the payment of Stipends.</note> till they shew their conformity, and
that the same was testified by the subscriptions of the Primate or ordinary Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</q>
Which letters being shewed to the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and others that
happened to repaire to that City for augmentation of stipends, did cast them
into a great fear, and repenting their wilfulnesse, as they had reason, became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questers
to the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> to preach as he was commanded on
<hi>Christmas</hi> day at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> trusting his Majesty should be mitigated by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and intercession for the rest. Neither did he fail to use his best means for
diverting the King from these rigorous courses, and after a little time (so loath
was his Majesty to exerce any rigour against Ministers) obtained a warrant for
staying the execution of the former letters, till their behaviour should be tried in
the particular Synods, and their disposition for accepting the Articles.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Archibald Sympson,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Archibald Sympson</hi> put to liberty.</note> who all this while remained prisoner in the Castle of
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> hearing that the King was so greatly displeased, did supplicate the
Lords of his Majesties Commission (by whose command he was committed)
for liberty, <q>promising not to fall again in the like errours and professing a great
sorrow for his medling with the Protestation, as likewise for writing that letter
wherein he had taxed the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Being brought before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
after he had set his hand to his supplication, he was permitted to return
to his charge at <hi>Dalkeith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and change.</note> Yet ere many days passed, finding the countenances of
the holy brethren cast down upon him, he dispersed an Apologetick (as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
it) wherein making a gloss upon every word of his confession he concluded,
that whatsoever weakness or frailty had befallen him, he hoped to be like <hi>Peter,
qui ore negavit, &amp; corde confessus est, and never to betray the Lords cause with Iudas.</hi>
This I have remembred by the way, to make the humours of these men seen,
and the small regard they take of saying, and gainsaying, when it maketh for their
purpose.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed; the Bishops upon advertisement given them convened at
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 29 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and considering the hurt that the Church might
receive, if the Commission granted in Parliament for provision of Ministers
(which was to expire at Lambmas next) should take no effect, did by a common
letter intreat his Majesty for a warrant to proceed in that Commission, giving
hopes that in their Synods they should induce the Ministers to obey.</p>
               <p>The answer returned in <hi>February</hi> next,<note place="margin">A warrant to proceed with the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Stipends.</note> was to this effect. <q>That howbeit his
Majesty did interpret well their doings, as intended to the good of his service,
yet considering the obstinate resistance of the Ministers to all his just and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
desires, he could not expect any thing from them in their meetings, but
a further expression of their former misbehaviour. Nottheless as he had once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
upon the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> his intreaty, suspended the execution
of his last directions, so at their requests he was pleased that the Commissioners
for Stipends should meet and go on with the providing of Churches, they in
the mean time in their own persons, and in their own Cathedralls observing
the festivities that should intervene between and the Synods, and ministring the
holy Communion with the reverence required, at the feast of <hi>Easter</hi> next.</q>
Thus were maters pacified for that time, and the Commission for augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Stipends by the warrant of this letter put in practise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="537" facs="tcp:50008:281"/>
Most of the next summer was spent in that work, but with greater detriment
then benefit to the Church; for what augmentation soever was granted, the same
was recompensed to the givers by prorogation of their former leases for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of years, and thereby the Church more damnified then bettered.</p>
               <p>In the Synods all things were carried with reasonable quietness,<note place="margin">A generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at <hi>Perth.</hi>

and the same indicted at <hi>Perth</hi> the 25 of <hi>August.</hi> The Lords <hi>Hadington, Carnegy</hi> and

                     <p>
                        <q>We were once fully resolved never in our time to have called any moe Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
here for ordering things concerning the policy of the Church,<note place="margin">His Majesties Letter to the Assembly.</note> by reason
of the disgrace offered unto us in that late meeting of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> wherein our just
and godly desires were not onely neglected, but some of the Articles concluded
in that scornfull manner, as we wish they had been refused with the rest: yet at
this time we have suffered our selves to be intreated by you our Bishops for a new
Convocation, and have called you together who are now convened, for the self
same business which then was urged, hoping assuredly that you will have some bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
regard to our desires, and not permit the unruly and ignorant multitude, after
their wonted custome, to oversway the better and more judicious sort in evill,
which we have gone about with much pains to have had amended in these Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
and for that purpose, according to Gods ordinance and the constant practise
of all well governed Churches, we have placed you that are Bishops and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers
of the rest in the chiefest rooms. You plead much we perceive to have
things done by consent of Ministers, and tell us often, that what concerneth the
Church in generall, should be concluded by the advice of the whole: neither do
we altogether dislike your opinion, for the greater is your consent, the better are
we contented. But we will not have you to think, that matters proponed by us of
the nature whereof these Articles are, may not without such a generall consent be
enjoyned by our authority.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>This were a misknowing of your places, and withall a disclaiming of that innate
power which we have by our calling from God, whereby we have place to dispose
of things external in the Church, as we shall think them to be convenient &amp; profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for advancing true religion among our subjects. Wherefore let it be your care
by all manner of wise &amp; discreet perswasions to induce them to an obedient yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to these things, as in duty both to God and us they are bound; and do not think
we will be satisfied with delays, mitigations and other we know not what shifts
have been proponed; for we will not be content with any thing, but a simple
and direct acceptation of these Articles in the form sent by us unto you a long
time past, considering both the lawfulness and undeniable convenience of them,
for the better furtherance of piety and Religion, the establishing whereof it had
rather have becomed you to beg of us, then that we should have needed thus to
urge the practise of them upon you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>These matters indeed concern you of the Ecclesiasticall charge chiefly; neither
would we have called Noblemen, Barons and others of our good subjects to the
determination of them, but that we understand the offence of people that have
been so much objected, wherein you must bear with us to say, that no Kingdome
doth breed, or hath at this time more loving, dutifull, and obedient subjects
then we have in that our native kingdome of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and so if any disposition
hath appeared to the contrary in any of them, we hold the same to have proceeded
from among you, albeit of all sorts of men ye are they, that both of duty were
bound, and by particular benefits obliged to have continued your selves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
others by sound doctrine and exemplary life in a reverent obedience to
our commandments. What and how many abuses were offered us by divers of
the Ministery there before our happy coming to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> we can
hardly forget, and yet like not much to remember, neither think we that any
Prince living should have kept himself from falling in utter dislike with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:50008:282"/>
it self,<note place="margin">An. 1618.</note> considering the many provocations that were given unto us: but
the love of God and his truth still upheld us, and will by his grace so do unto the
end of our life, our patience always in forgetting and forgiving of many faults
of that sort, and constant maintaining of true Religion against the adversaries (by
whose hatefull practises we live in greater perill then you all or any of you)
should have produced better effect among you, then continuall resistance of our
best purposes, we wish that we be no more provoked, nor the truth of God which
you teach and profess, any longer slandered, by such as under the cloak of seeming
holiness walk disorderly amongst you, shaking hands as it were and joyning in
this their disobedience to Magistracy, with the upholders of Popery. In summe,
our hearty desire is, that at this time you make the world see by your proceedings
what a dutifull respect you bear to us your Soveraign Prince and naturall King
and Lord, that as we in love and care are never wanting to you, so ye in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
submission to our so just demands be not found inferiour to others our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in any of our kingdomes: and that the care and zeal of the good of Gods
Church, and of the advancing of piety and truth, doth chiefly incite us to the
following of these matters, God is our witness; the which that it may be before
your eyes, and that according to your callings you may strive in your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
places, and in this generall meeting to do these things which may best serve to
the promoving of the Gospell of Christ, even our prayers are earnest to God for
you, requiring you in this and other things to credit the bearer hereof our servant
and Chaplain the Dean of <hi>Winchester,</hi> whom we have expresly sent thither, that
he may bring unto us a certain relation of the particular carriages of all matters
and of the happy event of your meeting, which by Gods blessing (who is the God
of order, peace and truth) we do assuredly expect, unto whose gracious direction
we commend you now and for ever.</q>

the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> resumed shortly the heads thereof, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them as he had done in his exhortation, to consider the inconveniencies they
should draw upon the Church by the refusall of the Articles. After which the rolls
being called, certain of the most wise and discreet Ministers, were set apart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
upon the Articles. How matters proceeded in the said Assembly, you may
learn by the Defence afterward published, in answer to a lying and seditious pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
that came forth in print against the conclusions there taken. To our story it shall
suffice that after long reasoning, first in the conference, and then in the full Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
the Articles were concluded in this form.</p>
               <p>1 Seeing we are commanded by God himself,<note place="margin">Article for kneeling.</note> that when we come to worship him, we fall
down and kneel before the Lord our maker, and considering with all that there is no part of
divine worship more heavenly and spirituall, then is the holy receiving of the blessed body
&amp; blood of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, like as the most humble &amp; reverent gesture
of our body in our meditation and the lifting up of our hearts best becometh so divine and
sacred an action; therefore notwithstanding that our Church hath used since the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Religion to celebrate the holy communion to the people sitting, by reason of the great
abuse of kneeling used in the Idolatrous worship of the Sacrament by the Papists; yet seeing
all memory of by past superstitions is past, in reverence of God and in due regard of so
divine a Mystery, and in remembrance of so mysticall an union, as we are made partakers
of; the Assembly thinketh good, that the blessed Sacrament be celebrated hereafter meekly
and reverently upon their knees.</p>
               <p>2 If any good Christian visited with long sickness and known to the Pastor,<note place="margin">Private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> by reason of
his present infirmity be unable to resort to the Church for receiving the holy communion,
or being sick, shall declare to the Pastor upon his conscience that he thinks his sicknesse to be
deadly, and shall earnestly desire to receive the same in his house, the Minister shall not deny
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:50008:282"/>
him so great a comfort, lawfull warning being given to him the night before, and that there
be three or four of good Religion, and conversation, free of all lawfull impediments, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with the sick person to communicate with him, who must also provide a convenient
place in his house, and all things necessary for the reverent administration thereof according
to the order prescri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed in the Church.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Item,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Private Bip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> The Minister shall often admonish the people that they deferre not the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of Infants any longer then the next Lords day after the child be born, unless upon a
great and reasonable cause declared to the Minister and by him approved, the same be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.
As also they shall warn them that without great cause they procure not their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to be baptized at home in their houses, but when great need shall compell them to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
in private houses (in which case the Minister shall not refuse to do it, upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the great need, and being timely required thereto) then Baptisme shall be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
after the same form as it should have been in the congregation: and the Minister
shall the next Lords day after any such private baptisme declare in the Church that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
was so baptized, and therefore ought to be received as one of the true flock of Christs
fold.</p>
               <p>4 For as much as one of the speciall means for staying the increase of Popery,<note place="margin">Confirmation of Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and setling
of true Religion in the hearts of people is, that a speciall care be taken of young children,
their education, and how they are catechized, which in time of the Primitive Church most
carefully was attended as being most profitable to cause young children in their tender years
drink in the knowledge of God and his Religion, but is now altogether neglected, in respect
of the great abuse and errors, which crept into the Popish Church by making thereof a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Confirmation; therefore that all superstitions built thereupon may be rescinded,
and that the matter it self being most necessary for the Education of youth, may be reduced
to the Primitive integrity, it is thought good that the Minister in every parish should cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise
all young children of eight years of age; and see that they have the knowledge, and
be able to make rehearsall of the Lords Prayer, Belief &amp; ten Commandements, with answers
to the Questions of the small Catechisme used in our Church: &amp; that every Bishop in his
visitation shall censure the Minister, who shall be found remisse therein; &amp; the said Bishops
shall cause the said children to be presented before them, &amp; bless them with prayer for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas
of their knowledge, &amp; the continuance of Gods heavenly graces with every one of them.</p>
               <p>5 As we abhor the superstitious observation of Festivall days by the Papists,<note place="margin">Observation of Festivities.</note> and detest
all licentious and profane abuses thereof, by the common sort of prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssors; so we think that
the inestimable benefits received from God by our Lord Iesus Christ, his birth, passion,
resurrection, ascension, and sending downe of the holy Ghost was commendably, and godly
remembred at certain particular days and times by the whole Church of the world,
and may also be now: therefore the Assembly admitteth that every Minister shall upon these
days have the commemoration of the foresaid inestimable benefits, and make choice of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and pertinent texts of Scripture, and frame their doctrine and exhortation thereto;
and rebuke all superstitious observation and licentious profanation thereof.</p>
               <p>These Articles concluded,<note place="margin">The Articles ordained to be intimated in all Churches.</note> order was given to intimate the same in all the parish
Churches, and the Ministers enjoyned to inform their people of the lawfulness

part, was not the least cause of the distractions that ensued, especially in the Church
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the people being still fostered in an opinion that their Ministers
would not go from their former practise, when they saw them give obedience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
themselves in great numbers, and ran to seek the Communion from other
Ministers they knew to be refractary. His Majesty always upon advertisement that
the Articles were concluded, caused publish the same at the Mercat Cross of the
principall burghs, commanding the subjects to obey and conform themselves under
the pain of his Highness displeasure.</p>
               <p>At the same time the King being informed that the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> (who the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

                  </note> and because a supply of money was required to
such a business, the Councell was desired to travell with the Noblemen the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Session, and the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for a voluntary contribution, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that others by their example would be drawn thereto. The Noblemen meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this effect the 24 of <hi>November</hi> expressed a great forwardness to satisfie his
Majesties desire, yet fearing that all the contributions when they were brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
should prove unworthy, advised the Councel rather to call a Parliament and
impose upon the subjects by way of Tax a reasonable proportion according to the
wealth and substance that every man had. This being signified to the King he
refused to have any supply by Tax, for he considered that the collection would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a time, and a burthen should that way be cast upon the Commons, and poor
labourers of the ground, which would make an outcrying among the people:
therefore he desired as before, that Noblemen, and those others he had named in
his first letter, should be urged to shew their liberality.</p>
               <p>A new meeting for this business being kept in <hi>Ianuary</hi> there after,<note place="margin">Ann. 1621.</note> divers overtures
were made for giving his Majesty content;<note place="margin">A Parliament desired by the estates.</note> The Noblemen that were present

rank being minors, and others abroad in their travells, they saw not who would
undertake for them. The Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> being pressed with an answer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
themselves as being one Burgh only, and lacking the concurrence of the rest,
without which any supply they could make would be of little worth. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates,
Clerks, and other members of the Session gave in effect the like answer,
so as they were forced to turn unto the first overture for a Parliament. And for
that the difficulties of the contribution could not so well be expressed by letter, it
was thought meet that one of the Councel should be sent to inform his Majesty of
the reasons, and necessity they had to call a Parliament. This employment being
laid upon the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> he took journey about the end of the
same moneth, and obtained after a little insisting his Majesties warrant for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
thus was it indicted to keep at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the first of <hi>Iune,</hi> and prorogued to
the 23 of <hi>Iuly</hi> thereafter.</p>
               <p>In this mean time it happened that Sir <hi>Gedeon Murray</hi> Thesaurer deputy being
then at Court,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Gideon Murray</hi> his death.</note> an information was made against him for abusing his office to the
Kings prejudice. The informer was <hi>Iames Stuart</hi> stiled the Lord <hi>Ochiltry,</hi> who
out of malice carried to the Gentleman for the strictness which he had used in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to an account for the duties of <hi>Orkney,</hi> made offer to justifie the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and by the assistance of some of better credit then himself, prevailed so farre,
that the matter was remitted to the triall of certain Counsellors at home; the
Gentleman being of a great spirit, and taking impatiently that his fidelity, whereof
he had given so great proof, should be called in question upon the information of
a malitious enemy, by the way as he returned from Court, did contract such a
deep melancholy as neither counsell, nor comfort could reclaim him, so farre was
he overgone that no advice given by friends, nor offer of their assistance, nor the
company and counsell of any whomsoever could reduce him to his wonted estate;
And so after he came to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> within a few days departed this life. It was
not doubted, if he should have patiently attended the triall, but he had been
cleered, and the accusation proved a meer calumny; nor was it thought that the
King did trust the information, but only desired to have the honesty of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
appear, yet such was his weakness (courage I cannot call it) as giving scope to
his passions of anger and grief, he suffered himself to be therewith oppressed. By
his death the King did lose a good servant as ever he had in that charge; and did
sore forethink that he should have given ear to such delations. But of that pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
sort some will never be wanting in the Courts of Princes, and happy is the
King that can rid himself of lyers in that kind. The Gentleman alwayes dyed

the business that some turbulent Ministers were making to impede the ratification

the Privy Councel and Session with their members to be, as having their places and
promotions by him. Therefore commanded them and every one of that number to conform
themselves to the obedience of the orders of the Church now established by law; which he trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they would readily do, otherwise if any Counsellor or Sessioner should refuse, and make dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,

Clerk should not at that time obey, they should be suspended from the exercises of their
offices, and the fees and casualities thereunto belonging, unto such time as they gave obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<hi>In the same letter he willed the Councell to take order,</hi> That none should
bear office in any Burgh, nor be chosen Sheriffe, Deputy, or Clerk, but such as did conforme
themselves in all points to the said orders. <hi>This letter was of the date, At the Honour of</hi>

left to their own pleasures.</q> That his Majesty gave no such warrant it appears by
the foresaid Letters, and that the Nobleman would go an inch from that he was
trusted with, none that knew will believe. The truth is, that in most perswasive
words (and with that majesty which became the place he represented) he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
them all to acquiesce, and willingly obey the conclusions taken, and not to
draw upon themselves by their disobedience his Majesties anger, assuring them
in that case, that his Majesty should not in his daies presse any more change, or
alteration in matters of that kinde without their own consents. And this was all
the Nobleman spake, as divers yet living may remember.</p>

This rumour was increased by occasion of certain directions sent from the King to
the Bishops of <hi>England,</hi> for reforming certain abuses crept into the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Preachers and Lecturers were commanded on Sundaies and Holy-daies in
the afternoon to teach the Catechisme only, or then some text taken out of the
Creed, the ten Commandements, or Lords Prayer; and in their preaching to
abstain from handling the deep points of Predestination, Reprobation, Election, the
universality, efficacy, resistibility, or irresistibility of Grace, leaving these themes as
fitter for the Schools then for simple auditors: as likewise not to presume in any
Lecture or Sermon to limit and bound by way of positive doctrine, the power,
prerogative, jurisdiction, authority or duty of soveraign Princes, or to meddle
with matters of State, having reference betwixt Princes and people, otherwise then
they were instructed and presidented in the Homily of Obedience, and others of
that sort, set forth by publick authority. These directions were interpreted to be
a discharge of preaching, at least a confining of Preachers to certain points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which they called a <hi>limiting of the Spirit of God,</hi> and as people will ever be

his forces from the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> at which time it was no way fitting that he
should be executing the rigour of his laws against Papists at home, while he did la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for peace to them of the Religion abroad; the most likely way to obtain what
he did seek of these Princes, being a moderation of the severity of laws against
Priests &amp; Papists, at least for a time. And as to the directions given to the Preachers,
the same they judged both necessary and profitable, considering the indiscretion of
divers of that sort, who to make ostentation of their learning, or to gain the applause
of the popular, would be medling with controversies they scarce understood, and
with matters exceeding the capacities of people.</p>

against Papists, but ye should know that a King and his laws are not unfitly compared to a
rider and his horse, the spurre is sometime to be used, but not alwaies; the bridle is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to be held in, at other times to be let loose, as the rider finds cause: just so a King is
not at all times to put in execution the rigour of his laws, but he must for a time, and upon
just grounds dispense with the same, as I protest to have done in the present case, and to
have connived only for a time upon just cause, howbeit not known to all. If any man for
the favour shewed to a Priest or Papist, will judge me to be inclining that way, he wrongs me
exceedingly. My words, and writings, and actions have sufficiently demonstrated what my
resolution is in all matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>Some mo words to this purpose he uttered in that meeting,<note place="margin">An. 1623.</note> but in a Letter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected

trouble them. But it pleased God both in his going and returning safely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

relate.</p>

but found a greater strangeness then he expected; for although he was
still kept in hope of the Match, yet he was not permitted to visit the Lady, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition to speak in such and such terms, and no otherwise. Afterward they
began to move him touching his Religion, desiring he should conferre with some
Divines, for that he could not have the <hi>Infanta</hi> to wife, unlesse he was converted,
and became a <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi> The Prince replying, <hi>That he would not change his
Religion for such a worldly respect, nor would he enter in conference with any Divines to
that purpose, for if they did not prevaile with him, it would breed a greater discontent;</hi>
It was then told him, <hi>that he must attend till a dispensation was procured from Rome,
and that in the mean time be should be entertained as a Prince, but not as a Sutor.</hi>

<hi>the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the Prince, wherein after many fair and plausible words, he said, that</hi>
as Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> was the first that induced the people of <hi>England</hi> to submit themselves
to the See Apostolick, so he bearing the same name, and being his equall in the height of
dignity, though inferiour to him in vertue and holiness, desired nothing more then to
follow his pattern, and promove the health and happiness of that Kingdome: the rather
because his peregrination at that time had given such hopes of an happy success; for since
he was arrived in <hi>Spain</hi> and at the Court of the <hi>Catholick King,</hi> with a desire to joyn
in mariage with the house of <hi>Austria</hi> (which intention he greatly commended) he could
not believe that he did really desire the Match, and in heart abhorre the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and seek to ruine the holy See of <hi>Rome. Then falling to a prayer, he</hi> besought God
the Father of lights to advance him (the most fair flower of the Christian world, and the
only hope of Great <hi>Britain</hi>) to that noble inheritance which his illustrious progenitours
had gained by the defence of the Apostolick authority, and the suppression of the monsters
of all heresies. <hi>Towards the end of the Letter willing him</hi> to call to minde the antient

above all the Princes of the earth. <hi>In end returning to his supplications, he said,</hi>
that the Catholick Church Roman stretching forth her armes to embrace him with all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as her most desired son, he could not perform any thing of greater comfort to the
Nations of Christendome then to bring again the profession of that most noble Island to the
Prince of the Apostles, whereof he could not despaire, his hopes being set on God, in whose
hands are the hearts of Kings, &amp;c.</p>

                  </note> which he received courteously, thanking the Pope for his good affection.
Thereafter understanding that the Dispensation was granted, he pressed the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the Marriage, but was answered, <hi>That the Conditions must first be fulfilled,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:50008:285"/>
and the Articles concerning the</hi> Infanta <hi>her liberty of profession when she came into</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>and the education of her Children, if God should grant her any by him, drawn up in
form.</hi> These Articles being advised by a Commission of Divines, were sent into
<hi>England,</hi> and shortly after returned, signed with his Majesties hand, and approved
by the Councell. And now it was thought there should be no more delaies used,
but other excuses were forged, as <hi>that it was not fitting the</hi> Infanta <hi>should go to</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>before the business of the Parliament was setled, and that these Articles must be sent
to</hi> Rome, <hi>and allowed by the Pope.</hi> The Prince perceiving that there was nothing
really intended on the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his part, and that the Treaty was only enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
till the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had reduced <hi>Germany</hi> in his power, resolved to be gone,
and declaring the necessity he had to return, did leave a Proxie in the hands of the
Earl of <hi>Bristoll</hi> (the Ambassadour legier) for espousing the <hi>Infanta,</hi> how soon the
Articles returned from <hi>Rome.</hi> So the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having conveyed the Prince
a little way towards the sea, they parted in most loving tearms, and in hope the
Match should take effect. But the Prince being after that informed of a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
laid, <q>That if the Match should be further pressed, the <hi>Infanta</hi> to eschew the
same should presently enter into the house of <hi>los Discalceatos</hi>
                  </q>(a Monastery of bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed
Nunnes) after he was parted, sent and commanded <hi>Bristoll</hi> not to make use
of the proxie till he should advertise.</p>
               <p>The Prince having for his convoy home,<note place="margin">The Prince returneth to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> eleven of the Kings ships, and some
Merchants, arrived at <hi>Portsmouth</hi> the 5 of <hi>October</hi> with his whole retinue, and went
the next day to <hi>Royston</hi> where the King lay. The joy was exceeding great of all
sorts of people, and publick thanks given to God throughout all the Churches
of both the Kingdoms for his safe return. Soon after when the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the report, that neither was the Match truly meant, nor the <hi>Palatinate</hi>
like to be restored, he directed the Earl of <hi>Bristoll</hi> to insist for the restitution, and if
he was put off with delaies to take his leave and come home; which also he did.
Thus was the marriage which had been long treated of quite dissolved, the King
saying, <hi>That he would never marry his Son with a Portion of his only Sistes tears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The year following the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were greatly vexed by a sort of
mutinous people,<note place="margin">An. 1624.</note> who separating themselves from the publick Assemblies kept

                     </gap>es.</note> and went so far as to oppose publickly the order established
for receiving the holy Communion. The leader of those was <hi>William Rigge</hi>
elected one of the Bailiffs for that year. This man puffed up with a conceit of his
own abilities did dream of no lesse, then the overturning of the Church orders, and
reforming of the Ministery in such things as he held to be amisse: hereupon in a
meeting ordinarily kept before the celebration of the holy Sacrament, he did
publickly challenge Doctor <hi>William Forbes,</hi> who was afterwards preferred to the
Bishoprick of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for divers points of doctrine, delivered by him in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and when as he refused to be judged by him and the Laicks that assisted, the
said Baliffe did openly threaten them all, that unlesse they returned to the old
form of ministring the holy Communion, the whole people should forsake them.
Herein he was assisteed by <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> an Apothecary, <hi>Iohn Dickson, William
Thomson, Iohn Meene,</hi> and some other base companions, who being called before
the Councell were charged to leave the Town, and the Bailiffe <hi>William Rigge,</hi>
deprived of his Bailiwick and declared incapable of any publick office in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>This trouble gave occasion of setling the state of that Church in a better case
then in former times, <q>the Ministers being ordained to reside in their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
and have allowed to them a sufficient maintenance; the popular election of
Ministers, when as places by any occasion fell void, discharged, and the presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appointed to be made by the Provost, Bayliffs, and Councell; the Sessions
to be choosed yearly by the Magistrates and Ministers for the particular Parishes,
who should convene every year, some ten daies after the election of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
for that business; the meeting before the Communion wherein the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
were accustomed to be censured by the people, simply prohibited: with
divers other particulars serving to the orderly ministration of all things in the
Church.</q>

a Nobleman of rare gifts, and fitted for the greatest affairs, which he shewed at
his deputation to the Parliament 1621, and at other divers occasions: his death
was the more grievously taken, that it was thought it was procured by poyson,
whereof the monstrous swellings in his face and body afore his death gave great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance:
his corps brought to <hi>Scotland</hi> by sea was interred at <hi>Hamilton</hi> with his

the Marquis was dead, he said, <hi>If the branches be thus cut down, the stock cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
long;</hi> which saying proved too true, for shortly after he fell into the feaver
that the Physitians call <hi>Hemitritaeam,</hi> a dangerous feaver to those that are grown in
years, and thereof died at <hi>Theobalds</hi> the 27 of <hi>March</hi> being Sunday about twelve of
the clock in the forenoon. The Thursday preceding his death, he desired the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                  </hi> wishing all men to doe the like when they were visited in that
sort. From that time to the hour of his death, he was still almost praying, and some
one sentence or other of piety ever in his mouth. As he drew neer to his end, the
prayer usually said at the hour of death being ended, having repeated once or twice
these words, <hi>Veni Domine Iesu,</hi> he gave up the ghost without any pangs, as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
seen in persons that are dying. He was the <hi>Salomon</hi> of this age, admired
for his wise government, and for his knowledge of all manner of learning; for his
wisdome, moderation, love of justice, for his patience and piety, (which shined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all his other virtues, and is witnessed in the learned works he left to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)
his name shall never be forgotten, but remain in honour so long as the world
indureth. We that have had the honour and happiness many times to hear him
discourse of the most weighty matters, as well of Policy as Divinity, now that he is
gone, must comfort our selves with the remembrance of these excellencies, and
reckon it not the least part of our happinesse to have lived in his daies.</p>

            <p>IT may concern the ease of the Reader to observe, that care was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
so strictly to follow the Authors own Copy, that it was not
thought fit to change those words of the Scottish Idiome, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the Reader will meet with in this History: Most of them are of
<hi>Latine origination,</hi> and therefore will not be matter of difficulty to very
many. And lest for want of caution any should be inclinable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Printers care, it was thought necessary to prepossess him with
this advertisement: The rest that have escaped his diligence, the present
Table of <hi>Errata</hi> will represent to be objects of his care, to amend;
and of his Charity, to pardon.
