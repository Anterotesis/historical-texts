            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Laſt Speech of Coll. <hi>Richard Rumbold,</hi> with ſeveral Things that paſſed at his Tryal, <hi>26 June, 1685.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ABout 11 of the Clock he was brought from the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to the Juſtices Court, in a Great Chair, on Men's Sholders; where at firſt he was asked ſome Queſtions, moſt of which he anſwered with Silence; at laſt ſaid, <q>He humbly conceived, it was not neceſſary for him to add to his own Accuſation, ſince he was not ignorant they had enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to do his Buſineſs; and therefore he did not deſign to fret his Conſcience at that time with Anſwering Queſtions.</q> After which, his <hi>Libel</hi> being read, the Court pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in uſual manner; firſt asking him, <hi>If he had any thing to ſay for himſelf before the Jury cloſed?</hi> His anſwer was, <q>He owned it all, ſaving that part, of having Deſigned the King's Death; and deſired all preſent, to believe the words of a Dying Man; he never directly nor indirectly intended ſuch a Villany; that he abhorred the very thoughts of it; and that he bleſſed God, he had that Reputation in the World, that he knew none that had the Impudence to ask him the Queſtion; and he deteſted the thoughts of ſuch an Action; and he hoped all good People would believe him, which was the only way he had to clear himſelf; and he was ſure, that this Truth should be one day made manifeſt to all men.</q> He was again asked, <hi>If he had any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:34529:2"/>
                  <hi>againſt the Jury?</hi> He anſwered, <q>No; but wished them to do as God and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Conſciences directed them.</q> Then they withdrew, and returned their Verdict in half an hour, and brought him in <hi>Guilty.</hi> The Sentence followed, <hi>For him to be taken from that Place to the next Room, and from thence to be Drawn on a Hurdle, betwixt Two and Four of the Clock, to the Croſs of</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>the Place of Execution, and there to be Hang'd, Drawn and Quartered.</hi> He received his Sentence with an Undaunted Courage and Chearfulneſs. Afterwards he was delivered into the Town-Magiſtrates Hands; they brought to him two of their Divines, and offered him their Aſſiſtance upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; which he altogether refuſed, telling them: <q>That if they had any good Wishes for him, he deſired they would ſpend them in their own Cloſets, and leave him now to ſeek God in his own Way.</q> He had ſeveral Offers of the ſame kind by others, which he put off in like manner. He was moſt ſerious and fervent in Prayer the few hours he lived (as the Senturies obſerved, who were preſent all the while.) The Hour being come, he was brought to the Place of Execution, where he Saluted the People on all ſides of the Scaffold, and after having refreshed himſelf with a Cordial out of his Pocket, he was ſupported by two men while he ſpoke to the People in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Gentlemen and Brethren, It is for all men that come into the World once to Dye, and after Death to Judgment; and ſince Death is a Debt that all of us muſt pay, it is but a matter of ſmall moment, what way it be done; and ſeeing the Lord is pleaſed in this manner to take me to himſelf, I confeſs, ſomething hard to Flesh and Blood, yet, bleſſed be his Name, who hath made me not only Willing, but Thankful for his Honouring me to lay down the Life he gave, for his Name; in which, were every Hair in this Head and Beard of mine a Life, I should joyfully ſacrifice them for it, as I do this: And Providence having brought me hither, I think it moſt neceſſary to clear my ſelf of ſome Aſperſions laid on my Name; and <hi>firſt,</hi> That I should have had ſo Horrid an Intention of Deſtroying the King and his Brother.</q>
               </p>
               <p>[Here he repeated what he had ſaid before to the Juſtices on this Subject.]</p>
               <p>'It was alſo laid to my Charge, That I was Antimonarchial.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It was ever my Thoughts, That Kingly Government was the beſt of all, Juſtly Executed: I mean, ſuch as by our Ancient Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, a King and a Legal Free-choſen Parliament. The King having, as I conceive, Power enough to make him Great, the People alſo as much Property at to make them Happy; they being as it were contracted to one another: And who will deny me, that this was not the Juſt Conſtituted Government of our Nations? How abſurd is it then for Men of Sence to maintain, That tho' the one Party of this Contract breaketh all Conditions, the other should be obliged to perform their Part? No; this Error is contrary to the Law of God, the Law of Nations, and the Law of Reaſon. But as Pride hath been the Bait the Devil hath catched moſt by, ever ſince the Creation, ſo it continues to this day with us. Pride cauſed our firſt Parents to fall from the Bleſſed Eſtate wherein they were created; they aiming to be Higher and Wiſer than God allowed, which brought an Everlaſting Curſe on them and their Poſterity. It was Pride cauſed God to Drown the Old World. And it was <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s Pride in Building <hi>Babel,</hi> that cauſed that heavy Curſe of Diviſion of Tongues to be ſpread amongſt us, as it is at this day. One of the greateſt Afflictions the Church of God groaneth under, That there should be ſo many Diviſions during their Pilgrimage here; but this is their Comfort, that the day draweth near, whereas there is but One Shepherd, there shall be but One Sheepſold. It was therefore in the Defence of this Party, in their Juſt Rights and Liberties,</q> againſt Popery and Slavery—</p>
               <p>[At which words they Beat the Drums; to which he ſaid:]</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They need not Trouble themſelves; for he should ſay no more of his Mind on that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34529:2"/>
Subject, ſince they were ſo diſingenious, as to Interrupt a Dying Man, only to aſſure the People, He adhered to the True <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> deteſting the Erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of many that called themſelves ſo; and I Dye this day in the Defence of the Ancient Laws and Liberties of theſe Nations: And though God, for Reaſons beſt known to himſelf, hath not ſeen it fit to Honour Us, as to make Us the Inſtruments for the Deliverance of his people; yet as I have Lived, ſo I Dye in the Faith, that He will ſpeedily Ariſe for the Deliverance of his Church and People. And I deſire all of you to prepare for this with ſpeed. I may ſay, This is a Deluded Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vail'd with Ignorance, that though <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> be riding in upon them, do not perceive it; tho' I am ſure there was no man born marked of God above another; for none comes into the World with a Saddle on his Back, neither any Booted and Spurred to Ride him; not but that I am well ſatisfied, that God hath wiſely ordered different ſtations for men in the World, as I have already ſaid; Kings having as much Power as to make them Great, and the People as much Property as to make them Happy. And to Conclude; I shall only add my Wishes for the Salvation of all men, who were created for that end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After ending theſe words, he prayed moſt fervently near three quarters of an hour, freely forgiving all men, even his greateſt Enemies, begging moſt earneſtly for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of <hi>Sion</hi> from all her Perſecutors, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rticularly praying for <hi>London, Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Dublin, from which the Streams run that Rule God's People in theſe three Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being asked ſome hours before his Execution,</hi> If he thought not his Sentence Dreadful? <hi>He anſwered,</hi> He wished he had a Limb for every Town in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>

               <p>IT may be expected, that I should ſay ſomething at my Death, my Birth and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being near this place. My <hi>Parents</hi> inſtructed me in the Fear of God; and <hi>I</hi> now Dye of the Reformed Religion; alwayes being inſtructed in that Belief, that if <hi>Popery</hi> should return into this Nation, it would be a Great Judgment. I Dye in expectation of Pardon of my Sins, and Acceptation with the Father, by the Imputed Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>He being the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> I thank God through Chriſt Jeſus, I depart under the Blood of Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>that ſpeaketh better things than that of</hi> Abel; God having made this Chaſtizement an Ordinance to my Soul. I did as little expect to come to this place upon this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as any perſon in this Nation; therefore let all learn not to be High minded, but Fear. The Lord is a Sovereign, and will take what way he ſeeth beſt to Glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his poor Creatures; therefore I humbly deſire to ſubmit to his Will; praying of him, That in Patience I may poſſeſs my Soul-</p>
               <p>The Crime was, my Entertaining a Non-Conformiſt Miniſter, which is ſince ſworn to have been in the <hi>Duke of Monmouth's Army.</hi> I am told, if I had not Denyed them, it would not have affected me: I have no Excuſe, but Surprize and Fear; which I believe my Jury muſt make uſe of to Excuſe their Verdict to the World. I have been told, <hi>That the Court ought to be Council for the Priſoner:</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Advice,</hi> there was <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> given from thence, which (though it was but Hear-ſay) might poſſibly affect my Jury. My Defence was ſuch, as might be expected from a Weak Woman; but ſuch as it was, I never heard it repeated again to the Jury.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:34529:3"/>
But I forgive all perſons that have Wronged me; and I deſire that God will do ſo likewiſe. <hi>I</hi> for give Coll. <hi>Penraddock,</hi> although he told me, <hi>He could have taken thoſe Men before they came to my Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what may be expected for my Conviction, That I gave it under my hand, that I diſcourſt with <hi>Nelibrop;</hi> that could be no Evidence to the Court or Jury, it being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Conviction and Sentence.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge his Majeſty's Favour in Revoking my Sentence; and I pray God he may long Reign in Mercy as well as Juſtice, and that he may Reign in Peace, and that the True Religion may Flourish under him.</p>
               <p>Two things <hi>I</hi> have omitted to ſay, which is, That I forgive him that deſired to be taken from the <hi>Grand Iury,</hi> and put upon the <hi>Petty Iury,</hi> that he might be the more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nearly Concerned in my Death. And return Humble Thanks to God, and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Clergy, that Affiſted me in my Impriſonment.</p>

               <p>A little after he ſaid, <q>Never did any poor Creature come to God with greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and Aſſurance of Acceptance with Him, through Jeſus Chriſt, than I do; but it is through Jeſus Chriſt; for there is no other Way of coming to God, and finding Acceptance with him, but through Chriſt: <hi>There is no other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Name under Heaven, whereby we can be ſaved, but by the Name of Ieſus.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſpeaking to the Officers, he ſaid; <q>Labour to be fit to Dye; for I tell you, you are not fit to Dye: I was not fit to Dye my ſelf, till I came in hither; but, O! bleſſed be God, he hath made me fit to Dye, and made me willing to Dye in a few Moments: <hi>I</hi> shall have the Fruition of Jeſus, and that not for a Day, but Forever; I am going to the Kingdom of God, where I shall enjoy the Preſence of God the Father, of God the Son, and of God the Holy Spirit, and of all the Holy Angels; I am going to the General Aſſembly of the Firſt Born, and the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect: O! that ever God should do ſo much for me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Officer going to Tye his Hands, he ſaid, <q>What! muſt I be Tyed then Well a Brown Thread will ſerve the turn; you need not Tye me at all; for I shall not ſtir from you; for, I thank God, I am not afraid to Dye.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As he was going out, he ſaid, <q>Farewel <hi>Newgate;</hi> Farewel all my Fellow-Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners here; the Lord Comſorr you, and be with you all,</q>

               <opener>
                  <salute>Deareſt Parents, and Ever-loving Brothers, and Tender-hearted and Beloved Siſters:</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THrough the infinite Goodneſs of God, the nearer I approach my End, the more Joy and Comfort I find in my Suffering Eſtate (if I may ſo call it) I can through Mercy ſay, That I have found more true Delight and Comfort this Night, than in all the Dayes and Nights of my whole Life? and I hope the Lord will continue it, that his Name may be Glorified by me the meaneſt and pooreſt of all his Servants; and I hope (through Free Grace) he will keep me Faithful to the end. My Soul is ſo ravished that I can hardly write; and my Joyes are more unſpeakable, than ever my Fears were.</p>
               <p>I did this Night ſee my deareſt Brother and Companion Capt. <hi>Alovff,</hi> and his Face to me was as the Face of an Angel; and he gave me that Comfort, that I cannot but ſay, that my Love to him is beyond what-ever I had to the deareſt Relation.</p>
               <p>When God blows, every thing hath a Beauty and Luſtre upon it; here is an Anſwer of Prayer, and ſuch an Anſwer as (deareſt Relations) muſt ingage you all to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the performance of that Duty, which, like <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Ladder, though it flands upon the Earth, yet reacheth up to Heaven. Here is the Love of God made manifeſt to a poor Sinner at the Laſt Hour, like the Thief upon the Croſs, he that never knew before what the Love of God was to his Soul, I find it now filled with it, and running over. Now bleſs the Lord, O my Soul! yea, all that is within me bleſs his Holy Name for this Diſpenſation. Now Light appears out of Darkneſs in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt; and all Worldly Joy and Comforts ſeem to be as they are, not hard to be parted with; Father, Mother, Siſters and Brothers, Wife, Children, Houſes and Lands, are (as my deareſt Saviour ſaith) to be parted with for him, or we are not worthy of him: I bleſs his Name, <hi>I</hi> find no Reluctancy to do it, he having brought me to his Footſtool; and <hi>I</hi> can heartily ſay, The Will of the Lord be done in this matter. <hi>I</hi> ever before now ſaw a Beauty in Worldly Comforts, but now they ſeem ſo ſmall, by rhe great Beauty and Luſtre <hi>I</hi> ſee in God in Chriſt Jeſus, that <hi>I</hi> am Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think how <hi>I</hi> have been wandering all my dayes, and ſpending my Time and my Money for that which is not Bread.</p>
               <p>O! ſtrive to get a Taſte of this Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and it will perfectly wean you from this Deceitful and Foolish World. What are Worldly Honours and Riches? O! ſet not your Hearts upon them, but get a Treaſure in Heaven, that your Hearts may be there alſo. O! loſe no time; for if once you knew the Sweetneſs of it you would never be at reſt till you found him whom yout Soul loveth: It will be more, yea, infinitely more than all Worldly Enjoyments can afford you, though in their greateſt, perfection: It will make your Life Sweet, and your Death moſt Comfortable. It is that Bread which the World knoweth nothing of, and therefore makes little or no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after it.</p>

Deareſt Relations, whilſt you and my other dear Friends, are like <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> holding up the Hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> I am (through Grace) getting Victory over the <hi>Ama, lakites. I</hi> can imbrace my dear Companion with more Joy in this Field of Sufferings, than ever <hi>I</hi> could have done, had <hi>I</hi> met him Crowned with the Lawrels of Victory. O! the Mercy to Dye with ſuch a Friend, and ſuch a Valient Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt, who hath kept his Garments clean. And <hi>I</hi> now begin to pity them that muſt ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, who have many Temptations to encounter with. It is but a little, yea, a very ljttle while, and my Warfare will be accomplished; and if God continue his Love and Influence upon my Soul, it will be both short and ſweet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> have little of this World about me; <hi>I</hi> leave you all the Legacy of what was ever dear to me, the Beſt of Wives, and Five Poor Children, who muſt paſs through an Evil and Sinful World, but <hi>I</hi> have committed them to God, who hath commanded as, <hi>To caſt our Widows and Fatherleſs Children upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Deareſt Parents, dear Brothers and Siſters, All Adieu; my Time draws on; my Paper is finished; and your Dying Child and Brother recommends you all to Him who is All-ſufficient, to that God of Peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               <head>Mr. <hi>Richard Nelthrop</hi>'s Laſt Speech.</head>
               <p>THe Great and Unexpreſſible Trouble and Diſtraction <hi>I</hi> have lain under, ſince I came into my Troubles, eſpecially ſince my laſt Confinement in <hi>Newgate,</hi> have ſo broken my Reaſon, that for many Weeks laſt paſt, till the Day in which my Sentence was paſſed, I have not had any Compoſure of Mind; and have been under the greateſt Trouble imaginable, ſince my deareſt Wife had the Favour granted her of coming to me; but I am at preſent under great Compoſedneſs of Mind, through the infinite Goodneſs of the Lord.</p>
               <p>As to that I ſtand Out-lawed for, and now Sentenced to Dye; I can with Comfort appeal to the Great God, before whoſe Tribunal I am to appear, That what I did was in Sincerity of my Heart, without ſeeking any private Advantage for my ſelf; but thinking it my Duty to hazard my ſelf for the Preſervation of the <hi>Proteſtant. Religion</hi> and <hi>English Liberties,</hi> which I thought highly invaded, and both in great Danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Loſt.</p>
               <p>As to the Deſign of Aſſaſſinating the late King, or Murdering of him, or his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty, 'twas alwayes a Thing highly Againſt my Judgment, and which I always deteſted, and was never in the leaſt concerned with it, neither in Purſe nor Perſon, nor never knew of any Arms bought for that intent, nor did I believe there was ſuch a Deſign, nor never heard any Diſappointment of ſuch an Affair, or Arms, or Time, or Place, ſave what after the Diſcovery of the general Deſign <hi>Mr. Weſt</hi> ſpoke of, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34529:4"/>
to Arms bought by him; 'twas at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and the firſt News I heard of the Fire, was at <hi>Beverly</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to my coming over with the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> it was in proſecution of the ſame Ends; but the Lord, in his Holy and Wiſe Providence, hath been pleaſed to blaſt all our Undertakings, though there ſeemed to be a very Unanimous &amp; Zealous Spirit in all thoſe that came from beyond the Seas.</p>
               <p>And as to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s being declared King, I was wholely paſſive in it, I never being preſent at any publick Debate of that Affair, and should never have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed it, but Complained of it to Collonel <hi>Homes</hi> and Captain <hi>Patchell;</hi> I believe the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> the chief Promoters of that.</p>
               <p>As to the Temptation of being an Evidence, and bringing others into Trouble or Danger, tho' the meaneſt perſon, I alwayes abhorred, and deteſted the Thoughts of it both when <hi>I</hi> was in and out of Danger of Life, and adviſed ſome very ſtrongly againſt it, except when under my Diſtraction in Priſon, that amongſt other Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did then violently aſſault me; but through the Goodneſs of my deareſt God and Father, I was preſerved from it, and indeed, was wholely incable of doing it for want of True Reaſon; and could never receive the leaſt shadow of Comfort from it, but thought Death more elegible; <hi>I</hi> was ſometimes, during my Diſtracted and Diſquieted Condition, free from it, though notwithout other Temptations far more Criminal in the ſight of men: And <hi>I</hi> bleſs the Father of all Mercies, and God of all Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that <hi>I</hi> find a great Reſignedneſs of my Will to his, finding infinite more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Death, than ever I could place in Life, tho' on Conditions that might ſeem ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, every hour ſeeing the Will of God, in his ordering this Affair, more and more cleared up to me; God hath given, and God hath taken; bleſſed be his Holy Name, that hath enabled me to be willing to ſuffer, rather than to put forth my hand unto Iniquity, or to ſay of <hi>Confederacy</hi> with them that do ſo. <hi>I</hi> am heartily and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled for what hath happened, many mens Lives being loſt, and many Poor Diſtreſſed Families Ruin'd; the Lord pardon the Sin he hath ſeen in it; and he in his wonderful Providence hath made me and others concerned Inſtruments, not only of what is already fallen out, but (<hi>I</hi> believe) in haſtening ſome other Great Works he hath to do in theſe Kingdoms, whereby he will try &amp; purge his People, and winnow the Chaff from the Wheat; the Lord keep thoſe that are his Faithful to the End.</p>
               <p>As to my Faith, <hi>I</hi> neither hope nor look for any Mercy, but only by the Free Grace of God, by the Application of the Blood of Jeſus, my deareſt and only Saviour to my poor ſinful Soul.</p>
               <p>My Diſtreſſes have been exceeding great, as to my Eternal Eſtate; but through the infinite Goodneſs of God, tho' <hi>I</hi> have many heinous Sins to anſwer for, yet <hi>I</hi> hope and truſt, as to my perticuler, that Chriſt came for this very end and purpoſe, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Oppreſſed, and to be a Phyſician to the Sick.</p>
               <p>I come unto thee O bleſſed Jeſus, refuſe me not, but wash in thine own Blood, and then preſent me to thy Father as Righteous: What though my Sins be Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of a Scarlet Die, yet thou canſt make them as White as Snow. I ſee nothing in my ſelf, but what muſt utterly Ruin and Condemn me; I cannot Anſwer for one Action of my whole Life, but I caſt my ſelf wholely upon thee, who art the Fountain of Mercies, in whom God is Reconciling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the World; the greateſt of Sins and Sinners may find an All ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in thy Blood to cleanſe them from all Sin.

look upon me as Righteous; and thorow the Imputed Righteouſneſs of thy Son, he has paid the Debt, by his own offering himſelf up for Sin, and in that thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is ſatisfied, and thy Mercy is magnified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Dye in Charity with all the World, and can readily and heartily forgive all my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, even thoſe who have been Evidences againſt me: And I moſt humbly beg the Pardon of all <hi>I</hi> have any wiſe in the leaſt injured; and in an eſpecial manner, I moſt humbly ask the Pardon of the Lady <hi>Liſle</hi>'s Family and Relations, for that my being ſuccoured there one Night with Mr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> brought that worthy Lady to ſuffer Death; I was wholely a Stranger to her Ladyship; I came with Mr. <hi>Hicks;</hi> neither did she (as I verily believe) ever know who I was, or my Name, till I was taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if any other have come to any Loſs or Trouble upon my Account, I humbly beg their Pardon, and were I in a Condition, would as far as I was able, make them requited.</p>
               <p>Grant me thy Love, O Deareſt Father! Aſſiſt me, and ſtand by me in the Needful Hour of Death; give thy Angels Charge over me, poor Soul, that the Devil may not touch nor hurt it; defend me from his power, and deliver me from his Rage, and receive me into thy Eternal Kingdom, in and through the Attonement of my Deareſt Redeemer, for whom I praiſe thee, and unto whom, with thy ſelf and Holy Spirit, be aſcribed all Glory, Power, Might, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion forever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
