         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Being, an Anſwer to a moſt falſe and ſcandalous Pamphlet late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Publiſhed; Intituled, News from New-England, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honourable Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO I have but very lately adviſed you
of my Arrival, and given you ſome
ſhort and general Account of the State
and Circumſtance of Affairs in <hi>New-England,</hi> at
the time I left the place; which I thought might
have been ſufficient, until I ſhould have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to wait on you perſonally; but having had
the view of a certain Pamphlet lately Publiſhed
and Intituled News from <hi>New-England, &amp;c.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to give an Account of the Preſent State
of that Country, and finding the ſame ſo very
fictitious, falſe and ſcandalous, publiſhed out of
a moſt wicked deſign to vilifie and traduce ſome
Worthy Gentlemen, who have been better
Friends to our Country, than ever the obſcure
Author thereof was, or knows how to be, and
to amuſe and perplex others: I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
out of my Zeal for truth, and the love and
value I have for the Peace and Welfare of my
Country, to give you the trouble of this Letter,
to diſcover the falſeneſs of the pretended News,
and the baſeneſs and ignorance of the Author;
who without great difficulty may eaſily be gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
at, and known by his fruits.</p>
            <p>And therefore it may not be amiſs to acquaint
you, that about two years ſince, one Mr. <hi>J. M.</hi>
pretended Teacher of the Goſpel in <hi>Boſton,</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
left that place and came for <hi>London,</hi> where
of his own authority, he ſet up to be an Agent
for the Country, and uſed all the art and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
he could, during the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi>
to indear the ſame into the affection of F. <hi>Peters,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Brent,</hi> and <hi>Nevil Pain,</hi> undertaking as well
for himſelf as us to ſubſcribe to the taking off
the Penal Laws and Teſts, to ſupport the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing
Power, and to ſatisfie his own malice
and prejudice (without any ground or reaſon)
conceived againſt the then Government of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Man, as it was the Opinion of moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and conſiderate Men when I left <hi>New-England,</hi>
ſo I may very juſtly term the Author and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter
of all our miſeries, founded upon appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and wittingly deviſed Lyes and Calumnies,
carried on under pretence of Zeal and Piety, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated
into, and impoſed upon many of the
common People, hurrying them into miſchiefs
and inconveniencies now ſufficiently ſeen, felt,
and repented of; Him therefore, I will conclude
the Author of the before-mentioned Pamphlet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the falſities whereof I ſhall now plainly and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
detect, to prevent your ſelf and others being
impoſed upon by him, as many of my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and others have too lately been.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place I cannot omit to take
notice of his poſitive confidence to charge a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
granted in due Form under the Great
Seal of <hi>England,</hi> for the Government of one of
Their Majeſties Plantations, Illegal and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and that Government a Tyranny, which
was by virtue thereof exerciſed with a thouſand
times more juſtice and lenity, than when under
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46660:2"/>
the pretended Charter, Adminiſtration, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
Diſcipline, without any Authority
for the ſame whatſoever, if the Author had been
but as well acquainted with the Law, as he was
with the Declaration he refers to, (and no doubt
was the firſt contriver of) he would have been
of another judgment, or at leaſt have conceal'd
it until the Opinion of his Superiors had been
given therein.</p>
            <p>2. That the War with the <hi>Indians</hi> was begun,
as the Author there relates, or that it was ever
affirmed by the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
thereto by Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> is wholly falſe; for in
the Summer 1688, when Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> went to
receive and ſettle the Province of <hi>New-York<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> then
annexed under his Government, it ſo happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that a Party of about Nine <hi>French Indians</hi>
fell upon an <hi>Indian</hi> Plantation at a place called
<hi>Spectaclepond,</hi> near <hi>Springfield,</hi> on <hi>Connecticott</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and kill'd and carried away about Nine <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
and after coming to a ſmall Village on
that River called <hi>Northfield,</hi> they killed ſix Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and being purſued, fled; the noiſe of theſe
Murthers ſoon ſpread throughout the Country,
and notice was given thereof to all the Frontier
or Out-parts, adviſing them to be vigilant and
careful to prevent Surprize by any ſtrange or
ſuſpected <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſoon after this News came
to <hi>Saco,</hi> (a Town and River in the Province of
<hi>Maine</hi> above three hundred Miles diſtant from
the places beforenamed called by that name,)
Five <hi>Indian</hi> Men, and Sixteen Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who had always lived and planted on that
River, were ſeized on, and ſent by Water to
<hi>Boſton,</hi> ſome of whom were ſo old and feeble,
that they were forced to be carried when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore)
on others backs. On their arrival at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi>
the Lieutenant Governor and thoſe of the
Council there, examined into the cauſe of ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſending them thither; but
finding that no Cauſe was ſent with them, nor
any ground or reaſon to hold them in Cuſtody,
they returned them to the place from whence
they came, to be ſet at liberty; but before they
arrived there, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> near thoſe parts were
got to their Arms and Gariſons: Other <hi>Indians</hi>
of <hi>Ambroſcoggen</hi> and <hi>Kenebeque</hi> River, hearing
that thoſe of <hi>Saco</hi> were ſeized and ſent away;
forthwith ſurprized as many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in
<hi>Caſcobay</hi> and <hi>Kenebeque</hi> River, ſaying, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
no harm, but would keep them till the
<hi>Indians</hi> were returned: Upon the Arrival of the
returned <hi>Indians,</hi> they were ſent unto, and a
day and place agreed upon when both the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
and <hi>Indians</hi> were to be ſet at liberty, and
all to be compoſed; but the <hi>Indians</hi> not coming
at the time appointed, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> waited not for
them, but were not long gone ere they came,
and by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man and two <hi>Indians,</hi> ſent a
Letter to the next Gariſon, importing their
readineſs to deliver up the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to make
ſatisfaction for any hurt or ſpoil done by them;
who from that Gariſon were Fired upon and ill
treated, and not ſeeing how what they expected
could be anſwered, ſome of them diſcover'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Men on a Neck of Land, near the
place appointed to meet at, and endeavouring
to ſeize ſome of them, were engaged into a Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
where five of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were killed and
ſeveral of the <hi>Indians</hi> wounded, who preſently
after in rage killed two of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captives.
In this manner, and no other was the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun;
whereupon two Troops of Soldiers were
raiſed, and ſent to the aſſiſtance of thoſe parts
againſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> with Proviſion and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
neceſſary by thoſe of the Council at <hi>Boſton,</hi>
and the <hi>Indians</hi> firſt mentioned to be taken,
were again ſent back and Impriſoned, and all
in the abſence of Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> Upon his arrival at
<hi>Boſton,</hi> and being informed of the above, and
that ſuch <hi>Indians</hi> were in Priſon, a Committee
of the Council was appointed to examine, and
ſee what Grounds or Cauſe there was for their
Commitment or Detainer; and the Committee
reporting they could find none, thoſe <hi>Indians</hi>
were by order of Council ſet at liberty, to be
ſent to the place from whence they were brought
if they deſired it: As for the miſchief ſaid to be
ſuſtained by the Inhabitants there, it cannot be
imputed to thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> for it was either done
while they were in cuſtody, or ſince the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Subverſion of the Government, from
whence begins the date of our Miſeries; and I
have juſt reaſon to believe, the Author was too
far concerned therein, as is evident by his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of his Letters to <hi>Simon Broadſtreet</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46660:2"/>
of the <hi>Maſſathuſets, &amp;c.</hi> before it was
poſſible for him to know that he was ſo, or could
have any ground to believe he would be, unleſs
he had contrived or directed it.</p>
            <p>3. There was no endeavours uſed to keep the
People ignorant of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> nor were
any Impriſoned for diſperſing the Prince's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration;
which was never publickly ſeen or
known to be in <hi>New-England,</hi> till ſome time
after the Inſurrection: Tho I have heard, that
one <hi>Winſlow</hi> arriving at <hi>Boſton</hi> from <hi>Nevis,</hi> about
the beginning of <hi>April</hi> 1688. and pretending
to ſhew to ſeveral Perſons a Written Copy of
the ſaid Declaration, was ſent for before a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and being examined about the ſaid Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
denyed he had any ſuch thing; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having
himſelf contemptuouſly, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Priſon; and the next Morning produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the ſame Paper to the Juſtice, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
without any further trouble or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding;
and this was all that was acted in
<hi>New-England,</hi> relating to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s
Declaration; ſo that there was no grounds or
reaſons to ſtir up the People to Sedition, but
only the ambitious deſires and wicked inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their former Popular Magiſtrates and
Members, to ſet up their old Arbitrary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
Government, that freeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Authority of <hi>England,</hi> they
might without fear of puniſhment, break all the
Laws made for the encouragement and increaſe
of the Navigation of <hi>England,</hi> and regulating
and ſecuring the Plantation Trade, as is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
evident by the ſeveral Veſſels ſince ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from <hi>Holland, Scotland, Newfoundland,</hi>
and other places prohibited by the Acts of Trade
and Navigation.</p>
            <p>And that ſuch was their deſign, to rend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> will appear
by the free and open confeſſion of ſome well
knowing in that Conſpiracy; who have ſince
declared (before Witneſſes of undenyable truth
now here in <hi>England</hi>) that the deſign of ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> and ſubverting Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in <hi>New-England</hi> had been long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
and reſolved on, and was to have been
done the beginning of <hi>January</hi> 1688. and that
thoſe concerned in the late Revolution were
then to have acted the like parts, at which
time was no account of the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi>
intention of coming into <hi>England</hi> known in
that Land.</p>
            <p>4. It cannot be ſaid, that ever any unlawful
Levies of Money were made upon the Subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Government of Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> for all that
was raiſed in his time, was by virtue of a Law
made and practiſed for about Fifty Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which was continued and confirmed by
expreſs command, under the Great Seal of
<hi>England,</hi> for ſupport of the Government,
and was but a Rate of one Penny in the
Pound, to be annually collected by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from the Treaſurer, which thoſe who late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſumed the Government, tho without any
Lawful Power or Authority, have ſo far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that for about Six Months management,
they have cauſed ſeven Rates and an half to be
levied; and I have ſince advice that they have
ordered Ten Rates more to be exacted.</p>
            <p>5. By the Actings and Proceedings of theſe
<hi>New-England</hi> Reformers, it is eaſily to be ſeen,
what regard they had to Religion, Liberty and

of them had their Offices and Houſes broke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,

and embezelled: And when application was
made to the new aſſumed Authority, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, and other Laws
made for the Liberty of the Subject, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their Property; the ſame was denyed
with this reaſon given amongſt others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
there publiſhed in Print; that till the
unhappy time of Sir <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Government,
the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were never uſed, nor any
<hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> granted in <hi>New-England,</hi> and
therefore not to be expected then; and about
Ten Weeks after their Confinement, ſeveral of
the Chief Officers were by the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
voted not bailable, for no other
cauſe or pretended Crimes than for being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by the Crown, having therein ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and truly behaved themſelves, that none
could juſtly lay any Crime to their Charge. By
this means many ſuffered Ten Months Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
and others leſs, being turn'd in and
out of Goal, as the Arbitrary pleaſure of their
New Rulers ſhould be verbally known: In
their new Erected Courts, they have publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared, they have nothing to do with the
Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeveral of Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Subjects, have been not only Fined and
Impriſoned, by the Arbitrary Will of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
without any lawful Tryal by a Jury
of their Peers, as the Laws of the Land di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect;
but for pretended Crimes ſentenced to
Death, without any lawful Authority or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Form of proceedings, and ſome of them
Executed.</p>
            <p>6. It is very true, that ſince the Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
of the Governor, and alteration of
the Government in <hi>New-England,</hi> the whole
County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> great part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Maine,</hi> and part of the Province of
<hi>New-hampſhire,</hi> are over-run and deſtroyed by
the <hi>Indians;</hi> but the occaſion thereof has been
by that Inſurrection, and the withdrawing of
the Forces left in thoſe Parts by Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> and
deſerting the Gariſons there, which was alſo
the loſs of the Fort at <hi>Pemaquid,</hi> and above
three Hundred of His Majeſty's Subjects, and
notwithſtanding the Malice of the Author can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46660:3"/>
be the leaſt imputation on Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> who
during the time of his Government, kept the
whole Dominion from injury, ſave what was
done at firſt by ſurprizal, as by every honeſt
Man will be confeſſed, for what was done in
releaſing the <hi>Indians</hi> before mentioned, was
not an Act of Favour but Juſtice, nor done
by him alone, but with advice of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and I can ſee no reaſon, why either the
<hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be Impriſoned, or
Reſtrained of their Liberty without ſufficient
cauſe, or why if one <hi>Indian</hi> commits an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
all muſt be blamed or puniſhed for it,
tho they are things too often uſed and practiſed
by our old Charters in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither were the numbers or quality of
thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> capable of doing ſuch miſchiefs,
tho the follies and madneſs of the People ſince
their Revolution, have encouraged and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
many to be their Enemies, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their numbers, and no doubt given the
<hi>French</hi> fair advantages to come into their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>The Fort of <hi>Pemaquid</hi> was burnt by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
and the Guns ſometime after fetched
from thence, by ſome of the Forces ſent from
<hi>Boſton,</hi> and brought thither by them, ſo that
what is mentioned about the <hi>Dutch</hi> Privateer
is wholly falſe.</p>
            <p>7. As to the pretended bloody Fight, ſaid
to be between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> it was
only after this manner: A Party of about three
hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Friend <hi>Indians,</hi> under the
command of Captain <hi>Benjamin Church,</hi> being
over-night landed at a Town called <hi>Falmouth</hi>
in <hi>Caſcobay,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Maine,</hi> the
next Morning early, a Party of <hi>Indians</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two hundred came to attack that place,
who meeting with one <hi>Anthony Brackett,</hi> and
his two Sons going to his Farm, a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from the Town; they Fired and Killed
them, and by that alarmed the place; and
thereupon a Party was ſent to diſcover, who
adviſed what they were, and that they were
very near the Town; the whole number of
Men being all called together had Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
delivered them, but by reaſon of the
unſizableneſs of their Guns and Shot, they
were forced to beat their Bullets into Slugs,
which made it late before they could March
to the Enemy, who in the mean time had
the opportunity to poſt themſelves advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly
behind Fences, Hedges, Old Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and in that manner they engaged; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
about two hours diſpute the <hi>Indians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
into a ſmall ſwamp, and our Forces
left them with the loſs of Eleven Men, and
Seven wounded, of which Five after dyed;
but it was not known that one <hi>Indian</hi> was
killed: And this is all we can brag of in that
Service, which was only fortunate, in that
the Forces were there, when the <hi>Indians</hi>
came to attack the Place, which elſe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
they would have carried, tho it's believed,
had our Forces been ready early to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
and purſued the Enemy, ſome greater
advantage might have been gained, but by
late advice I am informed that Place is alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
            <p>There is little dependence on thoſe we call
our Friend <hi>Indians,</hi> for they are as great Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in the Eaſtern Country as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
will not travel or venture farther than they,
tho, being uſed to the Woods, may be quicker
ſighted to diſcover the Enemy. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the fiery Zeal of the Author and his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent,
who will not admit of a charitable
Expreſſion or Character of his ſuffering Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
but after they have been the cauſe of all
their Miſeries and Ruine, muſt expect no other
comfort from them than to be accounted and
termed Heatheniſh <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations; for
which I cannot conceive any reaſon, unleſs that
many in thoſe Parts have been differently edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
from thoſe of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and are of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Forefathers, for that very
cauſe only, were forced to remove ſo far to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
the laſh of their Perſecutors in the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſets</hi>
Colony.</p>
            <p>8. We have no reaſon to brag of our Armies
Purſuit after the Enemy, for it was never known
that any Party laſt Summer went twenty Miles
from our Settlements (or Place where they had
done us miſchief) after them, neither, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46660:4"/>
to the methods taken, would it avail if
they had; for tho they knew the <hi>Indians</hi> are in
Arms, and taking all the Opportunities to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
and deſtroy them, yet no ſuitable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was made in our out-Towns and Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
for their Security and Defence; but after
Advice given to <hi>Boſton</hi> of a Town or Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being burn'd and deſtroyed, in about a
Fortnights time an Army or Party of about
two or three hundred Men would be ſent to the
Place to ſee if it were true or not, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Indians</hi> did not ſtay for their coming;
which Army of ours, uſually abide thereabouts
till they have eaten and conſumed what ſtock
of Cattle or Sheep the <hi>Indians</hi> had left, and
then return home again.</p>
            <p>That any Captives eſcaped from the <hi>Indians,</hi>
affirm, that the <hi>Indians</hi> ſay, they are encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by ſome Gentlemen in <hi>Boſton</hi> vigorouſly to
proſecute the War, is mere Invention, and a
moſt falſe and groundleſs Imputation, unleſs
by ſuch Gentlemen in <hi>Boſton</hi> are meant <hi>Foſter</hi>
and <hi>Waterhouſe,</hi> two of their own Party, who
being of the Conſpiracy to ſubvert the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſometime in <hi>March,</hi> about a Month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſame was put in Execution, loaded
a Brigantine with Proviſion and Ammunition at
<hi>Boſton,</hi> and entered her for <hi>Bermudoes,</hi> but ſent
her to the Eaſtward amongſt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
then in actual War with us, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſupplied them therewith, when the
Governor and the Forces were out againſt them
and had reduced them to the greateſt want and
neceſſity both for Proviſion and Ammunition;
and ſoon after the Revolution, that Veſſel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from thoſe Parts with her Loading of
Bever and Peltry, which was publickly known
and talked, but no notice taken thereof, the
grievous effects of which, the Country well
knows, and are ſince very ſenſible thereof.</p>
            <p>The two Captives that laſt eſcaped and came
to <hi>Boſton,</hi> related, that by the Service done by
Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> the laſt Winter was Twelve-months,
againſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> they were reduced to that
neceſſity both for want of Ammunition and
Proviſion, that in the Spring following they
reſolved to come in and ſurrender themſelves
at Mercy, which they no doubt had done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
if the Revolution at <hi>Boſton</hi> had not
happened, the Forces being drawn off from the
Eaſtern Parts, Garriſons deſerted, and they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with Ammunition and Proviſion from
<hi>Boſton,</hi> which was the only encouragement they
had to renew and continue the War upon us,
and has much increaſed the Numbers of our
Enemies.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Mohawks</hi> (tho a ſmall) are a
warlike Nation, and have been long Enemies
to the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Canada,</hi> and now in War with
them; but that no ways affects us in <hi>New-England</hi>
any otherwiſe than as it is ſome Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the <hi>French;</hi> for thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that war
againſt us are in a direct oppoſite part of the
Country, remote from them, and can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
from <hi>Canada, Port-Royal,</hi> and <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi>
altho thoſe <hi>Mohawks</hi> endeavour to obſtruct it;
and I could never hear any Offer made by them
to that purpoſe, or that they would engage
againſt our Enemies, for we never had any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
or Correſpondency with them, to
influence them to our Aſſiſtance, they being
very remote from <hi>Boſton,</hi> and always under the
Government of <hi>New-York:</hi> but I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by Letters from Perſons of good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
at <hi>Albany,</hi> that when the Agents ſent from
<hi>Boſton</hi> to treat with the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> and renew
their Peace and Friendſhip with them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
their Aſſiſtance, propoſed the ſame, the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks</hi>
replied, That it was unneceſſary for
them to come ſo far to renew their Peace, ſince
to the <hi>Indians</hi> Knowledge, there had been no
War between them, and that they had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Words, but by Action, manifeſted their
good Heart to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> particularly to <hi>New-England,</hi>
ſince they had by means of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>New-York</hi> engaged themſelves in
the laſt <hi>Indian</hi> War, for their Intereſt, againſt
the <hi>Indians</hi> their Enemies, by which means
much Chriſtian Blood was ſaved, altho but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
notice of their Service has been taken by
thoſe who had the benefit thereof; that they
were then in War againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and
would not increaſe the number of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
until they certainly knew that thoſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46660:4"/>
Eaſtern <hi>Indians</hi> aſſiſted the <hi>French</hi> againſt them.
This is the ſum and truth of that Negotiation,
which coſt us above four hundred Pounds Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
and what Advantage or Credit we are
like to get thereby, all Men may judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>We of <hi>New-England</hi> (I find) are too apt to
boaſt of what we neither underſtand n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r have
any aſſurance of, and build too much on mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
Notions and falſe Grounds, as in this
Caſe of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. The Story about the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> Jeſuits,
and Eclipſe of the Sun, has not been heard of
or acted in any part of <hi>New-England,</hi> but, as I
am informed, is an old Story taken out of ſome
Hiſtory of the Spaniſh <hi>Indies,</hi> and only inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Author to enlarge his ſtrange News,
and fill up his Paper.</p>
            <p>But it muſt be admitted, that with thoſe
<hi>Mohawks</hi> and other <hi>Indians</hi> ſeveral <hi>French</hi> Prieſts
and Jeſuits have dwelt and inhabited, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to propagate their Religion amongſt
them, which is more than any of our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Prieſts or Teachers have done; for altho by
the Piety of our Forefathers, conſiderable Sums
of Money have been given, and a Corporation
erected for the Evangelizing of the <hi>Indians</hi> in
<hi>New-England,</hi> a very ſmall progreſs hath been
hitherto made therein; and now ſcarce any
Endeavours or proper Means uſed at all for
their Converſion, tho large Sums of Money are
annually ſent over and diſpoſed of amongſt the
Brotherhood, on that pretence, which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or thoſe chiefly concerned therein,
would do well to enquire after, now there are
ſo many of that Country here capable to give
an Account thereof, that ſo good and pious an
Undertaking may be neither neglected nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p>10. It is too true, that great Devaſtations
have been made in <hi>New-England</hi> by the <hi>Indians</hi>
ſince the Revolution there, which thoſe that
ſubverted their Majeſties Government have been
and are the ſole occaſion of; and that the Fort
of <hi>Pemaquid,</hi> a conſiderable Frontier next the
<hi>French,</hi> hath been taken, the whole County of
<hi>Cornwal,</hi> greateſt part of the Province of <hi>Maine,</hi>
and part of the Province of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
and deſerted, beſides other Miſchiefs in
the <hi>Maſſathuſets</hi> Colony within thirty Miles of
<hi>Boſton;</hi> the loſs and damage of all which, when
I left <hi>New England,</hi> was not computed at leſs
than one hundred thouſand Pounds, beſides the
loſs of above three hundred of their Majeſties
Subjects, and the whole Fiſh, Maſt, and Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Trade, and all Out-parts forced to Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>But that ſo conſiderable a Force (as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
was ſent out againſt the ſaid <hi>Indians,</hi>
is a Miſinformation; for there was not one
Man ſent from <hi>Connecticott</hi> laſt Summer, nor
had they reſolved to be concerned in the War,
tho much perſuaded thereto by thoſe of the
<hi>Maſſathuſets:</hi> and when I left thoſe Parts, and
for ſome Months before, there was not a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
out; and they have reaſon enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
an Attack from the <hi>French</hi> as well as
<hi>Indians,</hi> in the Spring, ſo ſoon as the Rivers
are open, and the Snow off the Ground;
which (by their preſent ill Management of
Affairs, want of Authority, and the many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
amongſt them) they will not be in a
poſture to reſiſt, nor to defend and ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and Country.</p>
            <p>11. I did hear before I left <hi>New-England,</hi>
that about ſixty Men were ordered to march
for <hi>Albany</hi> from the ſeveral Towns on <hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott</hi>
River; but whether they were to aſſiſt thoſe
of <hi>Albany</hi> againſt the <hi>French,</hi> or to reduce them
under the Subjection of that Rebel <hi>Leſlier,</hi> (who
by the evil Inſtigation of thoſe of <hi>Boſton</hi> and
<hi>Connecticott</hi> had uſurped the Government of
<hi>New York,</hi> which thoſe of <hi>Albany</hi> always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to ſubmit to, but continued as they were,)
was a great Queſtion, and can only be known
by their Fruits and Service.</p>
            <p>The baſe imputation, which the unworthy
Author of that ſcurrilous Paper would caſt on
Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> and other Perſons concerned in Their
Majeſties Government, I think are not worth
my taking any particular notice of, ſince both
his, and their Actions do plainly ſhew them
of whom he ſo ſpeaks to be Faithful and Loyal
Subjects: And from the whole ſcope of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in <hi>New-England;</hi> it is moſt plain that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46660:5"/>
the late Subverters of the Government had no
manner of regard to Their Majeſty's Intereſt or
Service, but when they had as far as poſſible
ruined and deſtroyed the ſame, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
obliged to endeavour their own Security
and Preſervation, which if His Majeſty doth not
ſpeedily help by ſettling of the Government,
and giving them further aſſiſtance from hence,
they are not in a condition to maintain, but
will endanger the loſs of the whole Country;
As is evident by the farther late advice we
have of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> Incurſions upon
thoſe parts, the loſs of <hi>Schenectade</hi> a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
frontier Town near <hi>Albany,</hi> and of ſeveral
ſettlements on <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> River, with about two
hundred more of Their Majeſties Subjects kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and carried away Captives, and the ſeveral
other Parties of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> we hear
are out, deſigned to fall on other parts of that
Country, and feared on <hi>Albany</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This Sir, is the true, tho miſerable State and
Condition of that Country, as can be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
made appear whenever it ſhall be inquired
into, and muſt pray your Aſſiſtance to endeavor
a Redreſs of its preſent inconveniencies, and
that we may obtain Their Majeſty's favour for
a happy ſettlement, that ſo conſiderable a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
on the proſperity of which, depends
the Welfare of Their Majeſty's other <hi>Weſt-India</hi>
Plantations, may not be ruined and deſtroyed
for want of Their Gracious Protection. Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
your Pardon for this tedious diſcourſe, I
preſume to ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>
