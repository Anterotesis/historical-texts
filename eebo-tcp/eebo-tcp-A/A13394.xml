            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing (you great Citties and your friendes and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers) since I saw all vse of my poore endeuors spared, or rather found disabilitie in them to afforde vse to the state, or person of my dread Soueraigne, or of his royall Queene, or ishew; sequestred my selfe from either sawcie intrusions or shamelesse suites; I thought I should so haue been forgotten, and might also haue been suffered without offence to forget: But so full are all thinges euery where of his Maiestie, as euen in my retiredest priuatenesse, by Subiectes who could not iudge of ought, but what the Subiect enabled them to; neither take much ioy in any thing, but in Haruestes, Mariages, and Holydayes; nor speake for much more, then Nature and the Countries vocation giues direction for: I haue been assaulted with their welcome, yet vehement endeuours, of expressing their ioyes for him; their comfortes in him; their hopes from him, their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:18757:5"/>
to him; in deed their admiration, of not onely what they see, but what they feele themselues euen warmed and comforted by, not to all men in able Iudgement visible, but euery where by some ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or other sensible: no lesse then they professe his Maiesties Proclamations to their vnderstandings notable; his caryage and manage of himselfe and his iudgement in treasons so little deserued, by Subiectes no whit iustly agreeued, taken to mercy besides all law, but that which his owne heart and vnderstanding inuentes and affoordes; not a little rare, yet very royall. Aboue all it may be, (for being last in memorie) they seeme full of a speech his Highnesse made in the beginning of the Parliament: for place in such a session; for vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, so delyuered; vpon further suite and neede thereof so reitterated; the argumentes, so gratious; for vse, so necessarie; seene euen before proofe so iudiciall; as when they of their kind could finde vnderstanding to commende, fulnesse to vtter; it so farre set on fire my spirit, to giue my selfe satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction about; as whether scorne to be ouermat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by those in that argument, or new desire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed to apprehend so glorious a world, gaue the instigation I know not; vp rose againe those spirits which had faythfully borne zeale (and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault otherways) to his Highnesse, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie knew him not; in dayes when Nobilitie treated but sparingly of him; and the time had kept
<pb facs="tcp:18757:5"/>
him in breeding in a countrey fit to make him wise and hardy, as any of his auncestours; lesse soft and delicate then many of his progenitors. Pardonable then (I hope) it shall be esteemed, if to ioyne with the rest, or salute their gratulations to him first, what came from him, comes for him: the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Subiectes wishes, the vnderstanding of many their senses, directed to acknowledge how vnworthy they are so gratious &amp; so good a King, who publikely professeth to thanke them for that, for which, God and he himselfe is to be thanked, in that he was borne, and refuseth not his ende for which: who professeth peace; feareth no warre; standeth stifly to religion with a prudent discretion; seekes vnions for vnitie; giues his owne for the Common-wealthes cause the most, and yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptes to it for what he giues: doth all things as doubting which vpon tryall are surely placed. And though my selfe be too vnworthy to explaine what his Maiesties hidden prouisions are, of those which haue open shew for his Kingdomes good; and know how neare flatterie and grosse adulation plaine deliuerie and trueth comes: yet since they be good desires in others, none ill in my selfe, which haue stirred me vp to this presumption; and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue may be as confident to challenge her owne, as Vice is apt to borrow of insinuation; I aske leaue that I represse not my thoughtes in silence, neither spare to lay them downe so insufficiently, in so able
<pb facs="tcp:18757:6"/>
an age. But yet daring no further, you may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as <hi>Dionisius</hi> made <hi>Aristippus</hi> beleeue, that his eares were in his feete, to heare with your heeles: or if the worke be not worthy to be taken vp, it can not be vile enough, if it shall not be otherwise cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, hauing loue &amp; duetie, zeale and care of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey therein, to be trodden vpon. And here in what I shall discourse, as I haue caught it by vulgar rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and remember it happely but vnfittingly for the vse should be made of it: so, if either I had had direction to write, instruction of occurrents, and priuitie to haue made right vse; my paynes should haue been imployed to haue giuen that satisfaction to this cause, which now I ayme at: and but onely for the gladnesse of the popular duety to so gratious a Soueraigne, I could not haue been thrust vpon. And herein I will not deale with my loue to them, as the Sleeper did with the Coniurer, who hauing told him, that a dreame of an Egge signified trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, sent him onely of siluer and gould (whereof he had found some quantitie) a portion of the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and put him to aske for newes of the Yolke <hi>numquid de vitello:</hi> for euen all the substaunce in my Shell, is wholly this argumentes: and the more deuoutly, since with <hi>Deiotarns</hi> our King is not building of Citties at the thirteenth houre of the day: nor with <hi>Crassus,</hi> at sixtie yeeres olde, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to march against the <hi>Partheans:</hi> but euen at his first entraunce, doth so addresse himselfe to his
<pb facs="tcp:18757:6"/>
gouernement, as all are proude at this instant, who spake well before, and they who see him now, find abilitie to speake for euer. It shall not be sayd of him, he beares his time well, as if somewhat were to be allowed to his new enteraunce; but he vseth his time well. It was <hi>Damasippus</hi> fault to giue <hi>Cicero</hi> so much aduantage, hauing bidden him to supper, as by hauing kept his Wine fourtie yeeres in his house, to be subiect to his guestes censnre, that it bore the age well. This Kinges time came when it should be vsed, and is vsed when it is come: <hi>England</hi> allured not him to it, till it sent to him for it. He hath taken a state Captiue, by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and his Maiesties good vsage of his guifts; was not taken prisoner, as <hi>Policrates</hi> was by <hi>Eurotes:</hi> Therefore he pertakes Gods blessinges not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Fates, but by direction of the Heauens. Before his Highnesse is treasure, in his comming hither: some (I hope) will finde it behinde him, if God blesse the golden Mynes in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cefellius Bassus</hi> applauded <hi>Nero</hi> for being deere vnto the Gods, as in whose time onely, Gold long time hidde, came to light. There are (I cannot denie) who are so vnhappie, as to coniecture, that some that hath seene light, is gone that way to be hidde: But neither shall fayle the vse of this Kingdome, if God blesse the ones finding, and graunt meanes to the others returning, since now the King hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that an vnion may be confirmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the only
<pb facs="tcp:18757:7"/>

Nor is it fitte that his friendes should not be vnited (I presume to call his Subiectes his friendes, as by a deare tytle, as well as humble); since better it is the King were not of agreeing harmonie in himselfe, then where his friendes were naught, the King himselfe were of good disposition. And if the difference were any, for the exchange: some haue sayd <hi>Procul a loue et a fulmine;</hi> the conuersations of Kinges haue euer been helde like the nature of the Flames, warme further of, and burning neerer.

               <hi>Zenophones Colophonius,</hi> who was called <hi>Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romastixe,</hi> in lamentation of his pouertie, told a King of <hi>Cecely,</hi> that he was scarce able to keepe two Seruantes: Yet quoth the King, he whom you rayle vpon, feedeth 10000. being dead: so are worthy men by meane ones defaced; so prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantnesse knowes not it is sawcie; so come faultie humours to be vnpunished, because not seene; and not seene, because not regarded.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> it is written, <hi>Rutilius</hi> and <hi>Scaurus</hi> had petition for a Consulship, and at last <hi>Rutilius</hi> gaue way to <hi>Scaurus.

            <p>Where was then that humanitie which <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> shewed, who being appoynted vnto <hi>Metellus</hi> his charge, because <hi>Metellus</hi> was elder and more noble in glorie, would not accept his preferment appoynted vnto him, vnlesse <hi>Metellus</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire his companie in taking share of his care?</p>

Take it not ill then (Tully) if no body at Roome woulde talke to thee of thy Quaestorship, of the news of thy cariage wherin thou thoughtst, to haue found all men full. And why should not such gifts, as they cary, be bestowed by him, who hauing long staied for power, ought now only to affect glory and good will? <hi>Priùs</hi> said Antigonus <hi>mihi opus erat potentia; nunc verò gloria et beneuolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> What other humane indeauour hath this worthy king more seriously taken in hand, then the benifiting of his &amp; the countries friends, the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cileme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the enemies of both? whereof the one, as they were made vp, partely by his loue to his country, his desire to honour it, to adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hir faln nobility, to requite such as had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued best of her, to giue many more then theyr own, since the country had so gladly giuen him his own: partly by those he brought with him, who

But howsoeuer these, some of them much vnhappy before, in this estate at this time haue all tryed the Kings Maiesties grace in their seuerall particulars: in that notwithstanding they haue beene absent from the true ioyes of their Countrey, and from the affaires in hand, they may say as <hi>Demetrius Phalerius</hi> said, <hi>heu inquieta negotia actionesque nostras quorum causa hactenus tantum viru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nosse non licuit.</hi> Well hath hee spent his time in this time who ere he was, and worthily who wrote the tractate of the vnion, wherein hee hath performed his taske, and made his worke proue his title. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good lawes hath hee giuen vs to tye the vnion by: For besides what he writes like a Philosopher lernedly, &amp; of the Kings goodnes multipliciously, let the soule of his Common-wealth be tryed, and you may easily discerne whether iudgement can, or ought recommend his worke to a Parliament, to be made an Acte of: yet since he will needes trye
<pb facs="tcp:18757:21"/>
his owne inference by his owne applications, wee will likewise examine his whole worke, by the rule of his owne inuention. And first what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science can beleeue, that he who could not be drawne to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with clannes in Scotland, would be content to abet a faction in England? These factions were of heate; and as they drew bloud; so sooner te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted the bloud made the motiues more strong, the partakers more passionate; wheras in factions cold discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can abide much pause, &amp; the time giuen for respite giues it selfe a meanes for determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. What conscience can beleeue that he who by the English bloud in a Grand mother got three kingdoms, will not as much loue the English as the Scottish, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had but preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to one? what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science can perswade it self, that he who hath ad ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced many here without desart towards himself, will not continue his honors for daily seruices for his own behoofe performed? what reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can deny that the quiet we now enioy, &amp; riches by that qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, may not both be encreased, when our kingdom shall be abroad more feareful, &amp; the more ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds shal bring the greater profits into the land? what reason can pierce into that no reason hath diued into, to take Gods prouidence away from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing, what only by his prouidence he hath setled. To a worke diuine adde not thoughts humane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can discerne that men long combined, shall not rather holde together, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men neare in oportunities held

off farre, for sleight seeming respects? And do any examples teach that richer subiects are not more fearefull of offending lawes? teach any examples, that men by nature, fight, language, condition, &amp; occasion vnited, are vnunited by vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Or teach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples that Monarchies well setled, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse any ils as they are growing? wel hath he ther fore taught you to settle preuention, where dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiquely ye gouerne not. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; Spaine haue their moments to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into this our owne is to be looked. The one he tels you hath a custome, the other a pretext against Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: &amp; shal England refuse aide against them &amp; all others, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ordinarily &amp; extraordinarily offers it not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> increase, none helps England; be thou my countrey vnthankful; care not if Scotland stand as Ireland fell; disvnite Wales, as not needing it; seek abroad for friends, though they be Turkes; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine others quarrels to preserue your own safeties; set vp gariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againe; make new Lords of Marches; draw more from the rich, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore what they only haue; acte or exact, as if it were the last acte: liue as poore as Spaine, yet haue none Indies; as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine as Italy, but lesse friended and fruitfull; desire helpe one day, who may giue helpes now; cry out then when your own haue lost you, &amp; they who are vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, shall not know your language. Then may you war like the Switzers, when other Countries, who haue imbraced what you refused,
<pb facs="tcp:18757:22"/>
shall enioy with scorne of you, what you held, and might haue held before them, and them to either in dearenes, or at their deere rate. My natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, I craue pardon for my boldnesse, zeale hauing transported me as farre into passion of after suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses to be doubted, if this stand thus doubtfull; as I hope it is to their surmises euent, who deeme that for want of issue in this Kings loyne, the two Countries may againe be seperated, though this now be embraced. But let me be tryed whether I perswade honest things, &amp; I hope my vehemency shall not be imputed faulty. Soone do they breake vpon fit occasion, who are too soone repelled for no knowne cause. Why should not we wish them so wel as our Lawes? why shuld we wish our selues so ill, as their not being one with vs? Many will be the marriages in time, to make our Nations ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one: as many are the houses, they bring in with them of our own. What was it made the Romans and the Sabines friends, but the Romanes getting to wiues the Sabines daughters? they tooke them by violence, these haue opportunitie for loue: and thinke you we shal spare to goe for marriages into Scotland, when their daughters shall bee rich to maintaine vs in England? Thinke you many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand occasions will not make vs enterchange, if this one occasion had but made the Kings roade to the rest. Be of courage therefore honourable Cities, and your friends of all qualities, and bee what you
<pb facs="tcp:18757:22"/>
are; such an Iland as were a world to you, knew you no part of the world besides. Be what you are, and desire nothing rather to be <hi>Quod sis esse velis nihil que malis:</hi> Knowe this rather to be done, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, finished aboue, not imperfect beneath; all else howsoeuer seeming, more vncertaine then this yet not appeared. Let the honestie of this cause in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice you, the honour moue you, the profit snatch you to it.

Better is that borne a great deale whereof men are ashamed, then that whereof they repent. If any should thinke it a shame to loose the name, let him know their helpe lost would make vs more repent: The people to be called by the name of the Countrey is but <hi>Cognatum vocabulum rei.</hi>

            <p>Now is this vnion on foote; much hath beene said therein; much written thereupon; Our Kinges affection is setled thereto. All these will do hurt, if this now do not good.

Shal we then haue receiued this Nation with applause? honored the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our high Counsell of the Kings estate, and of the estate of the Kingdome? admitted them dignities? admitted them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in titles, in possessions? receiued them with loue into our houses? crepte at their knees in the English Court? haue put our money into their pockets? put them into our fortes, strengthes, &amp; Castles, and shall wee now make <hi>meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:18757:23"/>
man did in <hi>Terence, Hos nisi mors nobis adimet nemo;</hi> Let vs in name and vertue be the same: let the good of both ioyne together, and the good of both put downe the ill of either. Some who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer iudged aright what it was to liue so vnited, may rashly say they had rather dye then bee vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>He was but an young man in <hi>Terence,</hi> who vsed that perswasion for his affection onely, <hi>emori ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim:</hi> but an olde man gaue this counsell out of long experience, First learne what it is to liue; if then that life displease, when thou knowest it, thou mayest bestowe this on thy selfe which thou now chusest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> framed a definition of a man, that he was a liuing creature, going vpon two feete, and without feathers: which definition was mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by shewe of a Cocke, his feathers pulled off: But the Authour of the tractate of the vnion, hath giuen this man, if you will hence deriue him, foure legges to walke on.</p>
            <p>So strongly therefore vnderset, hee aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured that discourse, knowing belike, that the perswasion of iust thinges pleased the Gods; and that the people of Athens would not kill <hi>Phocion,</hi> if they repented a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>Mildly they yet proceed, for they cal his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:18757:24"/>
his wit rather giuing a backward commendation of his labour spent, then the cause, vse of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in behalfe thereof. Sure hee was some great Councellor who gaue the King that aduice, that he should not liue out of his Countrey wherein he was borne, and from it (that was not to let his <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> be felt in it) together.</p>
            <p>What, though hee hath pleasured many of that Nation: ought the well doing of a few be his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care? Is the rewarding of his seruants, all that falles into a Kings studie? for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthes good? haue we had so much benefit by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and shall we deny them share of that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy by them? They haue bred vs a King, they haue brought him safe, they haue brought him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way perfect; of nature, good; learning great, vertues many; of issue fruitfull; and on his head a Crowne, before he came here: Matched most roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the qualitie of her bloud; gallantly for her person; and aboue all for the goodnesse residing in her royal self, &amp; her happines in her sweet issue, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from her: And shall we now vse Scotland as an olde scabbard, or a Kings cradle. <hi>Vmditius</hi> a bond—slaue in Rome, for preuenting only by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sul, the treasons of the sons of <hi>Treui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telij,</hi> and of <hi>Brutus,</hi> was not onely made free; but a law made for the freedome of all bondslaues, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lex vindicia:</hi> by which euer afterwards none of them could be taken by force, or haue violence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb facs="tcp:18757:24"/>
to them by allowance: How much rather ought we to enact some memorable record vnto posteritie, whereby this great blessing from that Nation may be acknowledged vnto it? the rather they hauing demeaned themselues so honorably, as to giue vs iust satisfaction of their valours: An excellent cause now God will haue vs friends, why we should loue entirely.</p>
            <p>This is a course fitter for vs to embrace, then our strengths refused by other aduersities, to hope of our succours. But now rather to speake a little in behalfe, and for vse of our owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, then to perswade their particular good in it. As our lawes are the best, or we must say so of them, who liue vnder them, of all Nations, whereby our kingdome is gouerned; so the ciuill lawes being no such strangers vnto them, somewhat would soone be established; whereby we might get the benefit of theirs, by the assent of ours, to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of both. Which while it is in indeuor, they by precise loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into ours, wil get reformed some abuses crept in by time, custome, or misse-interpretation; such as my Lord Chancellor in his integritie shewed daily, and diuers of the graue Iudges, and chiefely the chiefest of them, as oportunities serue, for conscience sake, do amend as they apply them, and but by such an occasion as this, will hardly euer be moted vpon.</p>
            <p>Of this argument, for agreement of both lawes,
<pb facs="tcp:18757:25"/>
(except I be deceiued) a friend of mine; and worthie to bee yours, hath very lately, verie shortly written: comparing the Grandes, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, the rules, and right vse of both, (as his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion led him) so learnedly, so fully, and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencedly together; as the two common Wealthes may soone bee taught, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing disagreeing in essence betweene them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ones substance wanting to the other, (the termes and practises onely hauing giuen the shewe of difference hitherto.) But I cannot iudge whether hee will bee iudged woorthie any great imployments, since <hi>Hanno</hi> was but vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dealt withall, who first tamed a Lion. It were pitie a Common-Wealthes man should haue more encouragement in his trauell, then his conscience of well doing.</p>
            <p>To returne to my purpose; if for many seene benefits, which wee cannot chuse but reape, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the satisfaction of our Soueraigne, no way were motiue to a heartie Subiect, there should ingrowe any inconueniences; the Kinges desire standing in heede of the Acte <hi>Trimolius</hi> the true Corinth, would take part against his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the good of the Common-Wealth. But these doubtes stands like the Mountaines <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> was asked whether at the last they would not bee water; whose aunswere was, in time they would, <hi>Tempus edax rerum, &amp;c.</hi> Time doth
<pb facs="tcp:18757:25"/>
worke what no man knoweth in the faithfull Turtle Doue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martial</hi> was very angrie with a fellowe, who would needes knowe thinges vppon supposalles, as how hee would behaue himselfe if hee were rich; and shutting him off with this aunsweare; if men can foretell how thinges shall succeede, how wilt thou behaue thy selfe, if thou becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest a Lion? <hi>Quenquam posse putas, &amp;c. Isocrates</hi> was troubled with the vncertaintie of the time, how hee might behaue himselfe, when hee might haue a boxe on the eare; for then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not else hee would weare a Helmet. This cause great Cities, and your friendes from Story writers fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away so wilde, sits now as gently by vs, as <hi>Tubero</hi> the Pretors Pye did, which came strangely to his hand, and of which the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers foretolde that much good would come with her, were shee accepted; if otherwise, much ill to the Pretor: her hee pulled in peeces, but not without his owne mischiefe.</p>
            <p>In Phrigia and Silenus was a great earthquake, which consumed many houses and mortalles; The Oracle saide, some rich thing must bee throwne into it: Death of a Kinges Sonne one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stopped the gaping of the earth in those places. Here is no earth-quake, but heauens shine: here is life and renowne to our Kings Sonne, our worthy Prince, ours and many more
<pb facs="tcp:18757:26"/>
kingdoms hope. The Oracle sayes not, dye sonne; but liue all friendly together. <hi>Tully</hi> in the dreame of <hi>Scipio</hi> saith, that all they who haue saued their Countrey, haue helped their Countrey, haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased their countrey, haue in heauen a place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them, where euerlastingly they shall ioy. That was the cause why the Ambassadors of the Carthagenians and the Sirenenses were conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make the condition of being buried quicke, where they challengd their bounds: So great was their loue to the inlargement of their Countrey; a desire euer prosecuted, and neuer but weakely by <hi>Darius</hi> in <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> his time only gaine-said, that a kingdome might be too great. On the other side remember but how <hi>Themistocles</hi> dealt with <hi>Zerxes,</hi> for the ouerthrow of al Greece, because his countrey had ingratefully respected him. And had not <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> hung vp my <hi>Hamon, Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> had beene betrayed in his owne Countrey beyond the Kings disposition, but that did I beare, though it cost me deare. As I forgiue, so I forget, and returne to this: If the English haue not generall peace, which they shall not till they bee knowne generally strong (for yet forreiners may bee suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but to prye into our state, to breake or holde, resoluing neither but by the first instructions) they will ere long grow so vnanswerable of Taskes and Subsidies, that the Collectors shall finde them, as in another common-wealth was seene, playing in
<pb facs="tcp:18757:26"/>
the streetes, a shrewd signe, that they be no money keepers. But if they once see our fortune sitting, they will then thinke she will so finde the benefit of her ease, as shee will euer be knowne where to bee found. Now is our ground ready, what seede wee sow, we shall reape. This cause talkes nothing of inconuenience, yet the man, though good, though iust, though innocent, is feared, <hi>vir bonus, iustus, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocens timetur,</hi> pouertie is pretended, saith <hi>Martiall.</hi> it is not pouertie to haue nothing. <hi>Non est paupertas Nestor habere nihil.</hi> The fault sure is this, the poore seekes friendships vnworthy affections, <hi>quòd colit ingratas pauper amicitias.</hi> Nay they haue their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar riches where they are, in as large a maner as we make account of ours here. But this is to tennice freely, but not to denise kindly. Many I see knowe how to counsell; few finde I, who can tell how to make the Consull. The King should haue long hands, as farre reaching as Kent and Kentile; and would you haue the King feed with one gloue on, &amp; another off? It would be said of him, <hi>Totus &amp; in toto per totum totus &amp; omnis, Esse omnis du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vis incipis esse tuus:</hi> that he then beginneth to be his owne, when he will be all, and in all, and by all, and all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where. And though some pretend fables, how the Wolfe, by at the first getting an house to breede in, at the last hauing many litters, helde it by strength against the owner: Yet what can these things moue in ordered co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthes, where
<pb facs="tcp:18757:27"/>
no more interest is attained, then the lawes admit right to: <hi>Tully</hi> in his pleading for <hi>Roscius,</hi> shewes how many wayes the lawes punish those, whose demaundes are greater then the lawes doe allow. The like doth <hi>Crassus</hi> in <hi>Tully.</hi> Our lawes will maintaine vs in our owne well enough; though our conditions I hope will not make them pay so deare, as the English did when they went to fetch the King and Queene from Scotland.</p>
            <p>This may be giuen to the King for them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, to them for vs; the rest they shall enioy, as the lawe will, for what they buy, by the law they may call their owne. Demurre then no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger my great and deare friendes, vpon this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, but returne this aunsweare, that <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> did by the Raine-bowe <hi>Terram esse commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> Which though he durst not defend against <hi>Iupiter;</hi> yet you haue <hi>Iupiter</hi> on your side, against whome to contend were madnesse, as with an equall doubtfull; with an inferiour base. <hi>Seneca</hi> sayth of power, that if it inuite to any thing, nay, if it intreate ought, it compelles it. Easie it is not to write against him in his gouernment, who can score a man out of his gouernment: <hi>Non facile est in eum scribere qui potest proscribere. Fauorinus</hi> the Philosopher, admitteth <hi>Hadrian</hi> the better iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because he commaunded thirtie Legions. The matter then being euen, let vs not contend vnequally, for had not nature seated this kingdom
<pb facs="tcp:18757:27"/>
within you, you might well haue helde it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you. Well had <hi>Scipio Emilian</hi> discharged this Censorship, had the Quirites giuen him a fellow Pretoorr not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him one. Think not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what <hi>Cato</hi> saith, that it is not to be marueiled at, if what a man thinkes an excellent good, he be loath to share with another: But let <hi>Plutarch</hi> teach you to gaine authoritie, and power with expedition: so neither smoake shall make the fire vnpleasant in the kindling; nor enuie lay snares to impeach glorie by in the framing.</p>
            <p>If longer you stay vpon further deliberation, this businesse hauing beene determined by the Comittee in heauen, <hi>Scipio Emilian</hi> must nedes tell the Senate, that neither of the Consules is fit for the seruice of the Common-Wealth: For <hi>Seruius Sulpitius Galba</hi> was poore, and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and <hi>Valerius</hi> could neuer thinke he had enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet since the men on both sides are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable, make their conditions as agreeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues; so fit for the Common-Wealth: let the one inioy more, the other couet lesse; so shall both encrease apace, and <hi>Rome</hi> be well serued.</p>
            <p>If any obiect their affections bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ours, that comes not out of nature, but custome. As the Ayre is tempered, sayeth <hi>Tully</hi> in his Diuination; so are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren spirited, their wittes formed, their maners,
<pb facs="tcp:18757:28"/>
their minds, their bodies, and the actions of their life. Looke in the English and Scotchmens faces: see whether <hi>Caucasus</hi> haue begot them vpon hard rockes. Our climate is the same; our temperatures alike; if any thing within our gouernment make vs differ, it is but custome. They haue not so many Cities as we; they followe feeds which we do not; yet finde I not, but we are prickers as well as they, and if it be obserued what store of Ritters we haue got, it may be feared that two Cheuallers, being not <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> may be driuen to one Chiual, to ride on besides the saddle. But let <hi>Herodotus</hi> write as much as he will of the kingdom of custome: for though <hi>Darius</hi> could not get the Grecians to eate their dead Fathers for any golde; nor the Indians to burne theirs for any iron; because of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of their vses in both: yet assure I my selfe, this Nation honours the King with so much zeale; he is able to teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with so much skill; embrace vs with so much affection, especially if wee bee once vnited in indissoluble bounds; as I knowe not any custome may be fit for them to leaue, shall not be discontinued, nor any new lawe to be put in vse, to which the first day shall not finde them accordant. <hi>Si fingere me putas, istud salutemus.</hi> They do many of them vnderstand what was <hi>Cyrus</hi> his counsell to leaue those mountaines Countries, and descend into the plaines, there with the times to change the manners, as <hi>Tully</hi> writes to <hi>Atticus,</hi> where as the
<pb facs="tcp:18757:28"/>
seedes are like the plants, the liues of men are like the countries. There shal they best learne to obey, where the King sits highest to rule: there shall they heare him clearely, where <hi>Ille regit dictis animos &amp; pector a mulcet.</hi> For this deede done none shall need to looke backe into his conscience with affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For this name taken, none shall need to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Nation to be embased: For this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome inlarged, none shall finde their owne states impaired. As touching vnion with others and their abbetments, ye may there iudge of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, among those who haue learnedly and graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuted that fourth question of the booke intituled <hi>Vindictae contra tyrannos:</hi> Wherein is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed, whether one Prince may ioyne with the subiects of an other, who take vpon them armes for defence of defending religion. My purpose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be short, shall rather insinuate my zealous wish of home-combining then forraine vses, the one naturall and politique; the other politique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone if so much; I aske your body but within your girdle; your head couered onely with your hat; your garment to be grauer then partie-coloured: and offer you <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> for examples, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by those bounds, nature her selfe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto them, the Montes, Perrenaei, the Sea, the Alpes, with the rest. Nor is it constantly held, that our name of <hi>Britans</hi> should bee deriued of <hi>Brutus,</hi> rather some hold we are called <hi>Prittons,</hi> of a
<pb facs="tcp:18757:29"/>
word which signifies a Marte or Fayre; of stuffe for which, this whole Island, as well al parts as any one part, Wales and Cornwall, as England and Scotland, is in one kinde or other replenished. Nor ought that worde of Marte seeme to haue lesse boundes then <hi>Ciuitas;</hi> which (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) signifieth a whole Common- wealth. As for our priuate goods, thogh I could answere <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica priuatis sunt anteponenda;</hi> yet let the stories bee but searched, how our forteine conquestes haue bene hindred by the opportunities the Scots haue taken in our absences; and how iealousies haue onely made vs diuersely combine our selues; they with <hi>Fraunce;</hi> wee with the house of <hi>Burgondie,</hi> they shall finde how likely it is, that priuate mens marchandize may be lost in the wracke of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall fleete. Other obiections should I goe about to frame, such as pride or curiositie might suggest vnto me; as much as I haue heard should I ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to answere, the necessary themes of some mens seeming wise; I doubt much how I could swim from out their deluge. <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, or <hi>Chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> Trough being vnbuilt against such an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Steeples stand not vp here as in the drownd countries of our lowe neighbours. There are no sea-markes appearing to direct; no castles, no forts, no citties to protect; hilles and mountaines are here ouerwhelmed, and the solutions of these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, would be the dissolution of the time spent
<pb facs="tcp:18757:29"/>
about them, and no resolution of any thing for the applying of Gods blessings to our vses; <hi>Animo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti nihil difficile:</hi> while we say all will be subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the lawes ouerthrowne, mens states taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the nations honor lost, and our dish well ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in, sliced into a gallemawfrey, ouerpeppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and salt buttered: wee spread feares, doubtes, (God grant not hatreds largely) but discusse vpon inconueniences slowly. If to forward accordes the debate of this question happen, you will finde that neither the number of the Scottishmen, forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from their countrey; nor the ambition of the Nobles, though by some thought to challenge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie before ours; neither the customes of the Nation differing from ours in whatsoeuer, wil debarre this proceeding, or not admit time and will for fitnesse. The like said of our auncient sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, of the stories auncient, of vs, of our reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affections as wee now stand for our goods, and I dare boldly say, eyther their intendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts lesse needfull, or their applications more profitable, or alterations more beneficial, will make vs more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy this mornings breakfast, then all last weekes dyet. For neither doth the King affect other then our goods; or is himselfe vnable to iudge of them; nor doubteth but that there ought much delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to bee taken in a cause so important, much circumspection touching the proportioning out the particulars. These reasons haue moued me see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:18757:30"/>
that the King is to be defended in his desire as a good father of the Common-wealth; hath spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the bloud of our good countreymen, turned ill; hath incouraged the seruices of the well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, shewes himselfe wise in his gouernment; louing in his affection, and industriously carefull of the weale publike; to take vpon me this license in writing, this zeale to my countrey in perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Which if it happen to mindes affected to let <hi>Lucilii pecus esse liberum &amp; qua velit pasci,</hi> I hope with them mine endeuour shall finde fauour: for the rest, as it no waies becomes me to be vnciuill, as <hi>Democrates</hi> was to <hi>Philip:</hi> so if they shall thinke it rather an impotencie in me, not to spare mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to this argument; then in themselues to afflict me by whatsoeuer meanes: their wisdomes are of force to giue themselues content; and this being out and past from me, and dislikte, shall make me not like to passe out more to be submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to censure. To conclude, long liue yee right honourable Citties, keeping peace in you, fiers from you, and traffique with you; so may you build your houses faire, keepe them neate, haue good store of money and bonds in your chestes; your Prentices grow free, your liueries Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, your wiues Ladies, your children made Gentlefolkes, and your Cittie commodities be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed into the Courtiers reuenewes; as at this marriage if you will daunce, you make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb facs="tcp:18757:30"/>
sure, and till death depart: For though they and you lye in one an other of your houses; nay should they and you lye with one an other of your wiues and daughters; beleeue me <hi>non concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitus sed consensus facit Matrimonium,</hi> say the Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians; Marry them and make the bond holy and vnuiolable, or expect no securitie that the grand-children in time to come, shall alwaies proue comfortable to the old folkes.</p>
