            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as we have had the same or the like Oppressions and Grievances renewed, which we pretended to be under, and so much complained of before; so there are two very ill-favoured Aggravations attend the latter, wherewith the former were no ways accompanied.

of your Place, is, That tho you insert the Names of those in your Warrants whom you would have seiz'd, yet you do not always express and specify the Crimes, for which you require them to be apprehended. Nor is this Method of your Administration less ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and criminal than the former was: For as no Title you bear, or Character you are cloathed with, empowers you to deseize any Man of his Liberty, but whom the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seizeth, nor for any Offence (how much soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it may provoke and enrage Mr. Secretary <hi>Trenchard)</hi> but that which the Law has made thereunto obnoxious; so the Commanding to apprehend Men without mentioning their Crimes, is the acting despotically, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing your Will and Passions into the place and room of Laws. It is an <hi>Axiom</hi> in our Constitution, That <hi>Corpus</hi> and <hi>Causa</hi> must go together, and where there is not that which the Law accounts the last, no man, be his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle what it will, is legally empowered to lay hands upon the other. The Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> is not <hi>Seignioral,</hi> but <hi>Royal;</hi> being a Government under which we are <hi>Freemen,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Rights and Properties; not <hi>Villains</hi> and <hi>Slaves,</hi> who have neither Right nor Property in any thing: And therefore whatsoever the Subject has a Right in, he must both be enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled peaceably and securely to enjoy it, and have a Remedy for the recovering it, if dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seized and dispossessed. And without these, it's in vain to talk of being governed by Laws, all we are and have being subjected to Will and Pleasure. But so provident is the Law in this matter, that the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Writ</hi> under his Great Seal cannot imprison a Subject, unless it shews a <hi>Cause:</hi> And were a Writ of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sent to a <hi>Sheriff</hi> to be executed, he may return it without doing what is required, and he is no ways punishable for his Disobedience or Neglect, the Writ having been void in Law. And can we imagine, that the <hi>King</hi>'s War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, issued out by a Secretary ought to have more power and efficacy by the Law, than his Writ under his Brood Seal hath? Surely, we must renounce Sense and Understanding ere we sink into such a Belief. And if the Law doth not give you a Power over our Lands and Goods, nor any Prerogative where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are vested allows you to meddle with any Man's Estate or Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels; much less can you in their Name, and by their Authority, imprison our Persons, seeing Scripture as well as Reason do assure us, <hi>That the Body is more worth than Raiment,</hi> where, by <hi>Raiment,</hi> according to all Expositors as well as the <hi>Canonists,</hi> every thing that is outward is meant, to distinguish it from Corporal. For the Common Law hath so adjusted and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed the King's Prerogative, as that he cannot prejudice any Man in his Inheritance, and the greatest Inheritance a man has, is the Liberty of his Person, all other things being subordinate and subservient to that. Yea, so tender is the Law of our Liberty, that if a Wrong be done to a Man's Person, it does not oblige him to sustain it, and afterwards accept a Remedy; This being a Rule in Law, That <hi>Corporalis Injuria non receipt Estimationem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e futuro,</hi> that <hi>no Damages recovered by the Injured Person are a sufficient Recompence for a Wrong that is Corporal.</hi> And therefore, where the Law doth not deseize a Man of his Liberty, and render him imprisonable, it makes many things lawful in Defence of it, which otherwise would in some particulars be Trespasses, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers very heinous Offences. Accordingly, it is a <hi>Maxim</hi> in the Law, <hi>Quod quis ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How often does it come to pass, that a Matter which the Law makes no Offence, may give more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to a Minister of State, than that which it declares and publishes a heinous Crime? Must he therefore be allowed to wreck his Spleen in punishing the former, more than he does imploy his Justice in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stising the latter? For example, Should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one write a <hi>Satyr</hi> on the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the Wit and Acrimony that <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Arbiter</hi> writ one upon <hi>Nero</hi>'s Court, there are few Punishments so severe but the Law would adjudge the Author to them.

seasoning which may make it palatable to the Age, the Law would render this no Crime, nor subject the Writer to any Penalty; and yet some think, that such a History would more provoke and enrage the Government, as well as render it more ridiculous and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, than all the <hi>Satyrs</hi> in the World would. So that when your Ministers are most angry, there is not always the most legal cause for it. And therefore, if the reasons of every Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and Commitment be not declared in the Warrant, a Man may be treated as a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor against K. <hi>William,</hi> and a Conspirator to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the Government, when at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom all that the Gentleman is taken up and thrown into Prison for, may be only a piece of Banter upon the <hi>Green-Ribbon Secretary,</hi> or a Lampoon upon the mighty States-man, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the Politicks by the Degrees he took at the <hi>Rose-Club.</hi> For it is not your knowing my Name, and the inserting it into a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that gives you a Right over my Person and Freedom, but my being chatged with some Offence, for which the Law has made me forfeit my Freedom, and rendered me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonable. And if my Offence were not to be expressed in the Warrant, I might come to lose my Liberty, tho' innocent of any Crime against the State, merely for being thought to know too much of the Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Bribery of certain Ministers, which an observing Person must shut his Eyes, and stop his Ears, as well as avoid all Conversation, to remain long a stranger unto. In a Word, we hold not our Liberties by Law, but preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, and at the Discretion of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and are no more Freemen but Slaves, if we were not to be told why we were stript and divested of them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But I proceed to a <hi>Fourth</hi> Instance of your violation of the Laws in the Administration of your Office, which is, That when you hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your self to assign the Offences for which you order Men to be apprehended, you fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently alledge and insert in your <hi>Warrants, those Matters for Crimes</hi> which the Law does no way account <hi>sufficient either for the seizing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any.</hi> Actions are stubborn and unpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Things, which it is in the Power of none to alter or raise the value of beyond what the Law has set them at, and stampt them for. So that tho you may make <hi>Dutch Skillings,</hi> which are not intrinsically <hi>worth Two Pence,</hi> to pass for an <hi>English Six Pence,</hi> yet you must not think of doing so by Actions, tho really offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; and render that Treasonable, which is but an Undecency or at the most a Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. To piss at <hi>White-Hall-Gate</hi> may draw the Guard upon one till he has paid his Six-Pence, which tho he be not obliged to do, yet he is willing to bestow, rather than draw a Crowd about him and be houted at; but it were to push such a matter too far, to send the Man to <hi>Newgate</hi> or to the <hi>Gate-house</hi> for it: And yet I am very apt to believe, that should you produce it as an <hi>Overt-Act,</hi> whereby to prove the Person guilty of having designed to


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59017:7"/>
murder K. <hi>W,</hi> or to blow up the <hi>Tower,</hi> you might have some <hi>London Juries</hi> that would both find the Bill and convict him upon it. Tho you be priviledg'd to bestow upon your own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (whether begotten in Wedlock or out of it) what Names you please, yet you are vested with no Right of giving other Titles to Men's Actions than what the Law has conferr'd and fastened upon them. And to speak plainly, your committing Persons (as the usual Tenour of your Warrants run) upon pretence of their having <hi>been Aiding and Assisting to K.</hi> William's <hi>Enemies,</hi> without the condescending to mention the Particulars wherein, which you seldom vouchsafe to do, are no legal Commitments, but highly Arbitrary. For besides, That the Law admits no Man to be divested and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seiz'd of his Freedom upon general and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Allegations, without mentioning at the least the <hi>Species</hi> of the Crime, if not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Act; so there are innumerable Cases, wherein a Person very Loyal to this Government may be aiding and assisting to K. <hi>W</hi>'s Enemies, and in the mean time be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guilty of Treason nor Misdemeanour. For suppose I were indebted to a Banker or a Merchant in <hi>Paris</hi> the Sum of Ten Thousand Pounds for redeeming my Wife and Children, and ransoming four or five Ships from <hi>Jamaica</hi> or <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> on which my whole Estate and Fortune had been imbarqued, which through the Neglect of the Government to protect our Navigation and Commerce, had been taken by <hi>French Privateers,</hi> whilst our Fleet was fooling away a Campaign, and squandring the Treasure of the Nation upon the impracticable Expeditions of <hi>Bombing Brest</hi> and <hi>Callice,</hi> and <hi>blowing up Dunkirk</hi> by your <hi>Machine Vessels;</hi> this were an aiding K. <hi>W</hi>'s Enemies, as well as a relieving my self: And yet it would be so far from being any sort of Crime, that it were a Duty I ow'd my Family, as well as a Justice to my Creditor. Or suppose, that a General Officer in our Army, thro staying too long in the Field to cover the Escape of K. <hi>W.</hi> and to facilitate the Flight or Retreat of our Troops at the Battle of <hi>Landen,</hi> and thereby coming to be wounded, made Prisoner, and carried to <hi>Namure,</hi> where, by <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s Order, he was better treated than he would have been at <hi>Brussels,</hi> should, in Recognition of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Care that was taken of him, and in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for the noble Entertainment he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, send to the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> at the beginning of this Campaign, 2 or 3 of the best Horses he could purchase for Money; this were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be aiding and assisting to the King's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and yet none will believe it criminal, and much less a treasonable Offence, unless they be both furnished with your Morals, and enriched with your Law and Politicks. Let us put the Case, That one of the <hi>French King</hi>'s Physicians, or some other near his Person and extreamly in his Confidence, should offer to poyson him, provided K. <hi>W.</hi> or the <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of the <hi>Treasury,</hi> would promise to pay them a Sum of Money; most Insallibly, the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering this to <hi>Lewis Le Grand,</hi> would be an aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and assisting the only Person in the World whom K. <hi>W.</hi> thinks most his Enemy: And yet no Man of Sense, Honour or Vertue, would account it a Crime; seeing the <hi>Roman Consuls</hi> detecting the like to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> when in actual War against the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the very Bowels of their Countrey, was so far from being esteemed an Offence against the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it had both the Praise of that People then, and the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Nations and Ages since, of being a noble, brave and vertuous Action. Or suppose, That some of our almost ruined Merchants, and particularly Mr.—who lost <hi>Shares</hi> and <hi>Cargoes</hi> in 23 several Ships, which the <hi>French</hi> have taken, notwithstanding the utmost Care both of our <hi>Royal Navy,</hi> and our <hi>three and forty Cruisers,</hi> appointed by Act of Parliament to secure and preserve our Trade, I say, suppose that such Persons shall (after the Pattern of the Merchants of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam)</hi> make themselves <hi>Freemen</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of <hi>Stockholen</hi> or <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and in that Quality freely and boldly trade with <hi>France,</hi> this would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be an aiding and assisting of the King's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but the running counter to an express Act of Parliament, that makes it highly cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; yet I do not think that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would do wisely to call it Treason, and to prosecute it as any manner of Crime: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less our Ministers have a Mind to sacrifice the whole Nation to the Interest of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and be embarqu'd in a design of breaking the <hi>Exchange</hi> of <hi>London</hi> to enrich those of the <hi>Seven Provinces.</hi> For whatsoever our Law doth make it, yet you cannot be ignorant,

that it was within those few Years accounted to be in the power of <hi>British</hi> Subjects to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their Allegiance to <hi>Foreign States,</hi> this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been not only done, but justified in Print by an Eminent Divine, and as Famous a Man, now dignified at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who under that Plea, Covert and Protection, not only corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponded with the Enemies of his natural Prince, but plotted and conspired the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and barest-fac'd Treasons against him. And it were worth our knowing, whether he were not preferred to a Bishoprick upon the Merit of being subject to the <hi>States-General;</hi> and whether he doth not sit in the House of Lords (where he pretends to have a mighty Influence over Debates) under the Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Allegiance he swore to those <hi>High and Mighty.</hi> But may be he has a peculiar Priviledge, which other People claim not, of renouncing and re-assuming his Allegiance as his Interest guides him; and that our Laws are as pliable to that learned Man's Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies as his own Conscience is.

So that instead of discharging your Duty and Office in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter according to Law, you set up to play tricks, in order to clude the Laws, illude the Nation, and oppress free-born Subjects, and that of equal Quality and Education with your self; for which it is hoped, both You, and such of K. <hi>W</hi>'s Councel at Law as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, as well as Mr. <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> will ere long be made accountable. And the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament having, in their former Meeting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to take notice of this irregular and illegal committing of Persons, upon Pretences of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aided and assisted the Enemies of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when the Practice neither reached to so many as it now does, nor was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with so much Scandalousness; I shall therefore refer both the further Enquiry into it, and the inflicting those suitable Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it which it deserves, to the next <hi>Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of the <hi>Two Houses;</hi> where it is little to be doubted, but that the Dishonour and Misery which the Kingdom is sunk into, will in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of your <hi>Rich's</hi> and <hi>Clarks,</hi> awaken them to be more careful of our Lives and Liberties, as well as of the old <hi>English</hi> Constitution, than their giddy Zeal, or at least an intemperate and <hi>Mobbish</hi> Noise, have allowed them hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to rhink of, with the Circumspection and Prudence which become them, in reference to themselves, their Countrey and Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>And therefore I advance to a <hi>Fifth</hi> irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and arbitrary thing, in the manner of your seizing and committing the free-born Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> which is, That when you have both published the Names of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom you would have taken, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Crimes for which you authorise your Messengers to apprehend them, yet you do not always declare, as you ought, that the legal Transgressions for which you make them imprisonable <hi>were sworn and deposed upon Oath before you.</hi> For it is not enough, that such and such things are sworn, but it ought to be express'd in the Warrant, that they are so. And be your personal belief of their Guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of such and such Facts never so well grounded, and be your Credit as good as any can imagine or desire, to reconcile the Faith of others to what you say, yet the Rule, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Prescription of the Law are to be


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59017:8"/>
obeyed and attended to; and the Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly requires, that you should not only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your Warrants, that you are informed of such a Persons having committed those and those criminal Offences; but that you have the whole Matter, with the enhauncing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of it, <hi>deposed upon Oath before you,</hi> For so tender is the Law of the Subject's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, that it will not have it depend upon, or be forfeltable upon the most credible Man's Accusation, tho of never so heinous a Crime, unless he both can and do actually swear to it. Nay further, Our Freedom is of that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, value and esteem in the eye of the Law, that it will not allow a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's being diseized and divested of it upon the single Oath of any one, tho never so great and honourable; but it expresly requires that there should be more, and that at the least there should be <hi>Two.</hi> 'Tis true, that a Man is liable to be taken up and brought before a Secretary of State, or any other Officer of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, upon <hi>one</hi> Oath; but there must be no less than <hi>Two,</hi> in order to confine and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son him, and to preclude him from the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Bail: Yea, <hi>Treason</hi> it self, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est that can be imagined, sinks into bare <hi>Misdemeanour,</hi> when there is but <hi>one</hi> Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny upon Oath against the Offender; and that which is in it self Capital, becomes in such a ease obnoxious only to lesser and and more trivial Punishments. I do mention this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of what was perpetrated by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the present Government, <hi>An.</hi> 1692. when so many Persons of all Ranks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the Nation were apprehended and committed without any Deposition upon Oath against them, or at the most upon a <hi>single one.</hi> And when some of the first Quality of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> after they had made their Application to the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> in order to be Bail'd, were remanded back to Prison upon Mr. <hi>Aaron Smith</hi>'s deposing that he had Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against them; whereas it appeared by the Issue afterwards, that the most he had (if that) against any one of them, was a single and individual Witness; which is no evidence for the detaining of Men, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of them from the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, because not legal and according to what the Laws of the Land do require. And it hath very much detracted from the Reputation, Justice and Honour of the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> that they tamely connived at such an Injury done unto, and Affront put upon their Honourable Fellow Members, and that they did not both imprison the presumptuous and daring Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and order him to be prosecuted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the utmost Rigour of the Law, or at the least, that they voted him not to be for ever uncapable of serving the Government in any Place or Capacity whatsoever. But we hope they are by this time grown more sensible of their own Dignity and Jurisdiction, as well as what they owe to the Kingdom, the ancient <hi>English</hi> Constitution, and Generations to come: So that they will treat him otherwise the next time he is handed unto and staged before them, which will speedily be done, if for nothing else, yet for the <hi>Bills</hi> he preferr'd to the <hi>Grand-Iury</hi> against Collonel <hi>Parker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crosby,</hi> in direct Contempt and Defiance of the <hi>Articles of Limerick,</hi> which had anull'd and superceeded all Prosecutions of that kind, as well as in a visible subserviency both to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve <hi>Ireland</hi> in a new War, and to shake the Peace and Tranquility of this Kingdom. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if Stipulations and Agreements be not so duly observed, as that People may rely upon them for their Safety, they will think of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better Security, tho they must come to be indebted for it to their Swords. However, so it is, that thro the Parliaments over-look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Arbitrary and Illegal Proceedings of the Ministers, <hi>An.</hi> 1692. you, Sir, have been encouraged and emboldened to revive and repeat the same unjust Practices in the Year 1694.

            <p>But I hasten to another Grievance which the Subject groaneth under in reference to his Liberty, and which maketh the <hi>Sixth</hi> Illegali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the execution of your Office, and in your Administration of the Affairs of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

and this is, That your Messengers do often search Houses, and that by Night as well as by Day, <hi>without the Presence and Company of a Constable or a Headborough.</hi> So careful is the Law, in relation to our Liberty, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Free-hold that every one has in it, that as it will not suffer the House of a <hi>Peer</hi> to be searched, nor his Person there appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, without the Presence of a <hi>Justice of Peace;</hi> so it doth not allow the breaking into, and searching the House of the meanest <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner,</hi> without the Aid and Assistance of a <hi>Constable,</hi> or one of parallel Character, tho in some places otherwise stiled. Those whom the Court calls <hi>Messengers</hi> are no civil Officers, nor does our Law know them by any Title that empowereth them to meddle with Mens Persons or Goods, farther than as they are Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary-Office and Council-Chamber <hi>Porters,</hi> to carry Warrants and Orders from thence to the <hi>Justices of Peace</hi> or <hi>Constables,</hi> to get them executed. Neither have the very <hi>Secretaries</hi> any Authority or Jurisdiction over the Liberty of the Subject, in the Quality and under the Figure of Secretaries, but merely as they are themselves <hi>Justices of the Peace:</hi> Tho I know that in their own single Persons, as well as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, Mr. <hi>Secretary</hi> doth often supplant Mr. <hi>Justice,</hi> and usurp over him. Yet this I do affirm, that, according to our Laws, all that they can pretend unto and claim under that Character, is to write Letters, hand the Peoples Petitions to their Master, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to them, and the like; but they have no power to diseize Men of their Liberties, or take away their Papers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> otherwise than as being <hi>Justices of the Peace.</hi> 'Tis true, there is another Thing very much in Fashion, which, for what I pretend to understand either of Matters of Law or State, their Jurisdiction may extend unto; and I am sure that some of them, thro the Profit they make by it, find their Interest in it, and that is the supplying your Gazetteers and Writers of News-Letters with <hi>Cargo</hi> of Intelligence; the Honour whereof I do no wise envy those that practice it, being in my Opinion no better, nor other, than the furnishing Wind at a certain Price to the <hi>Speaking-Trumpets</hi> and <hi>Cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But, Sir, besides the Tyranny you exercise over us, by authorizing or by counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing your Messengers, to break into and search our Houses, without their being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a Legal and Civil Officer (for all Power that the Law allows not, is tyrannous and usurped;) how many particular Mischiefs are we subjected and enslaved unto by this one Method of your administring your Office. For your Messengers being Fellows that most People are wholly Strangers unto, and whom very few know by Face, and least of all they whom they are usually heunded out upon, how liable are we to be robb'd by such as they may either in Friendship lend their <hi>Badges</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or by those that may counterfeit them, that being every way as feasible as counterfeiting the publick Coin is, which is every day pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised. Nor while this Course is allowed, are we out of danger of being murdered by Ruffians, charactering themselves Messengers, and furnished with the Passport of a <hi>Badge.</hi> And this is the more easily practicable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those who are real Messengers carry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times only <hi>Blank Warrants,</hi> and at other times (especially towards meaner People) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to produce and shew any at all. But let us suppose, that none do come to our Houses, but such who truly are what they vouch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (tho we can never be sure of it, while the Method I have been mentioning is allowed or connived at) yet if they exceed their Bounds, and copy Sir <hi>W. Waller</hi>'s Originals, Pray, in that case, how shall we be redress'd, or whom shall we attach for Reparations? For it is upon that account, as well as to keep the Peace, that the Law ordains and requires the Presence of a <hi>Constable,</hi> and of such a one as is of the Neighbourhood; that if we be either pillaged or otherways injured, we may know whom to sue and make responsible. And I am very suspicious what your Messengers may do, in fingering and detaining what they ought not to meddle with, unless they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Inspection and Restraint of a Civil Officer, since the time that I heard a very odd and ungentile Story of your self, which I have made that just Inquiry into, that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for the Truth of it; Namely, That upon your being informed, that a certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman about this Town had the Picture of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> (which certainly is as lawful for any one to buy and keep, as it is the Pictures of the Emperour <hi>Leopol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

by that Authority which you conceive vested in you as Secretary, and having questioned him about it, and demanding a sight of it, upon his obeying your Command, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying your Request, you put it immediately into your Pocket, and have not to this Day restored it again. Now, pray, what is this but to rob by virtue of the <hi>Seals</hi> of your <hi>Office,</hi> and to teach those under you to do the like by your Example: But it may be it was design'd for you as a Pledge of K. <hi>James</hi>'s Grace and Favour, and of your own Reconcillation to him, and that the manner of your getting into Possession of it, was only Artifice to conceal the Mystery of your having made your Peace with that <hi>Exiled Prince,</hi> and to cover your remaining in the Post you are, about K. <hi>W.</hi> in order to betray him, of which your whole Administration seems strongly to smell.</p>
            <p>But I hasten to another Miscarriage in your Management, which as much declares your acting with Arbitrariness and Illegality, as any of those can do which I have mentioned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and that is, while you pretend to seize Papers of Treasonable and Seditious Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, your Officers take and carry with them <hi>the Deeds of Men's Estates, their Books of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts relative to Trade, and their Letters of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conversation with their Friends.</hi> All which, as they ought to be preserved Secrets which none should presume to pry into, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Consent of the Owners; so the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no Man a Right and Authority to meddle with them. The disordering Men's Letters, in reference to common and private Business, may sometimes be an Inconveniency not easy to be redressed; and the penetrating into the State and Condition of their Civil and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Affairs, may come so to affect their Credits that the Wrong is for ever Irreparable. There are several, since this Revolution, that will never emerge from under the Inconveniencies and Difficulties which were brought upon them, by the seizing and detaining their Books and Papers, till the <hi>Attorney General,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> would be at leisure to look them over. I am far from complaining of any Governments seizing Asseciations against the State; or Letters of treasonable Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but it is illegal as well as rude, to heap a Gentleman's Papers together promiscuously, and to carry them away in the Bulk. And as none of the Messengers are qualified to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish those of dangerous Importance from such as are not; so they are commonly so hasty to be upon the Scent of fresh Game, that they will not allow themselves time to do it, if they could. And in the <hi>paraphrazing</hi> what passeth in Writing between Friends, there ought to be the largest Allowances grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed imaginable: For how many Words and Sentences may there be, in familiar Letters, between intimate and ingenious Acquaintance, that were very innocently intended, and yet by a malicious Interpretation may be easily trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into Libels? The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Catalogue of <hi>Men Worthy, and Worthy Men,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported no legal Offence, and yet what a Noise was made of it, even to an Essay of grafting a Plot upon it heretofore. There are few in the Kingdom, of Genteel Learning, Political Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, or of a large Converse, but, were their Studies ransack'd and pillag'd, there would be something met with that would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please a peevish &amp; Hypocondrycal States-man; and yet they with whom they were found, may, notwithstanding that, be Loyal even to Bigottry. And, as if it were not highly ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, as well as extreamly damageable to the Person concerned, to have all his Papers sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed promiscuously, and in the gross, There is another Thing commonly practised in these Cases by your Messengers, which is of most threatning, and may be of fatal Consequence; and that is their neither <hi>numbering</hi> nor <hi>marking</hi> them themselves, nor allowing those concern'd and from whom they seize them to do it; which is to expose and make obnoxious those, with whom they were taken, to have others <hi>shuffied</hi> in among them that were not there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And this is practicable so many ways, that, where this previous Security is not vouchsafed, the Prisoner is by the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> which is the Law of Nations, made unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able even for those very Papers which were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him: For the Law, that always fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth the Accused, will suppose that to be done by them who prosecute, which they have furnished themselves with so fair an occasion for the doing of. This preserved Monsieur <hi>Fouquett,</hi> when the late <hi>Colbert,</hi> who was at that time the chief Favourite of <hi>France,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted him with all the Art as well as all the Malice he could. And while we not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

out own Laws so much above theirs, but so infinitely extol the Justice and Mercy of K. <hi>W.</hi> beyond those of K. <hi>Lewis,</hi> we might very well expect (tho I cannot tell whether we may hope for it, if some Ministers be heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened unto) that we may have the same equal dealing at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> which are met with at <hi>Paris.</hi> For how easy is it for some (where the fore-mentioned Care is not had and observed) by the Aid and Assistance of their Old Friend <hi>Parson Young,</hi> both to counterfeit what Hands and forge what Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Papers they please, and then to have it sworn by their bribed Mercenaries, that they are the Hand-Writing of such or such a one, and taken in the Custody of this or that Man, whom they have a mind to have destroyed. So that upon this account, as well as that there were no Papers taken about him, all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Writings and Correspondencies, with which Mr. <hi>Crosby</hi> is loaded, signify no more, in Law to affect him, than if they were Old <hi>Almanacks;</hi> and the Crimes pretended to be witnessable by those Papers, can, according to Law, (may he be but allowed the benefit of it) no more hurt or prejudice him, than if they were <hi>Bagatelles</hi> or Stories of <hi>Robin Hood and Little John.</hi> And our Ministers, were they not in a Conspiracy to waste the Treasure of the Nation, as ridiculously as well as uselessly, as Myn <hi>Heer Meesters</hi> does it upon <hi>Machines,</hi> might have spared the Expence of bringing People from <hi>Ireland</hi> to swear to the Similitude of his Hand, seeing while the Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members what a late Favourite <hi>Young</hi> was with some of our Statesmen, and the Service he employ'd himself about; nothing like the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Hands can influence the Belief of any Man, that is not on the Score of Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Folly fit for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or upon the account of Villainy for <hi>Bridewell.</hi> Nor will it be very grateful to the Nation, instead of better Divertisement given unto them, to have the Tragedy of Colonel <hi>Algernoon Sidney</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted before them. To which I shall subjoyn, under this Head, That as several Papers rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Mens Trade and Estates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been lost and embezled, before the <hi>Secretaries</hi> could fall into the good Humour, or so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Sence of Justice and Honour, as to order them to be returned; so sometimes they have been wholly detained, and refused upon any Terms to be restored. Of this I have an Instance in a particular Friend, who having all his Papers taken by a Messenger, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Secretary's Office,</hi> he could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover one of them, tho there was not a <hi>Script</hi> among them of a treasonable or seditious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: And the loss of them was not only an Injury to the Gentleman, as it was a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him of his Goods and Property, but as it was a depriving him of the means of getting Bread to himself and Family: There having been several of them prepared for the Press, in order to convey to Posterity the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Actions that are past, and to remain as <hi>Memoirs</hi> to assist such as may write the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the two late Reigns. And since they were withheld from the Author, after they had been several times demanded, they have been either hired out for Money, or lent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in Courtesy to divers to be perused: But he from whom they were plundered hath this to comfort him, that the <hi>Minister of State</hi> by whose Order and Authority they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it a Person sufficiently responsible; and he may assure himself that the Sufferer is not of that tame and pusillanimous Temper, but that he will sooner or later make him account for them: And if he cannot obtain Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Legal Methods, he will make Reprizals in the best ways he can, but in such as shall be always honourable and just. Yea I may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto add, That your <hi>Messengers,</hi> and those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Persons whom you employ upon these Errands, don't only carry away Papers with them, which they have no right to meddle with, but they rob Men of their Money, as if it were Treason for such as you stile <hi>Jacobites</hi> to have Silver or Gold by them. Of this we have a late as well as a famous Instance, in that <hi>Harry Baker,</hi> accompanied with the <hi>Dutch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servators</hi> of our Liberties, did either feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously rob, or militarily plunder Mr. <hi>Tildsley</hi> of a Purse full of old Gold, while they were ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacking his Closet, in search (as they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) of treasonable and seditious Papers. And these are the blessed Fruits we reap, by retaining and luxurlously feeding these <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midons</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> while our <hi>Brittish Troops</hi> are near starving in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and dropping into another World by Hundreds and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands in defending the <hi>Barrier</hi> of the <hi>Seven Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinees.</hi> But tho those <hi>Holland Troopers</hi> may be

And if I do not mistake, no Man tho never so legally seized is to be sent to Prison, until he hath been brought before some proper and competent Magistrate, and hath been there examined.

Nor do we want Examples, how sometimes, thro <hi>Similitude,</hi> and at other times thro <hi>Identity</hi> of Names, a very innocent Person has been apprehended in the stead of one that was Criminal.

And considering the Morals of most of them, it is more than probable in reference to many, and proof can be made of it in relation to some, how they employ <hi>Setters</hi> to entangle Persons into their Clutches, and have their <hi>Spaniels</hi> to start Game for them to worry. Nor is it much to be wondered at, that having purchased their Places at dear Rates, they should sell the Devil as well as they had bought him. And their customary Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being but ill paid, the Government being usually a Year or two in Arrear to them, while <hi>German</hi> Troops Abroad, and <hi>Dutch</hi> Projectors, under the Notion of Incompatable Artifis and Ingeniers at Home, swallow up our Money even to the starving almost King <hi>IV</hi>'s Houshold; few People will think it strange, if those Blades, who have neither Honour nor Conscience to restrain them, should purvey for a Subsistence in all the ways they possibly can, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Justice of them. And I will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add upon this Head, That if those who are forcibly detained in such Hands and Places shall make their Escapes, the Law neither doth nor can make any Crime of it: For whatsoever Cognizance it takes of Escapes out of Legal Prisons, and whatsoever Punishment it makes the Officer in that Case obnoxious unto; yet it can annex no Penalties where it hath made no Establishments, nor inflict Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for not remaining, where it is so far from requiring, that it doth not allow that any Man should be. And if the Law of 1 <hi>Ed. 2. de frangentibus Prisonam,</hi> doth neither <hi>make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Seeing the Law that hath ordered it to be always specified and declared for what Cause Men are taken into Custody, hath taken no less care in providing whither they are to be sent, and in what Places they are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>But I hasten to a <hi>Tenth</hi> Grievance, under which the Subject groans thro your illegal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of your Office towards those you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and commit, and that is in the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if not encouraging and authorizing those called Prisoners of State to be <hi>treated</hi> both in <hi>Goals</hi> and in <hi>Messengers Houses</hi> with the utmost <hi>Barbarity, Rudeness</hi> and <hi>Insolency.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you do not either prevent or remedy, when you both ought and may, you must be thought to justify and allow, and ought accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to be made responsible for it. Prisons are not by the Law intended for Punishments, but only for the detaining Persons accused in safe Custody till they come to be tried, and do either vindicate their Innocency, or be convicted of their Guilt. And as it is to be supposed in Justice as well as Charity, that every Man, notwithstanding what is informed and deposed against him, may be innocent till he be proved and found guilty; so he ought in the mean time to be treated with all the humanity and fairness that are consistent with the preserving him safe, and forth-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Tryal. But that it is wholy otherwise I shall endeavour to lay before the Nation, in


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59017:11"/>
several Particulars, that if they have any Sence left of the Rights of English-men, or any Bowels towards their oppressed Country-men and Brethren, or any Apprehension or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of what may be their own Portion and Lot, they may resent the Injuries answerable to the Weight and Importance of them; and by application to their Representatives in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament endeavour to get them both Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and Remedied. Nor will I insist upon the little and mean Injury, tho it be hainous enough to many in some Circumstances, that is commonly practiced in all your <hi>Goals,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Newgate</hi> towards Prisoners; which is the denying them the Liberty to purchase their Bread and Beer from abroad, but forcing them to buy them in the <hi>Goal</hi> at those scanty and stinted Measures which the Goalers think fit to allow. And the <hi>Sutier</hi> giving several hundreds of Pounds for his Place hath no other way to reimburse himself, and make provision for his Family and Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than by abridging Prisoners in the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, as well as by defrauding them in the Kind of what they ought to have. But I shall reduce all I have to say on this Head to the following Particulars, and branch this one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Grievance into <hi>Five</hi> kinds of Tyranny and Oppression exercised over the Subject in this Matter; whereof the <hi>First</hi> is the shutting up Men without regard to their Age, Quality, natural or adventitious Infirmities, or to the former method of their Living, under <hi>close Confinement,</hi> neither allowing them the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the respective Prisons, nor the benefit of that little Air which those Places afford. I do know that the Law speaks of <hi>arcta Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> as well as <hi>Libera,</hi> but as it is only either for some infamous Facts, or for Persons from whose ill Character some attempt may be justly feared of making their Escape, that the <hi>first</hi> is ordained; so it is not intended by it, that Men should be locked up Weeks and Moneths within narrow, moist, and dark Rooms, with Warders lying in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers all Night, as well as Centinels constantly at their Doors, which is the Method of your <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the <hi>Tower</hi> towards his Prisoners; who tho he be a <hi>Peer,</hi> may be said to be a Stranger to the Breeding and Civility of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Gentleman;</hi> and of whom it may be affirmed without <hi>Scandalum,</hi> That of the whole Bench, whether Earls or Barons, he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest for the Character he bears, and the best adapted to it, having more of the true and proper Qualities of a <hi>Goaler</hi>

               </gap>hin others are ambitious of being endued with, or capable of attaining unto. And to convince all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that this is a Piece of despotical Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and not what the Law requireth, or whereunto the <hi>Goalers</hi> duty obligeth him, they both can and do dispence with much of this Severity, and practice more Humanity and Gentleness, when they are liberally bribed to it; which proclaims them either barbarous Oppressors in the one case, or treacherous Rogues in the other. For as upon the one hand, if the Law restrains them from using that Moderation, they are Villains and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to those that trust them in exercising of it; so upon the other, if the Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth all that Civility and Fairness of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour from them towards those who are their Prisoners, which is consistent with the keeping them safe, then they are brutal Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranes, and worse than <hi>Bashaws</hi> in refusing it. But besides this, there is a <hi>Second</hi> Sort of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression practiced upon all your Prisoners of State in whatsoever Places they come to be confined; and that is, The <hi>demanding and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting from them illegal and exorbitant Fees.</hi> I do not deny but the Law alloweth some small Thing, by way of Fee, to the Keepers of City and County <hi>Goals,</hi> but it bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to what they require, and you Sir, as Secretary of State, countenance them to take. But for your <hi>Messengers</hi> I do know no Law that allows one Farthing to them from the Prisoner by way of Fee: For being the immediate Servants of the Court, they are to expect their Wages from those that set them at work, and whose Drudgery they do. Nor is it possible that according to Law they can challenge any Thing from those they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in Custody, seeing our Laws know none bearing those Names for <hi>Goalers,</hi> nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege any such Houses as theirs for Prisons. As for your <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> I am told that there is only a <hi>Groat</hi> legally due to him; and that if more be given him, it is meer Gratuity, for which, tho never so little, he ought to make a Leg, and be thankful.

For Extortion is too dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive a Title for it; nor can it be otherwise accounted of, than as a higher Degree of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression than any perpetrated in the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> and <hi>Great Mogul.</hi> And it would seem that some of you Ministers do reckon that you are in a State of War with the <hi>English</hi> at Home, as well as with the <hi>French</hi> Abroad; and that you may treat the Prisoners you make in the same manner as the Soldiers do those of the Enemies they take in the Field, where all they find upon the Captive is held lawful Plunder. So excessive are the Fees which are every where exacted of those cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prisoners of State, that a very great Fine inflicted for a High Misdemeanour against the Government, would not amount to so much, nor be so grievous, were the Prisoners tryed and convicted immediately, as the lying Five or Six Months in a Messenger's hands, or in Goal at <hi>Newgate,</hi> ariseth unto in bare and naked Fees.

For since the Exchange was made of Princes, some have stood confined for many Months, if not Years, and none suffered to go near them besides Goalers. I do acknowledg that in some Cases, and towards some Prisoners, it may not be convenient that any should have the Liberty of access to them, save in the Presence of a Keeper; but with that <hi>Proviso</hi> and that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection, there cannot be the least danger of giving their Friends and Relations admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to them at seasonable Hours. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever can be vouchsafed a Prisoner, without Danger to the Government, or in Subservien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the making an Escape, the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that it should not be denied him. And that it is not from any care of preserving the Government, or apprehension of the Prisoners contriving an Escape, that this Privilege is with-held from them, but from Covetuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to squeeze Money out of them, is apparent from hence, that upon Application for leave and paying down so much for an <hi>Order</hi> of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tance from the Secretary, the Liberty which was before refused is then granted. But then the Mischief is, that this <hi>Order</hi> will for the most part give only a Freedom of Access to the Prisoner for once, and that whosoever would go again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this customary Practise of some Secretaries in oppressing the Subject,


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59017:12"/>
encourageth <hi>Goalers</hi> to do the like, which tho they cannot exemplify in the same manner, yet they imitate it as well as they can. So that even when the Secretary does no way intend by his Form of Commitment, that the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner should be debarred the sight of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Friends, yet the Goaler will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, unless they make their Address by <hi>Guineas,</hi> and seek his Favour by the Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Angels,</hi> and then the Doors fly open, and the Prisoner may be seen and conversed with. To which may be added as a <hi>Fourth</hi> Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Severity used towards Prisoners under their Confinements, that they are refused the having their <hi>Counsellors</hi> and <hi>Sollicitors</hi> admitted to them, when they need and desire them. For as if their Conditions were not distressful enough, thro a shameful defect in our Laws, in not allowing them the Assistance of Council at and upon their Tryals for Treasonable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, which no Laws in the World besides ours but allow. You, Sir, render it more deplorable and worse by denying them to speak with their Councel freely, and as often as they please before, which is the robbing them of a Right, which the Law under all its other Deficiencies in this matter grants unto them. For a Counsellor at Law is the same thing to a Person confined, and to be arraigned for a Conspiracy against the Government, that a Physician is to one sick of a dangerous and malignant Distemper; nor ought the First be refused the coming to his <hi>Client</hi> with the same Freedom that the Latter goes to his <hi>Patient.</hi> I do the rather insist upon this, because of the unpresidented Barbarity used towards Mr. <hi>Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> even after he had warning given him by Mr. <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> to provide for his Tryal. For tho Mr. <hi>Momp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sson,</hi> who is his <hi>Council,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barleigh,</hi> who is his <hi>Sollicitor,</hi> had admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to see him, yet they neither were, nor yet are permitted to speak with him, but in the Presence of a <hi>Keeper.</hi> Which is not only all one, but much worse than if they were not suffered to come near him at all; so it does put him only to the expence of so many <hi>Fees,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving him in a Condition either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare with Safety his own Case, or to receive their Advice. And the Fellows fastened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him at those Seasons are only so many Spies, whose Business is to observe what he does say, that so if he discover the least Thing, which being known may do him hurt, they may be ready as Witnesses and depose against him, and thereby supply the want that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment still laboureth under in that matter, after they have hunted through the three Kingdoms to procure such as with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability may swear him out of his Life. And through this Severity put upon Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for High Treason, which most in both Houses of Parliament, as well as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Kingdom, and even Mr. <hi>Secretary Trenchard</hi> oftner than the rest have been guilty of, they are worse treated than <hi>Felons,</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, and Highway-men are; that being never denied to the latter, which is thus scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalously refused the former. To which I subjoyn in the <hi>fifth</hi> and last place, as another hainous and intolerable Grievance put upon State Prisoners in some <hi>Goals,</hi> and that this is the <hi>subjecting them to wear Irons,</hi> unless they redeem themselves from the Barbarity by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. For tho I cannot tell whether this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity be exercised towards Prisoners by your Authority, or meerly by your Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; yet this I am sure of, that exercised it is, and that upon Persons whose Quality, Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Character, equal them to your self in every thing, save that they are not advanced to the Honour by being vested with the <hi>Seals</hi> of the Office. Nor is this only a punishing of Men before they be convicted, or proved guilty of the least Crime (seeing none will deny, but that the wearing Irons is a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that as Grievous as it is Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious) but it is a Treating them as if they were actually Sentenced and Condemned to <hi>Gallys,</hi> and not as such as are meerly put under Confinement to be kept in safe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody until they can be brought to undergo a Legal Tryal. Now this is so commonly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised upon all that are committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> upon pretence of having conspired against the Government, that I need not assign par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Instances of it, tho divers very late ones are produceable; and for which, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration cannot legally be obtained against <hi>Tell</hi> the Keeper, Gentlemen will be tempted whensoever they recover their Liberty to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate themselves by a Cane, if not by a Sword, from the dishonour that has been done them: However I do both lay this Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity at your Door unless remedied; and


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59017:13"/>
offer It to the Cognizance and Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Parliament</hi> the next <hi>Sessions.</hi> If they be not either so employed <hi>about Ways and Means for carrying on a vigorous War against</hi> France, that they cannot find leisure for what concerns the preserving our Rights and Liberties at home; or that some of them have a mind to suffer poor <hi>Jacobites</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unrelieved in this particular, till some of the Advocates for the Merc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and who have laboured so stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously for the Redress of those Grievances which we complained of under former, may come themselves to fall under this Barbarity, which it is not impossible but that sooner or later they may. However this ignominious Severity is not inflicted upon State Prisoners in persuance either of <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Statute</hi> Law, seeing by bestowing a few <hi>Guineas</hi> on the <hi>Keeper</hi> they may either prevent it, or rescue themselves from it, when they please. But in the mean time I would desire to know, by what <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, either <hi>Fell,</hi> or any <hi>other Goaler,</hi> becomes authorised to levy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and exorbitant Taxes upon any of the People of <hi>England,</hi> and how our <hi>Ministers</hi> either of <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>State</hi> can answer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving at it under a Government that is Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and not Dispotical?</p>
            <p>But it is now time to advance to the next Grievance under which Prisoners of State do suffer, which makes the <hi>Eleventh</hi> Illegality, which in the Course of your Administration you exercise towards them; and that is, The <hi>refusing to admit them to Bail in Cases that are by Law bailable, and the allowing none for suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bail, but such as Mr.</hi> Aaron Smith <hi>thinks fit to approve of.</hi> It would extend this Paper to an undue length, to call over and enlarge upon all the Cases according as the Weight and Importance of them do require, in which you refuse to admit Persons to bail, when you not only may, but ought to do it.

For which as by Law they have very good Actions against him, so it is hoped that sooner or later they may recover lusty Damages. Yea, when the Ill-natured Man cannot except against Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon the foot of their Inability, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth to admit them upon Pretence of their being Disloyal, and brandeth whomsoever he beareth a Spleen unto, with the Name of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites;</hi> which besides the Prejudice that it may do to the Person that offereth to be Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and stands excluded upon this Allegation, it may often leave the Prisoner under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of remaining confined for want of <hi>Bail;</hi> seeing his Acquaintance and Interest may lye among no other but those whom <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> thus Charactereth.

But to return to Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Johnstone,</hi> who lyeth under this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that all whom he enrols for this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice will be thought allied to him in one Quality, which all that know him affirm his being endowed with in so great a Measure, that no Man believes a Word he says. For as his Character among all his Acquaintance is that of False and Lying <hi>Sandy;</hi> so it passes for the Badg of a weak Man to give Credit to any thing that Mr. <hi>Alexander Johnstone</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, tho he swear to it. But albeit the Court hath been a Sanctuary to him, all along since the Revolution, to cover him from his Creditors; and <hi>Whitehall</hi> hath been to him in the quality of a <hi>White-fryars;</hi> yet it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that no Place will long shelter him from the Punishments due to him as a <hi>Suborner.</hi> Nor is this Trade of his of Suborning Witnesses to to swear to Falshoods, and to depose Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously, an Employment with him of a late date, seeing he set up the Practice of it many Years ago. So that whosoever will but take the Pains to go to <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> will find a large Catalogue registred there of those he had Bribed to Swear to his Marriage with one Mr. <hi>Perrier</hi>'s <hi>Daughter,</hi> and to many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities with her, which I shall not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which that Court after great Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a Suit long depending, did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one word to be true. Yea, the Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations whereof he had been in that Case guilty, were so numerous, notorious and gross, that they not only determined it against him, but both then, and ever since whensoever he is named in presence of any who belong to that Society, they brand him with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the boldest and most Impudent <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And the Perjurles he had been accessary unto, were so many and apparent; and the Defamations he had fastned upon the young Gentlewoman so scandalous and gross, that had he not withdrawn first for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then to <hi>Ireland,</hi> he had been prosecuted in the Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and brought to undergo an ignominious and corporal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is unwillingly, and with regret, that I do either call these Things to remembrance, or publish them to the World; but when the Man is not satisfied in the Enjoyment of a Credit which he doth not deserve, but will upon a Reputation that is only charitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at, set up to destroy innocent Persons upon the Testimony of bribed and perjured Witnesses; it is then indispensably incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon such as know those Things, to strip him of his Mask and Disguise, and to present him to the World in his natural Image, and expose him to view in the best Light they can. Especially when he is growu up to that Impudence, upon a Presumption of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by the many Services of this kind which he hath done the <hi>Government,</hi> as to tell Sir <hi>George Maxwell</hi> that he was to dye as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Place where they lay: But upon his arrival the said <hi>Secretary</hi> would have at first wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and at last endeavoured to huff him to appear as an Evidence against the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Colonel Fountain.</hi> And tho <hi>Drumond</hi> averred to him upon the Word of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he was so far from understanding any thing whereof the <hi>Colonel</hi> was accused, that he did not so much as know him, nor was ever in his Company, to the best of his remembrance; yet the forenamed <hi>Secretary</hi> continued not only to rail against <hi>Colonel Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> as a hainous Traytor that must dye, but both to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inuate and affirm that <hi>Drumond</hi> must know a great deal against him. Which so provoked the <hi>Gentleman</hi> upon the finding himself tempted and importuned to murther an innocent Man, by a false and perjurious Deposition; that he told the said <hi>Secretary,</hi> That as he neither could nor would be an Evidence in that Matter, so the <hi>Secretary</hi> needed not be so earnest to suborn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch him, seeing he might easily furnish himself with enough of such Witnesses about the Town as he looked after <hi>for half a Guinea a Man.</hi> Which as it declares how large and deep this Conspiracy is, of those that serve the Government, against the Lives of gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>less Persons; so it both shews the hazard that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Fountaine</hi> is in, upon no other foot save that of meer Malice; and unfolds unto us the Methods taken and persued to draw in and muster Witnesses. Nor is it improbable but that <hi>Drumond</hi> upon declining to forswear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to destroy both an innocent Person, and one whom he doth no ways know, may not only have his <hi>Commission</hi> taken from him, but be refused the Payment of his Arrears; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had he complied to do what was required of him, he might have reckoned upon the being speedily preferred to a very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Command, and that upon the score of the highest Merit that is now in Fashion. But can there need more to supplant the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and eternally to blast the Credit of the present pretended Plot, than that <hi>Harry Baker</hi> and <hi>Alexander Johnston</hi> are the Procurers and Managers of Witnesses for the support of it. And I have been the rather obliged to give the Character of this Gentleman, because that as Mr. Secretary <hi>Trenchard</hi> declares he knows very little more of this Plot, than what Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Johnston</hi> conveyed unto him, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by himself, or by such Witnesses as he sent him, so it is not improbable but that Mr. <hi>Secretary Johnston</hi> had the Intelligence of it from his Brother <hi>Alexander,</hi> and those whom he handed to him; having first suborned them. So that this whole Conspiracy, for which so many have been taken into Custody, and more have been looked after, seems to have been first minted by <hi>Harry Baker, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Johnston</hi> and <hi>Hugh Speak,</hi> and afterwards made current thro the Kingdom, by the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit which the two Secretaries <hi>Johnston</hi> and <hi>Trenchard</hi> have stampt upon it. For that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and very Honourable Person, who filleth the Place and beareth the Title of <hi>English</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, in Conjunction with <hi>Trenchard,</hi> is a perfect Stranger to this whole Plot; farther than as they have involved him in the Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Drudgery of pursuing it, by imperiously as well as craftily playing their Witnesses upon him: And considering his great Sense and Honour, he cannot but resent the great Affront and Indignity done him by Mr. Secretary <hi>Trenchard,</hi> in turning all the Witnesses upon him to clamour Men out of their Lives, while he withdrew into the Countrey to observe, at a distance, how the <hi>Mine</hi> should spring which he and some others have been so long in digging and working at in <hi>Powis House.</hi> Or if it should reverberate on those that gave Fire unto and stand near it, he might be out of the reach of the Disaster, and have the pleasure of seeing the Honourable Person, whom he left here covered with the Dirt and Dust which it raiseth, if not buried under the Ruines of it. However this Trade of Suborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witnesses is become so common, (which it could not be were their not too much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance given unto it by those in Authority) that every pitiful Fellow that hath a Mind to ingratiate himself into Court-Favour, and to obtain a Pension, dare Openly &amp; with Boldness venture uponit. For it is not long since that two <hi>Bayliffs</hi> took the Confidence to accost a Third, and to tempt him to come in as an Evidence against Mr. <hi>Tildsley,</hi> and another Gentleman, and depose his having heard them speak trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Words against their Queen, and about the Murder of her: Tho the Person thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costed (as he confessed to a Friend whom he consulted about the Matter) never knew

Mr. Tildsley nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Nor is it to be questioned, but that those two Rascals, who endeavoured to inveagle their Companion to be a false Witness, will appear as Evidences both against the two Gentlemen I have mentioned, and against all such as they shall be hounded at. But tho Secretaries may take up and imprison Men, upon such Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, yet I cannot apprehend (albeit I have a very slender Opinion of the Sense, Vertue and Fortitude of many that are admitted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pannels)</hi> that any <hi>Jury</hi> will give the least Faith or Credit to what such Villains shall have the Impudence to swear. Yea this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Subornation is grown so much into Fashion, and receiveth such Encouragement, that even those who are upon the List, and have the Sallary of standing Witnesses for the Government, are not contented with the single Province of being <hi>Whitehall Evidences,</hi> and to perjure themselves, but they interlope like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise upon <hi>Alexander Johnston</hi> and <hi>Harry Baker,</hi> and turn Suborners of others to come in and forswear themselves; whereof we have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Instance in <hi>Lunt,</hi> the much celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Witness concerning the present <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to swear that he had received Money of Mr. <hi>Walmesley</hi> for the carrying on and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Service of King <hi>James;</hi> and upon that Persons answering that he had never seen Mr. <hi>Walmesley,</hi> the Miscreant had nevertheless the Impudence to tempt and entice him to own what was delivered to him the said <hi>Lunt,</hi> and another, and that then they Two would swear to it, and excuse the Person whom they accosted from being an Evidence. Which the poor Man likewise refusing, <hi>Lunt</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon grew enraged, and threatned him both with abridging the mean Commons that were allowed him in Prison, and with the greatest Severities that could be inflicted in a <hi>Goal.</hi> And as if the execution of all this to the full at <hi>Chester</hi> had not been Injustice and Barbarity enough, they have haled the poor Man hither to Town, and thrown him with Two other Persons more into <hi>Messengers</hi> hands, to be there wrought over and trained up for Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; which that they may the more easily and better Effect, the Messenger not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suseth to admit any to come to them, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owneth the having them in Custody. Which serveth farther to instruct us of the Mischiefs that attend the Confinement of Prisoners to other Places than Legal <hi>Goals.</hi> And it would seem that there are Privileges belonging to the Ministers of this Government, that were never allowed to those of the former; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That as they may without being made accountable press Men for Soldiers, when they will not of their own accord list them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; so they may torture Men into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Witnesses, when they can neither wheedle nor bribe them to it. For I do account such a Confinement as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, and the Starving them thro not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them a Sixth part of what their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites crave, to be a torturing of them. Nor do the <hi>Scotch Boots,</hi> which are the Disgrace of that Nation and the Scorn of this, affect Men in so sensible Parts as the pinching them for Weeks and Months in their Bellies doth. Which will make me always dread the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring some People threaten to touch their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the most sensible part; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when I find it executed upon such as they call so at home, instead of falling upon those that are so abroad. And we may easily imagine how admirably qualified some of your Messengers are for to rack and torture poor Men when they have taken them in Custody, by the hostile and violent Methods which they practice, and seem to be licensed to use, in their apprehending them. Of which I crave leave to refresh. your Memory with one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Example, whereof not having had seasonable Intelligence. I could not insert it in its proper Place, as otherwise I should; namely, How that <hi>Kitson</hi> breaking into a House in <hi>Scroops Court</hi> near S. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Church, where some quiet People were peaceably as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to worship God, on the 30th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> last, and having seized several without either producing or having any Warrant, and demanding the Key of Mr. <hi>Grascom</hi>'s Closet to rifle for Papers, which the said Mr. <hi>Grascom</hi> refusing to deliver, unless he might see his Warrant, and know by what Authority he stood empowered so to act; the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Kitson,</hi> pointing to his Badge as his sole and sufficient Warrant, pulled a Pistol out of his Pocket, and swore by God that he would shoot Mr. <hi>Grascom</hi> (who is a Learned and Holy Minister) thro the Head, unless he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately surrendred the Key of his Study. Hear O Heavens! and be astonished O Earth! That <hi>England,</hi> under Pretence of having its Rights and Liberties rescued and vindicated, should be reduced into this worse than <hi>Turkish</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and Slavery. And that under <hi>One</hi> whom a deluded Nation entertained as a <hi>Moses</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them out of a meer fancied <hi>Egypt,</hi> they should be translated out of a <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As if those Things were again to be re-acted which made <hi>Tacitus</hi> say, <hi>Quantoque majore libertatis imagine tegebantur, tanto eruptura ad intensius servitium; That the great Pretence of the restoring us to Liberty, was only that with the more Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity we might be made the greater Slaves.</hi> But it is worth enquiring, Whether Self-Defence, in all the ways God and Nature have enabled us, be not in such a Case, as that of Mr. <hi>Grascom</hi>'s, both lawful and necessary? And whether I ought not in Duty to God and my Country, as well as I may by the Law of the Land, slab such a Fellow as <hi>Kitson</hi> who thus hastily assaults me?

upon those in whose Power he knew it was to crush him. Witness his defrauding my Lord <hi>Renelaugh</hi> of <hi>Sixty Pounds,</hi> for which that Lord treated him to his Face, in the Hearing of divers Persons of Condition, with no better Titles than those of Rogue and Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. And it is notoriously known, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of King <hi>James</hi>'s withdrawing, he cheared the Regiment (to which he stood then in the Relation of Agent) of several Hundred Pounds, as is ready to be attested by several <hi>Officers,</hi> as well as private <hi>Centinels,</hi> that suffered by his Knavery. But that which brands him with indelible Infamy, and ought to incapacitate him from being esteemed a Credible and Legal Witness, is, his having fastned upon a Gentleman a <hi>Sham Bill</hi> of <hi>Fifty Pounds,</hi> and of which he received <hi>Fifteen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cheat was detected. But the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage, and Falsification, being discovered, e're he had received the rest, he was arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and thrown into the Counter; from whence he got out upon <hi>Sham</hi> Bail, and so having escaped the Punishment of one Crime, by perpetrating another, he fled into <hi>Ireland,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was not worth the while, nor at that time easy to pursue him. Neither can any thing be so Infamous, which this Man will not commit; seeing in Contempt both of the Laws of Nature and Revelation, and in Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Duty and Affection of a Brother, he hath thrown his Eldest Brother into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in order to defraud him of an Estate. To which I crave leave to add, That having been bred a Protestant, and continued so till of late years, he then turned Papist; tho as he declared to several at that time, and hath often repeated it since, that he did it not upon any Conviction of Mind, but meerly to comply with the Desires, and to gratify the Importunity of his Relations: Which speaks him to be a worse Man, than if he were an avowed and down-right Atheist. Because while the one denies that there is a God, he doth in effect renounce him, at the same time that he pretended to believe there is one. For whosoever departs from a Religion that he Judges to be true, to embrace one of the Truth whereof he hath no Conviction upon his Mind, doth no less than both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise, and implicitly disclaim that God whom he owneth and pretendeth to worship. Nor is such a Man's Oath to be more valued, or what he declares upon it to be more credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than one would rely upon the Oath of a professed Atheist, or believe him that ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules a Deity in what he swears.

And because the Title of <hi>Labourer</hi> or the Stile of <hi>Victualles,</hi> by which <hi>Lunt</hi> designs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a Judgment granted under his Hand and Seal, were too mean for one of King <hi>W</hi>'s Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to go by, and too contemptible for a Person of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Degree and Haughtiness to own under either of those Characters; he caused insert him into the Bail Bond by the Title of Gentleman. And undoubtedly Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> who acteth as invested with a power to dispose of mens Lives at he pleaseth, may conser Honours on whom he will. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a Gentleman of a Rogueish Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant he may in a little time challenge the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating whom he thinks meet Barons and Earls: Seeing these are more indebted to Inclination and Humour for their Creation, than any are or can be in their being made or rendred Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.

In a Word, there was never such packing of Juries, obstructing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of Justice, obliging Persons both to High and Supreamary Bail, as since the Nation fell under the <hi>Grand Vistership</hi> of Mr. <hi>Aaron Smith.</hi> So that under <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Graham</hi> we may be said (notwithstanding all our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints) to have lived <hi>in Republica Platonis;</hi>


               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59017:21"/>
whereas the best we can now pretend unto is to be <hi>in faece Romuli.</hi> But in the mean time, where is Law, Government and Justice, that a Criminal indicted of Felony, and taken into Custody, should be thus rescued out of the Hands of Magistrates, and from under the power of the Law, to be made use of as a Witness to destroy those that are Guiltless? And this at such a Season when the <hi>Felon</hi> was to have come upon his own Tryal, to receive the Punishment due to his Crime: With this further Aggravation, that this was done by the imperious Interposition of <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> who being an Officer under the Government, should for the Honour of K <hi>W.</hi> and Credit of the Court, have not only permitted the Law to have its Course, but ought to have assisted in preventing all Obstructions in the Execution of Justice. But <hi>Aaron</hi> knows where his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest lies, and that he gains more by the Tryai of <hi>State-Prisoners,</hi> than by the Prosecution of <hi>Felons.</hi> For the heaping up of Money justly or unjustly, is what <hi>Smith</hi> principally aims at; and not being contented with <hi>Sixteen Thousand Pounds</hi> payable into the Treasury, which he hath gotten into his Hands, and not paid one Thousand of it (being resolved as it seems to cheat the Government of the rest;) he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to give all the Countenance he can to Sham-Plots, as finding them so subservient to his Profit. And while he grows Rich by other Mens being suspected and taken up as guilty of Treason (every pretended Plot being worth unto him some Thousands of Pounds) he doth all that Craft and Malice can suggest, for the forging of Conspiracies, and the pointing out such for Criminals whom his Covetousness makes him desirous to have believed Traytors. And there is enough to be laid before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to convince the most Incredulous and Obstinate, that he hath been a wilful and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Encourager of this Sham-Conspiracy, as he is known to be the principal Countenancer of Suborners, and the chief Supporter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Witnesses. But what can be expected that is either Legal or Righteous, from a Man that makes it his Business against the time of any Tryals for State-Crimes, to get the Under-Sheriff to return what Grand and Petty Juries he pleases: And if his Blood-thirsty desires be not readily complied with, he complains to the Upper-Sheriff, and never leaves swagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and threatning till he gets it done. And as if this were not enough towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing his Sanguinary and Cruel Ends, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently sends for the Lists of those that are to be returned upon the <hi>Pannels,</hi> and strikes out and puts in whom he thinks meet. Yea, he is risen to that heighth of unpresidented Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, as to take upon him to dictate to Grand Juries, when sworn and sitting, how they are to find the <hi>Bills</hi> that lie before them, imposing upon them with an Insolence peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that such and such both ought and must be made Examples. Nor will any Man wonder at <hi>Aaron</hi>'s haughty Impudence towards <hi>Juries,</hi> that observes how he treats the very <hi>Judges</hi> in his Application unto them, as if he were in the Place and had the Authority of <hi>Dictat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor does any one give that check to his Imperiousness, Pride and Insolence, as the <hi>Attorney General</hi> doth; who finding of what Profit and Advantage it is to be as much as he can at the head of all Treasonable Causes, and to keep Prosecutions of that nature under his own Conduct, doth therefore whatsoever lies in his Power to confine <hi>Aaron</hi> to a shorter Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than he is willing to be staked down unto: for which he talks of Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Contempt, detracting both from his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and Integrity in all Companies. Which Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding I leave to be arbitrated between themselves, as being best acquainted with each others Intellectual and Moral Qualifications.</p>
            <p>But why do I insist so much upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presidented Illegalities of <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> when the very <hi>Secretaries of State</hi> themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to Law, Honour, Justice or Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, cause seize and apprehend both Men and Women, for no other Offence alleged against them, but that they disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ver what they know of the Infamy of the Witnesses, and take the Methods which the Laws have provided and chalk'd forth for bringing them to an account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness for their Crimes. And as the like was never practised under any of those Reigns of which we did most complain, and as it appears since very unjustly; so it is worthy of our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, that when a Pack of Scandalous Rascals had combined in the Year 1681, to involve a great many Protestants in a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of seizing King <hi>Charles,</hi> and for altering


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59017:21"/>
the Government, yet no one was molested ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for detecting the Forgery of that Plot, or for laying open and exposing the Crimes, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainies and Perjuries of those who were then stiled the King's Evidences. Yea, when three several <hi>Discourses,</hi> all of them bearing the Title of <hi>No Protestant Plot,</hi> were printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in Vindication of the Innocency of those that were suspected, as well as of those that were apprehended and imprisoned, and for detecting the Scandalousness and Legal Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity of the Evidences, and withal the Picquancy which the Author of those Discourses had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit or Language to season them with; yet they were not only read by every Man with Safety, but openly sold by most Stationers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>London,</hi> without Animadversion or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. Nor can any Age parallel such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment, or furnish us with a Warrant of the Tenor of that issued out by the present Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon this occasion; whereof I shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join a Copy, that this Generation may see their Misery, and the next laugh at our Folly. Namely (afterwards of course in all Warrants) <hi>That they should apprehend and bring before them the Persons of——together with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, for conspiring and endeavouring to suborn Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses against the Lives and Credit of several witnesses for their Majesties, against Persons char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with High Treason,</hi> &amp;c. Which looks like a summoning all the Malefactors in the several Goals of the Kingdom, to come in and list them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Witnesses for the Government, with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance not only of Protections and Rewards, but that they shall have the Satisfaction and Pleasure to see those imprisoned and punished, that shall dare to prosecute them for their Crimes, tho they should be Murders and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaries as well as Felonies. Were not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before me too open to be exposed, as well as it is tempting to render me severe beyond my Temper and Inclinations, I would add more upon this Theam. But tho nothing can be rude, and much less picquant enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that have had the Indiscretion, if not the Malice to issue out a Warrant of this Nature, yet I will so far both retain my Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and regulate my Heat, as only calmly to expostulate the matter in one Word: Is the rescuing our Laws, and the vindicating our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, which were the Pretences for the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Descent into <hi>England,</hi> and the great Motives to the late Revolution, issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this? That we have neither Laws nor Liberties left us, but that we must stand with our Mouths shut, and our Hands bound, till our Lives be destroyed and our Estates forfeited, upon the Perjuries of the most Notorious as well as Hainous Villains that that ever the Earth bare. And let me tell you, That we think it much more eligible, that you should command your <hi>Dutch Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons</hi> to cut our Throats (if they can) than that a Design should be carried on, and thus countenanced, by Authority of murthering us by Forms of Law. For as in the <hi>one</hi> Case, we should be sure to sell our Lives e're we lost them, and should we miscarry in our own defence, would hope to dye not only pitied, but expect to have our Deaths revenged; whereas in the <hi>other,</hi> we fall with Disgrace; and there are few have the Honour, Zeal and Generosity, to resent the Wrong and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice that are done us.

            <p>But I return to a Representation of some more of your Witnesses; and he whom I shall next unmask is <hi>Wilson,</hi> who was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Chamberlain</hi> at the <hi>Bear Inn</hi> in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> but who I do suppose is by this time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced Gentleman, thro the Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> who takes upon him to be the Fountain of Honours.

And that being done by the Rascal with all readiness; my Lord, to deliver himself both from the trouble and reproach of it, caused conveigh and deliver it to Mr Secretary <hi>Trenchard,</hi> whom I take to be you, Sir. Nor did you think it enough to receive it (as may be your Place did oblige you) but you had the Indiscretion to entertain it with a great deal of Fondness, and to say, he was a Person might do you a great deal of Service. And as a Testimony both of your Esteem of the Fellow, for the good Qualities I have mentioned, and of your being engaged in a Design of murthering Men by the worst and most infamous Means and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments imaginable, you gave Order that he should not be prosecuted the Sessions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for his Felony. For to obstruct Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and to pervert it, are the usual Methods with you of Administring your Office. But Mr. <hi>Freeman</hi> having upon that Disappointment consulted with a Friend what he should do, being very desirous to recover his Money, he was adviced to prosecute the Rascal the next Sessions that should ensue, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in Court if the Law were not allowed its free course. Upon which, Sir, you began to think, That you should make a cheap Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of a Witness at the Price of 30 <hi>l.</hi> and a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ekly Allowance ever since; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you took care to have <hi>Freeman</hi> paid half his Money before that Sessions, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther half within a little time after it. Nor can it be but from a malicious Design, that tho this Fellow has not hitherto been prosecuted, nor likely to be by <hi>Freeman,</hi> yet you keep him still in <hi>Newgate.</hi> However in this, as in other Things, you do but dance in a Net; seeing we plainly discern you, notwithstanding your Cover. In brief, he is detained there not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Spy, but to acquire some umbrage of Credibility in what he is to be brought forth to swear against such there, as you have a mind to destroy. For tho he be admitted into Conversation with none of the Prisoners of State; yet you hope that his walking in the <hi>Press-yard</hi> among them, may give some Reputation to what he shall perjuriously De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And that you may supply that defect of Evidence you laboured under when you

sent several Gentlemen thither into Custody, by having one ready to swear that they are become guilty of Treason since they were in hold. Nor can I compare this Discovery of <hi>Ashlock</hi>'s, after he was in <hi>Newgate</hi> in danger of being hanged, to any thing more properly than to the Detection which <hi>Whitney</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make of a Conspiracy for murthering King <hi>William;</hi> in hopes, after all his Crimes, and the Sentence of Death which he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to have thereby escaped the Gallows. And I tremble to think how many, and of what Quality, that Fellow offered to depose against; and with what Leachery his Information was entertained, till my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Holt,</hi> from a Horrour of the Villainy he saw pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by <hi>Whitney,</hi> and cherished by others, interposed with the Zeal, Justice and Courage, that are natural to him, and got him hanged. And thanks be to God, that how ill natured so ever some of them were, who then filled the chief Places of the Ministry, yet we knew nothing at that time of a <hi>Powis-house Juncto,</hi> nor of a Cabal instituted to form Treasons, and who sit brooding to shed innocent Blood. But surely we might have expected, that after the ignominy which the Government fell under, for hearkening so far as they did to <hi>Whitney</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Discovery of a Plot, we should not have heard of another Detection of a Conspiracy from Criminals and Malefactors in <hi>Newgate;</hi> but some Men when they cannot <hi>flectere Superos,</hi> they will <hi>movere Acheronta;</hi> and apply to Hell for support, when they despair, and that very justly, of the farther favour of Heaven.</p>
            <p>And Goals being the properest Places to yield agreeable Tools to the Exigencies of the Government, and most fertile of those of a Vertue and Credit proportionable to the good Qualities of such as need and employ them; and all the Prisons of <hi>England</hi> not furnishing Rogues enough of a Character becoming Royal Evidences, the Goals of other Nations have been searched and ransacked in order to the obtaining a Supply of Witnesses, fit to pass muster against <hi>Jacobites</hi> at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> and to he credited by <hi>London</hi> Juries. Of which I shall recount one Remarkable Instance; namely, That one <hi>Bateman,</hi> and his Wife, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perpetrated Sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For these two Miscreants being sensible, that there was no way of escape for them, but by the Intercession of King <hi>William,</hi> and knowing how to recommend themselves to his favour, and to merit a Share in all the Interest he had in the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> took care to get him informed, what mighty Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries they were able and ready to make of a Plot here in <hi>England</hi> against his Person and Government; whereupon he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interposed with the Elector, for their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and ordered their being defrayed and conveyed hither, to pass as Witnesses against the Lives of those, whom <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> and others, should think fit to mark out to be murthered. And being consigned over to you, Sir, it is known with what fondness you received them, and how you committed them to <hi>Cooke</hi> the <hi>Messenger,</hi> to be preserved fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But the Wretches having compassed their End, thought fit to frustrate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint you and <hi>Aaron</hi> of yours. For find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Opportunity of robbing <hi>Cooke,</hi> and his Wife, of Money and Goods to a considerable Value, they made their Escape, to the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Grief of some of you Ministers, that reckoned upon mighty Services from them.</p>

well as of countenancing; and what others who serve this Government are ready, and have the Villainy to execute. For as I have seen an authentick <hi>Copy</hi> of the <hi>Orders</hi> under a great Man's hand, requiring it to be done; so I have heard those that perpetrated the bloody Crime, justify the doing of it; upon their having the command of their Master for it, whom they declared themselves resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all Things to obey, without respect to Religion, Law, Justice, Honour or Humanity.
