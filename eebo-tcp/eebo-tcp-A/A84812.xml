         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Something by way of QUERY to the BISHOPS COURTS,</hi> Which we the People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> never yet received an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>CHANSELLOR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>WHY do you not come to Church? Give a Reaſon why you will not come?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I demand of thee the Kings Patten, with his Seal, and his Hand, and his Armes, for keeping thy Court, before I ſpeak to thee any more; For many keep Courts and ſhew not their Authority, and by that I may be brought into Bondage: So I will ſee thy Patten, with the Kings Seal and Hand, and Armes.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would know the Reaſon of thee, Why thou and you forſook us near about twenty years ago, and left your Church? that by this time I might have been turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Heathen,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> and my Soul might have been loſt for thee and you. For who hath watched over me and been my Keeper about theſe twenty years? But you have left me, I have neither <hi>Sermon,</hi> nor <hi>Exhortation,</hi> nor <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> nor <hi>Colect,</hi> nor <hi>Goſpel,</hi> nor <hi>Even-ſong,</hi> nor <hi>Homily,</hi> nor <hi>Mattin,</hi> from you; though the Lord God hath been my Watcher over me, and my Overſeer, who is now my Teacher. And do you think that the Lord will not require his Fock at your hands which you left almoſt twenty years to the Wolves and Dogs, to tear our Fleece, and Fleſh, and to deſtroy the Sheep; and then will he require the Fleece, if he require the Sheep and his Flock, which you have left to Wolves and Dogs, to tear the Fleece off the back of them? For how have <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> torn the Fleſh off the backs of the Sheep, and Priſoned the Sheep to Death: And you in the time of <hi>Perſecution</hi> neither ſent <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> nor <hi>Colect,</hi> nor <hi>Exhortation,</hi> nor <hi>Goſpel,</hi> nor <hi>Even-ſong,</hi> nor <hi>Homily,</hi> nor <hi>Mattin</hi> to the Sheep, nor mattered not them, nor cared for them. For if a man hire a man to keep a flock of Sheep, and have ſo many delivered into his hand, and the hireling Shepherd have ſo much a year, will not the Maſter or the Lord require both Sheep and Fleece of the hireling Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd if he ſee a Dog, or a Wolf, (which may be calling the <hi>Uſurping Power)</hi> come to worry the Sheep, and he fly away in the time of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> is not this an hireling that flies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is an hireling, and doth not care for the Sheep, and worſe than <hi>David</hi> who defended his Sheep from the <hi>Bear</hi> and the <hi>Lyon?</hi> And ſo if the Shepherd ſuffer any of the Sheep to be worried, or Feece to be torn off, Will not the Maſter or Lord require both his Fleece and Sheep of the Shepherd? So read <hi>Jacob to Laban.</hi> For doth not the Lord ſay, <hi>He will require both the Fleece and Flock?</hi> So conſider and judge your ſelves in this caſe, and do not ask me a reaſon <hi>Why I do not come to the Church</hi> but anſwer me this, Why you left me as a Sheep to all the Wolves? For we have the Kings Speech, and Declarations, and Promiſes, and Words of a King for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> that none ſhould call us in queſtion if we live peaceably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Government. Therefore what have you to do to call us in queſtion contrary to the Kings Speech and Declaration, and Word of a King, we being peaceable? As you may read his late Declaration, and there is an Act that Four may meet, So I may meet with my own Family by the Act of Parliament. And ſo if you will give me a Reaſon Why you for ſook us, and prove all your Practice, Worſhip and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by Scripture, and whether or no <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles, Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> had <hi>Tippets, Hoods, Rayles, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Surplices</hi> in their Worſhips? And whether <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> which were called <hi>Biſhops,</hi> were called <hi>Gracious Lords,</hi> as your <hi>Biſhops</hi> are? And whether to be called ſo is not a breach of <hi>Chriſts Command,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>The Gentiles were called Gracious Lords, but it ſhould not be ſo among his Diſciples?</hi> And whether or no <hi>John</hi> Baptized <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a <hi>Font,</hi> and ſigned him with the <hi>Sign of the Croſs?</hi> And whether he had a <hi>God-Father,</hi> or <hi>God-Mother,</hi> yea, or nay? And whether or no thoſe ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that <hi>Peter</hi> Baptized, whether he Baptized them in a <hi>Font,</hi> and ſigned them with the <hi>Sign of the Croſs?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had all theſe <hi>God-Fathers,</hi> and <hi>God-Mothers?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> when <hi>Philip</hi> Baptized him, did he it in a <hi>Font</hi> with the <hi>Sign of the Croſs?</hi> And if ſo, Who were their <hi>God-Fathers</hi> and <hi>God-Mothers,</hi> and where ſtood the <hi>Font,</hi> and who Commanded the <hi>Croſs?</hi> Anſwer me theſe things by Scripture, and convince me by Scripture of theſe things, for we are to ſearch the Scriptures whether theſe things be ſo as you ſpeak, and try all things, and hold faſt that which is good. And we are to lay hands on no man ſuddenly, nor preſume above what is written; thou knoweſt this is Scripture; Read the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the other <hi>Epiſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whether or no the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Timothy,</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> had <hi>Paritors</hi> to ſummon in People to hear them, and if they would not hear them, and come to their Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Place, Excommunicate them before they were of their Religion, or know what it was, and before they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them by ſound Doctrine, and good Converſation? And whether Excommunication be not to ſuch as be of their Church, and know their Principles, and which doth ſome bad thing for which they are Excommunicated and put out of their Aſſemblies? And is this Reaſon to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſuch as were never of their Church, and do not know their Principles or Doctrine, nor cannot be charged with a bad Converſation in any particular, and before they be convinced by ſound Doctrine, or good Converſation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Religion and Worſhip? And is this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Excommunicate thoſe that you ran away from, and leſt to the Devourer, before you ſeek to bring them in again by ſound Doctrine or good Converſation? Anſwer theſe things, <hi>Yea,</hi> or <hi>Nay.</hi>
