            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IT is too common a receiued errour, amongst the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, yea, and amongst not a few persons of better capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that if any bee vexed by a spirit, that such are bewitched.

which many possessed endured, and not a word of any Witch, to set the Diuell on worke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The people which brought the possessed to our Sauiour, complained onely of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, Matth. 15.22. Luk. 9.39. They made no mention of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, nor (for any thing wee reade) had any suspition of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Thus we see the Diuell may bee the sole Agent, without

               <head>CHAP. V.
That seeing men, or women, or beasts may bee afflicted, from some naturall causes: or that some persons may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeite cunningly many things: or that the Deuil may be the sole worker, without consent of a Witch: people are not rashly and in the first place to ascribe the cause to witchcraft.</head>
               <p>IT is an euill too common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the ignorant vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, amongst the superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the popishly-affected, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others of a vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, which are Protestants at large, neutrals in heart, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall, without the power of Religion, and amongst all the generation of vaine people, to thinke presently, when any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill betideth them, that they,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1816:53"/>
or theirs, or their cattell are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, that some man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath brought this euill vpon them. From which irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious &amp; vncharitable thought, so preiudiciall to their soules safetie, many reasons may withdraw them.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The consideration of Gods owne hand, of some naturall causes, of some power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, without any Witch, as in the former Chapter is shewed at large.</p>
               <p n="2">II. An approued truth by long experience, that such as little dreame of Witches, and lightly regard them, are hardly at any time or neuer troubled with them: but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, such as euer liue in suspition of them, such as feare them, giue to them for feare, and vpon any ill hap are euer dreaming, that they are the instruments, and are most plagued by them, which plainely sheweth, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1816:53"/>
this their suspition, feare, and ascribing their harmes to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, doe much displease God, who maketh them to feele the smart thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">III. All doe grant, which haue any knowledge of the power of Witches, that they worke by the Diuell; they curse, banne, threaten: but hee workes the mischiefe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keepe off the Diuell, and there is no feare of a Witch. She may bid him goe, but that is, if he himselfe lift; or if hee please, to satisfie her reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, he must haue leaue from God. For her sending giueth not, nor increaseth any power in the Diuell, either to worke his owne, or her malice vpon any. If a mans own sinnes prouoke not God, if our wayes please him, and that hee hedge vs about (Iob 1.) wee need feare neither Witch, nor Diuell. But let vs cease to sinne,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1816:54"/>
feare God, obey him, and wee shall be safe enough.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The manifold euils which happen and fall out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this so present imaginarie conceit to be bewitched.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It withdraweth mens minds from the consideration of Gods hand so, as they doe not humble themselues before him, as they ought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It maketh them thinke, that though it be a Diuell that afflicteth them, yet that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is sent of God (as ill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits sometimes be) nor that hee commeth of his owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious disposition against man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde (when the Scriptures shew the contrarie) but that the Witch only hath sent him, else had hee not come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them. So as heere their thoughts are wholly vpon the Witch, as if hee or shee were the onely commander and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in this action.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1816:54"/>3. The Deuill hereupon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth great aduantage, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mightily vpon such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which bee so apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue themselues to be bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: For</p>
               <p>First, hee worketh in them a slauish feare, to stand more in awe of the creature, then of the Creator.</p>
               <p>Secondly, vpon this feare, if any thing happen amisse, hee suggesteth a suspition of this or that party to be a Witch.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the suspition a little settled, hee then stirreth the man or woman to vtter the suspition of this or that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Diuell worketh credulitie in those neighbours, and withall sets them on worke to second the relation, with opening of their suspicious thoughts of the same partie; and withall, to tell what they haue either heard from others,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1816:55"/>
or obserued from themselues, that may tend to increase the suspicion, that such an one is a Witch.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, through this credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, this relation, and rumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this suspicion, from one rattling Gossip to another, it is taken for granted, that such an one is a Witch, and hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched such a man, woman, child, seruant, or beast.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, vpon this groweth a generall dislike, with a feare of the said party suspected, so as others vpon any ill hap, begin likewise to blame the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for that ill accident.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, to make vp the Diuels plotted mischiefe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; he maketh the party suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to marke all the words and deeds of the suspected, and to interpret the worst of them, to gather matter to accuse the same of Witchcraft. And to performe this, the Diuell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1816:55"/>
some to seeke to a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard for helpe and counsell, which hel-hound telleth them, that they are bewitched, that they liue by ill neighbours: and hereupon returning home, they publish it amongst their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that now without all peraduenture, such an one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Witch, and hath done this and that harme.</p>
               <p>Lastly, hereupon the Diuell stirreth vp some more impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, more fiery and inraged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest, to seeke reuenge, to hale the suspected before Authori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, to procure his or her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, and at last, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, follow him or her to death, which is that which in all these things the Diuell la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for. For he is a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and delighteth in bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding, especially of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud, as it may fall out in this case, and (as learned men write) sometimes it doth, vpon
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1816:56"/>
onely fallible presumptions.</p>
               <p n="5">V. And lastly, they may be drawn from this their rash con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit so sudden, and soon in their minde, by the Scriptures si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, no where ascribing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which haue not power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to doe what he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them about, whether it bee Angell, Diuell, Man, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature; nor ascribeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them any deede, which they cannot do of themselues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of some other: But Witches are Satans slaues, who cannot doe those euils, which men accuse them of, but the Diuell doth it for them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scriptures ascribe the Acts to the Diuell as his owne, and not vnto Witches (though they consent) because they doe them not themselues.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is done in speciall wisedome from God, to teach all that bee godly (for whose sakes the Scriptures are pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and who indeed make them their rule and guide) to ascribe least vnto Witches, or rather nothing at all in this kinde to them, as the multitude do. But to iudge of a Witch as a Witch,

               <p n="4">4. They are more tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe, and lesse able to hide what they know from others, and therefore in this respect, are more ready to bee teachers of Witchcraft to others, and to leaue it to children, seruants, or to some others, then men.</p>

               <p>For its very probable, that Satan dealeth not altogether with all his now, as hee did once amongst the Heathen, and yet now doth amongst Pagans; nor as he did with the blind sots vnder Popery, or with some of the better lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; nor as he doth with some ignorant, sillie, blockish people amongst vs, vncapable of the knowledge of the Truth and power of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:

but that now, as hee hath taught his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonnes, the Iesuites, to refine Popery somewhat, and to hide from their Proselites in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, the grossenesse of their Idolatrie, to make them swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low downe Popery at the first the more easily: so hath Satan done in this Arte of Witche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Or, it may be this, as Christ allowed some, which openly as yet did not follow him: to haue power to cast out Deuils in his name, Mar. 9.38, 39, 40. who were not, as hee said, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, nor could lightly speake euill of him; so will Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan haue some also, which shall not openly bee his followers, but yet shall worke by his power, and herein also imitate Christ.</p>

               <p>The profession of these Witches is, for the most part, to heale and cure such as bee taken, blasted, strucken, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken, as they vse to speake, and bewitched: all which cures they doe by their compact with the Deuill.</p>
               <p>But though these Witches be almost all healing Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and cannot doe to man, or beast any hurt, except they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure some other to doe it, yet we may finde, that some of these sometimes haue the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble facultie, both to blesse, and to curse, to hurt, and to heale, as it is probable <hi>Balaam</hi> had, at the least in <hi>Balaks</hi> imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

This is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted marke of a Witch, as one Master <hi>Edmunds</hi> of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge told me, who was one that for a time professed to helpe men to goods or money stolne, who was once by the heads of the Vniuersitie que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, as he confessed to mee, when hee had better learned Christ, and giuen ouer his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice that way. He told mee two things (besides many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in a whole afternoones discourse at <hi>Castlehiningham</hi> in Essex) neuer to bee forgotten. 1. That by his Art he could find out him that stole fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, but not for himselfe. 2. That the ground of this Art was not so certa
ine, but that hee might
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1816:83"/>
mistake, and so peraduenture accuse an honest man, in stead of the offender, and therefore gaue it ouer, albeit he said hee might haue made two hundred pound <hi>per annum</hi> of his skill.</p>

the very same which was vpon the bewitched. This skill hee learned of a woman, which taught him a secret, but what that ground of this Witchcraft was, that could I by no meanes procure him to reueale. Some know who are bewitched, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shewed, by their spirit, &amp; some by some Witchery means, of which <hi>Bodinus</hi> maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of many vaine people yet put in practice,<note place="margin">

               <p n="10">X. Lastly, by requiring Faith of such as come vnto them: Physicians expect it not, neither dare any truely fearing God, rob thus God of his honour (who curseth such as trust in man) and yet these VVitches professe, that they cannot heale such as doe not beleeue in them.<note place="margin">

               <p>Neuerthelesse they are made guilty of these mischiefes. 1. Because they call them and bid these spirits doe such euls. 2. Because they speake, and doe such things as please the Deuils, and which they desire and counsell to haue done, while they themselues goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and doe the mischiefe, (which though the Deuils can doe) yet will they not doe it for them, without these watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words, and signes. 3. That they thinke verily, that they haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them power to do the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, laid to their charge, and thereupon they confesse, they hurt such and such persons, or killed this or that man or beast. 4. Because they assume to themselues, a kind of glory
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1816:96"/>
within themselues, when the people feare them, and they haue a ioy in their hearts, that they can awe others so by such thoughts of them. 5.

               <p n="4">IV. Those that most feare them, whom they doe sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to bee Witches, and for feare doe giue something vnto them.

               <p n="3">III. To haue holy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties in our families, to pray with them rising vp, and lying downe, and to lift vp our hearts in holy and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eiaculations in our going out, and in performing the duties of our particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: For, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> saith the Apostle, 1.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Charmes and other detestable remedies v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by vaine people, see <hi>Scot.</hi> b. 12. chap. 21.</note>IT is a miserable thing to see the vanity of people in so clear light of Gods Gospell, how they runne yet, either to vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or to weake and very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine meanes, to relieue themselues in cases of suspected Witchcraft, as these and such like; for I will recite onely the most vsuall.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To runne to a White Witch, and to seeke helpe so from the Deuill, and to put in practice his or her tricks of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie (of which before) to driue away a Deuill, and to helpe the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1816:108"/>
bewitched: an vgodly course as before is proued, and accursed before God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. To beate the suspected, as Master <hi>Enger</hi> did <hi>Mary Sutton</hi> the Bedfordshire witch, vpon which, his seruants were well; so one <hi>William Faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi> did bear <hi>Anne Baker,</hi> the Leicestershire Witch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon his sonne <hi>Thomas</hi> recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and amended. Sometimes such effects follow after, but wee must remember,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this is not euer so, as fell out with one <hi>Henry Mills,</hi> who had ill nights af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Except it bee by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Magistrate, it is against the Law of man, and being a priuate reuenge, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This then being euill, we may not doe it,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.8.</note> that good may come thereof, its no meanes of Gods appointment.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:1816:109"/>4. The torment vpon the partie is by the Deuill, which sometimes the Witch ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue, if shee would: the three Witches of <hi>Warboyse,</hi> would haue vnwitched the Lady <hi>Cromwell,</hi> but could not: if shee doe, it is by making a prayer to him; of which <hi>Bodin</hi> giueth a fearefull example of a Witch,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Li.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> praying to the Deuill, to cure one whom shee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched: And if the Deuill doe cease to torment, it is because he would nourish this reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing practice against both Gods Law, and against the Law of the land; we may not violently iniure others, because they haue hurt vs.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To burne something of the Witches, which, what effect it may haue to heale the bewitched, I know not, nor vpon what ground, either in naturall reason or in religion: but this I am sure of, that when
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1816:109"/>
the Lady <hi>Cromwell,</hi> made some haire of Mother <hi>Samuels</hi> to be cut off, and her hairelace with it to be burnt, the children of Master <hi>Throgmorton</hi> were not the better, and the Lady was bewitched soone after, so as when Mother <hi>Samuel</hi> had try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her husband, and after, her daughter to vnwitch her, they could not. For they may send their spirits to do mischiefe, but it appeareth by this, that the Deuill, except he list, is not at their command to helpe and heale the partie.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. To fetch the suspected,<note place="margin">In the triall of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton.</note> and to <hi>scratch</hi> him or her to get blood, as one Master <hi>Auery</hi> and his sister did scratch two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and drew blood of them at Northhampton, &amp; presently found ease: but this must wee know,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That albeit they had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ease, while the Witches were with them, yet they were
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1816:110"/>
no sooner out of sight, but hee and shee were in their old fits, and more vehemently tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then before. This is then no certaine remedy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is no lawfull remedie, no more then beating the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected. Violence vpon priuate motion, is a reuenge, and wee may not offer it to another, to ease our selues.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is a remedy which the Deuils themselues haue confessed to practise,<note place="margin">The War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> &amp; which the Diuell hath strengthened some to be able to do: as you may reade in the Relation of Master <hi>Throgmortons</hi> children in foure seuerall places, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of one <hi>Mary,</hi> a little child, kneeling on her knees,<note place="margin">The child but 9. yeeres old.</note> who scratched the yong VVitch a big maide, whilst the child was in her fit, and said that the spirit bade her doe it; that the spirit willed her not to pity the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches crying, that the spirit
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1816:110"/>
held downe the Witch to her, that it forced her to scratch, stretching forth her armes, and straining her fingers, whether shee would or no, to doe it. Is this a good and Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, wherewith the Deuill is so well pleased? Neither for all the scratching did the children amend, but were againe in their fits, and that often afterwards. Yea I haue read,<note place="margin">See <hi>Giff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rds</hi> discourse of Witches.</note> that a woman VVitch willed voluntarily one to scratch her to helpe him.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Some in the fits bring in the suspected, and make the same to <hi>Touch</hi> the afflicted par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>This may be vsed, but yet no resting therevpon: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I haue shewed, that by touching they bewitch people: the signe is therefore vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the suspecteds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, though sometime the afflicted hath had ease, as was
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1816:111"/>
proued in Master <hi>Throgmortons</hi> children often; yet in that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we find two things: First, that at Mother <hi>Samuels</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, when Mistresse <hi>Iane Throgmorton</hi> began her fits, she grew worse, and the rest fell into their fits at another time, as soone as they saw her. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the said Mother <hi>Samuel,</hi> when shee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued afterwards, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were the better for her being with them, made a new composition with the Diuell, that they should be ill wen she was with them, and this the children in their fits reuealed openly. So that the Witches presence or absence is but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vncertaine meanes, seeing that is of no force either way, but as they make their league with the Deuill: for there is no naturall reason for it, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ordinance.</p>
               <p>There was another triall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1816:111"/>
very often by M. <hi>Trogmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> to bring his children out of their fits, which was this: to make the Witch to say, <hi>I charge thee, thou deuill, as I loue thee, &amp; haue authority ouer thee, and am a Witch, &amp; guilty of this matter, that thou suffer this child to bee well at this present:</hi> and by and by the child should be well.</p>
               <p>But here note, that the Story telleth vs, that one of the spirits was the author and counsellor to this, and told one of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in her fit, that if <hi>Agnes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> were made to speake these words, the child should for the present be well. What warrant they had to take the Deuils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and to make her vse these words, so cursed &amp; feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, I leaue to the iudgement of the wise and religious.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Some goe to them, and threaten the suspected, to carry them before authority, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute law against them, and to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1816:112"/>
hang them; &amp; thereupon some haue been well.<note place="margin">

               <p>But this is no certaine reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for some Witches are so far from being hereby moued to cease their Witcheries, as on the contrary they are the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to euill, as was <hi>Mary Smith</hi> of Linne, who being threatned by <hi>Iames Scot,</hi> that he would hang her, if his wife had any such fits, as aforetime shee had, did soone after bewitch her againe, &amp; she was tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as formerly she had beene.</p>
               <p>This and such other like means people do vse for ease &amp; helpe, but they are either vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or vnlawfull. The best is <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. That Witches may be discouered, though there be many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therein, and the causes thereof.</head>
               <p>IT is not to bee doubted, but that Witches may be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; this is certaine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From God, in the giuing of his Law against Witches, Exo. 22.18. <hi>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to liue.</hi> Which implyeth a discouery of them, or else it could neuer be put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so should bee a law to no purpose.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From History: First diuine: for <hi>Saul</hi> found our Witches, and executed the Law vpon them, 1. Sam. 28. And so did good <hi>Iosias,</hi> 2. Kin. 23.24. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee haue Chronicles and many relations made of the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1816:113"/>
euident discourse of Witches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How tryals in our owne countrey at many Assises.</p>
               <p>So as it is cleere that Witches may be discouered, though it cannot bee denied, but that there are some difficulties ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that for these reasons:</p>
               <p n="1">I. Because of the secrecy of the grounds of Witchcraft so close and hidden, as being one of the greatest works of darknes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this day vnder the Sun.</p>
               <p n="2">II. For that from naturall causes may arise very strange tortures, pangs and torments, as if the afflicted were bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the iudgement of most ordinary apprehensions.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Because of cunning counterfeits, who can so liuely expresse the outward &amp; visible apparances of such as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, as if they were indeed really possessed &amp; bewitched.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. For that witnesses may feigne their accusations, yea
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1816:113"/>
and confirme them by oath to be true: of which wee haue a notable example of one <hi>Grace,</hi> or rather gracelesse, <hi>Sowerbutts,</hi> inticed by a Priest or Iesuite called <hi>Tomson, alias Southworth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the Witches of Lancaster.</note> to accuse her owne Grand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her Aunt, and another woman, all three Protestants, of Witchery, and that she had by them been afflicted, and seene them in their practices of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, in the night, somtimes in one place, &amp; sometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, naming when, where and how, and the ground of all this was, because they wold not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, forsooth, Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liques: a bloudy practice, fit for a Romanist, and very vnnatural.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Because of the strong ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of such as suspect themselues to bee bewitched, which will make them thinke verily that they see strange ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions; and for feare will dreame of the suspected, and so
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1816:114"/>
may cry out and talke of him or her in their fearefull dreames, the fantasie being oppressed. And if the disease called the <hi>Mare,</hi> happen to such an one, then their sweating, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and struggling, with an imagination of one creeping vpon them, from the feete to their brest, (they awaking in feare and trembling) will make them say and sweare too, that they are bewitched.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. For that vaine persons many times are the pursuers of the suspected, who are so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with rage and vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table desire of reuenge, (they still fearing some harme by them, except they can rid them out of the way) that they will ouer-diligently gather matter to strengthen their suspicions: some out from meere imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; some from words &amp; deeds taken in the worst sense; some from the sight of some creature
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1816:114"/>
on a sudden, as a Cat, Weasell, Polcar, or such like, late in the euening, where they saw not any before; some from idle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of superstitious neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; some from accidents hapning vpon others, vpon a suspected person, and (their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out; &amp; if the pursuers be of some abilitie, to these shall bee added the too confident auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of some flatterers, that such an one is a Witch, and all tending to further the rage of the pursuer, to bring the suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to his or her end.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Because there may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre many seeming probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which commonly mis lead many for want of iudgement, and for want of throughly weighing the weight of them in such a case, taking such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions for sufficient proofe, when they are nothing so.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. And lastly, for want of deepe search into the subtilty
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1816:115"/>
of Satan, who (as is proued) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten worketh without any asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, or league with the Witch: yea (as is also before declared,) the diseases or death of men or beasts may be meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly naturall, and no work of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan therein at all, and yet euen in these things he hath his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous deuices, to make them to be cast vpon some man or woman, altogether innocent of the same and thus he doth it.</p>
               <p>He knoweth when his power is granted him of God to doe hurt to man or beast, also hee knoweth the growing of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall disease in man or beast: he knoweth the ripening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp; at what time it will breake out.

But heere I will set downe such probabilities, as may iustly cause the suspected to be questioned, as these:</p>
               <p n="1">I. To be much giuen to <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:1816:116"/>
and <hi>imprecations,</hi> vpon light occasion, and withall to vse <hi>threatnings</hi> to be reuenged. And presently thereupon euill to happen, and this not <hi>once,</hi> or <hi>twice,</hi> to one or two, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and to diuers persons.</p>
               <p>This is a great presumption (all these circumstances withall considered) because Satan of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himselfe (as before is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) vnto such, and such meanes, wee finde that Witches vse to bewitch men and beasts; yet is this but a presumption, for that many are so bitter spirited, that they will curse &amp; ban, &amp; threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reuenge, and yet be no Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Also Satan is subtill, as is noted in the former Chapter, to make vse of Gods leaue giuen to himselfe, and of the working of naturall diseases, which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cursings breake out, as is caused thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">II. An implicit confession, when any come &amp; accuse them,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1816:117"/>
for vexing them, hurting them, or their cattell; they shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon say, <hi>You should haue let me alone then</hi>: as <hi>Anne Baker</hi> a Witch, said vnto one <hi>Miles</hi>: or, <hi>I haue not hurt you yet,</hi> as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Samuel</hi> said to the Lady <hi>Cromwell,</hi> when she caused her haire to be burnt: or to say to one, <hi>I will promise you that I will doe you no hurt,</hi> vpon this or that condition, as others haue said. These kinde of speeches are in manner of confession of their power of hurting, and yet but a presumption; because such speeches haue beene, and are vsed vpon diuers occasions, by others which are no Witches.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The suspecteds diligent inquiry after the sicke party, and an ouer-inquisitiuenesse to know how such an one doth, falling sicke presently vpon his or her cursing and threatning, with the suspecteds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to visit him or her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1816:117"/>
for, especially after they be forbidden the house. Thus haue those done which haue beene found condemned for Witches: yet but a presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because mans heart being reuengefull, and hauing cursed and threatned, and hearing of some sudden mischance, is so taken vp with a cursed ioy, as maketh him or her thus to do, and yet by no league with the Diuell. For <hi>Salomons</hi> words may not onely bee applyed to Witches, but euen to all others, as an inbred euil in mans heart, <hi>Reioyce not at the fall of thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> And for comming being forbidden, it is the impudency of some of the poorer sort, rude and ill-mannered to doe so, and to bring some small thing to curry fauour againe.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The naming of the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in their fits, and also where they haue been, &amp; what they haue done here or there, as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1816:118"/>
Master <hi>Throgmortons</hi> children could doe,<note place="margin">Relation of <hi>Warboys</hi> Witches.</note> and that often, and euer found true.

And Satan, wee reade,<note place="margin">Iob 1.</note> would accuse <hi>Iob</hi> to God himselfe to bee an hypocrite, and to be ready to bee a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer. And hee is called the Accuser of the Brethren.<note place="margin">Reuel. 12.</note> Albeit I cannot deny, but this hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often proued true: yet seeing the diuell is such an one, as you heard, Christian men should
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1816:118"/>
not take his witnesse, to giue in a verdict vpon oath, and so sweare that the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll hath therein spoken the truth. Be it far from good men to confirme any word of the diuell by oath, if it bee not an euident t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uth, without the Diuels testimony, who in speaking the truth, hath a lying inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp; speaketh some truths of things done, which may be found to be so, that hee may wrap with them some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious lye, which cannot bee tryed to be true, but must rest vpon his owne testimony to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare the bloud of the innocent.</p>
               <p n="5">V. An apparition of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty suspected, whom the afflicted in their fits seeme to see. This is a great suspition: for some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched haue cryed out, seeing those who were suspected to be Witches, and called vpon them by name, as Mistresse <hi>Belcher</hi> in Northamptonshire, of <hi>Ioane Vaughan,</hi> M. <hi>Engers</hi> man, or
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1816:119"/>
                  <hi>Mary Sutton</hi> of Bedfordshire. So did M. <hi>Throgm.</hi> children vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mother <hi>Samuel:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P. de Loyer de spectris.</hi>
                  </note> yet this is but a presumption, though a strong one: because these appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions are wrought by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, who can represent vnto the fantasie such as the parties vse to feare, in which his represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, hee may as well lye, as in his other witnesse. For if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell can represent the Witch a seeming <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 28.</note> saying, <hi>I see Gods ascending out of the earth,</hi> to beguile <hi>Saul</hi>; may wee not thinke he can represent a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ordinary person, man or woman vnregenerate (though no Witch) to the fantasie of vaine persons, to deceiue them and others, that will giue credit to the Diuell?</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The common report of neighbours of all sorts, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the suspected be of kin to a conuicted Witch, as sonne, daughter, brother, sister, neece,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1816:119"/>
or nephew, or Grandchild, or a seruant man or maid, or of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acquaintance with such an one. This is a cause of suspicion: For common reports of neere neighbours of all sorts do arise out of some shewes, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are known to endeuour to make others Witches, such as they dayly conuerse with, as Mother <hi>Samuel</hi> of <hi>Warboys</hi> did her daughter: old <hi>Dembdike</hi> the Lancashire Witch did her grand-daughter, &amp; grand-son, her daughter and a neighbour of hers; yet all this is but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; because a common report may arise, though not vpon no grounds, yet vpon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weake grounds, being duely examined: and though witches doe labour to make others like themselues; yet we find, when Mothers haue beene executed for witchery, some of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue not onely beene no Witcherly miscreants, but by
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1816:120"/>
Gods mercy, haue become reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and zealous Christians, of which I could giue some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The testimony of a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, the cunning man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; this may be a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption: for who can better discouer a Witch, then a witch? and many haue bin found such, whom the Wizard hath accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be Witches. But yet this is but a presumption; because, if he be not a counterfeit (taking vpon him to know more then hee doth) but indeed a very Witch; yet is his testimony sometime the testimony onely of the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell, by whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to know another to be a Witch, and not vpon his owne knowledge; and though in this case he be found to speake true sometimes, yet may he lye also, being instructed by the father of lyes.</p>
               <p>But as concerning this Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1816:120"/>
if a Wizard happen to cast out of himselfe an accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, it may bee vsed for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption: but none may goe to such an one to aske his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, nor vse his skill to discouer a Witch, no more then for this end, to goe to the diuell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>To vse a sieue and a paire of sheeres, with certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To burne some cloathes in which the sicke party lyeth, for to torment the Witch; to burne part of the creature in paine; to burne aliue one, to saue the rest; &amp; to make the Witch to come thither: These are execrable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices made to the diuell, to be abhorred of all true Christians.<note place="margin">

The Romanes in old time put to death such as by Magick would discouer theeues, to come by their goods stolne. Christians then should abhorre these abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. Some think it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to try one suspected, by cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him or her into the water, and binde their armes acrosse: and if they sinke not, but doe swim, then to be iudged Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as M. <hi>Enger</hi> tryed vpon <hi>Mary Sutton,</hi>

               <p>TO conuict any one of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, is to proue <hi>a league made with the Deuil.</hi> In this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act standeth the very reality of a Witch; without which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she nor he (howsoeuer sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and great shewes of probability concurring) are not to be condemned for witches. Without this league, they bee free, though the Deuill hurt mens bodies, kill their ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is the principall point to be enquired after in all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries; this must be only aimed at; all presumptions must tend to proue this, and to discouer this league; without which, no word, no touching, no brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no giuing nor receiuing,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1816:122"/>
are of force to bewitch any.</p>

               <p>This league therfore, though neuer so secretly made, is to bee discouered; seeing it is that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which maketh a Witch, &amp; by which all is done, which iustly can be laid to her or his charge.</p>
               <p>Now, they that make this league, haue a Familiar spirit. For this is true, as soone as the league is made, the spirit, one or moe, is familiar with them, as before is proued.

               <p>Inquiry may be made of these: 1. Touching the afflicted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, what his conuersation is; and whether there be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie of counterfeiting?

2. Vpon what grounds they haue thus accused the said par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? for such an one may know the other to be a witch, one of these two waies: 1.

               <p n="2">2. Whether they haue heard the suspected to foretell of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to befal any, or heard them speake of their power to hurt this or that, or of their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, to this or that place,

               <p>Now, while these sorts are in examining, it were very good, in the meane space, to haue a godly and learned Diuine, and somewhat well read in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of Witchcraft and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties thereof, to be instructing the suspected, of the points of saluation, of the damnable cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse of Witchcraft, and his or her fearefull state of death e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, if guilty and not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.

               <p n="2">2. That Satan is a powerfull Deceiuer, and Seducer, who can make an <hi>Eue</hi> in Paradise, (being in the state of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to beleeue him, the Diuell, before God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That by nature corrupt, we are no lesse apt to be mis-led
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1816:144"/>
by him,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.1, 2. Col. 3.3, 7.</note> then they; walking in sinnes and trespasses, according to the course of the world, and according to the Prince of darknesse, in inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and other lusts, being foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, disobedient,<note place="margin">Titus 3.3. Ephes. 2.</note> deceiued, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diuers lusts &amp; pleasures, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in malice, enuy, hatefull, and hating one another. Thus by nature are we the children of wrath, and bemyred with the filth of sinne, as wel as they.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That therefore our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ariseth not, from within our selues, as from our owne wisedome, will and power: but we are kept from their Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, either by Gods restraining power: as he kept the King of <hi>Gerar Abimelech</hi> from Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie: as also <hi>Pharaoh</hi> from <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife: or by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting grace; so euery one must say with Saint <hi>Paul: By the grace of God, I am that I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:1816:144"/>5. Consider, that some so dreadfully catched by Satan, may be Gods seruants, and bee conuerted; as was <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and also Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> of whom before. And did not such as vsed curious Arts, euen Magicke, turne to God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue?</p>
               <p>Therefore let vs behold in them a spectacle of mans mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as being left of God vnto the power of the Diuell, and so be moued with compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to pray for their conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In our selues preserued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the mercifull goodnesse of our God, and so bee stirred vp to praise his name. Thus shall we make a good vse of both, and behaue our selues as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Christians ought to doe.</p>

               <p>MAny things may seeme very strange, and hardly to be beleeued, which are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee done betweene the Diuell and Witches. But all this will seeme no wonder, if men doe wisely consider, that Satan endeuoureth to bee an imitator of God, not to please him, but rather to crosse him, and to beguile these hellish Apostates, and to increase the more their sinnes, and iust condemnation.</p>
