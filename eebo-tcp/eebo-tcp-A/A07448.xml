            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

father Time. All morall
Phylosophie is diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three parts; Ethicall,
Oeconomicall and Politicall. All Law
is reduced to three heads; to the Law
of Nature, to ancient custome, and to
the ordinances of men. And to insist in
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wne state: All our Parliaments
consist of three sorts of people, Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
Cleargie, and Comminaltie. And
all our tryals and iudgements are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
after three formes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
by Parliament, by Battell, and
by the great Assise: So all the force of
wit may flow within three chanels, and
bee contriued into three heads; into a
Sentence, a Similitude, &amp; an Example.
<hi>Carolus</hi> said, that warres were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with victuals, money and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours:
so Wit is nourished with
<pb facs="tcp:22311:3"/>
Sentences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Similitudes, and Examples.
And therefore as three things are
necessarie for a Scholler; a Will, a
Wit and a Booke: so I hold that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
Similitudes, and Examples,
are as necessarie to vphold a Wit. <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi> vsed to carry three things about
with him, when he followed the wars;
his pen to write the whole course of the
Romanes successe in their warres; his
Bookes to find himselfe occupied, and
his Launce to repulse his enemies: so
he that would write or speake pithily,
perspicuously, and persuasiuely must
vse to haue at hand in readinesse, three
kind of orn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ments and effectuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
Sentences, Similitudes, and
Examples. Wherefore as <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
wished three things for himselfe;
Health, Beautie and Riches: so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the necessitie and excellency of
these three heads, haue long wished the
accom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ishment &amp; publication of them.
And in truth what can I desire more,
then to see the naked Truth arrayed in
Sentences, fitting the tast of Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers;
inuested in Similitudes, loued
of Oratours; and approued by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb facs="tcp:22311:3"/>
the rule and leuell of the vnstayed
and raging multitude? Saint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Augustine</hi>
desired to see three things, <hi>Paulus Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi>
triumphing; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and <hi>Christ</hi> vpon the Crosse; in the
first, hee desired to see the glory of the
earth; in the second the glorie of the
Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the third, the glorie
of Heauen: so haue I long desired to see
three things; Truthes soundnesse in
Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ences, her elegancie in Similituds,
and approbation by examples. And
now I haue my wished desire. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may reioyce for three things, as
<hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> reioyced.
Hee ioyed; that hee had wonne the
Games at <hi>Olympus</hi> by the running of
his Chariots; that his Captaine <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio</hi>
had ouerthrowne the <hi>Dardari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
and that his wife <hi>Olympia</hi> had
borne him a Sonne, called <hi>Alexander:</hi>
So I exceedingly reioyce, and am glad
at my heart, that the first part of <hi>Wits
Common-wealth,</hi> contayning Sentences,
hath like a braue Champion gloriously
marched and got such renowned fame
by swift running, equiualent with
<hi>Philips</hi> Chariots, that thrice within
<pb facs="tcp:22311:4"/>
one yeare it hath runne thorow the
Presse. If this second part of mine, called
<hi>Wits Common-wealth</hi> contayning Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes,
being a stalke of the same
stemme, shall haue the like footman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and find the same successe, then
with <hi>Parmenio</hi> I shall be the second in
<hi>Philips</hi> ioy. And then <hi>Philips</hi> ioy will
eft-soones be full, for his <hi>Alexander,</hi>
whom not <hi>Olympia,</hi> but a worthy
Scholler is conceiuing, who wil fill the
third part of <hi>Wits Common-wealth</hi> with
moe glorious Examples, then great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
did the world with valiant &amp;
heroicall exploits. <hi>Lampedo</hi> is iudged
happy for euer, as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, for
three causes; for that she was a Kings
Daughter, a Kings Wife, and a Kings
Mother. <hi>Thales</hi> to one that asked him,
who was happy, said; <hi>Quicorpore sanus
est, fortuna diues, animo eruditus:</hi> So
I iudge him of an happy Wit, who is
profound and substantiall in Sentences;
eloquence and ingenious in Similituds;
and rich and copious in Examples.</p>
            <p>The first part being published some
yeares agoe, hath had the worlds fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and furtherance, which hath made
<pb facs="tcp:22311:4"/>
him so cranke, young and fresh, that
thrice in one yeare hee hath renued his
age, a spring more then is in fruitfull
<hi>Saba.</hi> If this second part may find as
much fauour and countenance with you
gentle Reader, as <hi>Antimachus</hi> the Poet
found with <hi>Plato,</hi> it shall bee <hi>instar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>omnium</hi>
to me, and therewith conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I shall willingly send this second
with the first, to take what fortune
Wit will send him. Which I hope and
wish may bee as kindly accepted, as I
doe heartily offer them. Which if I
shall perceiue, neuer was <hi>Aristotle</hi>
more gratefull to <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor
<hi>Enuius</hi> to <hi>Scipio,</hi> nor <hi>Virgill</hi> to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
nor <hi>Horace</hi> to <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> nor
<hi>Pliny</hi> to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> nor <hi>Plutarch</hi> to

among the hot spices, wherewith <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Epaminondes</hi> being sore wounded in

Then whether his buckler were whole
or no. They answered also I. Nay then

For now your deere <hi>Epaminondes</hi>

borne againe then buried: so Christ was
sore wounded, but his enemies, death
and the Deuill were ouerthrowne and
spoyled: His Buckler, which was his
Godhead, was whole and vntonched.
Therefore there was no harme done. His
death was no death, but an exaltation
vnto greater glory.</p>

               <p>New Wine is more pleasant then
wholsome, and Grapes gathered before

is by time and fancy banished from the
heart.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Salamander,</hi> which being a

               <p>Hearbs that are the worse for water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

hedge, but blacke in the hand: so are
many beautious women, fairely made,
but fowly mannered.</p>
               <p>As by the current of a streame, we
come to the Fountane: so when we
meete with any beautifull body we
should follow the perfect regard there,
of so farre till we are arriued at the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
point and ground-worke, which
is God himselfe, for from him all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
hath originall.</p>
               <p>As fire burneth those that either
touch it, or stand too neare it: so
beautie inflameth those that either
stand neare it, or farre off. <hi>Xenophon
apud Stobaeum. serm.</hi> 64.</p>
               <p>As the fairest Leopard hath his spots,
the finest cloth his list, &amp; the smoothest
shooe his last: so the most blazing
beautie hath some blemish.</p>
               <p>Where the wine is neate, there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no Iuy-bush, the right Corall
needeth no coloring: so where is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
there needeth no painting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:22311:178"/>As the Adamant draweth the heauie
Iron, the harpe the fleete Dolphin: so
beautie allureth the chast mind to loue,
and the wisest wit to lust.</p>
               <p>The purple dye will neuer staine, the
puer Ciuet will neuer loose his sauour,
the greene Lawrell will neuer change
his colour: so beauty can neuer be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with discourtesie.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Milo</hi> that great wrastler began to
weepe, when hesaw his armes brawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen

strength, is but vaine: so <hi>Helen</hi> in her
new glasse, viewing her old face, with
smileing countenance, cryed, <hi>Beautie,
where is thy blaze?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As when the counterfeit of <hi>Ganimede</hi>

therein shewed his greatest cunning: so
when a beautifull woman appeareth in
a multitude, euery man is drawne to
sue to her, for that God hath shewed
such rare art in her.</p>
               <p>As a fresh colour doth easily dimme
a quicke fight; as a sweet Rose doth
soonest pierce a fine sent; as pleasant
sirrups doe chiefliest infect a delicate

allure them that haue the wantonnest
eyes, and the whitest mouthes. <hi>Lilly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Eagle soares not so high in the

               <p>As the Bauin is but a blaze: so
beautie.</p>
               <p>As the gorgeous Cedar is onely for

Apples of <hi>Tantalus</hi> are precious in the

               <p>As the fairestiroses haue pricks; the

those that are beautifull haue many

times imperfect conditions, for nature
hauing care to polish the body so farre,
ouer weenes her selfe in her excellency,
that shee leaues their minds vnperfect:</p>
               <p>As the Adamant draweth the iron,
the Ieat the straw, and the sight of the
Panther the Ermly: so doth beautie
draw the eyes of youth.</p>
               <p>The Lapidarie thus chuseth a true
Saphyre, when he seeth it to glister,
he couereth it with Oyle, and then if it
shine, he alloweth it, if not, he
breaketh it: so if thou fall in loue with
one that is beautifull, cast some kind
of colour in her face, either as it were

               <p>Those that are stung of the Scorpion,
are healed of the Scorpion; the fire that
burneth taketh away the heate of the

poysoneth, doth with her skin make a
plaster for poyson; the speare that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:22311:180"/>

so he that is wounded and stung with
beautie, must bee cured and healed
with beautie.</p>
               <p>Siluer although it bee white, yet it
draweth blacke lines: so <hi>Rodophe, Lais,</hi>
and <hi>Phrine,</hi> although they had beautiful
faces, yet they had foule deeds.</p>
               <p>The skinne of the Ermelin is desired,
and the carkasse despised; the horne of
the Vnicorne most preciously receiued,
and his flesh reiected; the hoofe of the
Leopard is the thing the hunter seekes,
or else he is contemned: so the beauty
and riches of a woman are highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
of most men, but her honesty
and vertue are lightly esteemed.</p>
               <p>As the Deare with the sight of a faire
Apple standeth at gaze: so men through
beautie are driuen into a maze.</p>
               <p>As Beauty made <hi>Venus</hi> to loue <hi>Anchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi>

beautifull persons haue stood
as though with <hi>Medusaes</hi> head they

               <p>As <hi>Pigmaleon</hi> for beautie loued his
Image of Iuory: so the beautifull picture

Ladies of <hi>Cypres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wise Lapidaries say, that the
prescious stone with the most glistering
hew, hath alwayes the most secrete
vertue, the pure Gold is chosen by the
perfect colour; the best fruite, by the
branest blossomes: so the best conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are commonly discerned by the
sweetest countenance.</p>
               <p>As the Dormouse cannot shut his
eye, as long as he lyeth in the beame
of the Sunne; and as the Deare cannot
cease from braying, where the hearbe
<hi>Moly</hi> groweth: so beautie causeth one
to stare, so long as it is in presence.</p>
               <p>As the stone <hi>Topason</hi> is not more
loued for the outward hue, then hated
for the poyson, which secretly is hid
within it; or as the herbe <hi>Nepenthes</hi>
is not more liked for the pleasant

so beautie cannot inflame the fancy so
