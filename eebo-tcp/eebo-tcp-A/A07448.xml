            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

father Time. All morall
Phylosophie is diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three parts; Ethicall,
Oeconomicall and Politicall. All Law
is reduced to three heads; to the Law
of Nature, to ancient custome, and to
the ordinances of men. And to insist in
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>wne state: All our Parliaments
consist of three sorts of people, Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
Cleargie, and Comminaltie. And
all our tryals and iudgements are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
after three formes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
by Parliament, by Battell, and
by the great Assise: So all the force of
wit may flow within three chanels, and
bee contriued into three heads; into a
Sentence, a Similitude, &amp; an Example.
<hi>Carolus</hi> said, that warres were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with victuals, money and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours:
so Wit is nourished with
<pb facs="tcp:22311:3"/>
Sentences<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Similitudes, and Examples.
And therefore as three things are
necessarie for a Scholler; a Will, a
Wit and a Booke: so I hold that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
Similitudes, and Examples,
are as necessarie to vphold a Wit. <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi> vsed to carry three things about
with him, when he followed the wars;
his pen to write the whole course of the
Romanes successe in their warres; his
Bookes to find himselfe occupied, and
his Launce to repulse his enemies: so
he that would write or speake pithily,
perspicuously, and persuasiuely must
vse to haue at hand in readinesse, three
kind of orn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ments and effectuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
Sentences, Similitudes, and
Examples. Wherefore as <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
wished three things for himselfe;
Health, Beautie and Riches: so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the necessitie and excellency of
these three heads, haue long wished the
accom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ishment &amp; publication of them.
And in truth what can I desire more,
then to see the naked Truth arrayed in
Sentences, fitting the tast of Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers;
inuested in Similitudes, loued
of Oratours; and approued by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb facs="tcp:22311:3"/>
the rule and leuell of the vnstayed
and raging multitude? Saint<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <hi>Augustine</hi>
desired to see three things, <hi>Paulus Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi>
triumphing; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and <hi>Christ</hi> vpon the Crosse; in the
first, hee desired to see the glory of the
earth; in the second the glorie of the
Gospell<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and in the third, the glorie
of Heauen: so haue I long desired to see
three things; Truthes soundnesse in
Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ences, her elegancie in Similituds,
and approbation by examples. And
now I haue my wished desire. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may reioyce for three things, as
<hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> reioyced.
Hee ioyed; that hee had wonne the
Games at <hi>Olympus</hi> by the running of
his Chariots; that his Captaine <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio</hi>
had ouerthrowne the <hi>Dardari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
and that his wife <hi>Olympia</hi> had
borne him a Sonne, called <hi>Alexander:</hi>
So I exceedingly reioyce, and am glad
at my heart, that the first part of <hi>Wits
Common-wealth,</hi> contayning Sentences,
hath like a braue Champion gloriously
marched and got such renowned fame
by swift running, equiualent with
<hi>Philips</hi> Chariots, that thrice within
<pb facs="tcp:22311:4"/>
one yeare it hath runne thorow the
Presse. If this second part of mine, called
<hi>Wits Common-wealth</hi> contayning Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes,
being a stalke of the same
stemme, shall haue the like footman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and find the same successe, then
with <hi>Parmenio</hi> I shall be the second in
<hi>Philips</hi> ioy. And then <hi>Philips</hi> ioy will
eft-soones be full, for his <hi>Alexander,</hi>
whom not <hi>Olympia,</hi> but a worthy
Scholler is conceiuing, who wil fill the
third part of <hi>Wits Common-wealth</hi> with
moe glorious Examples, then great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
did the world with valiant &amp;
heroicall exploits. <hi>Lampedo</hi> is iudged
happy for euer, as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, for
three causes; for that she was a Kings
Daughter, a Kings Wife, and a Kings
Mother. <hi>Thales</hi> to one that asked him,
who was happy, said; <hi>Quicorpore sanus
est, fortuna diues, animo eruditus:</hi> So
I iudge him of an happy Wit, who is
profound and substantiall in Sentences;
eloquence and ingenious in Similituds;
and rich and copious in Examples.</p>
            <p>The first part being published some
yeares agoe, hath had the worlds fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and furtherance, which hath made
<pb facs="tcp:22311:4"/>
him so cranke, young and fresh, that
thrice in one yeare hee hath renued his
age, a spring more then is in fruitfull
<hi>Saba.</hi> If this second part may find as
much fauour and countenance with you
gentle Reader, as <hi>Antimachus</hi> the Poet
found with <hi>Plato,</hi> it shall bee <hi>instar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>omnium</hi>
to me, and therewith conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I shall willingly send this second
with the first, to take what fortune
Wit will send him. Which I hope and
wish may bee as kindly accepted, as I
doe heartily offer them. Which if I
shall perceiue, neuer was <hi>Aristotle</hi>
more gratefull to <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor
<hi>Enuius</hi> to <hi>Scipio,</hi> nor <hi>Virgill</hi> to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
nor <hi>Horace</hi> to <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> nor
<hi>Pliny</hi> to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> nor <hi>Plutarch</hi> to

Then whether his buckler were whole

For now your deere <hi>Epaminondes</hi>

borne againe then buried: so Christ was
sore wounded, but his enemies, death
and the Deuill were ouerthrowne and
spoyled: His Buckler, which was his
Godhead, was whole and vntonched.
Therefore there was no harme done. His
death was no death, but an exaltation
vnto greater glory.</p>

of Storkes, but that they are come;
neither knoweth any man of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
but when they are gone; because
they doe both priuily in the night: so no
man vnderstandeth that youth depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

that old age is comming, but
when it is come. <hi>Plin. libro 10. cap.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>As the parting of waies doth but a
little differ at the first, but the further
that their parting extendes, the distance
is more and more increased, so that their
differences are very spatiously opposed:
so in the youth a little progresse of
yeares doth make a great difference.

learne with great study, wee neuer
forget.</p>
               <p>As they that loue lightly, doe reioyce
at the presence of a friend, but being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
doe easily forget him, but they that
loue entirely and dearely, doe not suffer
that to bee absent from them, which
they loue: so some are easily pulled by
businesses from the study of Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
but they that truely loue her,
neglect all things before they will bee
drawne from her, neither can any
thing without her bee pleasant vnto
them. <hi>Plut.</hi>

               <p>As beasts feed one, one where, and

some, whilest they study to bee both
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:22311:283"/>
diuines, and rhetoricians, are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
of neither.</p>
               <p>As from the people called <hi>Seres</hi> there
comes the softest silkes, and the hardest
iron: so from some diuers studies and
contrarious endeuours doe proceede.</p>
               <p>The Crocodile sometimes liueth in
the water, and sometimes on the land,
shee layeth her egges in the land, and
getteth her prey in the water: so whilst
some study to bee both Prelats and
Courtiers, they become pestilent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
both in Church and Court.</p>
               <p>Wine moderately drunke doeth
strengthen the sinewes, and corrobarate
the sight, but taken immoderately
doth hurt them both: so by moderate
study the life is adorned, but immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately

knew no time to take his hand from the

table: so some students and writers are
much to blame, because they neither
know time to leaue of their study, nor
know not when a thing is sufficiently
amended.</p>
               <p>Nightingals doe so contend in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they dye in the contention,
their breath rather failing them then
their song: so some by too much study
extinguish their health, and whilest

were more blockish, then that
they could bee deceiued of him: so the
riper and pregnanter the wit is, the

               <p>As <hi>Cato</hi> when hee was a Scholler

               <p>As in the same pasture the Bee seaseth
on the flower, the Goate grazeth on
the shrub, the swine on the roote, and
the Oxen, Kine and Horses on the

History, and other for ornament of
speech, and an other for proofe and an
other for precepts of good life. <hi>idem.</hi>

               <p>As they that come very suddenly out
of a very darke place, are greatly
troubled, except by little and little they
be accustomed to the light: so in reading
of Poets, the opinions of Phylosophers
are to bee sowne in the minds of young

               <p>As in the portraiture of murder or

so in laciuious Poets let vs imitate their

all leane to one side, but is in saftie, one
leaning one way, and another another

they lesse infect their readers. And for
this purpose our Satyrists, <hi>Hall, the

are very profitable.</p>
