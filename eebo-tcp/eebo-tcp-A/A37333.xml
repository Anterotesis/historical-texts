            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>KNowing that you are diſirous to hear newes from <hi>Scotland,</hi> I thought fit to ſhow you that that Act wherby all publick Officers are obleadged to take the Teſt, is rigorowſly put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutione, and therby many perſons baith in Kirk and State, throughout the hall<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Lounes it ſeems fell intil a debate amongiſt themſelves, whither or no, ane Maſtiffe Tyke, who keept the outmoſt gate, might not by reaſone of his Office of Truſt, come within the compaſſe of the Act, and ſwa, be obleadged to take the Teſt, or be turned out of his place,</p>
            <p>(The Tyke therupon was called, and interrogat, whither he wold take the Teſt, or run the hazard of forfaulting his Office, whilk was asked again, and again.</p>
            <p>The ſilly Curr boding no ill, anſwered all their Queries with ſilence, whill<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Debat laſted not long, until all agreed, that ane Printed Copy ſhould be thrumbled of as little boulke as it could, and therafter ſmured over with Tallow, Butter, or what elſe might make maiſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his appetit; this done, he readiely took it, and after he had made a ſhift, by rowing it up and down his mouth, to ſeparat what was pleaſant to his pallat, and when all ſeemed to be over, on a ſudden they obſerved ſomehat (ilke piece after another) droped out of his Mouth, qwhilk the Advocats on the other ſide ſaid it was the Teſt, and that all his irkſome champing and chowing of it, was only, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to ſeperat the concomitant nutriment, and that this was mikel worſe then an flat refuſal, and gif it were rightly examined, would upon Tryal be ſound no leſs then Leiſeing-making.</p>
            <p>To this his Advocat opponed, That his Enemies having the rowing of it up, might perhaps (through deadly ſpite) have put ſome crooked prin intil it, and that all the ſu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ling and rowing of it up and down his mouth, might be by reaſon of the prin, and not through any ſcu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ering at the Teſt it ſelf, and that ther was nought in the hail matter, that looked like Leiſeing-making, except by interpretation, and his Adverſaries allowed to be the only Interpreters. Yea, what was mair offered, that his Client ſhould have a fair Tryal before competent Judges, qwhilk was unanimouſly granted.</p>
            <p>A Court therupon being convocat, ane aſſize conſtitut, the Indictment being read, ther fell out warm pleading upon baith ſides, amongſt the Advocats, thoſe againſt him pleaded, that he was <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> to take ſo mikel upon him, and that the chaming and cherking of the Teſt belonged nought to him, nor to none like him, who ſerved only in inferior Offices, and that his truſt and power reached nought ſo far, and by what he had done, he had made himſelf guilty of mair nor a bare refuſal, according as was Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Thoſe for him pleaded, That he could be guilty of nather, ſince he had freely taken it in his Mouth, willing to have ſwallowed it down, and that ther was no fault in him, bot in its ſelf, that it paſſed not, ſince it fell a ſqwabeling, one part of it hindering another fighting in his halfe, and if wold have agreed in its ſelf, to have gone down all one way, he wold blaithly ſwallowed it, as he had done many untouthſome morſel before, as is well known to all the Court, ane other pleaded, that he had officiat very dutifully, and was niver known to balk his Truſt: bot that was anſwered with this, all his former good Service could not excuſe his preſent guilt; guilt qwoth an other, if that be guilt, he hath many marrows, and why ſhould he be worſe handled then all the reſt? bot what ever could be ſaid in his favors, when the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs came to the Jury, they found that he had ſo mangled the Teſt with his explanatory tongue and teeth, and ſwa miſleardly abuſed it with his ſlaver, that it was right ſoon agreed upon, to be at leaſt Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-Treaſon, and conſequently brought him in guilty of Leiſeing-making. Wherupon he was ordered to cloſe Priſon, till ane other time, that the Court call him forth to receive his doom, to be hanged like a Dog.</p>
            <p>(As the Lounes was removing him from Court to Priſon, ther chanced a Curat to be preſent, who ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what was the matter, what ailed them at the Dog? one of the Limmers anſwered, That he being in publick Truſt, was reqwired to take the Teſt, and had both refuſed it, and abuſed it, wherupon he was to be hanged; the Curat ſtorming, ſaid, They deſerve all to be hanged for ſuch preſumptuous mockery; the Lounes laughing aloud, cryed out with one conſent, That he and his Brethren deſerved better to be hanged, then any of them, or the Tyke eather, ſmoe they had ſwallowed that which the Tyke had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</p>
            <p>This ſurpriſeing Verdict, you may be ſure, created no ſmall grumbling of the guſſorne with the Advocats and others, who ſpared not to utter ther private ſentiments, and blaze abroad the Arguments <hi>Pro,</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and what further might have been homolagating, had not the Court haiſted to have the Tykes Life, take a few of them as they come to hand.</p>
            <p>Some ſuſpected deadly fewd in the Chanſelor of the Jury, alleadging that ane Enemy was not fit to be a Judg, this was anſwered with, that he was of more Noble Extract, then to ſtain his Honor with ſo baſe an Act, and that his own Reputation wold make him favored; an other objected, that a Tykes refuſing ſo good a Teſt, might be of ill example to Creatures of better reaſon; to this a pakie Loun anſwered, That it could not be good, ſince Lyon Rampant, King of Tykes, nor none of his Royal Kine, wold not ſo much as lay ther Lips to it, far leſs to ſwallow it, and therfore,—this was interrupted by on, who was a principal Limmer among them (a contradiction reconciler) who wold needs help him with a Logical diſtinction, wherby he like ane <hi>Aberdeens</hi> man, might Cant and Recant again.</p>
            <p>Bot he was ſoon ſnibed by another, who ſaid, That the Tyke wold nather ſup Kail with the Div'l, nor the Pope, and therfore needed not his long Spoon; well ſaid ane other, this is mair nor needs, ſince we

Nay, qwoth his Nighbour, the hazard was greater then ye imagine, for the Teſt, as it was rowed up, had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plyes and implications in it, one contrary to another, and ſwa the Tyke might have been qucikened ere it had been all over, ilk ply as it were rancountering another wreſling and fighting in his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
