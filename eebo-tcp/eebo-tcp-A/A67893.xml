         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I haue receiued your letters, and according to your desire, haue returned these few lines in answer thereunto. If I haue not so fully satisfied the particulars of your letters, as I wished and purposed, I pray you impute it not to any want of will, but vnto my disaquaintance with your Dutch tongue and hand: I should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture haue giuen you better satisfaction then now I doe, If you had written to me in the Latine tongue. But to leaue excuses and come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the thing you touch in your Letter is but too too true, to wit, that the hatred and dissension a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians (if it continue, as God defend it should) is, and will be the cause of much innocent bloud-shedding amongst friends, and of estranging the hearts of Heathens, from the worship of the true God. And therefore that enimitie amongst friends may cease, and that such as are as yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, may bee allured to submit themselues to the scepter of Iesus Christ: it standeth vs vpon (who are Preachers of the Gospell of peace) to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of peace, which for my owne part how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling I am to doe, is not vnknowne to such as know my selfe, and among whom I doe daily conuerse. I haue alwaies both in publike and priuate, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to our Worshipfull company in <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19295:3"/>
by liuely voice to our Commanders here in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> declared how good a thing it is for vs that are Christians, professing one Faith, one Christ, one Baptisme, to liue in peace, and to dwell together in vnitie. And of this my earnest desire to be a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, <hi>Master Brancraft</hi> your Master of the <hi>Black-Lyon,</hi> who remained after his taking some weekes aboord of the <hi>Royall Iames,</hi> can giue euident testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony &amp; witnesse. And now that you haue written to this end, I will stir vp my selfe, and set a fresh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worke of reconciliation. It is pelfe indeed and pride, that is the Make-bate breeding strife and discord: for, had not the riches of the <hi>Moloccos</hi> and the robbing of the <hi>Chinaes</hi> and others by you, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the English colours, fathering thereby your theft vpon vs, cast you into a deepe and deadly <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie,</hi> you would not as you haue done, haue abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed your best friends abroad, that haue shed so much of their deerest bloud in defence of you and your country at home; but now you are freed from the Spaniard at home, you fall out with your frends abroad. Is this the recompence of our loue and bloud shewed vnto you, and shed for you, to keepe you from the supposed thraldome of <hi>Spaine</hi>? Did <hi>Dauid</hi> thus reward his three Worthies, who aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their liues to satisfie his longing, &amp; to quench his thirst? Did he not say, Lord be it farre from me that I should doe this: is not this the bloud of the men that went in ieopardy of their liues? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 17. Doe you thus requite vs, as <hi>Lot</hi> did <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Who when as hee with the 318. that were borne and brought vp in his house, did recouer <hi>Lot</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:19295:3"/>
and his goods and women out of the hands of the Conquerors, cared not for him but to serue his own turne, and being deliuered did in a manner scorne <hi>Abrahams</hi> company. Well, though <hi>Abraham</hi> being the elder and worthier might haue stood vpon his right, yet yeelded of his interest, that hee and <hi>Lot</hi> might liue as brothers, and the rather because both of them at this time soiourned among the <hi>Cananites</hi> and <hi>Pheresites,</hi> who were ready to take notice of their discord, and so to curse their God, and holy religion. Yet what gained <hi>Lot</hi> by separating companie, but a showre of fire and brimstone, which rained vpon <hi>Sodome</hi> wherein he liued, and would haue consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med both him and his, if God had not beene merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto him at <hi>Abrahams</hi> request?</p>
            <p>It is not long of the English that wee expose our selues to the mockery of Infidels: our Company loue peace, and trade peaceably: they haue put vp for peace sake more wrongs at your hands, then they meane to doe againe. You write and publish to the world that the Sea is free, and yet by your encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon it, are not you both the Mothers and Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of discord? One of our Commanders, wrote (as I thinke, or at least sent word by one of speciall note amongst your selues) to <hi>Coen</hi> your Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concerning a parly before the shooting downe of our Turret at <hi>Iackatra</hi>: but the first and last newes wee heard of him, was it not the beating downe of our house there, and the defaming of our Nation, with <hi>Penoran</hi> at <hi>Bantam</hi> and others here?</p>
            <p>And thinke you that this is the way to make peace?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:19295:4"/>The present Captaine of your Fort at <hi>Iackatra</hi> promised to the Right Worshipful Sir <hi>Thomas Dale</hi> our chiefe Commander, vpon the faith of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that <hi>M. Peter Wadden</hi> (now your prisoner) should haue free ingresse and egresse in and out of your house to parley betweene vs, to retourne to our Ships: and yet is either promise or oath kept? hath he not, and doth hee not continue your priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to this hower? You remember <hi>Iehu</hi> his answer to <hi>Iehoram, What peace whiles the whoredomes of thy Mother Iezabel, and her witchcrafts are yet in great number?</hi> 2 King. 9. 23. No sound league of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or reconciliation can be made, or being made can continue, till the wrongs which men haue done one to another, be reproued, and remoued; and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction giuen by word and deed, where it may possibly be performed; else it will be like a wound or sore, that being cured outwardly to the eye, doth bleed and fester inwardly; many hollow reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations are daily made amongst men, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards breake out to the hurt of both parties, and scandall of others: As a wound that is ill cured, by an vnskilfull or an vnconscionable Chirurgion. As for mine owne part, I would to God that if it were possible, I might with all my best skill and cunning bee the Chyrurgion to cure this wound, that our reconciliation, when euer it shall bee made, may not be hollow, but holy and firme: yea I wish from my heart, that my very bloud might be the milke to put out this wilde fire which now is kindled, and (if it be not quenched in time) is like to deuoure, not onely the ships and goods (as it hath

            <p>October the 23. 1619. there came into the Rode out of <hi>England</hi> three other ships, the <hi>Paltegraue,</hi> the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the <hi>Merchants Hope.</hi> From <hi>Tekoo</hi> we sailed to and fro, and at length came to anchor at an Iland called <hi>Amyncan,</hi> where we had fresh water and some fish, but is no place of trade, nor is there any man that knoweth of any thing that growes vpon it. The people are thought to be man-eaters. After this we returned backe for <hi>Tekoo,</hi> and neere the same Ianuary 29. 1619. we met with Generall <hi>Prynne</hi> in the <hi>Royall Iames,</hi> and his whole fleet of ships in number nine. All the fleet being then twelue goodly ships, were resolued to saile for <hi>Bantam:</hi> and in sight of two Flemmish ships (which we purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19295:6"/>
to take) Captaine <hi>Adams</hi> in the ship called the <hi>Bull,</hi> together with one of the Flemmish ships came vp with newes of peace. We then sailed for <hi>Iaqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> where by the way met vs 17. saile of goodly Flemmish ships, with whom (had not the peace then come) we must haue fought it out. But peace being then concluded betweene the Flemmings and vs, our English Factorie was againe setled at <hi>Iaquatry</hi>; and the ships diuided some for one place, some for another.</p>
            <p>Aprill 26. 1620. the <hi>Royall Iames,</hi> and a ship of some 800. Tonnes, called the <hi>Vnicorne,</hi> set saile for <hi>Iapan,</hi> the distance neere about 1400. leagues. Iune the second 1620. the <hi>Vnicorne</hi> was cast away on the coast of <hi>China,</hi> neere a certaine Iland called the <hi>Macoio</hi> Iland. In the ship were two English women; both which, and all the men were saued: for they ranne the ship neere the shore. Most part of all their goods they lost. As we sailed for <hi>Iapan,</hi> at a place called <hi>Puttany,</hi> we heard of Captaine <hi>Iordayne,</hi> who being there with two ships, called the <hi>Hound,</hi> and the <hi>Samson,</hi> there came into the Rode and fought with them three Flemish ships: Captaine <hi>Iordayne</hi> was slaine in that fight, and the Flemmings tooke both their ships. December 17. 1620. the great <hi>Iames</hi> being well trimmed at a place called <hi>Farando</hi> in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> came away from thence: and Ianuary the 14. 1620. we arriued safely at <hi>Iaquatry,</hi> where shee is now loaden for <hi>England.</hi>
