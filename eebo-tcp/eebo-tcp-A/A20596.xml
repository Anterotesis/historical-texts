            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thy olde Caballe and couerture of Religion, is as good to thee as nothing, this drugge was long since vttered, and returnes thee no profit: the Catholique Noble men that abhorre thee, doe very well knowe, that heerein is no vertue left to sheelde thee from falling; at thys hooke and line, angling for the estates, thou fastnest sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie licorish baytes, of Crosses, Miters, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Prelat-ships, Partages of Prouinces, Offices, Gouernments, and great prerogatiues, which thou promisest to distribute among such, as with thee doe cast the Nets for so rich a Fish.</p>

That all thinges are subiect to alteration and change, and there is nothing that perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually continueth in one selfe same estate, for heauen it selfe is not exempt from change and ending. I aunswer, that I am very certain of this
<pb facs="tcp:520:68"/>
alteration, likewise that there is a course of ages and dispositions of things in the world, as in our humaine body: to wit, after they are borne, they haue their infancie, child-hood, and state of a yonge stripling: then they increase in manly strength, and so continue a while in force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor: afterward they become aged, declining, and in the end perishinge. For this is a <hi>maxime</hi> in Phisique, that all thinges composed by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are dissolued by corruption, and the ende of the one is the birth of the other. Such variety and change commeth not onely to priuate men, who declare sufficiently these effects, by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabillitie of their desseignes and enterprises, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering themselues to bee carryed away with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties, that makes a confusion of their wits, and in the ende is their vtter spoyle; but likewise to Families, who at the instant when they imagin they haue freely builded their fortune, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the conceit of their owne greatnesse: they behold their present fall, and all their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations throwne on a heape together.</p>
            <p>I knowe likewise, that Empires, Kingdomes, Signories, &amp; the most flourishing estates, are no lesse exposed to remoouings, varieties, &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: as it may seeme a naturall reuolution, that oftentimes makes the state of a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth to change and rechange.

Hence then it came, as I haue breef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie touched, that the <hi>Carlingians,</hi> hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force helde the Realme against the <hi>Merouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> by the Armes of <hi>Pepin</hi> a stranger prince: God pleased that the Crowne should return by <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> of whom our Kings are discended to this present day, in the race of the <hi>Merouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> who therof was a while vniustly frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Will yee then permit (my Lordes) that our King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, a branch of the <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingians,</hi>

by <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and S. <hi>Lewes</hi> of the selfe same race, should be depriued of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession which appertaineth to him in right and iustice: Will not you assist him against such as seeke to hinder his peaceable possession? Are ye so weake of minde and spirit, as to let him be smitten and conquered by his enemies, without giuing the assitance you owe him of duetie? Take ye such delight in your owne ruine, as it stirres ye not, when the stranger treades your state vnder his feete, but you drawe your wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to helpe him to his enterprise?

On this vniust iudgement, he appealed to God and hys sword, when the iustice of his cause beeing assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the inuincible power of GOD: the Crowne was preserued for him, and hee establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with very wonderfull victories thorow all all his kingdome, from whence hee chased the Englishmen, beeing reconciled to the Duke of Burgundie, and deceassed, to the great griefe of all his Subiects, leauing them in good peace &amp; quiet.</p>
            <p>Whereby you may perceiue, that albeit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one was set against the true heyre to the Crowne, yea, the Father himselfe: yet God in his admirable prouidence, woulde not permit, that the kingdome should be trans-ferred from the race and linage of S. <hi>Lewes,</hi> neither is it to be doubted, that his grace preuenting, with the deuoire of all good and faithfull French-men: but that it will be continued to all his posterity, whereof this most famous and royall House of

            <p>To be an heretique, (as els where I haue said) is obstinately to holde an opinion concerning Religion, and rather to die then to forsake it.

            <p>We desire nothing more, then that the King (according to the most Christian tytle of hys Predecessors) and his people shoulde be vnited in Christian Religion, as for preseruing peace in his Kingdome, he is declared the Defender and Protector of the Catholique Religion: with protestations so oftentimes reitterated, so to preserue it as his proper life. Nor is he ignorant what <hi>Cicero</hi> sayth: <hi>That Religion beeing troubled, the whole Common-wealth is troubled,</hi> because the disquiet and change that happeneth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, dooth nothing else but cloy the spirites of men with disorder and confusion: whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth contempt of Gods true worshippe, and hee beeing offended, punisheth and afflicteth with diuers woundes and calamities, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey that is fallen into such a miserie. This ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Maiesty wold fore-see by his wisdome, desiring that Religion shoulde bee preserued,
<pb facs="tcp:520:74"/>
euen as (before God) the gouernment of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state is put into his hande. God hath giuen vs such a one, adorned with so many heroycall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as makes him admirable to all Nations of the world: Would you then haue vs goe rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, and vrge a beleefe contrarie to that we doe beleeue? Is it possible we should doe so? <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> and is not imprinted in mens consciences, by stroakes of swordes, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other weapons: it is necessary that the spirit of God should be in quiet: all the harts of men, especially of vs that are his subiects, would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dye and be consumed. Of necessitie is it, that this grace commeth from aboue, and we can do no otherwise, but pray to God for his Maiestie, and that he will graunt vs to be still mindefull of our dueties, hee is our King, wee ought to obey him, and he ought to preserue &amp; maintaine vs, according to the Laws &amp; statutes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as all other Kings hys predecessours haue doone.</p>
            <p>But what shalt thou gaine by desiring the thing thou doost? I beleeue, that if the King were such a Catholique as thou wouldest haue him, and for one Masse, he should dispose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe euery day to heare two: yet the Rebels would say no lesse of him, then they did of the late King, that he did it for hypocrisie, and to be quiet in hys estate. What can we else iudge? se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their intent is to exterminate his life, with
<pb facs="tcp:520:75"/>
all the generous and royall linage of <hi>Burbon,</hi> to follow the seruice of a Stranger. But (as I haue sayde) GOD hath euer-more preserued that race, euen for sixe hundred yeeres and more, to this present: and yet by hys holy will stil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues it, for the good &amp; quiet of this poore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed kingdome.</p>
            <p>These Armes that you haue taken against him (ô Rebels) will turne to your owne ruine and confusion, seeing God forbids ye so to doe, what-soeuer pretence ye make of Religion. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion should moue ye to pitty and not to rage: to compassion, and not furie: to loue &amp; regard of your King, and not to rancour or hatred: to a naturall French-affection of hys seruice, and not to an obstinate will, to wound, destroy, and take his life from him, if ye could.</p>
            <p>Now say my Lords and Gentlemen, if yet ye haue not sufficient manifestation, that euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Tyrants, Religion cannot serue for anie cloake or collour? The Spanyard, hath not he declared so much, who tearming himselfe in Fraunce, <hi>Protector of the Catholique Religion,</hi> hath not hee (neuerthelesse) suffered Paganisme in many places of Granado, Andalozia, and Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, for the great <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:520:75"/>
where they pluckt out theyr eyes, to make them die the more miserably? Their drift is, to bee Commaunders ouer ye, and if you haue goods and faire wiues, to put you and your heyres to death, to possesse your wiues and your goods: as they haue practised the like in Flaunders, Naples, Millaine, and in euery place where they by force doe domineere. It is the Crowne, it is the Crowne that all this debate is for, although we hauing (as I haue proued) a lawfull succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, there cannot be gathered any occasion for such a debate.</p>
            <p>VVhen heere-to-fore there happened anie such like strife, they had recourse to the estates of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: as it chanced after the death of <hi>Lewes</hi> the 10. called <hi>Hutin,</hi> that the Crowne was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to <hi>Phillip le Long</hi> his brother. And after <hi>Charles le Bel</hi> to <hi>Phillip de Valloys</hi> his Cousin, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Edward</hi> king of England, who pretended the cause of his Mother, the daughter of <hi>Phillip le Bel,</hi> &amp; sister to the last three kings: but there she had no right, by force of the <hi>Salique</hi> Lawe, which excludes the daughters of Fraunce from any succession. It is now no question of holding the estates, in this regard, seeing no one maketh doubt, but that the Crowne appertaineth to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Burbon,</hi> by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for his race &amp; admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfections, with his happy fortunes in war, amidst so many trauerses: the estate receiueth more honor, being gouerned by such a king, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:520:76"/>
the King dooth of the estate, which comes to him by succession, as beeing the very neerest heire to the Crowne.</p>
            <p>Then you braue Lordes and Gentlemen of Fraunce, whose famous Grandfathers defended this Kingdome by their vertuous strength, and made their glorie wondered at through the world: spend not your valiant &amp; noble blood to your eternal destruction, but as your spirits are rockes of far more excellent perfection, so seeke such waies as are more worthy and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable for ye. To bring again this estate, with the whole body of the Nobillity, who haue euer stood with the King, &amp; from whom through false impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your selues are dismembred: into her former splendour &amp; honorable quiet. Vnite your selues to your king your soueraigne Lord to extirpate this rebellion, and chase hence your entertained euils, the Spanyards, your auncient and mortall enemies: thereby to bring and re-establish this poore afflicted Realme, into such peace and tranquillitie, as all good mindes desire, and is promised by your generositie &amp; force, with the grace and blessing of God: who I pray to open your eyes, to let you wade no further in the loue of thys vnlawfull League, that like a subtill <hi>Thais,</hi> is prouided of a thousand baytes and sleights to catch yee withall. But if ye continue in her seruice, ye shall find your selues betweene two stooles, wher-through (as the Prouerbe is)
<pb facs="tcp:520:76"/>
the taile falles to ground: and too late repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with most pittifull end, will be the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of your pernicious pursutes, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest pleasures you haue had with her.</p>
            <p>Followe, followe then the steppes of the most magnanimous and valiant Princes of the blood, so many great Lordes, Marshalles of Fraunce, Dukes, Earles, Marquesses, Barons, and Gentlemen of marke, the number wherof is infinite and innumerable, al which expose them selues and their deuoire, for the seruice of hys Maiesty, the reliefe of the estate, to preserue you (if ye forget not your selues) in your goods, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueledges, and immunities, seeking nothing but the quiet and prosperitie heereof.</p>
            <p>God giue them grace, and you likewise, to make some profit of this fore-warning, to the end, that wee hauing occasion more and more, to bee thankefull to the King for his infinite bountie, &amp; those faithful subiects that attend on him: the celestiall fauour and assistance accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the Kings power, your amendment and reconciliation, may turne to the happie successe of these publique affayres, the rest and re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of thys disolate Kingdome.</p>
