            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And what and if I shuld say nothyng els these thre or. iiii. houres (for I know it wil be so long, in case I be not commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the contrary) but these words Take hede and beware of couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, it would be thought a straunge Sermon before a Kynge to saye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynge elsse but <hi>Cauete ab auaricia.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Couetousnesse. And yet as straunge as it is, it would be lyke the Sermon of Jonas that he preached to the Niniuites, as touchynge the shortnes, and as touchynge the pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city


<pb facs="tcp:8707:3"/>
or fewnes of the words: For his Sermon was, <hi>Ad huc quadraginta dies, et Niniue subuertetur.</hi> There is yet fourtye dayes to come, and Nynyue shall be destroyed. Thus he walcked from streete to strete, &amp; from place to place round about the Citye, and sayd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge els, but there is yet. xl. dayes (quod he) and Niniue shalbe destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There is no greate ods nor diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at the lest wyse, in the number of woordes, no nor yet in the sence or meanyng betwene, these two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: There is yet forty dayes, and Niniue shalbe destroyed, and these wordes that I haue taken to speake of this day: Take heede and beware of Couetousnes. For Niniue should be destroyed for synne, and of theyr sinnes Couetousnesse was one, and one of the greateste, so that it is all one infeffect. And as they be like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng the shortnes, the paucity of words, the breuitye of wordes, &amp; also


<pb facs="tcp:8707:3"/>
the meaning &amp; purpose: So I wold they myght be lyke in frute and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, for what came of Jonas sermon? what was the fruit of it? <hi>Ad predicacio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Ionae crediderunt Deo.</hi> At the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng of Jonas they beleued God. Here was a great fruite, a greate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wrought, what is that same, they beleued god? They beleued Goddes Preacher Gods Offycer, Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Jonas, &amp; wer conuerted from theyr syn. They beleued that (as the preachersayd) if they dyd not repent &amp; amende theyr life, the Cyty should be destroyed wythin fourtye dayes. This was a great fruite, for Jonas was but one man, &amp; he preached, but one Sermon, and it was but a short Sermon, neyther as touchynge the number of words, and yet he turned al the whole City great &amp; smal, ritche and poore, kyng and al. We be mani preachers here in Englande, and we preach many long Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and yet


<pb facs="tcp:8707:4"/>
the people wil not repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor conuert. This was the frut, the effect and the good that hys Sermon dyd, that all the whole City at his preaching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and amended theyr euyll ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge &amp; dyd pennaunce in sakcloth. And yet here in this Sermon of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas is no great curiousnes, no great clerklines, no greate affertacyon of wordes, nor of painted eloquence, it was none other but <hi>Ad huc qua di aginta dies, &amp; Niniue subuertitur.</hi> yet fortye dayes <hi>&amp; Niniue subuertitur,</hi> and Niniue shall be destroied, it was no more. This was no great curious Sermon, but thys was a nyppynge Sermon, apynch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge Sermon, a biting Sermon, it had a ful byte, it was a nyppynge ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, a rough Sermon, and a sharp bitynge Sermon. Do you not heare maruayle that these Niniuites caste not Jonas in pryson, that they did not reuyle hym, and rebuke hym? They did not reuile him, nor rebuke


<pb facs="tcp:8707:4"/>
hym, but God gaue theym grace to heare him, and to conuert and ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at his preachynge. A straunge mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so noble a Citye to gyue place to one mans Sermon. Now England cannot abyde thys geare, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be content to heare Gods Minister and hys threatnyng for theyr synne. Thoughe the Sermon be neuer so good, thoughe it be neuer so true. It is a naughty fellowe, a sedicious fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, hee maketh trouble and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon in the Realme, hee lacketh dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cression, but the Niniuites rebuked not Jonas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he lacketh dyscression, or that he spake out of tyme, that hys Sermon was oute of season made. But in England if Gods Preacher, Gods Minister be any thyng quike, or do speake sharply, then he is a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysh fellow, he is rash, he lacketh dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cression. Nowadayes yf they cannot reproue the doctryne y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is preached: then they wyll reproue the Preacher

I knowe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> preachers ought to haue a dyscressy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb facs="tcp:8707:5"/>
in theyr preachyng, and that they ought to haue a consideracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spect to the place and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme that he preacheth in, as I my self wyl say here that I would not say in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for no good. But whan then? syn must be rebuked, sin must be plainly spoken agaynste. And when shoulde Jonas haue preached agaynst Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, yf he should haue forborne for the respectes of the tymes, or the place or the state of things ther? For what was Niniue, a noble, a rytche and a welthy City. What is Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don to Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niue? like a village as Islington or such another in comparison of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Suche a Cytye was Niniue, it was thre daies iourny to go through euery strete of it, and to go but from streete to streete. There was noble men, rychmen, welthy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ther was viciouse men and couetous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and men that gaue them selues to al vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouse lyuynge, and to worldely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

Couetousnesse is as greate a synne nowe, as it was then, and it is the same sinne now, it was then, for God hateth synne, and al Couetousnes as much now, as he dyd then.

of the worlde they fel to synne. The firste age from Adam whyche was aboute two thousande yeares they fell euer to synne, and they had prechers Noe and Enoch and other holy fathers. And in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyme a greate multiplicacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was that grew in two thousand yeres. For the Scrypture sayeth: The sonnes of God saw the daughters of men that thei wer fair, &amp; thei toke them wyues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amonge all that they had chosen. Thys is a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g matter to speake of al. But what meaneth thys the sons of God sawe the daughters of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? who wer these sons of God? The sons of God were those that came of the good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> good preachers, and of the holye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that wer gods me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they that came of Seth and Enos, that were good men, and of others.

Here is a long matter to talke on.

And therefore our graunde mother Eue badde beware of maryinge wyth Caines seede, for feas of fallyng from God to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therby.

But I wyl say this For Goddes loue beware where you marrye, chuse youre wife in a fayeth full stocke. Beware of this worldlye policy, mary in god, mary not for the great respect of alyaunce, for therof commeth al these euils of breakinge of wedlocke, which is amonge Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

For here is maryage for

And that is the cause of so much adultry, and so much breache of wedlocke in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> noble menne, and gentlemen, and so much deuorcynge. And it is not now in the noble men only, but it is come nowe to the inferyor sorte. Euerye man if he haue but a smale cause wyl cast of hys olde wife and take a new, and wyll marye agayne at hys plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and there be many that haue so done. I wold therfore wish that ther were a lawe prouided in thys behalfe for adulterers, and that adultri shuld bee punyshed wyth deathe, and that myghte be a remedye for all this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ther wold not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be so much ad ultry, whordom and lechery in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as there is.

And that the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if her housbande would be a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for her, she shoulde be pardoned for the fyrst tyme, but not for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond tyme. And the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>beyng an of fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der shuld be pardoned, if hys wyfe be a suter for hym, for the fyrst tyme, but not for the second tyme, not if he offended twyse. If thys lawe were made there wold not be so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery nor lechery vsed in the realme as there is. Well I truste once yet as old as I am, to se the day that leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye shalbe punyshed. It was neuer more nede, for ther was neuer more lechery vsed in England as there is at thys daye, and mayntayned. It is made but a laughinge matter, and a triste, &amp; it is a sad matter and an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest matter. For leachery is a greate synne, Sodome &amp; Gomore was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed for it. And it was one of the syns raygnyng in Niniue for whych

it shoulde haue bene destroyed. But thynke ye that leacherye was alone? No no, Couetuousnesse was ioyned with it. Couetousnes foloweth leche<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, and commonlie they go together. For why, they that be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes, and to the vyce of lechery, must haue wherewyth to mayntaine it, &amp; that must be gotten by couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For at the fyrst when men fel to sinne, and chiefely to lechery, where fore the worlde shoulde be destroyed (the booke faith) ther were Giaunts in the earthe in those dayes.

Theese were Gyauntes, so called of the property of Giauntes, for they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres the weaker, and take from them what they list, by force, vyolence and oppressyon.

And thys was couetousnes wherwith God was so dyspleased, that hee repented that he had made man, and resolued vtterly to destroye the world, and so called to Noe, and told hym of it. And I wyl

So they had an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and. xx. yeares to repent.

            <p>But how long hast thou England thou England? I can not tel, for god hathe not reuealed it vnto me, if hee had, So God helpe me I woulde tell

But in the meane time ye haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Jonasses to tel you of your fauts and to declare vnto you gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, except ye repent and amend, therfore to returne to my matter, I say as I sayd at the begynnyng: <hi>Vide te et cauete ab auaricia.

Thus saying of Paul tooke me away from the gospel y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is red in the church thys day, it tooke me from the epistle, that I wold preach vpon neyther of them both at thys tyme, I cannot tel what alled me. But to tel you my imperfec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was appointed to preche here, I was new come oute of a sick


<pb facs="tcp:8707:13"/>
nes, wherof I loked to haue died and weake I was. Yet neuertheles whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was appoyncted vnto it, I tooke it vpon me, how be it I repented after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward that I had done. I was disple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with myself, I was testi as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas was when he should go preache to the Niniuits. Wel, I loked on the Gospel that is red thys daye, tut it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me not, I looked on the Epistle: tushe I could not away with that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And yet I remember I hadde preached vpon this epistle once afore kyng He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the. viii. but now I could not frame with it, nor it liked me not in no sauce. Wel, this saying of Paul came in my mynde, and at last I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered and waied the matter deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then thought I thus with my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self: Is Couetousnes the roote of al mischefe, and of al euil? then haue at the roote, &amp; down wythal Couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. So this place of Paul brought me to thys text of Luke, Se and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware


<pb facs="tcp:8707:13"/>
of Couetousnes Therfore you prechers out with your swordes, and stryke at the roote, speake agaynste Couetousnes, and crye oute vpon it. Stand not tyckynge and toyinge at the braunches, nor at the boughes, (for then ther wyl new boughes and braunches springe againe of them:) but stryke at the roote, and feare not these Giauntes of Englande, these greate men and men of power, these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are oppressours of the poore. Fear them not, but stryke at the rote of al euil, which is mischeuouse coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes. For couetousnes is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause of rebellyon. I haue forgotten my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyke, but yet I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iumble at a Silo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, &amp; make an argumente of it to proue it by. Couetousnes is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rote of al euyl: Rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is an euill, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roote of rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And so it was in dede. Couetousnes was the cause of rebellyon thys laste So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and both partyes had couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,


<pb facs="tcp:8707:14"/>
as well the gentle men as the commons. Both partyes had Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, for both parties had an inor dynate desyre to haue that they had not, &amp; that is couetousnes, an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate desyre to haue that one hathe not. The commons wolde haue had from the gentlemen such things as they desired. The gentlemen would none of it, and so was ther couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes on bothe sydes. The Commons thought they had a right to the thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that they inordinately sought to haue. But what then, they muste not come to it that waye. Nowe on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side the gentlemen had a desyre to kepe that they had, and so they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled to agaynste the kynges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and agaynst such good order as he and hys councelle would haue set in the realm. And thus both partyes had couetousnes, and bothe parties dyd rebell. I heard saye that there was godly ordynaunces deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed


<pb facs="tcp:8707:14"/>
for the redresse of it. But the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants would none of it in no sauce. I remember myne owne self a certain Giaunt, a great man, who sat in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about such matters. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tounsemen shuld bryng in what had beene inclosed, he frouned and chafed and so nere loked and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they durst not aske theyr ryghte. I red of late in an act of parliament: and thys act made mencion of an act that was made in kyng Henries daies (the. iii. I trowe it was, yea and suche an other buysy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes there was in kynge Edwardes tyme the second also) In this parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I speak of, the gentlemen and the commons wer at varyaunce as they were now of late. And there the gentle men that were landlords, wold nedes haue away much landes from theyr tenantes, and wold neds haue an act of parliament y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it myght be lawful for them to enclose &amp; make


<pb facs="tcp:8707:15"/>
seuerall frome theyr tenauntes and from the commons such porcions of theyr landes as they thoughte good, much a do ther was about thys acte. At last it was concluded &amp; graunted y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they myght so do, Prouided alway that they should leaue sufficient to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> tenaunt. Well it was wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wer bounde to leaue sufficient for theym. But who shoulde bee the iudge to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite what was sufficient for theym. Or who shal now iudge what is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, wel I for my part can not tell what is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But me thoughte it was well that the tenauntes &amp; poore commons should haue sufficient, for if they had sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (thought I) they hadde cause to be quyet. And then fell I to make this argument within my selfe. If at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time it were put in theyr wil and power, that they myghte en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close leauing to the tennant that wer sufficient for hym, yf they had it then in theyr power (thought I) that they


<pb facs="tcp:8707:15"/>
myght thys do, they woulde leaue no more then suffyciente. If they left to the tenaunts and pore commons no more in those dayes but suffycyente: then if they had ani more taken from theym sence that tyme, then had they now not sufficient. They in Christ ar equall with you. Peres of the realme muste nedes be. The poorest plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is in Christ equall wyth the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test prynce that is. Let them therfore haue sufficient to mayntayne theym, and to fynde them theyr necessaryes. A ploughlande must haue sheepe, yea they muste haue shepe to dunge theyr grounde for bearynge of corne (for if they haue no shepe to healpe to fat the ground, they shal haue but bare corne and thynne.) They must haue swyne for theyr foode to make theyr vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes or bacon of, theyr bacon is theyr veniso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for thei shal now haue bangu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tuum if thei get anie other venyson) so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bacon is theyr necessary meate to


<pb facs="tcp:8707:16"/>
feede on, whiche they may not lacke. Thei must haue other cattels, as hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses to draw their ploughe and for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of thinges to the markets, and kine for their milke and chese, which they muste lyue vpon and paye theyr re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. These cattel must haue pasture whych pasture if thei lacke, the reaste must nedes fayle theim. And pasture thei ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue, if the land be taken in and inclosed from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So (as I said) ther was in both partes rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore for Gods loue restore theyr sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto them, and search no more what is the cause of rebelly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But se and beware of couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for couetousnes is the cause of rebellyon. Wel now, if couetousnes be the cause of rebellyon, then prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng agaynste couetousnesse is not the cause of rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Some say that the preching now a daies is the cause of al sedicion and rebellion, for sence thys newe prechynge hathe come in,


<pb facs="tcp:8707:16"/>
ther hath bene much sedicion, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must nedes be that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prechyng is the cause of rebellion here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, forsoothe our preachinge is the cause of rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, much like as Christ was cause of the destruccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem. For (saith Christ) <hi>Si non uenisse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; locutus suissem eis, peccatum non haberent. &amp;c.</hi> If I had not come (sayth Christ) and spoken to them, they should haue no synne. So we preachers haue come and spoken to you: we haue drawen our swerdes of Gods word, and stry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at the rootes of all euyll, to haue them cut downe, and if ye wyll not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do more. And prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching is cause of sedicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land, much like as Ely was the cause of trouble in Israell, for hee was a preachet there, and toulde the people of all degrees theyr faultes, and so they wynched and kycked at hym, and accused hym to Achab the kyng, that he was a sedicious fellowe, and


<pb facs="tcp:8707:17"/>
a troublous precher and made much vprore in the realme. So the kynge sente for hym, and he was broughte to Achab the kynge, who sayde vnto hym: Arte thou hee that troubleth all Israell? and Ely answered &amp; sayde: naye, thou and thy fathers house are they that trouble al Israell. Ely had preached gods word, he had playnlye told the people of theyr euill doyngs, he had shewed them Gods threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges: (In gods behalfe I speake, ther is neither king nor Emperoure, be they neuer in so greate estate, but they are subiecte to gods worde) and therfore he was not afrayed to say to Achab: it is thou and thy fathers house that causeth all the trouble in Israell. Was not thys presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously spoken to a king? was not this a sedicious fellow: was not thys fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes preachynge a cause of all the trouble in Israell? was he not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be cast in bocardo or lytle ease?


<pb facs="tcp:8707:17"/>
No, but he had vsed goddes sworde which is his word, and don nothyng elsse that was euyll, but they coulde not abyde it, he neuer dysobeyed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabs sworde whyche was the regal power. But Achab dysobeyed hys swerd, which was the worde of God. And therfore by the punyshmente of god much trouble arose in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> realme for the sinnes of Achab &amp; the people. But Gods preacher goddes prophet was not the cause of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> trouble. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it not we Preachers that trouble England. But here is now an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to proue the mater against the preachers. Here was preachynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst couetousnes al the last yeare in Lent, and the next so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rebellion: <hi>Ergo</hi> preaching agaynst couetousnes, was y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellyon, A goodly argumente, Heare now I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Mores, which he bringeth in, in a boke that he made against Bilney


<pb facs="tcp:8707:18"/>
&amp; here by the way I wil tel you a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytoy. Master Moore was once se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in commissyon into Kent, to help tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out (if it myght be) what was y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause of Goodwin sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and the shelf that stopped vp Sandwych hauen. Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commeth mayster Moore, and calleth the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try afore him, suche as were thought to be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of experience &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that could of lykelyhod best cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him of that matter concernynge the stoppyng of Sandwich haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others came in before hym an old man with a whyte head, and one that was thought to be lytle lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an hundreth yeares old. When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Moore sawe thys aged man, he thought it expedient to here him say hys mynde in thys matter (for being so old a manne it was lykely that he knewe moste of any man in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and companye.) So mayster Moore called this old aged man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym, &amp; sayd: Father (sayde he) tell


<pb facs="tcp:8707:18"/>

Ye are the eldest man that I can es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye in al thys company, so that if any man can tel any cause of it, ye of lyke lyhoode can saye most in it, or at leste wyse more then any other man here assembeled. yea forsoth good master (quod this old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) for I am wel nigh an hundreth yeares old, and no man here in thys companye anye thynge nere vnto mine age.

Forsothe syr (quoth he) I am an old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I thinke that Tenterton steple is the cause of Goodwyn sandes, for I am an olde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> syr (quod he) and I may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the building of Tenterto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> steple, &amp; I may remember when there was


<pb facs="tcp:8707:19"/>
no steeple at all there. And before that Tenterton steeple was in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge, ther was no manner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of any flats or sands that stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the heauen, and therfore I think that Tenterton steple is the cause of the destroyinge and the decaying of Sandwyche hauen. And euen so to my purpose is preachynge of Gods word the cause of rebellyon, as Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton steple was cause that Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is decaied.

But this is now made a trifle and a smal matter. And yet it is a sadde matter a godly matter, a gostly mater. A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of damnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and saluacion. And Paul saith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oughte to haue a power on her heade. What is thys to haue a power on her head? It is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of speaking of the scripture, &amp; to haue her power on her heade, is to haue a sygne and a token of power, whiche is by coueringe of her heade, declaring that she hath a superioure aboue her, by whome she ought to be ruled and ordred. For the is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vnder God, but mediately. For by their iniunccion the husband

is theyr head vnder God &amp; they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes vnto their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. But this power that some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue is disgu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed geare and of straunge facyons.</p>
            <p>They muste we are Frenchehoodes, and I cannot tell you I, what to call it. And when they make theim ready &amp; come to the couering of their head, they wyll call and saye, geue me my French hoode, and geue me my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net or my cap &amp; so furth. I wold wish that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> women wold cal the couering of their heades by the termes of the scripture. As when she woulde haue her cappe, I wold she wold say geue me my power, I would they woulde learne to speake, as the holye ghoste speketh, and cal it by such a name as Sainte Paule doothe. I wolde they wold (as they haue much pryckynge) when they put on their cap, I wolde thei wold haue this meditacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I am nowe puttyng on my power vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my head, If they hadde this thoughte in


<pb facs="tcp:8707:21"/>
their mindes, they wold not make so much pricking vp of them selfes as they do now a daies. But now heare is a vengaunce deuil: we must haue our power from Turkey of Ueluet, and gay it muste be. Farre fet, deare bought, and when it commeth it is a false signe. I had rather haue a true Englysh signe then a false signe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Turki. It is a false signe when it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth not their heades as it shoulde do. For if they woulde keepe it vnder the power as they ought to do, there shoulde not any such Tussockes nor tuftes be sene, as there be, nor suche laying oute of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> heere nor breydynge to haue it open. I wolde merueile of it how it shulde come to be so abused and so farre out of order, sauing that I know by experience, that mani wil not bee ruled by theyr husbandes as they oughte to be. I haue bene desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to exhort some, and wyth some I could do litle in that mater. But ther


<pb facs="tcp:8707:22"/>
be nowe manye Adams that wil not displease their wiues, but wil in thys behalfe let them haue all theyr owne mindes and do as them listeth. And some others agayne ther be nowe a daies y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wyll defend it, &amp; say it mai be suffred well inough, because it is not expresse in Scripture, nor spoken of by name. Thoughe we haue not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed mencion in scripture against such laying out of the heare in Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sockes and Tufftes: yet we haue in scripture expresse mencyon. <hi>Detortis erinibus,</hi> Of writhen heare, that is for the nonce forced to courle. But of these tussocks that are layd out now a dayes, there is no mencyon made in scriptures, because they were not vsed in scripture time. Thei wer not yet come to be so far out of order, as to lay out such tussocks and tufftes, but I wyl tell the, if thou wylt nedes laye it oute, or if thou wylte neades shew thy heare and haue it seene: go

and powle thy head or rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do, for to what purpose is it to pul it out so, and to laye it oute? some do it (say they) of a simplicity, Some do it of a pryde. And some of other causes. But they do it because they wyll be quarter masters with their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, quarter masters? Nay, half maisters yea some of them wil be hole masters and rule the roast as they liste, theym selues. But these defenders of it wil not haue it euyl, because it is not spo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken of in scripture. But ther be other thinges as euyll as thys whyche are not spoken of in scripture expressely, but they are employed in scrypture as well as though they were ther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely spoken of. For the Prophete Esay sayth. <hi>Vequi consurgitis mane ad co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>messandum, ad Ebrietatem sectandam, et potan do usque aduesperam, ut uino estuetis.</hi> Woo vnto you that aryse early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, and goo to drynckynge vntyll nyght, that ye may swimme in wine.

This is the scripture agaynste ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting and dronkennes.

But some do. I went one day my selfe be tyme in the mornyng to a great ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s house, to speake wyth him, in busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that I had of min own.

a dayes shall soner haue promocyon then a true Gospeller shall haue, the more pity. But this was a thorni gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peller, he heard Christes preachynge and followed hym for company, and heard his words. But he was neuer the better for it, but the care of the world, so choked the worde of God in hym, that he could not heare the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, but interrupted the ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for hys worldly matter yer it wer al done? And what was Christe then doinge? forsoo the he was sowing of good seede, but it fell vppon stonye ground, so that it could not take any rote in thys fellowe to bringe forthe good fruit in him. And let me tel you of the sede that Christ was then sow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.

At the time when this fellowe

interrupted Christes sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he was preachynge a longe Sermon to hys Dyscyples, and to the people beynge gathered together in a wounderfull great multitude as appeareth in the xii.

In the Cytye of Corinthe one had maryed his stepmother, hys fathers wyfe. And he was a iolye fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a great riche man, an alderman of the Cyty, and therfore they wync<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at it, they wold not medle in the matter, they had nothyng to do with

it, and he was one of the head me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of such rule &amp; authority that they durste not, manye of them. But. S.

But at last he was confounded, and hys murther brought to lyght. And now al the world readeth it in the Byble.

<pb facs="tcp:8707:31"/>
Augmentacyoners, Receiuers, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiers, and Auditours: I make a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticion vnto you: I beseche you all be good to the Kynge. Be good to the king, he hath bene good to you, there fore be good to him, yea, bee good too youre owne soules. Ye are knowen wel inoughe what ye were, afore ye came to your offices, and what lands ye hadde then, and what ye haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased sence, and what buyldynges ye make daylye, well I praye you so build, that the kinges workmen may be paied. They make ther mone that they can not get no mony. The poore labourers, gunmakers, poudermen bowmakers. Arrowmakers, smiths carpenters, souldiers, &amp; other crafts crye oute for theyr dutyes. They bee vnpayed some of theym three or. iiii. monethes: yea some of theim halfe a yeare: yea and sum of them putte vp bylles this time. xii. mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ths for theyr monye, and canne not be payde yet.


<pb facs="tcp:8707:32"/>
They crye oute for theyr mony,) and as the Prophet sayeth) <hi>Clamor operari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum ascendit ad aures meas.</hi> The crye of the workmanne is come vp to myne eares. Oh for gods loue let the work men be payde, if there be monye y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe? there wil whole showers of gods vengeaunce raine down vpon your heades. Therefore ye mynters, and ye Augmentacioners, serue the kinge truly. So buyld and purchase that the kynge maye haue monye to pay his workmen. It semeth euil fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouredli, that ye should haue inough wher w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to build superstuously, &amp; the king lacke to pay his poore laborers. wel, yet I doubt not but that ther be some good offycers. But I wyll not sweare for all, I haue now preached iii. Lents. The first time I preached restitucion, restitucion (quod some)? what shuld he preache of restytucyon let hym preache of contryssyon (quod they) and lette restitucyon alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8707:32"/>
We canne neuer make restitucyon, (The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> say I) if thou wilt not make re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stitucion, thou shalte go to the deuyl for it. Nowe chose the eyther restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or els endles da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But now therbe two maner of restitucioners, secret restitucion, and open restituci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whither of both it be, So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucion be made it is al good inough. At my first preachyng of restituion, one good man toke remorce of consy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence, and acknowledged hym self to me, that he had deceyued the kynge. And willing he was to make restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; so the first le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t came to my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds twenty poundes to be restored to the kings vse. I was promised. xx. pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more the same lente, but it could not be made, so that it came not. Well, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next lent came three hundrethe and twentye pounds more. I receyued it my selfe, and payde it to the kynges Counsel. So I was asked, what he was that thus made restytucyon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8707:33"/>
But shuld I haue named hym? naie they shuld as sone haue thys wesau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of myne. Wel, now this le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t came one hundreth and fore score pounds. x. s. whiche I haue paide and delyuered this present day to the kynges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. And so this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath made a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly restitucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And so (quod I to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine noble manne that is one of the kinges councel) if euery man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath beguiled the king should make resty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucion after this sort, it wold coughe the kynge. xx. M. pounds I thyncke (quod I) yea that it wold (quod the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) a whole. C. M. poundes. Alac alac, make restitucion for Gods sake make restitucion, ye wil cough in hel elsse, that all the deuylles there wyll laughe at your coughinge: There is no remedy but restitucion open or se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crete, or elsse hell. Thys that I haue now told you of was a secret restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Some exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of open restitucion, and glad maye he be that

God was so fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly vnto him to bring him vnto it in this world. I am not a fraied to name hym. It was master Sheringto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, an honeste gentleman and one that God loueth. He openly confessed that he had deceyued the kyng, and he made open restitucyon. Oh what an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t maye he haue against the diuell, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shall moue hym to desperacyon, God broughte thys out to hys amendment.

Yea and (as I heare saie) Alderme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are now a dayes become Colliers. They be both wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and makers of cooles. I woulde so God healpe me, what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be: I would wyshe he myghte eate nothynge but coles for a whyle, tyl hee hadde amended it. There can not a poore bodye by a sacke of coles. but it must come thorowe theyr han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. But thys rytche manne that the Gospel speaketh of, was a couetouse manne. God hadde geuen him plenti but that made hym not a good man, It is another thynge that maketh a good man.

And the deuil laboureth to turn all thinges to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s euil.

head what he shuld do, he did not ask of the scripture. For if he had asked of the scripture, it would haue told him, it woulde haue said vnto him: <hi>Frange esurienti panem tuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp;c.</hi> Break thy breade vnto the hungry. All the affeccion of men now a dayes, is in building gay &amp; sumptuouse houses, it is in setting vp and pulling downe, &amp; neuer haue they done buildyng. But the ende of al suche great ritches and couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is this: Thys nyghte thou foole thy soule shal be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the. It is to be vnderstande of all that ryse vp from lytle to much, as thys rytch ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Gospel spake of did. I do not dyspyse ryches, but I wysh that men should haue rytches, as Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had, and as Joseph had. A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to help his neyghbour, is a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ryches.
