            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALL that is necessary to
be said in the way of a
<hi>Preface</hi> to these <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
is, that the References
made here to Mr. <hi>Varillas's
History,</hi> are according to the
<hi>Paris Edition;</hi> these <hi>Reflections</hi>
were writ before the <hi>Dutch
Edition</hi> appeared, otherwise
the <hi>Pages</hi> should have related
to both, according to the one
and the other: This will be
some Inconvenience to those
who have only the latter: But
since I was resolved to attack
<pb facs="tcp:53298:3"/>
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> in an <hi>Edition,</hi> for
which he was accountable;
and to do it with such expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that his Book might
have as little time to do Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schief
as was possible. I hope
the Reader will forgive me
the Trouble to which he is

on which I make my <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>

            <head>REFLECTIONS
On that which relates to
ENGLISH AFFAIRS,</head>
            <head type="sub">In the Third and Fourth Volum of
Mr. Varillas's History of Heresies.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MR. Varillas</hi> thinks, that all
his Imaginations are matters
of such Importance, that they
deserve to be presented to the <hi>King;</hi>
and because <hi>Panegyricks</hi> are things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to <hi>Princes</hi> as well as to all
other men, he it seems has projected
one; and that we may judge of the
piece by a pattern, he lets the <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> know, that <hi>he has found out
two extraordinary Subjects for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
that Master-piece of his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi>
which perhaps he has in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
that when the quality of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
fails him, yet his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may be continued to him as
the Kings <hi>Panegyrist.</hi> But if one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
common things, he is much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken:
for as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has told us,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53298:4"/>
               <hi>that he loves to rise above the Vnlgar;</hi>
so he has found out a Topick for his
<hi>Masters</hi> praise, on which no man would
ever have thought besides himself:
some have compared the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
the Great,</hi> and others to <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus;</hi>
some to <hi>Trajan,</hi> and others to
<hi>Charles the Great:</hi> in short, all that
is most eminent in Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>History,</hi> has been brought forth to
raise his <hi>Glory:</hi> but no body before
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> thought, that it would
raise the <hi>Kings</hi> Character much, to
give him the preference to a <hi>Woman:</hi>
yet since he thought that stroke was
wanting to make a compleat <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
one would have expected to
have seen some of the Chief of the
Sex brought out, a <hi>Semiramis,</hi> a <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobia,</hi>
or for all her <hi>Heresy</hi> a <hi>Queen
Elisabeth,</hi> had made the comparison
less odious: but to set the short and
despised Reign of a <hi>Princess,</hi> that drew
on her self the Aversion of her <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
and the contempt of all her <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
in any sort of comparison with
<hi>Lewis le Grand,</hi> is a <hi>sublime</hi> becoming
our Author. But as the comparison
and the preference is a strain a little
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53298:4"/>
too humble for the present <hi>Reign,</hi> so
the two points on which this part of
his piece of Oratory is to be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
are mistakes of such a nature,
that I do not know how a man could
contrive it to put <hi>two</hi> such conspicuous
ones in so remarkable a part of his
book.</p>
            <p>The <hi>one</hi> is, that Queen Mary <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
her self with the re-establishing of
the Catholick Religion in her Dominions,
without endeavouring to destroy the</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists:
<hi>whereas His Majesty has not
stopt half way, as that Princess did:</hi>
and here he trys the full strength of his
<hi>Sublime</hi> to set forth the <hi>Kings Glory</hi>
in his extirpating <hi>Heresy.</hi> But one
would be tempted to ask Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi>
whether he has ever read the History of
that <hi>Queens</hi> Reign or not: for by his
way of writing, one is disposed to
believe, that he knows not yet what
her Reign will be when he comes to
write it: he has not yet made her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter:
he thought softness became the
Sex; so it seems he will represent her
gentle and feeble in all her actings:
and it must be so, otherwise the <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick</hi>
will be quite spoiled; but what
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53298:5"/>
will our <hi>Author</hi> say when he finds there
were two hundred eighty four <hi>burnt</hi>
by her: that <hi>She</hi> was not satisfied with
all the <hi>Laws</hi> that had been anciently
made against <hi>Herefy,</hi> nor with execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them with a rigour that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the softness of her Sex in it:
<hi>Bishops</hi> and other <hi>Churcbmen</hi> being put
in prison long before those severe <hi>Laws</hi>
were made, and kept there till there
should be colour in Law to make
them Sacrifices to the zeal of the
<hi>Priests: she</hi> was apt enough to shew
Mercy on all other occasions, but
was never guilty of any towards <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks:</hi>
she gave <hi>Commissions</hi> that
came very near the Courts of <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;</hi>
and besides the evidences of
those that I have given in my <hi>History,</hi>
I have since that time seen a Register
of the <hi>Earl of Sussex's</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<note place="margin">Fx Mss. D. Petyt.</note>
and in it there is a
Secret Article of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
that the <hi>Queen</hi> sent
him, in which he is ordered to
have two or three Spies in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
who should be engaged by Oath
to observe and discover every mans
behaviour, and upon whose Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53298:5"/>
men were to be examined and
punished, without discovering the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers:
this was to act in the Spirit
of an <hi>Inquisition;</hi> all the difference was,
that Lay-men had still the management
of it, who have naturally Bowels and
Compassions, which is defaced by the
indelible Character. The <hi>Queen</hi> set
on the Persecution with so much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
that she herself writ Letters
to animate even the bloodiest of all
the Bishops, <hi>Bonner,</hi> if at any time
Compassion softned his spirit a little.
There were eight, ten, and thirteen
sometimes burning all in one fire, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Age nor Sex made any difference,
and the Cripple and the Blind were
burnt at the same stake. Now I do
not deny but Galleys and Dungeons,
and a butcher-like <hi>De Rapine</hi> of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
are really dreadfuller things,
than a quick end of ones misery, tho
by fire; yet so many fires had more
lustre, and lookt more terrible; so this
part of the <hi>Panegyrick</hi> will fail <hi>Mr.
Varillas,</hi> and he will find that <hi>Queen
Mary</hi> had the better of his <hi>Monarch.</hi>
It is true, great numbers seemed to
comply in <hi>Q. Mary's</hi> time, as well as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53298:6"/>
they have lately done in <hi>France,</hi> and
as we find by <hi>Pliny's</hi> Letter to <hi>Trajan,</hi>
the Christians of those days did upon
the first threatning of a Persecution;
and when this fell out, while the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were but newly dead, and
while so much of an extraordinary
spirit remained still in the Church, it
is not to be wondred at if in our days
too many have preferred this present
World to the Faith, and to a good
Conscience; but as that forced com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
had no other effect besides the
giving those who had not the courage
to stand firm, so much the more horrour
at their Persecutors, so it very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turned the spirits of the whole <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to a detestation of a <hi>Religion</hi> that
had signalised it self with so much
Cruelty. I will not take upon me to
play the Prophet as to the effects that
the present Persecution in <hi>France</hi> may
have, tho the numbers that come e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day out of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the
visible backwardness of the greatest
part of those who have fallen, are but
too evident signs that this Violence
is not like to have those glorious Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
which <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> may perhaps
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53298:6"/>
set forth in his <hi>Panegyrick:</hi> one thing
cannot be denied, that this persecution
has contributed more to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and to the awakening men to
use all just precaution against the like
cruelty, than all that the most zealous
<hi>Protestants</hi> could have wished for or
contrived; and of this some <hi>Princes</hi> of
that <hi>Religion</hi> are sufficiently sensible,
and do not stick to express their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
at it in terms that they may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
use than I repeat. In a word, <hi>Queen
Mary</hi> in this point will be found to
have the better of the <hi>French King:
She</hi> found her people <hi>Protestants,</hi> and
yet in eighteen months time she o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew
all the settlement that they
had by Law; <hi>She</hi> turned them out of
their Churches, and began to <hi>burn</hi>
their Teachers and Bishops: whereas
the <hi>French King</hi> had not of that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
above the tenth part of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and yet the extirpating them
out of his Dominions, has cost him
as many years as it did <hi>Queen Mary</hi>
moneths.</p>
            <p>The other Article of the preference
that <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> gives his Monarch to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53298:7"/>
               <hi>Queen Mary</hi> is, that whereas she
could not do it without marrying the
<hi>Prince of Spain,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> has been
able to effect it without the aid of
Strangers. If this were true, the praise
due upon it will not appear to be very
extraordinary, since he who has so vast
an Army, and is in peace with all the
World, has been able to crush a small
handful without calling in forreign
aid; but on the other hand, <hi>Queen
Mary</hi> had neither Troops nor Fleets,
and very little Treasure, so that her
Imploying Strangers would appear to
be no great matter; yet so unhappy is
<hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> like to be in all that he
writes, that it seems his <hi>Panegyricks</hi>
and his <hi>Historys</hi> will be suteable to one
another. <hi>Queen Mary</hi> indeed married
the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> but she was not
much the better for it; for she took
such care to preserve the Nation from
falling under his power, that as she
would receive none of his Troops,
so she neither gave him nor his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
any share in the Government
of <hi>England;</hi> of this he became soon so
disgusted, that seeing no hope of Issue,
and as little probability of his being
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53298:7"/>
able to make himself Master, he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
her; and <hi>She</hi> to recover his
favour, engaged her self into a War
with <hi>France,</hi> which ended so fatally
for <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Calais</hi> was lost; so
that upon the whole matter, she lost
much more than she gained by the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Match: but as for her admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
at home, if some money
that she had from <hi>Spain,</hi> helped a little
to corrupt a <hi>Parliament,</hi> that was the
only advantage that she made by it:
and thus if <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi>'s <hi>Panegyrick</hi>
is not better raised in its other parts
than in this, it will be an Original;
but I doubt it will not add much
lustre to that <hi>Monarch,</hi> nor draw the
recompences on the Author to which
he may perhaps pretend. And if the
Kings <hi>Parchment</hi> and <hi>Wax,</hi> which he
says procured an Obedience from two
Millions of persons, that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
against it by the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of all considerations, which is that
of <hi>Religion,</hi> had not been executed by
<hi>Dragoons</hi> in so terrible a manner, it is
probable <hi>that Edict</hi> would have had
as little effect upon the Consciences of
the <hi>Protestants,</hi> as it seems the <hi>Edict</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53298:8"/>
of <hi>Nantes</hi> had upon the <hi>King's,</hi> tho he
had so often promised to maintain it,
and had once sworn it. I would not
willingly touch such a Subject, but
such Indecent Flattery raises an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
not easily governed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> in his Preface to his
third <hi>Volum</hi> mentions no Author
with relation to <hi>English Affairs,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Raguse,</hi> who,
as he says, writ the Life of <hi>Card. Pool.</hi>
I do not pretend to deny that there is
any such <hi>Author,</hi> only I very much
doubt it; for I never heard of it in
<hi>England;</hi> and I was so well pleased
with the discoveries that I made rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to that <hi>Cardinal,</hi> that I took all
the pains I could to be well informed
of all that had writ of him; so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that there is nothing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in that <hi>Life,</hi> otherwise it would
have made some noise in <hi>England;</hi> and
it does not appear credible, that a
<hi>Dalmatian Bishop</hi> could have any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
knowledge of our Affairs; and if
the particulars related in Mr. <hi>Varillas's</hi>
14. Book are all that he drew out of
that life, it seems the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of
<hi>Raguse</hi> has been more acquainted with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53298:8"/>
               <hi>Swedish</hi> than <hi>English</hi> Affairs: for
there is not one word relating to
<hi>England</hi> in all that Book, and as little
of the <hi>Cardinal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> has shewed himself
more conspicuously in the Preface to
his fourth <hi>Tome;</hi> he pretends to have
made great use of <hi>P. Martys Works,</hi> in
his 17. Book: but he gives us a very
good proof that he never so much as
opened them: he tells us, that <hi>P. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
delivered his <hi>Common-places</hi> at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
where he was the <hi>Kings Professor,</hi>
and that one <hi>Masson</hi> printed them at
<hi>London</hi> some years after his death; he
tells us, that an ambition of being
preferred to <hi>Melancton</hi> had engaged
him to that work: in which he adds,
that if he is to be preferred to <hi>Melancton</hi>
for subtilty, he is Inferiour to him in
all other things; upon which he runs
out to let his Reader see, how well
he is acquainted both with <hi>P. Martyrs</hi>
Character and History. All men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> take at least some care
of their Prefaces, because they are
read by many who often judge of
Books, and which is more sensible,
they buy them or throw them by as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53298:9"/>
they are writ: Now since Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
reproaches me with <hi>my Ignorance of
Books,</hi> I will make bold to tell him,
that the Apprentices to whom he sends
me for Instruction, could have told
him, that <hi>P. Martyr</hi> never writ any
such Book of <hi>Common Places,</hi> but that
after his death, Mr. <hi>Masson</hi> drew a great
Collection out of all his Writings, of
passages that he put in the Method of
<hi>Common Places:</hi> so that tho all that
Book, that goes by the name of <hi>P. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
Common Places,</hi> is indeed his, yet
he never designed nor dictated any
such Work: and this Mr. <hi>Masson</hi> has
told so copiously in his Preface, that I
have thought it necessary to set down
his own words:</p>

            <p>And if after all these discoveries, Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Varillas</hi> can find men that will still read
his Books and believe them, it must be
said, that the Age deserves to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon.</p>
            <p>There is another particular set forth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53298:10"/>
in this <hi>Preface,</hi> that is of a piece with
the former: He tells us, he has drawn
that which is <hi>most curious</hi> in his twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Book out of <hi>Commendons</hi> Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
in <hi>England,</hi> of which he gives
us this account; <q>
                  <hi>Pope Iulius</hi> the third
writ to Cardinal <hi>Dandino,</hi> ordering
him to send some able man secretly
over to <hi>England,</hi> to confirm the
<hi>Queen</hi> in her resolution of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
<hi>England</hi> again to the <hi>See of
Rome.</hi> He upon that sent over <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendon,</hi>
who went to <hi>London</hi> in
disguise; but by accident found
one <hi>Iohn Lee,</hi> a Privy Councellor,
who procured him a secret Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
he had many Conferences
with the <hi>Queen,</hi> who trusted him
with her Secret, which was, that she
believed she could never re-establish
the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> unless she
married the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
by that means engaged the House
of <hi>Austria</hi> to assist her with their
Troops: but tho <hi>Commendon</hi> could
not doubt that the <hi>Popes</hi> Intention
was, that she should marry Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Pool,</hi> and not raise <hi>Spain</hi> too
much by so great an accession; yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53298:10"/>
he had been sent over in hast, and
had no Instructions relating to that
matter; so he complied with the
<hi>Queens</hi> Inclinations for the <hi>Spanish
Match,</hi> of which she spoke to
him every time that she gave him
audience; so that he saw into that
Sectret, and had credit by that
means to soften most of the Articles,
which would otherwise have been
of great prejudice to the Court of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </q> Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> can pretend no
Warrant for this part of his History but
<hi>Gratians</hi> Life of <hi>Commendon;</hi> and if
this be the <hi>most curious</hi> part of his 20.
Book, we may conclude what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we ought to make of the rest.
<hi>Commendon</hi> was in <hi>London</hi> when the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which was the <hi>22. August:</hi> he
had been sent from <hi>Brussels</hi> some days
before that; and by consequence he
was sent by Cardinal <hi>Dandino</hi> of his
own motion, as <hi>Gratian</hi> represents it.
For King <hi>Edward</hi> died the sixth of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> and it was 10. dayes after that
before <hi>Queen Mary</hi> was in possession:
so here there will not be time enough
for sending notice to <hi>Rome,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53298:11"/>
orders from it. <hi>2. Lee</hi> was a
Servant of the <hi>Queen's,</hi> and no Privy
Councellor. 3. The <hi>Queen</hi> never
mentioned the Spanish Match to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendon;</hi>
on the contrary, she rather
intimated to him her design for Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Pool:</hi> for she asked him, if the
<hi>Pope</hi> could not dispence with his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,<note place="margin">Lib. 20.</note>
since he was only in
Deacons Orders; which is
confessed elsewhere by Mr. <hi>Varillas.</hi>
4. It does not appear by <hi>Gratian,</hi> that
<hi>Commendon</hi> saw the <hi>Queen</hi> often; for
as the thing was a great secret, and by
consequence many audiences given by
a Lady, that was so scrupulous as she
was, could not be long concealed: so
on the other hand, no doubt <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
pressed a dispatch all that was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
knowing what a step such a
piece of news must be to the making
his Fortune in <hi>Rome.</hi> 5. Nor does it
appear, that there was the least mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
yet made in the Match with <hi>Spain;</hi>
and the first proposition that I could
find of it, was in a Letter writ by the
<hi>Q.</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> in the <hi>Emperours</hi> name,
and subscribed by him, for he was then
lame of the Gout, and dated in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53298:11"/>
beginning of <hi>November. 6. Mr. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
represents <hi>Queen Mary</hi> very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to discover her greatest Secrets,
when she would trust an unknown
Man, sent to her by the <hi>Legate</hi> in the
<hi>Emperours Court,</hi> with a matter of
such Consequence. There was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in trusting him with her design
of reconciling her self to the <hi>Court</hi> of
<hi>Rome;</hi> for he that was a Creature of
that <hi>Court,</hi> was not to be suspected in
that matter; but it had been a strange
loosness of Tongue in her to have
blobb'd out such a Secret to such a
Person; so that the preference he gives
his <hi>King</hi> to so weak a Woman, will
lose much of its grace. And thus by
this Essay it appears, that <hi>Mr. Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
holds on his Method of writing,
and that he does not so much as take
care to write his <hi>Prefaces</hi> correctly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I. Mr. Varillas</hi> will shew, that he
knows <hi>Genealogies</hi> as well as he
does the other parts of History;<note place="margin">P. 58.</note>
for he tells us, <hi>that</hi> Henry <hi>the Sevenths
Queen, that was the Heiress of the
House of</hi> York, <hi>had no Kinswoman of
that Family nearer to her, than her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Ignorance; for she had a Sister that
married to <hi>Courtney</hi> Earl of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
who was Mother to the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis</hi>
of <hi>Exeter,</hi> that was executed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Henry the Eighth.</hi> Now he should
have known this, that so he might
have given a stroke upon it against the
Memory of that <hi>Prince.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>II. He sets out</hi> Cardinal <hi>Pools</hi> great
vigour in speaking so freely to the
King,<note place="margin">P. 59.</note> against his Divorce, that he
once intended to put him to death: but he
pardoned him in consideration of the
Compliance of his Mother and Brethren,
and so he was sent by his Family to study
at <hi>Padua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is a Fiction, that was not so
much as thought on, till many years
after the persons concerned were dead:
that <hi>Cardinal</hi> in his Book had no regard
neither to <hi>K. Henry's</hi> Royal Dignity,
nor to the relation in Blood that was
between them; but treated him as a
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and a <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> yet
he upbraided him with no such thing:
tho it had been a very natural Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
for all that Freedom that he then
took, if he could have alledged, that he
had expressed himself first so plainly to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53298:13"/>
him in private. But so far was the
<hi>Cardinal</hi> from such a behaviour, that

so far as to declare Confession neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
by the Law of God: but <hi>King
Henry</hi> would not consent to that; and
there is a long Letter yet extant, all
writ with his own hand, in which he
argues this matter liker a learned <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
than a great <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. He tells us, <hi>that Arch-bishop</hi>
Cranmer <hi>conferred all Benefices
in the quality of Vicar General of
the Church of</hi> England,<note place="margin">P. 61.</note> 
               <hi>and that he dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>the Institution
of four Sacraments.</hi> But neither the
one nor the other is true; for he gave
no <hi>Benefices,</hi> but those of his own <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess:</hi>
and as for his expression of <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
with Iesus Christ the Institution
of four Sacraments,</hi> I pass it as a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime</hi>
of our Author's; yet even the
thing is false: all the ground for it is,
that in the first part of the <hi>Erudition
of a Christian-man,</hi> that was set out
this year, no mention was made of
these four <hi>Sacraments;</hi> but they were
all set forth some years after this, when
that work was finished.</p>
            <p>VI. He says, that upon this the <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Catholicks of England</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
that the <hi>King</hi> himself leaned to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53298:15"/>
               <hi>Heresy,</hi> and that the Provinces of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>
and <hi>Northumberland, Cambridge-Shire,
York-Shire</hi> and <hi>Durresm,</hi> were
the first that revolted, and made up a
body more than 50000. men. Here
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> shews us still how well
he likes <hi>Rebellion,</hi> by giving those
Rebels no worse name than that of
<hi>Zealous Catholicks;</hi> and here he gives
us the accomplishment of the Cardinal
<hi>de Bellay's</hi> threatnings: but one would
have thought, that a Writer, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to dedicate his Book to the
<hi>King,</hi> should have softned this part a
little; otherwise a <hi>Zealous Protestant</hi>
may be naturally carried to make the
Inference, that if the Fears of the
change of <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> might
carry <hi>Catholicks</hi> to Rebel, on whom no
worse Character is bestowed than that
of <hi>Zealous;</hi> why may not <hi>Protestants,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
and ruined, contrary to the faith
of irrevocable <hi>Edicts,</hi> claim the same
priviledge. His laying of <hi>Lincoln-shire</hi>
and <hi>Northumberland</hi> together, and
then returning to <hi>Cambridg-Shire,</hi> and
going back to <hi>York-Shire,</hi> shews how
well he knows the situation of our
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Counies; and he instead of <hi>Lanca-Shire</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53298:15"/>
and <hi>Westmorland,</hi> has out of his
store put <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge-Shire</hi>
in the Rebellion; he also
represents this rising only as a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
whereas these were the only
<hi>Counties</hi> that rebelled: nor did they
ever joyn together; for those of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln-Shire</hi>
were suppressed within that
County, before the rising in <hi>York-Shire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VII. He says,</hi> The King ordered the
Dukes of <hi>Northfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi>
to go to the Rebels,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and to promise
them all that they demanded; upon which
these Dukes undertook this Message, and
went to the Rebels Camp, with all the
shews of Humility that could have been
expected from the most abject of the
vanquished; they desired them to put
their Complaints in writing, and when
they saw them, they thought them very
just, and signed a Treaty with them in
the Kings Name; by which they obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to redress all the Innovations
that had been made in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
and with this they satisfied those
who were in Arms, who were so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
as to lay down their Arms upon the
faith of this Treaty: yet the King, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53298:16"/>
he had thus dispersed them, did not
trouble himself much with the keeping
of his word to them; but as he knew
the names of the chief Instruments of
this Sedition, so he put them all in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at several times, upon some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Crimes with which they were
charged; and soon after they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against, according to the forms
of Law; and not one of them escaped
death, either in secret or in publick.</p>
            <p>By this Relation of this Affair, one
would think, that the <hi>King</hi> sent those
<hi>Dukes</hi> as Supplicants to the <hi>Rebels:</hi>
but they went both of them at the
Head of the <hi>Kings</hi> Troops, and both
to different Armies. 2. They were so
far from promising every thing in the
<hi>Kings</hi> Name, that the <hi>Kings</hi> Answers
to their Demands are yet extant, in
which he treats them as <hi>Brute Beasts,
that medled themselves in things that
they did not understand: the King
told them, their duty was to obey, and
not to command; and that he would
not at all be advised by them.</hi> He did
indeed promise a Pardon of what was
past, to those who should return to
their duty: but lie would not alter
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53298:16"/>
any thing at their sute. 3. Our Author
did not know, that this <hi>Rebellion</hi> was
after the suppression of the lesser <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,</hi>
and that this was one of the
Chief of their Grievances: otherwise
he had embelished it, no doubt. 4. He
taxes them of <hi>Imprudence,</hi> for trusting
the <hi>Kings</hi> promises; but one would
have expected, that in a <hi>Reign</hi> of so
much submission as this is, he should
have rather shewed their Fidelity and
Loyalty, that made them so easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a <hi>Kings</hi> word: but it seems Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> thinks it is a piece of <hi>Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
to rely too much on that. 5. A
<hi>Prince's</hi> breaking his Faith, is a thing
that needs no aggravation; yet for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
reasons that our Author may
guess at, if he will, he should not
enlarge too much on this, even tho the
promise had been given both frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and solemnly; for this awakens ill
Ideas in peoples minds: and makes
them conclude with the <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi>
that <hi>the thing which hath been, is that
which shall be. 6. King Henry</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
many out of the General Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
others were presently seised on
for engaging into new Conspiracies:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53298:17"/>
and against all these he proceeded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no pretended Crimes, but upon
that of High Treason, for having
been in actual Rebellion against him.
7. All that suffered by form of Law
for those Rebellions, were only two
<hi>Peers,</hi> six <hi>Knights,</hi> and the <hi>Wife</hi> of
one of them, six <hi>Abbots,</hi> and a
<hi>Monk,</hi> and sixteen <hi>men</hi> of a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
rank: now considering what a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
<hi>Rebellion</hi> that had been, this
will not appear to have been a very
extraordinary severity; and without
running too far back, to things past
the memory of man, it were possible
to instance <hi>Rebellions</hi> that were not so
dreadful, and yet that have ended in
many more <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> 8. He tells us
of some that died in secret; if he
means that died in their Beds in Prison,
the thing may be very true: but then
it is not extraordinary; but if he
means the putting them to death se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
and the using them so barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,
that they languished and died
under the hands of their Tormentors:
he must know, that these are things
which the <hi>English Nation</hi> knows not;
they may be practised by <hi>Courts of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53298:17"/>
Inquisition,</hi> or where <hi>Dragoons,</hi> and
<hi>De Rapines</hi> have the Execution of the
<hi>Kings Parchment</hi> and <hi>Wax</hi> put in their
hands; but all Tryals and Executions
in <hi>England</hi> are open and publick;
which is too gentle a Nation to bear
the Cruelty of Torture.</p>
            <p>VIII. <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> would needs have
an extraordinary stroke of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
appear here; for he tells
us,<note place="margin">P. 63.</note> 
               <hi>that the last of those who
suffered under the hand of the
Hangman, was no sooner dead, then
the Kings beloved Son the Duke of</hi>
Richmond, <hi>whom he had designed to
make his Successor, died suddenly of a
malignant Feaver.</hi> But I had warned
our Author of the necessity of buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Chronological Table; for I saw
what would come on it, if he would
not be at that charge: The <hi>Duke of
Richmond</hi> died the 22. of <hi>Iune 1536.</hi>
and the first of all the tumults that
was begun in <hi>Lincoln-Shire,</hi> did not
fall out before the <hi>October</hi> following:
so here is a lovely stroke of the Poem
spoiled. 2. It does not appear that the
<hi>King</hi> had any such design on this <hi>Son</hi>
of this: for as he gave him none of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53298:18"/>
Titles of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> so he did
not raise him up to any such degree of
lustre as must have naturally followed
on such a design.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IX. He joyns to this</hi> Edward the
sixths Birth, <hi>and says,</hi> That his
Mother not being able to bring
him forth,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> King <hi>Henry</hi> ordered
her Belly to be opened; saying, that he
could find another Wife, but that he was
not sure to find another Son: and that
he began presently after her death to
think on a fourth Marriage.</p>
            <p>Again it appears that <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi>
wants a Chronological Table; for he
joins King <hi>Edward</hi>'s birth to the <hi>Duke
of Richmond's</hi> death; tho there was
sixteen moneths between them; for
King <hi>Edward</hi> was born the twelfth
of <hi>October 1537.</hi> and that was nine
moneths after all the Executions were
over. 2. King <hi>Edward</hi> was born in
the ordinary way, and the <hi>Queen</hi> was
as well a day after as any Woman in
her condition could be: of this there
are many good Proofs extant; for her
<hi>Council</hi> writ Letters over all <hi>England,</hi>
giving notice of her safe delivery, and
of her good health, and two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53298:18"/>
others say three days after, she
was taken with a distemper ordinary
to Women in her condition, of which
she died. 3. Our Author should have
considered the decorum of his Fable
better, than to make the <hi>King</hi> speak of a
<hi>Son</hi> before he was born: it had been
more natural to make him speak of a
Child indefinitly. 4. This <hi>Queens</hi> death
affected K. <hi>Henry</hi> so much, that he let
two years pass before he entred into any
Treaty for a new Wife. 5. He puts this
in the year 1538. tho it fell out in the
year 1537.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>X. He opens upon the
Death a Project for Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling</hi>
England <hi>to the</hi> Court
<hi>of</hi> Rome:<note place="margin">Queens</note> 
               <hi>and says,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. and P. 64, 65, 66.</note> That
in order to the satisfying that
Court, it was not doubted
but the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> would
annual King <hi>Henry's</hi> second Marriage,
and declare <hi>Elisabeth</hi> a Bastard. <hi>He
adds,</hi> That a Marriage of King <hi>Henry</hi>
with <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Francis</hi>
the First, was projected: <hi>and here he
shews,</hi> how great a resemblance of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
there was between them. <hi>He
adds,</hi> That Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53298:19"/>
much pressed by the Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
to fulminate against <hi>Henry,</hi> since
the Cardinals Hat, which he had sent to
<hi>Fisher,</hi> had only served to precipitate his
death: upon which the Pope was bound
both in Honour and Interest to revenge
that contempt that was put on the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
for if the persons of Cardinals
were not esteemed sacred, this would
very much slacken their courage upon
dangerous occasions: The <hi>Pope</hi> therefore
very dexterously resolved to shew his
Thunder without discharging it. So
tho a new Sentence was past, yet it was
not published, in hopes that the <hi>King,</hi>
for the safety of his person, that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
exposed to the resentments of <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Catholicks,</hi> or for the securing
himself from those Seditions which broke
out in one place, as soon as they were
quieted in another, would at last recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
himself to the holy See.</p>
            <p>The only Project that was ever set
on foot after the breach, for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
<hi>England</hi> to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
was almost two years before this, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Anne Bullens</hi> fall: for then the <hi>Pope</hi>
proposed it to <hi>Cassali,</hi> that had been
the <hi>Kings</hi> Ambassador at <hi>Rome,</hi> but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53298:19"/>
the <hi>King</hi> rejected it with so much
scorn, that in his next <hi>Parliament</hi> he
past two <hi>Laws</hi> against all commerce
with that <hi>Court,</hi> severer than any of
the former. 2. There was no need of
asking an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> for annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the <hi>Kings</hi> Marriage with <hi>Anne
Bullen,</hi> and for illegitimating the Issue;
for that was already done, upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a Pre-contract that was drawn
from her: of which it is plain <hi>Mr. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
knew nothing, tho it is in our
<hi>Statute Books,</hi> and these were then
printed both in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English.</hi>
3. It does not appear that there was
ever the least motion of a Marriage
between King <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> muchless that it was believ'd
concluded. 4. Our Author does not
observe the decency of the <hi>Cardinals</hi>
pressing the <hi>Pope</hi> to severity, when he
expressed it by his <hi>Revenging</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
put upon the Purple. It must
be confessed, that this is too haughty a
stile for him that pretends to be the
<hi>Vicar of Christ:</hi> the language of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi>
does not agree with the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Lamb of God. 5. But if
he makes the <hi>Cardinals</hi> speak a little
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53298:20"/>
too high with relation to the <hi>Popes</hi>
Resentments, he makes them as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as can be in their own particulars;
since they own, that the ground of
their courage in serving the <hi>Holy Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
on dangerous occasions, was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credness
of their persons, which must
be maintained, otherwise it could not
be expected that they would expose
themselves any more. There is no
courage when a man knows he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable.
It seems Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
thinks, that the Colledge of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi>
have not the spirit of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
among them: now tho it is very
likely that this may be true, yet Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> had shewed more respect if he
had suppressed it. 6. The Sentence
which Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> represents, as past
at this time, but not pronounced, was
passed two years before this, the first
of <hi>September 1535.</hi> so little is he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act,
that he does not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
the days of printed
<hi>Bulls. 7.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bullar. Rom. Tom. 2. p. 704.</note> Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
this present Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
as in the year
1538. which he sets on his Margin, yet
the final publishing of the Sentence was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53298:20"/>
on the 17. of <hi>December 1538.</hi> So that
all this delay of the Sentence, and that
which follows, could not belong to
this year; but it must come in here
for <hi>Amours</hi> giving a lustre to <hi>Romances;</hi>
our Author thought, it was necessary
to make them have a large share in all
his Relations, and if the dates of
matters will not agree, there is no help
for it, he must pass over such inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
things. 8. <hi>Zealous Catholicks</hi>
again for <hi>Rebels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>XI. He goes on to dream, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
that since the Daughter of
<hi>France</hi> was Christned by King
<hi>Henry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 67.</note> both <hi>Francis</hi> and he
would be obliged to send to <hi>Rome</hi> for a
Dispensation; and that the <hi>Pope</hi> resolved
not to grant it, but after that <hi>England</hi>
should be reconciled to the Holy See.
Therefore to facilitate this matter, the
<hi>Pope</hi> sent for <hi>Pool,</hi> who was then at
<hi>Padua,</hi> and he made him a <hi>Cardinal,</hi>
and sent him to <hi>France,</hi> to set on that
Design: which <hi>Pool,</hi> who loved his
Countrey to excess, undertook with all
possible Zeal. But the <hi>King of England</hi>
by a fatal Blindness rejected all this.
<hi>And here he pretends to tell what
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53298:21"/>
might be the secret Reasons of it, in
his way, that is to say, very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently.
He adds,</hi> that King <hi>Henry</hi>
sent to <hi>Francis,</hi> to demand Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi>
as a Fugitive and a Traytor, and that
he cited the examples of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fifth, and of his Father, who had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up <hi>Princes</hi> of the House of <hi>York</hi>
to the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> and in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that <hi>Henry</hi> threatned <hi>Francis,</hi> that
if he did not grant his desire, he would
break the League in which he was
with him, and would make one with
the Emperour against him.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> had seen Card. <hi>Pools</hi>
Book against King <hi>Henry,</hi>
which he pretends to have
lying before him,<note place="margin">Answer to me. P. 305.</note> he would
have known that it was
printed in the year 1536. in which he
had used the <hi>King</hi> in a stile that no
Crowned Head in the World could
al ow of: but the conclusion of it was
beyond all the rest; for he conjured
<hi>the Emperour to turn his Arms rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King than against the Turk;</hi>
and it was known in <hi>England,</hi> that he
had obtained this Commission to be
sent to <hi>France,</hi> only that he might set
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53298:21"/>
on a League between the two Crowns,
against <hi>England;</hi> and so it was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if the <hi>King</hi> resented his being well
received in the Court of <hi>France.</hi>
2. It is not to be imagined, that when
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was contriving how
to make War upon <hi>England,</hi> and was
the person that chiefly supported
<hi>Cardinal Pool,</hi> that, I say, <hi>King Henry</hi>
would be so highly displeased with the
civility of the Court of <hi>France</hi> to the
<hi>Cardinal,</hi> as to threaten upon that to
join with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> who was the
<hi>Kings</hi> chief Enemy, and the spring
that set <hi>Pool</hi> in motion; therefore all
this whole negotiation is to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
among our Authors Fictions, since
he gives no Proofs of it.</p>
            <p>XII. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> says, <hi>that King</hi>
Henry <hi>set fifty thousand Crowns
on Cardinal</hi> Pools <hi>head:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 72.</note> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this he grafts a new Fable.</p>
            <p>But in the Sentence, and Act of
Attaindor against <hi>Pool,</hi> there is not a
word of any sum set on his head; so
this was a small decoration that was
not to be omitted by a man that does
not trouble himself to examin, whether
what he writes is true or not.</p>

XIII. If <hi>Mr. Varillas</hi> were not so
excessively Ignorant as he is of
the History of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 73.</note> he
would not have passed over
the great advantage he had here of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
King <hi>Henry,</hi> with that
which was indeed the greatest blemish
of his whole Reign, and that was first
practised on the <hi>Countess</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi>
Cardinal <hi>Pools</hi> Mother, whom by an
affectation contrary to our Rules, he
calls <hi>Princess Margaret,</hi> the Title
<hi>Princess</hi> being affected in <hi>England</hi> to
our <hi>Kings</hi> Children; and not being so
much as given to their Brothers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who are only called <hi>Ladies:</hi>
this piece of Tyranny was, that she
was condemned without being
brought to make her Defence, or to
be heard Answer for herself. Now I
leave it to the Reader to judge how
well informed Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is, who
is ignorant of that which is to be found
in every one of our Writers, that
have given the History of that time:
and which would have furnished him

against King <hi>Henry.</hi>

XIV. He tells us; that
<hi>Calvin writ an Apology for</hi>
King Henry's <hi>conduct in that
matter;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> upon which he makes a long
excursion.</p>
            <p>But I know nothing of this matter;
I believe it not a whit the better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> sayes it; and it does
not appear among his printed Works.
He adds, that the accusation was false
that was brought against <hi>Card. Pool,</hi> as
if he had formed a design to raise
Troops in <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> and
to make a descent with them to assist
the <hi>Zealous Catholicks</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> one
reason that he gives to prove it false, is,
that the <hi>English</hi> were at that time <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Sea.</hi> The good opinion
that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has of the Rebellions
of the <hi>Zealous Catholicks of England</hi>
returns often in this kind <hi>Epithet,</hi> that
he bestows on them. But for this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of <hi>Cardinal Pools,</hi> our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
may very well answer it; for I
believe, it was never made by any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
himself: yet so unhappy is he,
that he must discover his Ignorance in
every Page and Line of his Book. The
<hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had then no <hi>Fleets,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:53298:23"/>
and so they were not <hi>Masters of the Sea,</hi>
unless he means that the Soveraignty
of the four Sea's belonged to the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in which sense I
acknowledg, that not only then, but at
all times, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Master
of the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XV. Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> after he had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Romance to make the
round to other parts,<note place="margin">P. 149.</note> returns
back to <hi>England;</hi> but I do
not know by what ill luck it is, that
there is not one single Paragraph that
relates to our Affairs that is true: he
begins here with the pretended Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
against <hi>Latimer,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorne,</hi>
and <hi>Scherton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sarisbery,</hi>
who were, as he says, not only degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but condemned to perpetual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
for having spoke some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
against the <hi>six Articles.</hi> 1. It is
perhaps to descend too low to tell him,
that he ought to have named those
Sees <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and that
the latter of those <hi>Bishops</hi> was not
<hi>Scherton,</hi> but <hi>Shaxton;</hi> for the mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such small faults looks like a want
of more material ones. 2. These two
<hi>Bishops</hi> were never <hi>degraded,</hi> but of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53298:23"/>
their own accord they resigned their
Bishopricks, within three days after
the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>six Articles</hi> had passed;
and it was some time after that, before
they were put in prison, upon an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
relating to the <hi>six Articles,</hi>
and not for <hi>Latimer's</hi> having <hi>eat meat
on a Good Fryday,</hi> as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
reports it in another
place,<note place="margin">Lib. 17. P. 76.</note> having forgot what
he had said here. For it is a
very hard thing to remember Lies,
especially when the number of them is
so excessively great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XVI. Upon</hi> Wolsey'<hi>s fall he tells us,
that the</hi> King <hi>cast his eyes upon</hi>
Thomas Cromwel, to be his chief
Minister;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> who was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of quality; <hi>upon which he tells us,</hi>
that the Family of the <hi>Cromwels</hi> was
very Antient, and had already produced
some that had been raised to the Chief
Imployments in the State; <hi>and so he
goes on to make a</hi> Parallel between the
late <hi>Protector</hi> and King <hi>Henry's</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister:
only he will not in this place exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
whether the one descended from
the other or not.</p>
            <p>One would wonder how it falls out
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53298:24"/>
that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is so constantly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
even in the most obvious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
There is not one that writ in that
time on those Affairs, that does not
take notice of the meanness of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel's</hi>
birth; for his Father was a <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith;</hi>
and his base extraction is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
mentioned in the <hi>Act</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
him. 2. He is the first of his
name that is spoken of in our Story:
for the Family was so far from being
antient, that it was not known before
him. 3. <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> was no way
related to him, and indeed not so much
as by being originally of that name:
being descended from an Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in <hi>Wales,</hi> of the <hi>Ap William's,</hi>
&amp; at this time the <hi>Welchmen</hi> beginning
to take Sirnames, who before went
only by the name of some Eminent man
among their Ancestors, with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Ap</hi> before it: this <hi>Ap Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
having received great Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from <hi>Cromwel,</hi> he made choice
of his name. 4. Our Author says true
here, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> succeeded <hi>Wolsey</hi>
in the <hi>chief Ministry,</hi> but yet he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
himself; for he had said
elsewhere,<note place="margin">Lib. 9. see my Reflect. p. 103. numb. 38.</note> that by <hi>Anne
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53298:24"/>
Bullens</hi> means <hi>Cranmer
was raised at this time to
the Dignity of being the first
Minister:</hi> but he grows old,
and it seems his Memory decays; all the
rest of his Character of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and
the projects that he puts in his head are
a continuation of the Romance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XVII. Mr.</hi> Varillas <hi>will here rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Vulgar, and give a
representation of the state of
the</hi> Monasteries <hi>in</hi> England:<note place="margin">P. 152, 153.</note>
               <hi>he tells us,</hi> They had acquired
the property of two thirds of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
and among the other effects of the
power of the Clergy, he mentions this,
that the <hi>Popes</hi> had many officers in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi>
for levying the Peterpence, who
had such an Influence over the Clergy,
that they had the main stroak in our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;
by which means it was, that
tho the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was as to the
outward appearance Master of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
yet in effect he was far from it:
and that as <hi>King Henry</hi> had a mind to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> off this yoke, so <hi>Cromwel</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
to him the method in which it
might be done: and among other things,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nce the chief resistance that the Crown
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53298:25"/>
had met with in Parliament, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
come from the <hi>Monks,</hi> he propos'd
to the <hi>King</hi> the seising on their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.</p>
            <p>One would think that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
had intended to prepare an Apology
for King <hi>Henry's</hi> seising on the <hi>Abbey
Lands:</hi> for if they had <hi>two thirds of
the Kingdom,</hi> if they were influenced
by <hi>Italian Ministers,</hi> and if they had
always opposed the designs of the
Crown in <hi>Parliament,</hi> here were very
powerful reasons for suppressing them.
2. It is generally believed that the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
Lands</hi> might be one <hi>third</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi>
but no body ever carried the
estimate of their wealth to so invidious
a height before Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> as to
imagin, that they were Masters of <hi>two
thirds of the Nation.</hi> And as for that
Interest that he pretends that some <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
have had in them, and the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that they gave the Crown in
<hi>Parliament,</hi> these are either Fictions of
his own, or of some Author as bad as
himself, if any such can be found. In
the times of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of his Son
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the <hi>Italians</hi> oppressed
<hi>England</hi> severely, but they were far
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53298:25"/>
from doing it by the Interest they had
among the <hi>Monasteries;</hi> for it appears
by <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> how much they
complained of that Tyranny; which
was in a great measure repressed when
<hi>England</hi> came to have <hi>Kings</hi> who had
more spirit: so that <hi>Edward</hi> the first
and <hi>Edward</hi> the third made such effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Laws, that after their time
we find no evidences of any great stroke
that <hi>Italian Officers</hi> had in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>XVIII. He represents</hi> the dissolution
of the Monasteries, as carried
on by a Project of <hi>Cromwels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 154.</note>
who got a great party among the
<hi>Monks</hi> to sign a Petition to the <hi>King,
for which he cites on the Margin the
expositive or Preamble of it,</hi> in which
they set forth their real unhappiness, tho
they seemed to be happy, &amp; that they could
not bear the hardness of their condition,
and therefore they implored the King's
Favour, that they might live as other
Englishmen, free from the constraint
of Vows, and the Tyranny of the
Court of <hi>Rome: and they added,</hi> that
if the King would grant this Petition,
they prayed him to accept a free Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of all their Goods and Lands. This,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53298:26"/>
               <hi>he says,</hi> was sent from House to House,
and it was looked on as the Master-piece
of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has a mind to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to all the World, that he knows
nothing of <hi>English</hi> Affairs: For 1.
there was never any such Petition
made. 2. I have published almost
three hundred of the <hi>Surrendess,</hi> of
which the Original Deeds are yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant:
and these were all of one form,
but were not in one writing, as he
dreams: the Preamble of all is the
same:<note n="*" place="bottom">Sciatis n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3. It is plain our Author knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the <hi>General Visitation</hi> that was
made of all the <hi>Monasteries</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
and of the Discoveries that were made
of the most horrid of all Vices, that
God had punished with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
from Heaven, which reigned
among them: and of the discoveries
made of the Instruments of coyning in
several Houses; and of the False Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
and the Impostures discovered in
some Images, of which the Eyes and
Mouth were made to move by secret
Springs; for these things, that were
laid open in the publickest parts of the
Nation, disposed men to bear with the
dissolution, which perhaps would not
have been otherwise so easily brought
about. 4. Nor does our Author know,
that three years before the general dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
all the small <hi>Monasteries</hi> were
dissolved. In short, the great disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
I had made of the progress of
this matter, might have engaged a
man even of an ordinary degree of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness,
to have read what I had writ
concerning it. But Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> must
be an Original in every thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:53298:27"/>
XIX. He says, <hi>This Petition was no
sooner read in Parliament, than
on the 28. of</hi> April 1539. <hi>they
appointed that all the</hi> Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<hi>in</hi> England <hi>should be set open,<note place="margin">P. 156.</note> and
that their Lands should be appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to the</hi> King <hi>for the encrease of his
Revenue; upon this all was seised on,
and there was so much wealth found
among them, that out of the Church of</hi>
Thomas Becket <hi>alone, there were six
Cart load of</hi> Plate <hi>and other things car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away; and for such of the Religious
Persons as would not quit their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
nor their Lands, they proceeded
against those who were of a meaner rank
as guilty of a Contempt of an</hi> Act <hi>of</hi>
Parliament; <hi>and those that were more
considered, were attainted of Treason,
because some Libels that had been writ
upon the Kings divorce, were found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
their Papers, in which the Kings
Amours were painted to the life; for
these they were accused, as having not
only concealed them, but preserved them
to posterity: and by a new subtilty the
Crime of</hi> lese Majesty <hi>was added to that
of High Treason:</hi> and here he comes
over again with that of <hi>King Edward's
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53298:27"/>
being cut out of his Mothers belly,</hi> as
if the frequent repeating of Falsehoods
would gain them the more credit.
1. <hi>Dates</hi> are unhappy things for Mr.
<hi>Varillas;</hi> for this <hi>Act</hi> did not pass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the 28. of <hi>Iune.</hi> 2. This <hi>Act</hi> did
only confirm what was already done,
but did not at all threaten any that
would not surrender. 3. There were
eighteen <hi>Abbots</hi> present when the <hi>Act</hi>
was first read, and seventeen when it
passed in the House of <hi>Lords,</hi> and yet
none of them opposed it. 4. There
was no petition read in either House
of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that had been made by
the <hi>Monks;</hi> for this <hi>Act</hi> neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
nor opened any <hi>Monasteries,</hi> but
only confirmed the <hi>Kings</hi> Title upon
their Surrenders. 5. His Author <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
had raised up <hi>Two</hi> Chests of the
Plate that belonged to <hi>Beckets</hi> Shrine,
to Twenty six Cart Load: but it seems
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> thought this a little too
Extravagant, so that he reduces it to
a modester number of <hi>six;</hi> but yet he
should stick to his Author. And here I
must call to mind a passage of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's,
that had escaped me, concerning
<hi>Thomas Beckets Bones being raised and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53298:28"/>
burnt;</hi> as if the <hi>King</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed
his Process,<note place="margin">P. 83.</note> and by a
formal Sentence degraded
him of his <hi>Saintship:</hi> whereas this
matter passed without any sort of
Ceremony. <hi>Becket</hi> did things that
were of another nature than all that
has been lately done in the business of
the <hi>Regale;</hi> he was not content to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey,
but thundred against the <hi>King</hi>
and the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the whole <hi>Nation,</hi>
that would not concur with him in
his Violences, which were such, that
at this day they would not pass unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
even in <hi>Spain</hi> it self: and tho he
was killed without any Order of the
<hi>King's,</hi> it is known not only what Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the <hi>King</hi> was forced to do, but
what a Superstition for his Memory
there followed upon his Canonisation:
there were Two <hi>Holy Days</hi> assigned
him: there was a <hi>Iubily</hi> every fifty
year, with Plenary Indulgences to all
who visited his <hi>Tomb,</hi> which brought
sometimes an hundred thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
together; and his <hi>Altar</hi> was so
much more valued than either <hi>Christ's</hi>
or the <hi>Virgins,</hi> that by the old accounts
yet extant it appears, that some years
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53298:28"/>
there were no Offerings at all made
at <hi>Christ's Altar;</hi> and tho there were
indeed some made at the <hi>Virgin's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
yet those of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>'s
made a sum about twenty times more.
So it was no wonder if King <hi>Henry</hi>
put an end to this Superstition: and
therefore he ordered the <hi>Shrine</hi> to be
broken, and the Bones to be <hi>buried,</hi>
as our Authors say positively, tho the
<hi>Italians</hi> say they were <hi>burned;</hi> for so
it is specified in the <hi>Bull:</hi> and indeed
there had been no great fault if they
had been <hi>burnt.</hi> 6. No man could be
punished for refusing to surrender; for
the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> required none to
do it. 7. Those who were attainted
of Treason, had been either in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi>
or had sent their Plate to the
<hi>Rebels.</hi> 8. Our Author shews how
well he understands our <hi>Law,</hi> when
he pretends to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>High Treason</hi> and the Crime of
<hi>lese Majesty;</hi> for they are one and the
same thing: we do not use to express
the highest sort of Crimes against the
State by the term of <hi>Lese Majesty,</hi> but
only by that of <hi>High Treason.</hi> 9.
Those <hi>Libels</hi> of which he speaks, were
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53298:29"/>
only found among the <hi>Carthusians;</hi> and
tho some of that Order were put to
death upon other accounts, yet these
Libels were only made use of to frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them to surrender up their House:
sure here are faults enough for one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph.</p>
            <p>XX. He gives us a long prospect
of what <hi>Cromwel</hi> thought
on,<note place="margin">P. 160.</note> and of what he should
have thought on; both being
alike true and equally judicious: then
he goes on to tell us <hi>the Interests of
the Duke of</hi> Cleves, <hi>and of his Sister's
Qualities:</hi> and to shew us, <hi>how well
he was informed of her greatest Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets;</hi>
he sayes, <hi>that she was fit for
Marriage before she was twelve year
old: but that tho she had been courted
by many Princes, her Brother was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to reserve her for such
an Alliance as might protect
him against the House of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria.
She was a</hi> Lutheran, <hi>which did
not please</hi> Henry,<note place="margin">P. 164.</note> 
               <hi>yet at last the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was agreed on, and She
came to</hi> England,<note place="margin">P. 166.</note> 
               <hi>and was
married the third of Ianuary
1540.</hi> 1. She had been contracted to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53298:29"/>
Prince of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and tho this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of no force in Law, yet it was
afterwards pretended to dissolve her
Marriage with <hi>Henry,</hi> as appears by
the Sentence: So much is our Author
a stranger to her Story, tho he would
make us fancy that he had Memoirs
concerning her from her Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids,
since he tells us when she was fit
for Marriage. 2. I have often warned
our Author to avoid the giving of
<hi>Dates;</hi> for he is unhappy in them all:
this Marriage was made the 6. of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
yet it is much for him to have
hit the Moneth right; for he is not
always so exact.</p>
            <p>XXI. He says, <hi>The King was so
well pleased with this Match,
that immediately upon it,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he
made</hi> Cromwel <hi>Great</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,
<hi>and created him</hi> Earl of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,
<hi>and made his</hi> Son <hi>a Lord.</hi> But this
is so false, that the <hi>King</hi> from the
time he saw <hi>Anne of Cleve,</hi> had an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
for her; and intended once to
have sent her away without Marrying
her; and after he had married her, he
told <hi>Cromwel</hi> how much he disliked
her, and that he believed <hi>She was no
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53298:30"/>
Maid,</hi> and that her person was loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som;
so that he believed he should
never be able to consummate the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
so that <hi>Cromwel</hi> had rather rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to apprehend, that this proving so
unhappy, it would be his Ruin. He
was not made <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> till the
<hi>April</hi> following; so that as this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was too unlucky to do him any
service, it seems it did not hurt him
much neither.</p>
            <p>XXII. He shews us, how well he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
our Constitutions,
when he says,<note place="margin">P. 166.</note> 
               <hi>That the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy
granted the King, was a
Tenth and the Fourth part of a fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth:</hi>
whereas it was a Tenth and
Four Fifteenths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXIII. He says,</hi> That <hi>Cromwel</hi>
having met with some Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by three members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
who were the Bishop
of <hi>Chichester,<note place="margin">P. 168.</note> Dr. Wilson,</hi> and <hi>Fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
a Merchant, he charged some
false Crimes on them, and put them in
prison: but he proceeded more severely
against <hi>John Nevil,</hi> Knight of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for he subordned false Witnesses
against him, so that he was beheaded.</p>

1. The Bishop of <hi>Chichester</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
with every thing that was done
in Parliament, as appears by the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of the House of <hi>Lords:</hi> but some
Correspondence that he held with the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> being discovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this time, he was put in prison;
but upon his submission he was set at
Liberty. 2. <hi>Wilson</hi> being a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
could not be of the House of
<hi>Commons:</hi> and he was no <hi>Bishop,</hi> so
that he could not be a Member of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
House; but he was clapt up as
a Compsice of the Bishop of <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's,</hi>
and likewise set at liberty with
him. <hi>Frammer</hi> is not named, there is
indeed one <hi>Grunceter</hi> a Merchant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
who was condemned of Treason
a year before this. 3. There was one
Sr. <hi>Edward Nevil,</hi> a Knight, tho not
of the <hi>Garter,</hi> who was indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and executed a year before
this; but it was for being in a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
with Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> and more
particularly for having said, <hi>that the
King was a Beast, and worst than a
Beast.</hi> God only knows whether the
Witnesses swore true or false against
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:53298:31"/>
               <hi>XXIV. He tells us,</hi> That <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
to fill up the measure of
his Iniquities,,<note place="margin">P. 169.</note> got a Law to
be made, by which he might
easily dispatch all those who should oppose
his Designs: which was, that any man
condemned in absence, without being
heard to justify himself, either in person,
or by proxy, should be esteemed as justly
condemned as if it had been done in the
common form.</p>
            <p>Here is indeed the great blemish of
of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign, and of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel's</hi>
Ministry: but it is told in such
a manner by Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be no extraordinary thing as
he relates it. 1. There was no <hi>Law</hi>
made about this, it was only practised
by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as the Legislative
Body, without giving the common
Courts of Judicature the power of
using it. 2. The Condemning men
in Absence has been always pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
by our <hi>Law,</hi> when the Absence
was wilful: and if Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> accuses
the putting men to death upon such a
Sentence, it may probably be supposed
to be an effect of his aversion to the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and put here on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53298:31"/>
to aggravate the Execution of Sr.
<hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Monmouth,</hi> who were the two last that
suffered being condemned in absence.
3. The Heinousness of this matter, which
our Author shews he understood not,
consists in this, that men who were in
prison, were condemned upon the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Witnesses against them,
without confronting them with their
Witnesses, or bringing them to answer
for themselves: now tho this was taken
from the Holy Courts of <hi>Inquisition,</hi>
and was only put in practise by the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
it self, yet I will not go about
to soften, much less to justify a practice
so contrary to the most Indispensable
Rules of Equity and Morality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXV. He says,</hi> K. Henry being
sooner disgusted at <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve</hi> than
he had been of his other Wives, dissolved
the Marriage for two reasons; the one
was, that she was Incapable of having
children; and the other was her Heresy;
to which the English Writers that favour
<hi>Henry</hi> add two others; the one, that
those of the League of <hi>Smalcald,</hi> would
not receive the English into their Vnion;
and the other, that <hi>K. Henry's</hi> Interests
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53298:32"/>
were then changed: <hi>to these four rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
he adds a fifth,</hi> that She had not that
engaging Temper, that was necessary to
charm <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It is a strange thing to see an <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
mistake every thing, and that there
should not be one single part of his work
sound. The sentence annulling the <hi>K's.</hi>
Marriage with <hi>Anne of Cleve</hi> is printed,
according to the Record yet extant; in
which, as there is not one of all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
mentioned by Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> so there
are other Reasons that would have
given him much better grounds to
have censured this Action, than those he
sets up, chiefly the second, which is,
that K. <hi>Henry</hi> had not given an inward,
clear, perfect, and entire consent to the
<hi>Marriage,</hi> which I had laid open with
the Indignation that so unjust a practice
ought to raise in an <hi>Historian;</hi> since
here a ground was laid down by which
all Faith and Commerce among men is
quite destroyed: so ill instructed was
Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> that tho he had a mind to
write a <hi>Satyr</hi> against K. <hi>Henry,</hi> he did
not know where to take the true Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
that a man better Informed
would have found if he writes <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks,</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:53298:32"/>
as he does <hi>Satyrs.</hi> Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
will still be Mr. <hi>Varillas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXVI. He pretends,</hi> that Cromwell
would not so far comply with
the King's aversion to <hi>Anne</hi>
of <hi>Cleves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 172.</note> as to concur
with him in the Divorce, which drew
on him his Ruin.</p>
            <p>His testimony was the fullest proof
that the <hi>King</hi> made use of for obtaining
the <hi>Divoce;</hi> but whether he consented
to it or not, it cannot be known: if he
refused to do it, he was so much the
worthier man.</p>
            <p>XXVII. He tells us a long story of the
different Interests to which
K. <hi>Henry</hi> was leaning;<note place="margin">P. 176.</note> at last
he says, <hi>that Cromwellsigned
a League in the Kings name with the</hi>
German <hi>Princes, which some say, he
did without the Kings knowledge, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
others say the contrary: upon which the
Emperours Ambassadours reproached
the King with it, but the King denying it,
the discovery was made:</hi> and after a dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up of the scene with more of his
Visions, it ends in this, <hi>That Cromwell
was put in Prison, yet he hoped to have
justified himself for this Treaty, if he
had been brought to make his Defence:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53298:33"/>
but many other things besides this,
were laid to his charge; and the Law that
he had procured to be passed three moneths
before this, of condemning men without
hearing them, was applied to himself;
so he was condemned and executed the
6. of Iuly; his body being cut up, as is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to Traitors, and Quartered.</hi> And
to justify all this he cites on the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Cromwells Process.</hi> But that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,</hi>
or rather the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that
condemned him, is in print, taken
from the Record, in which there is
not one word of all this business, of
signing a <hi>League</hi> with Forreign <hi>Princes</hi>
without the <hi>Kings</hi> orders. 2. No such
thing can be done according to our
forms. <hi>Amhassadours</hi> that have formal
powers can sign <hi>Leagues,</hi> but the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
about the <hi>King</hi> cannot bind him,
nor sign <hi>Leagues</hi> without him: and no
<hi>Prince</hi> would have either asked or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
any such thing 3. All that is
objected to <hi>Cromwell</hi> in his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is so Inconsiderable, that it is
plain there was no great matter against
him; some Malversations and illegal
Warrants, some high boasting words,
is all that is to be found in his Attaindor
4. There was no such <hi>Law</hi> ever made;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53298:33"/>
for Parliaments do not make Laws,
with relation to their own proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
but this practice was indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
not three moneths, but a full
year before this. 5. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in his venturing upon <hi>Dates;</hi> for
<hi>Cromwels</hi> Execution was not on the
6. but on the 18. of <hi>Iuly. 6. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
was only beheaded; it is true the
Hangman did it in a butcherly manner;
but all the rest is fiction, and I am not
much concerned whether <hi>Florimond</hi>
or Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is the Contriver.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. He says, <hi>Anne of Cleves
was terrified with a Sentence
of Death,<note place="margin">P. 177.</note> as being a Heretick,
and that She was so far wrought
on by that, as to become the Chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of her own Degradation; for
She confessed that She had promised
Marriage to another before King</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>had pretended to her; upon which her
Marriage was dissolved, and She was
sent back to</hi> Germany. I have already
shewed the falsehood of this from the
Sentence it self, that dissolved the
Marriage. Nor did She ever go back
to <hi>Germany,</hi> but stayd still in <hi>England,</hi>
being contented with the appointments
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53298:34"/>
that were set off for her, and with
the honour of being made the <hi>King's</hi>
adopted <hi>Sister,</hi> which it seems was
more supportable to her, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to her own Countrey with the
Infamy of such a Degradation: which
she indeed bore, either with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of a great Philosopher, or with
the insensibility of one that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
stupid.</p>
            <p>XXIX. He tells us of <hi>a new project
of a Reconciliation with the
Pope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 200.</note> in which he is so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
as to set down the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
that were proposed, and King
<hi>Henry</hi>'s Exceptions to them: and he
tells us at last, <hi>That King</hi> Henry <hi>stood
so much on the point of Honour, that he
thought it below his Dignity to make any
Submission to the Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is Fiction, without the least
proof: for it does not appear, that
after that proposition that was made
upon <hi>Anne Bullen's</hi> fall, there was ever
the least step made by either side in this
matter. Our Author had heard there
was one made, but not knowing where
to place it, his fancy rambled about.
Indeed the <hi>King</hi> was so much alienated
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53298:34"/>
from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi>
and <hi>Knevet</hi> being sent Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
to the <hi>Diet</hi> at this time, one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to <hi>Knevet</hi> some secret Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views
that had passed between <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
and the <hi>Legate:</hi> which <hi>Gardiner</hi>
considered as so great an Injury to him,
and as that which must have ruined him
in the <hi>Kings</hi> spirit, that he prosecuted
the Informer as a Slanderer, and got
him to be put in Prison: concerning
which, his Letters to the <hi>King</hi> are in
print: which shew clearly, that there
was no such Negotiation at this time
on foot, otherwise those secret En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviews
could not have been such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXX. Mr.</hi> Varillas <hi>says,</hi> That the
K. who would not submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so far as to confess his Sins,<note place="margin">P. 202.</note>
did a much meaner thing; for
he accused his Queen, <hi>Katherine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> for her disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
both before and after her Marriage
with <hi>Thomas Culper</hi> and <hi>Francis
Dirham,</hi> and so her Head was cut
off</p>
            <p>There are few Writers that do not
at some time or other tell things true;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53298:35"/>
but Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> must needs be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
person, and commit such
Errors as no other man ever did before
him. <hi>Catherine Howard's</hi> Incontinence
was discovered, and proved many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
before the Parliament met: nor
would the <hi>King</hi> at all appear in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
as it is expresly mentioned in the
Record. It were too great an Honour
to our Author, to insist on such small
Faults as that he names the Persons
wrong.</p>
            <p>XXXI. Nor ought I to make any
great Account of his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our <hi>English</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
since he calls <hi>Catherine
Parre</hi> Sister to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 203.</note> who
was Sister to the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Nort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton;</hi>
these things might indeed
be forgiven him, if it were not that
he sets them down to shew how well
he is informed even in the smallest
matters, which no doubt will make
some Impression on Strangers, who
do not know our Affairs, nor our Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXXII. He reproaches</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
for making a League
with <hi>Henry</hi> against <hi>Francis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 207.</note>
notwithstanding his Schism.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:53298:35"/>
But why might not <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth
do the same thing, that <hi>Francis</hi> had
done for seven years together? It is
known, that <hi>Francis</hi> was not so scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as to decline the making of any
<hi>League,</hi> that might be to his Advantage,
not only with <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> but even
with <hi>Mahometans:</hi> and some have been
so malicious as to say, that this is a maxim
that some of his <hi>Successors</hi> have thought
fit to keep up and put in practise against
the <hi>House of Austria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXXIII. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> tells us, <hi>That</hi>
Richer <hi>was appointed to set on
the King of</hi> Denmark <hi>against</hi>
England,<note place="margin">P. 293.</note> 
               <hi>and that he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to him, that King</hi> Henry <hi>had
taken occasion to come over to</hi> Picardy,
<hi>at the same time that</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into</hi> Champaigne <hi>with a formidable
Army, and that K.</hi> Henry <hi>had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged</hi>
Bulloigne, <hi>and tahen it, therefore
the K. of</hi> France <hi>resolved to make</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
<hi>the scene of the War: and that
since he knew the great pretensions that
the Crown of</hi> Denmark <hi>had upon</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<hi>which his Subjects had formerly
conquered, he thought the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
proper for the renewing these:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53298:36"/>
so he invited him to share with him,
and to accept the Provinces that lay over
against</hi> Denmark, <hi>while the</hi> French
<hi>King should seise on those that lay nearer
him.</hi> Now it is to be considered, that
this was in the year 1542. as he warns
us by his Margin; and all this is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as he told us in his Preface, on
<hi>Richers</hi> Negotiation, of whose Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he makes so great an account,
telling us both <hi>that he was the first that
negotiated according to form with the
Kings of the North,</hi> and <hi>owning that
he had drawn his thirteenth Book out of
his Memoirs, in which there are some
things that by the order of time had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to his fifth Book, but he had not
seen those Memoirs when he writ his
first Volum, therefore his</hi> Reader <hi>must
forgive him if there is any disorder in the
recital that he gives:</hi> and now from all
this one would he disposed to believe,
that there is some truth in this matter,
and that he has really such a Book of
<hi>Memoirs</hi> in his hands; but I need give
no other proof to shew that all this is
Imposture, save that <hi>Bulloign</hi> was not
taken before the 18. of <hi>September 1544.</hi>
so that all this Negotiation of <hi>Richers</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:53298:36"/>
in 1542. must have been by the spirit
of Prophesy. 2. The state of <hi>Denmark</hi>
at that time must make this project ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
very ridiculous, since they were
far from being in a condition to set out
great fleets, and make Conquests.
3. At this time <hi>Francis</hi> did indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> to make an
Invasion into the North of <hi>England,</hi>
which was a more reasonable project:
and that which our Author might have
more justly guess't at, tho he had
known nothing of it; for it was an easy
thing to engage the <hi>Scots</hi> to fall into
<hi>England,</hi> but that was too true and
too natural, therefore our Author,
who loves to <hi>elevate</hi> and <hi>surprise</hi> his
<hi>Reader,</hi> would needs despise the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so would carry it
over to <hi>Denmark. 4.</hi> It is also no less
clear, that <hi>Francis</hi> was at that time in no
condition to make a descent upon <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
otherwise he used the <hi>Scots</hi> very
ungratefully; for tho he had engaged
them in the war, yet he left them to be
overrun by the <hi>English</hi> without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
K. <hi>Henry</hi> any considerable diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
5. But our Authors setting on
the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> to renew preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53298:37"/>
of five hundred year old, is of a
piece with the Law at <hi>Metz:</hi> and when
<hi>England</hi> will examin its Ancient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
to some <hi>Provinces</hi> in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> as it needs not go so
far back, so it will not be put to found
them on hostile descents and depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which was all the pretension that the
Crown of <hi>Denmark</hi> could ever claim,
but on clear and undisputed Rights:
tho I confess they have been both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued
and renounced; but I build on
the modern Law, that neither <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,
Treaties</hi> nor <hi>Oaths</hi> can cut
off the Rights of a <hi>Crown,</hi> which are
sacred and Inalienable.</p>
            <p>Thus I have gone over his third
<hi>Tome,</hi> and I think I have missed nothing
that relates to <hi>English affairs.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I may have passed over some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
that may perhaps lie Involved in
other Relations, as this of <hi>Richers</hi> had
almost escaped me. I have turned all
his leaves over and over again to see for
any thing that might relate to <hi>England.</hi>
But I could not prevail with my self to
read him all; for I am now past the
Age of reading <hi>Romances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXXIV. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> begins his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53298:37"/>
concerning <hi>English Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi>
in his fourth <hi>Tome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 62.</note> with a
Character of K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that deserves indeed to be put in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals;
he says, <hi>that during his Sickness,
his Conscience had time to reproach him,
with the 2. Cardinals, the 3. Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
the 18. Bishops, the 14. Arch dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
the 500. Priests, Abbots, and
Priors, the 60. Canons, and 50. Doctors,
12. Dukes, Earles, or Barons, 29.
Knights, 336. Gentlemen, and almost
an Infinite number of people, whom he
had put to death for establishing his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
over the Church of England.</hi> And
because all this was so remarkable, he
would not put the numbers in Ciphers,
but in words at large; and by the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his small numbers, a man that is
not aquainted with his <hi>Talent,</hi> would
be tempted to think this might be true:
but what will he say, if of all those ten
<hi>Items,</hi> besides the great <hi>Et cetera</hi> of the
<hi>Infinit</hi> number, there is not one that
is either true or near truth. 1. <hi>Fisher</hi>
was the only person that can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> that was put to death.
2. There was not one <hi>Archbishop</hi> that
suffered; and tho the Archbishop of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53298:38"/>
               <hi>York</hi> concurred in the <hi>Yorkshire Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi>
yet the <hi>King</hi> included him in the
Indemnity. 3. There was not one
<hi>Bishop</hi> that suffered, unless he subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<hi>Fisher,</hi> as he did <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth,
and makes both a <hi>Cardinal</hi> and a <hi>Bishop</hi>
out of him. 4. There is not an <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon</hi>
to be found among all that died
in this Reign. 5. For the 500 <hi>Priests, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots</hi>
and <hi>Priors,</hi> there were only 9. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots,
3. Priors, 18. Priests,</hi> and 9. <hi>Monks</hi>
that suffered, which according to my
Arithmetick makes only 39: but an
Imagination that multiplies as Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>'s
does, can swell this up to 500.
6. There is but one among all that
suffered that can be thought a <hi>Canon,
Crofts,</hi> that is designed in the Record
Chancellor of <hi>Exeter. 7.</hi> There is
but one <hi>Doctor,</hi> unless <hi>Fisher</hi> comes into
the account again. 8. All of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
that were executed during this
reign, were one <hi>Duke,</hi> a <hi>Marquis, 3.
Earls,</hi> and 3. <hi>Lords,</hi> which make 8. but
this comes the nearest his number; yet
since the <hi>Marquis</hi> that suffered was K.
<hi>Henry</hi>'s Cosen german, he might have
put <hi>Marquises</hi> among the degrees of
the Peers that he reckons up, as well as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53298:38"/>
the rest. 9. There were only ten <hi>Knights</hi>
that were put to death; so the 19.
more are of his creating. 10. There are
ouly 33. others that suffered, of which
some were only Yeomen to make up
his 336. <hi>Gentlemen;</hi> and now I have
set down the list exactly of all that died
by the hand of justice in this Reign: so
that there is not a man left for his &amp;c.
of <hi>almost an Infinite number of people.</hi> But
besides this, all these except only 12.
persons, suffered either for being in
actual Rebellion, or for entring into
Conspiracies for the raising of one; so
small was the number of those who
suffered for denying the <hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi>
and even of these a distinction is to be
considered, which I must explain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some have fancied, that I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
my self in different parts of my
<hi>History,</hi> having said in some places,
that none suffered for not acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the <hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi> and having
set forth in other places, that men died
for denying it. But the refusing to swear
the Oath of supremacy was only punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
at first with a <hi>Premunire,</hi> that is
<hi>loss of liberty and Goods,</hi> so that those
who suffered were not condemned for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53298:39"/>
refusing to swear that Oath, but for
their having spoken against the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy:</hi>
now <hi>the refusing to swear
it,</hi> and the <hi>speaking against it,</hi> are two
different things; which some have
confounded. It is true, afterwards a
<hi>Law</hi> was made, declaring it to be
<hi>High Treason to refuse to swear the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</hi>
But no man ever suffered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Law; for no man ever refused it
after that Law was made. And thus
we see what we may expect from our
Author after such a beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXXV. He says,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>
seemed to repent of what he
had done when he was near
death,<note place="margin">P. 63.</note> and that he spake with
<hi>Gardiner</hi> concerning it, who upon that
advised him to call a Parliament. <hi>But
the Falsehood of this is too visible; for
there was a</hi> Parliament <hi>then sitting,
which was dissolved by the</hi> King<hi>'s
Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXXVI. He says, <hi>The Church of
the</hi> Franciscans <hi>was opened in</hi>
London,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>25. dayes before his
death;</hi> and he had said before,
<hi>that King</hi> Henry <hi>was 57. years
of Age compleat when he dyed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 61</note>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:53298:39"/>
This Church that he represents as the
<hi>Cordelier</hi>'s Church, was indeed opened;
but it was in order to the making it an
<hi>Hospital,</hi> and was no more the <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi>
Church. But now I will shew
Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> how just I am to him;
for I think I am bound to take notice
that this date is right: For tho it is of
no great consequence, yet it is the
first that I have found him give true:
and perhaps it is true, because it is of
no consequence: but he is above a full
year wrong in a matter of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
which is King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Age;
for he was born the 28. of <hi>Iune 1491.</hi>
so on the 27. <hi>Ianuary</hi> or the 28. for
he dyed in the night between them
1547. he wanted five moneths of six
and fifty: So natural is it for Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
to mislead his Reader in every
thing.</p>
            <p>XXXVII. He says, <hi>The disorder of
the Kings Marriages, and the
three Children that he had by
three of them,<note place="margin">P. 63.</note> gave grounds to
apprehend a Civil War upon his death,
against which he provided by putting his
only Son</hi> Edward <hi>first in the Succession.</hi>
But out of what part of our Authors
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53298:40"/>
study of the Law, did he find this,
that a <hi>Son</hi> of an unquestioned Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
on all hands, could receive any
opposition from two <hi>Sisters,</hi> both born
in Marriages that had been questioned.
The <hi>Succession</hi> had been also expresly
regulated by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the
Kings power of disposing of it by his
<hi>Testament</hi> was only in default of all
his own Children, or of issue by
them.</p>
            <p>XXXVIII. He gives us a character
of the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi>
that shews how well he knew
him:<note place="margin">P. 64.</note> he says, <hi>He had an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Capacity, and a Penetration
of Spirit superiour to the greatest Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
The D.</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> was indeed a
man of great probity; but his Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and Penetration of Spirit were far
from Extraordinary. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
thought those strokes were magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
so he did not trouble himself,
whether they were true or false.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXXIX. Mr.</hi> Varillas <hi>tells us,</hi> that
<hi>Somerset</hi> represented to the
English Nobility,<note place="margin">P. 65.</note> the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of having 16. Governours
for their young King, as King <hi>Henry</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:53298:40"/>
had determined it: and that three parts
of four of these were most zealous for
reconciling <hi>England</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and so no doubt they would breed up
the King in those sentiments, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
as soon as the King came of Age,
he would annul all that his Father had
done, which would ruin the whole No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility:
and that since it was much fitter
to have only one Regent, he engaged to
them, that if they would pitch on him,
he should take care of the Kings Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and should be so far from distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the Nobility in the possession of the
Church Lands, that he should grant them
all the Ratifications that should be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
all this was so well received,
that King <hi>Henry</hi>'s true Testament was
suppressed, and a new one was forged,
by which <hi>Somerset</hi> was declared Regent
and Protector; which surprised all those
who had the chief Interest to maintain
the Government during the Minority, in
the state in which King <hi>Henry</hi> had left
it.</p>
            <p>1. King <hi>Henry</hi> died the 28. of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
upon which the young <hi>King</hi>
was presently brought up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and upon the first of <hi>February
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53298:41"/>
Somerset</hi> was declared <hi>Protector.</hi>
2. This was not done by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> but by the
consent of the major part of the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<hi>Governours,</hi> whom King <hi>Henry</hi>
had named; and the Original Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this under all their hands is
yet extant. 3. There was no new
<hi>Will</hi> forged; for that which was then
published, was the same that made all
the sixteen equal in power: and <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi>
had the Title of <hi>Protector</hi> given
him by these only, with this express
condition, <hi>that he should do nothing
without the Advice and Consent of the
rest.</hi> Nor was it ever pretended, that
King <hi>Henry</hi> had ordered it so by his
<hi>Will:</hi> so all that Negotiation with the
<hi>Nobility,</hi> is to pass for a Fiction of
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s, or of some other that is
about his pitch of sincerity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XL. He says,</hi> Vrisly the Chancellour
was the only person that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of this;<note place="margin">P. 67.</note> but that was
made use of as a pretence to send
him away from the Court.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Wriothesley</hi> the Chancellour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
did not like <hi>Somerset</hi>'s Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but he signed it with the rest.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53298:41"/>
2. The pretext upon which he was
turned out, was the passing an illegal
Patent, for divolving the Execution of
his Office, in the matters of Justice to
some other persons, which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Law, he to redeem himself
from a further Censure, resigned his
place.</p>
            <p>XLI. He says, <hi>Somerset forbad the
Bishops to confer Orders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings permission,<note place="margin">P. 68.</note> and
made them come up to</hi> London
<hi>to obtain it, and that he granted it only
for a limited time, and during pleasure:
and that he forced the new Preachers to
take their Mission for it under the Kings
Name: and by this means he hindred
those to preach who were able to defend
the Catholick Doctrines.</hi> And for the
Proof of all this he cites the Ordon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth. There
is a particular misfortune on Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
in all he writes; for tho there was
indeed an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> passed
before the end of this Year, that did
very much subject the <hi>Bishops</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things to the <hi>Regal</hi> power; yet
there is a special exception in it of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
or Presentations to Benefices,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53298:42"/>
and of Letters of Orders, in which
no Limits were set them. 2. The <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences</hi>
that were given to <hi>Preachers,</hi>
were only Civil things, being Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
to preach; but there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Mission pretended to be in
them. 3. Tho the <hi>King</hi> did Licence
some <hi>Preachers,</hi> to preach in any part
of <hi>England,</hi> yet the <hi>Bishops</hi> retained
still their Authority of granting them
within their own <hi>Diocesses.</hi> 4. That
which Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> perhaps relates to,
in some parts of this Period, is, that
under King <hi>Edward,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> were
obliged to take out new Commissions
from the <hi>King,</hi> such as they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out under King <hi>Henry,</hi> for hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their <hi>Bishopricks</hi> during the
<hi>Kings</hi> pleasure. This <hi>Bonner,</hi> and some
of the other Popish <hi>Bishops,</hi> had first
set on foot under King <hi>Henry,</hi> hoping
by so abject a Submission to gain much
credit with him: but <hi>Cranmer</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
so far as to get this to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid aside. And now all these things
shew that our Author is still as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as he was in his Citations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XLII. He pretends,</hi> That <hi>Cranmer</hi>
set out at this time a Catechism, which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53298:42"/>
inclined more to the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Doctrine,<note place="margin">P. 69.</note> upon which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector</hi>
looked down upon him,
not thinking it fit to carry his displeasure
farther. <hi>Cranmer</hi> could not know to
what the <hi>Protector</hi>'s coldness was to be
ascribed, but fancying that a further
Declaration of himself was expected, he
professed himself a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and took
a Wife, whom he had seduced while he
was in <hi>Germany,</hi> and had entertained
ever after as a Concubine.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Cranmer</hi> did not set out his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,
till about two years after
his. 2. <hi>Somerset</hi> and <hi>He</hi> were always
in a very perfect Friendship. 3. He
had married his Wise before he came
out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and had owned it to
King <hi>Henry.</hi> It is true, upon the <hi>Act</hi>
of the <hi>six Articles</hi> he had sent her over
to <hi>Germany,</hi> so that all he did at this
time, was only to bring her over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and to own her more publickly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XLIII. I pass over what he says here
of</hi> Latimers <hi>Degradation, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
on that formerly: he
says,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 77.</note> The Duke of <hi>Sommerset</hi>
set two men about the King for
his Education; the one was <hi>Richard
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53298:43"/>
Croc,</hi> and the other was <hi>John Cheek,</hi>
a Libertin, that every day gave new cause
of Scandal.</p>
            <p>But 1. These who were trusted
with the Education of King <hi>Edward,</hi>
were no other than those that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had set about him, ever since he
was six Year old, as is set down by
that young <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Iournal</hi> of his
own <hi>Life,</hi> writ with his own hand.
2. Our Author it seems knows both
their Names and their Characters
alike; for he, whom he calls <hi>Croc,</hi>
was <hi>Cox;</hi> and for Sr. <hi>Iohn Cheek,</hi> he
was not only one of the learnedest,
but was esteemed one of the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousest
Gentlemen of his Age: he was
indeed prevailed on thro fear, to sign
an Abjuration of his Religion in
Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> days; but that did so
strike him, that he not only went out of
<hi>England</hi> quickly, and made an open
Retractation of what he had done, but
was so affected with the sense of it that
he could never overcome it, but fell
into a Languishing, of which he soon
after died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XLIV. He says,</hi> that <hi>Bucer</hi> avowed
to the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53298:43"/>
he did not believe all that was
said of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the <hi>New
Testament.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 96.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sanders,</hi> who very probably made
this Story, said, it was to the Lord <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
that <hi>Bucer</hi> said this; but now the
man is changed. 2. If this had been
said to the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
it is very probable that when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his Aversion to the <hi>Reformed
Religion,</hi> and to the Preachers of it,
at his death, this, which was beyond
all other things, would have been
mentioned. 3. Or at least, when <hi>Bucer's</hi>
Process was made, and his Body burnt,
this would have been very probably
made use of, if the Lye had been then
made. 4. No man of that Age writ
with a greater sense of the Kingdom
of Christ, than <hi>Bucer</hi> did, in the Book
on that subject which he writ for King
<hi>Edward's</hi> use.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XLV. He tells us,</hi> that on the
fourth of <hi>November, 1547.</hi> at
<hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> a new form of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was set up, which as to the
Doctrine was almost the same with
<hi>Calvinism;</hi> but they retained the Rites
and the exterior of <hi>Lutheranism;</hi> they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53298:44"/>
appointed all the <hi>Church-Lands</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
to be annexed to the Crown, and
never to be again dissolved from it: they
also appointed, that there should be a
new form of Administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
different from the <hi>Roman:</hi> that
Bishops and Priests should be ordained
by this Form: that Images, which were
yet held in reverence in some places, for
the Miracles that had been wrought
before them, should be taken away; and
the Kings Arms put in their stead: that
the Roman Missal should be abolished,
and that the Sacrament should be given
in both kinds; and in fine, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Offices, and above all the Canon of
the Liturgy, should be said only in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
tho the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Welsh,</hi> who
were almost as numerous as the <hi>English,</hi>
understood that Langage no more than
they did the <hi>Latin.</hi> And thus by a Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
that will appear almost incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to those who know perfectly the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, they peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
changed their Religion, under a
Minority, without any Opposition.</p>
            <p>Here much patience is requisite to
read or examin such a confusion of
matters, as Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> gives us all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53298:44"/>
at once. But 1. The new form of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
was not set out till five year after
this, in the year 1552. 2. The <hi>Church-Lands</hi>
were never annexed to the
Crown; but Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s mistake is,
that those Chantry-Lands, that had not
been suppressed by King <hi>Henry,</hi> were
indeed given to King <hi>Edward</hi> by an
Act that passed not the fourth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
but the fourteenth of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
1547.</hi> 3. The new form of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
the <hi>Sacraments</hi> was not set
out till the fifteenth of <hi>Ianuary, 1549.</hi>
4. The new form of <hi>Ordinations</hi> was
not set out before the year 1550.
5. <hi>Images</hi> were ordered to be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
by an Order from the Council
the eleventh of <hi>February 1548.</hi> 6. There
was never an Order made for setting up
the <hi>King's Arms</hi> in the Churches, tho it
was done in most places. 7. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
had said, that a new form of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
the <hi>Sacraments</hi> different
from the <hi>Roman</hi> was appointed, and
now as in a new Article he tells us,
that the <hi>Roman Missal</hi> was abolished;
but this is one of the Indications from
which we may measure his profound
Judgment. 8. He puts at the end,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53298:45"/>
that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> was appointed to be
given in both kinds, whereas this was
done first of all in an <hi>Act</hi> that past
the twentieth of <hi>December, 1547.</hi>
9. He very learnedly makes a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between the <hi>Divine Offices,</hi> and
the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> tho as they
are in themselves one and the same
thing, they are likewise used promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in <hi>England.</hi> 10. The Law for the
<hi>Service</hi> in <hi>English</hi> did not extend to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and care was taken to put it
quickly into <hi>Welch.</hi> 11. It seems he
knows the estimate of our Numbers
as well as he does other things, who
says, the <hi>Welch</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> are as many
almost as the <hi>English;</hi> whereas they
are not perhaps above the tenth
man to the <hi>English.</hi> 12. Thus we
see his fruitful fourth of <hi>November,
1547.</hi> which he had made so productive,
is stript of all, and not any one of all
those great Changes belongs to it. But
to comfort Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> a little, I will
tell him, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
one or two of the things he
names, was indeed opened the fourth
of <hi>November, 1547.</hi> but it is long
after a <hi>Parliament</hi> is opened, before an
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53298:45"/>
               <hi>Act</hi> is passed: and thus it appears, that
all that sudden change, was a Dream
of our Author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XLVI. He says,</hi> There were five
Bishops, <hi>London, Winchester,
Duresm,<note place="margin">P. 97.</note> Chichester,</hi> and
<hi>Worcester,</hi> and some of the most
learned in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi>
that opposed these things; but yet as soon
as they were decreed, they complyed, and
professed the new Religion.</p>
            <p>There were many of the other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
that opposed them, as well as
those <hi>five;</hi> nor did they ever concur
with that which he calls the <hi>new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
for they were all turned out of
their Bishopricks before the year
1552. in which the Articles of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
were agreed on, and set out by
Authority. So that if our Author had
known the Story better, he should
have valued them as <hi>Confessors;</hi> for tho
they comply'd in a great many things,
yet it appers that they were still true
to their old perswasions; upon which
they fell in trouble, and were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turned out illegally, but kept in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for several years, till Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
set them at liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:53298:46"/>
               <hi>XLVII. He says,</hi> that <hi>King Henry</hi>
had ordered the <hi>Bible</hi> to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
correctly,<note place="margin">P. 98.</note> and that he had put
with it <hi>Erasmus's</hi> last <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase</hi>
on the <hi>New Testament;</hi> but the
Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> found this Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did not agree so well with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Sacramentary's,</hi> so he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
a new Translation to be made, that
was more favorable to their figurative
expressions. At which the Press<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
wrought so long, till there was not only
a sufficient number of Copies printed off
for all the Parish Churches, but likewise
for all that could read.</p>
            <p>There was no new Translation of
the <hi>Bible</hi> thought on during this reign;
for that was done in Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi>'s
time: so that King <hi>Henry</hi>'s continued
all this Reign. Nor had King <hi>Henry</hi>
put <hi>Erasmus</hi>'s Paraphrase either with
the Bible, or in the Churches; for
that was done by the Duke of <hi>Somerset;</hi>
and <hi>Gardiners Letters</hi> to him are yet
extant and in print, complaining of
that Paraphrase in a great many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
So constantly mistaken is our

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hor even in matters concerning
which it had been easy for him to have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53298:46"/>
found better Information.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XLVIII. Mr.</hi> Varillas <hi>tells us,</hi> that
the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and the
<hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Chester,<note place="margin">Ibid</note> Mena</hi> and
<hi>Sadore</hi> comply'd outwardly as <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries;</hi>
but lived in the secret practice of
the Catholick Religion: <hi>Somerset</hi> was
informed of this, so he ordered some to
tell them, that they were the only Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
of <hi>England,</hi> that were opposite to
the publick Religion: and therefore the
King desired to be satisfied in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
so the tryal that was required of
them, was, that they should marry: which
tho it was somewhat uneasy, to men past
threescore, yet they comply'd, even in
this: and <hi>Somerset</hi> having by this means
rendred them very contemptible, did not
only banish them, but put them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
and he treated other <hi>Bishops</hi> in the
same manner for their defending the
Catholick Religion in full Parliament, tho
they had done it very feebly.</p>
            <p>1. I find Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is as Ignorant
in <hi>Geography,</hi> as he is in <hi>Chronology:</hi>
for among all the Bishopricks of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
he will neither find <hi>Mena</hi> nor
<hi>Sadore.</hi> 2. There is indeed an <hi>Island,</hi>
that lyes between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:53298:47"/>
that is a Soveraignty, belonging
to the Earl of <hi>Derby.</hi> But the Island
is <hi>Man,</hi> or in Latin <hi>Mona,</hi> but was
never called <hi>Mena.</hi> In this Island there
is a Bishop, who is called <hi>Bishop of
Man,</hi> but he writes it in Latin <hi>Sodore:</hi>
so this is wrong put by Mr. <hi>Varillas
Sadore;</hi> yet these may be faults of the
press: but the making two Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
out of one, and the making this
<hi>Bishop</hi> subject to the King of <hi>England,</hi>
and receiving Orders from the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
are Faults that he cannot turn
over upon his Compositor. 3. It does
not appear that either the Archbishop
of <hi>York,</hi> or the Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> did
ever oppose any thing in <hi>Parliament:</hi>
for tho many of the other Bishops
voted against the changes that were
made in matters of Religion, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Journals of the House of
<hi>Lords,</hi> yet these two concurred in
every thing: and all <hi>Henry</hi>'s time,
<hi>Holgate</hi> was considered still as one
united to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and he was by his
Interest raised to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>York:</hi> as for
the Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> I confess, I know
no particulars. 4. It is true that they
were both married; for I found a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53298:47"/>
issued out by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> for
turning them out, because of their
Marriage: but it is certain, that they
were neither in disgrace, nor in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
all King <hi>Edwards</hi> Reign: for
the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> was all this
while in High Favour. <hi>5. England</hi> is
not a Countrey in which the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of a <hi>Regent,</hi> or even <hi>Letters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cachet</hi> can either <hi>banish</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison</hi>
men, chiefly when that is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
only on some suspitions. No; it
is a Countrey governed by <hi>Law:</hi> but
it seems Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had his head full
of somewhat nearer him when he
writ this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XLIX. He sets out the</hi> Constancy <hi>of</hi>
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> during her <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
Reign,<note place="margin">P. 100, 101, 102.</note> and that She
continued firm in the Religion
of her Ancestors: that tho
<hi>Somerset</hi> brought the Italian Divines
<hi>Martyr</hi> and <hi>Ochin</hi> to her, to convince
her, She answered all their Objections
with great vigor; She spoke stoutly to
<hi>Somerset;</hi> She interrupted the Privy
Councellours, when they spoke to her of
those matters; and She would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ever hear
any of their Sermons, but one only. In
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53298:48"/>
short, that she threatned those, that
threatned her: and told them, a time
would come in which they should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for that. Her constancy was such,
that at last <hi>Somerset</hi> desired only, that
she would at least shut her Chappel doors
when Mass was said; but even in that
she satisfied him as little as in other
things.</p>
            <p>Here are so many lovely strokes,
that it is a great Pity they are all false.
1. Some Letters past between the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector</hi>
and her, that are in print; but
it does not appear that ever he spoke
to her upon this subject. 2. She ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pretended to be of the Religion of
her Ancestors; but by all her Letters
she declared, she was of the Religion
that her Father had setled: and she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
insisted on his <hi>Laws,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in a Minority they could not
be altered. 3. She spoke <hi>French</hi> well,
and understood <hi>Latin;</hi> but she could
neither speak <hi>Italian,</hi> nor <hi>Latin:</hi> so
she could have no conversations nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> nor <hi>Ochin:</hi> nor
is this named among all the Letters
that were writ concerning this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
4. She would never hear any
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53298:48"/>
one Sermon; so here the Character
was as much slackened, as it was raised
in the other parts of this paragraph.
For when Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> went to her,
and offered to preach before her, she
told him plainly, that she would never
hear any one of them. 5. The <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi>
was too discreet to threaten her
Brothers <hi>Ministers,</hi> or to talk of a
time in which they might be called to
an account for what they did: for such
Language never comes from Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Heirs, unless they are extream in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet.
6. The great dispute with
the <hi>Princess,</hi> fell out after <hi>Somerset</hi>'s
disgrace, and was chiefly set on by
the <hi>King</hi> her <hi>Brother,</hi> who could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be prevailed with by the <hi>Privy
Conncil,</hi> to consent to her having <hi>Mass</hi>
still said in her Chappel; and after he
had talked with her himself upon that
matter, he sets down these words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Resolution that was taken,
in his Journal. <hi>The Bishops of</hi>
Canterbury,<note place="margin">The 20<hi rend="sup">th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> day of March 1550.</note> London, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,
<hi>did consider, to give
licence to sin was sin: to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and wink at it for a
time, might be born, so all
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53298:49"/>
hast possible might be used.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>L. He says,</hi> There was no appearance
that King <hi>Edward</hi> could live
till he should be of Age,<note place="margin">P. 103.</note> so that
Princess <hi>Mary</hi> was considered
not only as the Presumptive, but as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Heir of the Crown. But at this
time the Prince of <hi>Spain</hi> lost his Wife,
and <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth comforted himself
with the hopes of uniting <hi>England</hi> to
his other Dominions by marrying his Son
to her; so that Emperour resolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
her, and sent <hi>Vargas</hi> both to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
and if that prevailed not, to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>Somerset,</hi> in case he gave any further
disturbance to her, upon which he was
forced to let that matter fall.</p>
            <p>All this is so false, that the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
set on a Treaty of Marriage for
the <hi>Princess</hi> with the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
of which I gave an account in my Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story:
but since that time a Volum
of Original <hi>Letters</hi> has been sent me
by the Heirs of Sr. <hi>Philip Hobby,</hi> who
was then <hi>Ambassadour</hi> in the <hi>Emperours</hi>
Court: in which I find more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
relating both to this Marriage,
and to the <hi>Princesses</hi> permission for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Mass</hi> in her House. There is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53298:49"/>
one Letter, dated the 19. of <hi>March,
1550.</hi> signed by all the Council, in
which they write, that since the Infant
of <hi>Portugal</hi> was only the <hi>Kings Brother,</hi>
they give up the Treaty for the
Match: yet the <hi>Emperour</hi> insisted on
the Proposition that he had made: so
there is another Original <hi>Letter,</hi> dated
the 20. of <hi>April</hi> thereafter, in which
they desire to hear all the particulars
that related to the <hi>Infant</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
and in that they write, That <hi>as for the
Lady</hi> Mary<hi>'s Mass, they had formerly
connived at it, but now stricter Laws
were made: they had connived so long, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that at last she would be prevailed
upon: but that a diversity of Rites in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion was not tolerable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would grant her no Licence, yet
they would connive at her a little longer:
but She abused the young Kings Goodness,
for she kept as it were open Church both
for her Servants and Neighbours.</hi> They
therefore conclude, <hi>wishing that the
Emperour would give her good Advice
in this matter.</hi> This <hi>Letter</hi> of which I
had the <hi>Original</hi> long in my hands, is
signed by <hi>ten Privy Councellours,</hi> and
will be I suppose a little better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53298:50"/>
than the quotation that Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> sets on his Margin of <hi>Vargas</hi>'s
<hi>Negotiation;</hi> and all this was transfacted
after the Duke of <hi>Somersets</hi> Disgrace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LI. He tells us a long story</hi> of the
methods that the <hi>Admiral</hi> used
to compass the Marriage of the
<hi>Queen Dowager:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 122.</note> and the
ways he took to engage his Brother <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset,</hi>
to consent to it. <hi>Somerset</hi> moved
it to the King, who consented to it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
so that the Marriage was made
up in hast, and without any solemnity.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> knows this matter, as he
does other things, notwithstanding
the shew he makes, by citing on the
Margin the <hi>Relation of that Intrigue,</hi>
which is another of his Impostures;
for by the Articles that were objected
to the <hi>Admiral,</hi> which are in print,
and of which the <hi>Original</hi> is yet extant
in the <hi>Council Book,</hi> it appears that
the <hi>Admiral</hi> had first courted the
Kings Sister <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> and that failing
in this design, he afterwards married
the <hi>Queen Dowager</hi> so secretly, that
none knew of it, and so indecently,
that if she had become with Child, soon
after the marriage, there would have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53298:50"/>
been a great doubt whether the Child
should have been accounted K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s
or <hi>His:</hi> that he kept the Marriage long
secret, &amp; he prevailed with the <hi>King</hi> to
write to the <hi>Q. Dowager,</hi> and with his
<hi>Brother</hi> to speak to her in his Favour:
and when all this was done, then the
Marriage was declared. So that all his
Fictions of <hi>Somerset</hi>'s design of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
his <hi>Daughter</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and
of the Remonstrances that the <hi>Admiral</hi>
made to his <hi>Brother,</hi> as well as his Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are manifestly false.</p>
            <p>LII. He sets out the common story
of the <hi>Dutchess</hi> of <hi>Somerset's</hi>
Disputing the Place with the
Q. <hi>Dowager:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 125.</note> and as if it had
been a great Affair, he spends two
Pages arguing both their Pretensions.
He reckons up the Duke of <hi>Somersets</hi>
Dignities, <hi>1. He was the Kings Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
2. He was Regent of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
3. He was Protector of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Nation, a dignity inferiour to none
of the other, which was not much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the Dictatorship among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
Romans: <hi>and on the other hand,
the</hi> Admiral <hi>was the second Office of
the Crown, and a Charge for Life.</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:53298:51"/>
So that here was as he thought a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
fit to be copied out by those who
would treat of Precedence. But 1.
I have shewed fully, that all this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
of Precedence among the <hi>Ladies</hi>
seems a Fiction; for it is not mentioned
in all that time. 2. The Offices of
state in <hi>England,</hi> do not communicate
any Honour to the Wife: So that the
<hi>Queen Dowager</hi> had either still her
rank of <hi>Queen Dowager,</hi> or she was
only a <hi>Baroness,</hi> her Husband the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral</hi>
being only a <hi>Baron.</hi> As the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess
of <hi>Somerset</hi> had only the rank of
a <hi>Dutchess.</hi> 3. It is clear that the Q.
<hi>Dowager</hi> retained her rank, and was
mentioned in all the publick Prayers,
even before the <hi>Kings Sister.</hi> 4. All
those three places that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
gives <hi>Somerset,</hi> were but one single
Office, and held by one single Patent;
for to be <hi>Protector</hi> and <hi>Regent</hi> is the
same thing in <hi>England.</hi> His comparing
the Protectors Dignity to that of the
<hi>Roman Dictators,</hi> is another stroke of
his ill-will to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi>
for among the <hi>Romans</hi> all other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
ceased, when there was a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator:</hi>
so if this were in the <hi>English
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53298:51"/>
Law,</hi> here were a short way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning
our <hi>Kings.</hi> 5. The <hi>Admiral</hi>
is far from being the second Office of
the Crown; for it only has the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of all those that are of the same
rank; so that the <hi>Admiral</hi> was only in
rank the first <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> and
tho the great Navyes that have been
built since that time, have made it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the first Office, as to the real value
of it, yet it was but an ordinary ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
when there were no <hi>Royal Fleets.</hi>
6. The <hi>Admiral's</hi> charge is forfeitable
as well as any other in <hi>England,</hi> and of
this a remarkable Instance appeared in
the year 1673. 7. The true occasion
of the Quarrel between the <hi>Brothers,</hi>
was, that tho the <hi>Protector</hi> was <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
of the <hi>King</hi>'s person, yet these
two trusts had been sometimes divided:
so the <hi>Admiral</hi> pretended to be made
the Governour of the <hi>King</hi>'s person,
and this gave his <hi>Brother</hi> just cause of
Jealousy. He had engaged all that
were about the <hi>King</hi> in his Interests,
and had once got the young <hi>King</hi> to
write a <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
it to them. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector</hi>
was twice willing to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53298:52"/>
to him, after great Quarrellings;
but his Ambition was incurable. Now
since all this Process and the Articles
against the <hi>Admiral</hi> are printed from
the Original Records, it is like Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> to falsify this matter as he
does.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LIII. He tells a long Story,</hi> of a
Sermon of <hi>Latimers,</hi> in which
he named the <hi>Admiral</hi> as
one that disturbed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency:
and this was done by <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set's</hi>
direction;<note place="margin">P. 129.</note> yet he seemed offended
when it was told him; and sent for
<hi>Latimer,</hi> and ordered him to retract
that which he had said concerning his
<hi>Brother.</hi> But <hi>Latimer</hi> reply'd boldly,
that he knew the <hi>Admiral</hi> had layd a
design against the Kings Life, which he
thought himself bound to discover: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> ordered
the Iudges to take his deposition; yet he
threatned to proceed against him with
the utmost severity, if he were found to
be a false Accuser <hi>Latimer</hi> had his
Witnesses laid, and the Conspiracy was
proved, upon which <hi>Somerset</hi> seemed to
be very much troubled; yet he said, he
must prefer the <hi>King's</hi> safety to all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53298:52"/>
whatsoever: so he signed a
Warrant for his Brothers Imprisonment,
his process upon that was made, and he
was found guilty of High Treason, and
condemned to be quartered, which was
accordingly executed the 20. of March,
1549.</p>
            <p>I do not know how it comes that
in such a series of Falsehoods, our
Author has hit the date right: but it is
the only circumstance of this whole
Recital that is true. For 1. It is true
<hi>Latimer</hi> in a Sermon at Court refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
on the <hi>Atheism</hi> of some about
the <hi>King,</hi> described the <hi>Admiral,</hi> who
was a man that laughed at Religion:
but this had nothing to do with the
<hi>State,</hi> and nothing followed upon it.
2. The <hi>Admiral</hi> had broke out the
former year, and thought to have
made a Rent in the <hi>Parliament:</hi> yet
that had been made up, and <hi>Somerset</hi>
had made him a very considerable grant
out of the Lands of the Crown; but
he laid his design next year deeper, he
bought Magasins of Arms, and listed
many men: he intended to have carried
away the <hi>King,</hi> and had ordered much
False Money to be coined: so that all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53298:53"/>
this being discovered, he was clapt in
the Tower: yet a moneth past before
the matters against him were brought
in to the <hi>Parliament:</hi> and during that
time, <hi>Somerset</hi> tryed, if it was possible
to bring him to a better mind, but all
was in vain. 3. He was not tryed by a
Common Court of <hi>Peers,</hi> but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> 4.
There was not a word said in the whole
Process, of any Design on the Kings
Life: on the contrary, he had gained
so much upon the young <hi>King,</hi> that
this gave the greatest jealousy of all.
5. He was not quartered, but only
beheaded: for the Original warrant
for his Execution is yet extant in the
Books of <hi>Council,</hi> signed by all the
Privy Councellours, that mentions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
<hi>that he should be beheaded, and
that his Head and Body should be buried
in the Tower.</hi> And now is not Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
a very Credible Author?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LIV. Our Author sets down</hi> the
Agony, into which the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's</hi>
Death threw his Wife,
and after he had turned this
as Romantically as he could,<note place="margin">P. 131.</note> he makes
her to dye, so soon after her Husband,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53298:53"/>
that She was buried at the same time
with him.</p>
            <p>But if Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had seen the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
upon which the <hi>Admiral</hi> was
condemned, he would have found that
the <hi>Queen Dowager</hi> was dead long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
(for she died in the <hi>September</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding,
and as was suspected of <hi>poison</hi>)
and that after her death, he had renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his pretensions to the <hi>Kings</hi> second
Sister, <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> which is reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his Crimes, as it was certainly a
very great one: and is it not now a great
pity to see so tender a stroke in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>
spoiled?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LV. Mr.</hi> Varillas <hi>tells us a long sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s
Designs to dismount <hi>Somerset:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 133.</note>
for doing which the two occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that presented themselves were,
First, the taking of several Forts in the
<hi>Bolognese,</hi> and that as the <hi>English</hi> had
often failed in observing the Law of
Nations, so the <hi>French</hi> treated them in
the same manner, and put all that they
took Prisoners, to the edge of the
Sword: that the <hi>English</hi> Souldiers who
came over, complained that the Forts
that were lost, could not be longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sended
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53298:54"/>
for want of Provisions; that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>Warwick</hi> advised some Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
to demand the calling of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
and perswaded <hi>Somerset</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to agree to it. The other was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Insurrection that was among the
Commons of <hi>England</hi> against the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility:
upon which <hi>Warwick</hi> likewise
pressed <hi>Somerset</hi> to call a Parliament.
So the Members were all chosen by the
Earl of <hi>Warwicks</hi> Means. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
before them more Accusers and
Witnesses against the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi>
than was needful for destroying him:
upon which he was put in prison the
14. of <hi>October 1549.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How it comes that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has
thus given two Dates one after another
true, amidst so much falsehood, is
that which amases me. But the rest of
this Section is writ in his ordinary
strain. Yet before I open that, I will
take the liberty to set down a passage
relating to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seconds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
the <hi>Bolognese,</hi> which I have
found in an Original <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
writ to Sr. <hi>Philip Hobby,</hi> tho Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> will perhaps tell me upon it,
that I have done <hi>an irreparable Injury,</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:53298:54"/>
to the Memory of that <hi>King.</hi> In that
Letter, that bears date the seventh of
<hi>September, 1549.</hi> and is signed by the
Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> and seven other
Councellors, they write, <hi>That the</hi>
King <hi>of</hi> France <hi>had corrupted two, that
had the Charge of one of the Forts,
which was by that means lost, and this
occasioned the loss of the other Forts;
they were surprised with this Invasion:
for on the 20. of</hi> July <hi>last, the</hi> French
King had promised to their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
par la foy d'un Gentilhomme,
<hi>that he would not make War without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
warning first: and yet he having
heard of the Progress of the Insurrections
that were in the several parts of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<hi>broke his word four days after he
made it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That was indeed thought strange in
those dayes, but in our days it would
not appear extraordinary: since we have
seen promises publickly made, and
broken in the very time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which they
were made.</p>
            <p>But now to return to Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi>
1. He forgot to mention the Western
Rebellion, that hapned a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that rising of the Commons against
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53298:55"/>
the Gentry: tho this was not kindly
done of him, since it was by his Friends,
the <hi>Zealous Catholicks,</hi> who declared
openly, <hi>that the change made in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
was the reason of their rising.</hi>
2. There was no demand made of a
<hi>Parliament;</hi> nor was there any need of
calling or choosing one; for there was
one then on foot, running in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation.
3. Those Insurrections were
all quieted before there was any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
made to the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi>'s
Government. 4. He was not at all
questioned in <hi>Parliament;</hi> but in
<hi>Council;</hi> for the greatest part of the
<hi>Councellors</hi> went to <hi>London,</hi> and joyned
with the <hi>City</hi> to demand the <hi>King</hi> out
of his hands, whom he had carried to
<hi>Windsor:</hi> and he finding that he was
not able to stand against so strong a
party, submitted himself to them,
upon which he was not only turned
out of his <hi>Protectorship,</hi> but was also
sent to the <hi>Tower.</hi> And is not Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>
a fit person to undertake the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of <hi>History,</hi> who does not know
the most Publick and the most Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
transactions of those times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LVI. The next time that Mr.</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53298:55"/>
               <hi>returns to</hi> English
Affairs,<note place="margin">P. 298.</note> 
               <hi>he tells us,</hi> that
<hi>Dudley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
made head against the Duke of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi>
and threw him out of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
clapt him in prison, and cut off his
Head, according to form.</p>
            <p>Now I lookt over and over again to
see if there was an <hi>a linea</hi> here, because
there was an Interval of two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween:
for the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> came
again into a share in the Government,
with the rest, and was not beheaded
before <hi>Ianuary, 1552.</hi> above two year
after this. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had excused the
like Error in another place, by telling
me, that he had begun <hi>a linea.</hi> And so
by that, I should have known that
there was an Interval of two years: but
that being omitted here, I hope he
will forgive my taking notice of it.</p>
            <p>LVII. After this he gives a long <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation</hi>
between <hi>Dudley</hi> now
Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 300.</note> and
the Court of <hi>France:</hi> which
I must conclude to be all a Fiction;
for I never saw the least mark of any
thing like it, in all the Papers of that
time. There is in this a lovely dash of a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53298:56"/>
Pen in the character of Mr. <hi>de Novail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
which no doubt Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
hopes will draw him some Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
from his Heirs. It is the greatest
that can possibly be given, but it is
certain, that it is as true as the other
things that our Author gives out so
liberally: he says, <hi>that his foresight
went so far,<note place="margin">P. 301.</note> that the first
advance that those who treated
with him made, was sufficient to make
him discover that which lay hid in their
Intentions what care soever they took to
disguise them.</hi> But I allow him to go
on in such excessive praises, only I wish
he were a little less excessive, in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, that I will not name.</p>
            <p>LVIII. He pretends here, <hi>That both
King</hi> Edward<hi>'s Sisters,</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabeth,
<hi>as well as</hi> Mary,<note place="margin">P. 302.</note> 
               <hi>made
open Profession of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion.</hi> The contrary to this is so
well known, that tho it was often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> that she
had dissembled her <hi>Religion</hi> in her
Sister Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much as once objected to her,
that she had professed <hi>Popery</hi> in King
<hi>Edward's</hi> time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:53298:56"/>
LIX. After a series of things that
are equally true and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
he tells us,<note place="margin">P. 310.</note> 
               <hi>that when
the D. of</hi> Northumberland
<hi>got the Marriage of</hi> Jean Grey <hi>for his
Son</hi> Guilford; <hi>her two Sisters were
married to the Earles of</hi> Pembrok <hi>and</hi>
Huntington.</p>
            <p>But I have warned him not to medle
with Genealogies: yet nothing will
prevail upon him. The Duke of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland</hi>
married his second Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> his eldest
having married to <hi>Sidney,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Leicester</hi>'s Ancestor, in whose Arms
King <hi>Edward</hi> dyed. Lady <hi>Iean Gray</hi>'s
second Sister was indeed marryed to
the Earl of <hi>Pembrok</hi>'s eldest Son, and
her third Sister that was crooked, was
married to one <hi>Keyes,</hi> an ordinary
Gentleman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LX. He says,</hi> upon this nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
for the Duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
to do,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but to forge a Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for King <hi>Edward,</hi> by which
both his <hi>Sisters</hi> and the <hi>Queen of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were excluded from the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
his <hi>Sisters</hi> as being both Bastards;
and the <hi>Queen of Scotland</hi> because born
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53298:57"/>
out of the Kingdom: so that the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
came to the Dutchess of <hi>Suffolk's</hi>
Daughters.</p>
            <p>All this with all the other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
mentioned by Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> which
are too many to be set down, are all
false. In the Declaration that King
<hi>Edward</hi> made, there is no special ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of his <hi>Sisters,</hi> or of the <hi>Queen</hi>
of <hi>Scots,</hi> tho they are in effect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
the <hi>Daughters</hi> of <hi>Suffolk</hi> being
declared the next Heirs. 2. This was
not done by a <hi>Testament,</hi> but by a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>
made in <hi>Council,</hi> all writ with
the <hi>King's own Hand;</hi> upon which an
<hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Council</hi> was also signed by all
the Board: and then <hi>Letters Patents</hi>
were passed under the Seal conform
to it. 3. There was no possibility of
Forgery here, for it was done too so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
to admit of that: and here I
will publish the discovery that I have
made in that matter, since I writ my
<hi>History.</hi> The <hi>Original Paper</hi> all writ
with K. <hi>Edward's own Hand,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
<hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Council,</hi> signed by all the
<hi>Council,</hi> have come into my Hands:
and as I kept them long enough by
me, to shew them to many persons, so
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53298:57"/>
I have thought fit to publish them
here, as Papers that are extremely
curious: and I would gladly do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that may be a better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Reader, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
discovery of a series of Errors,
which come so thick one upon another,
that there is not any one part sound.</p>

By these Evidences it will appear
that what Faults soever may be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on the Memory of the Duke of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> this of forging King
<hi>Edward's Testament</hi> is none of them.</p>
            <p>LXI. He says, <hi>the D. of</hi> Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland
<hi>obliged all</hi> Mary <hi>and</hi>
Elisabeth<hi>'s Friends to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 312.</note> 
               <hi>and made them be
kept as close Prisoners in</hi> Hunsden-Castle,
<hi>as if they had been Criminals.</hi>
But these two <hi>Sisters</hi> were never so
good Friends as to live together.
2. They were both so free with their
Families, that Princess <hi>Mary</hi> was on
her way to see King <hi>Edward,</hi> and on
the road she met the news of his
<hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LXII. He says, <hi>It was five moneths
past from the time of</hi> North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland<hi>'s
Son's marrying L.</hi>
Jean Gray,<note place="margin">P. 313.</note> 
               <hi>when K.</hi> Edward
<hi>died on the sixth of Iuly.</hi> There was
but five weeks past, for they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> but on
what day of <hi>Iune</hi> it is not certain, for
ought I know.</p>
            <p>LXIII. He tells us, <hi>that</hi> Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland
<hi>concealed King</hi> Edwards <hi>death
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53298:61"/>
as long as he could: and that
some days after that,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 314.</note> Jean
Gray <hi>made a magnificent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
thro</hi> London, <hi>and then came on the
War with Queen</hi> Mary. But this whole
business lasted only nine dayes; from
whence it is thought that the English
Proverb of a <hi>Nine days wonder,</hi> took
its beginning. So he ought to manage
this time a little better: Indeed this
Phantasm of Lady <hi>Iean Gray,</hi> as it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared
soon, so it never had force
enough to pretend to any Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
two dayes after King <hi>Edward's</hi>

was a vertuous and sincere man: if
was a <hi>Catholick,</hi> he was a very bad on
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53298:63"/>
for his Family to this day feels what a
great Estate he made out of the <hi>Abbey
Lands.</hi> 3. He continued stile with
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> and was one of those
who signed the Letter to Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
in the pretended <hi>Q. Iean's</hi> Name,
ordering her to lay down her preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
4. He was removed from his
Office of <hi>Secretary,</hi> as soon as Q. <hi>Mary</hi>
came to the Crown: and here I lose
sight of him, and do not know what
became of him afterwards, or when it
was that the <hi>Family</hi> was raised to the
dignity of being <hi>Peers</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
5. It was the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> that
sent Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the notice of her
<hi>Brothers Death,</hi> and of the design then
on foot against her; for she was then
within half a days journey of <hi>London</hi>
on her way, to see her <hi>Brother;</hi> and it
seems that <hi>Northumberland</hi> durst not
venture on so hardy a thing, as the sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
on <hi>her,</hi> but he intended to make
her come, as it were to see her <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and so to get her to throw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into his hands.</p>
            <p>LXVII. He says, Northumberland
<hi>had four things for him; King</hi>
Edward's Testament,<note place="margin">P. 320.</note> 
               <hi>the</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53298:64"/>
Treasure, <hi>the</hi> Army, <hi>and the</hi>
Fleet: <hi>but Queen</hi> Mary <hi>went to</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,
<hi>where She knew how much he
was hated for his having sold</hi> Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigne
<hi>to the French.</hi> But I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
shewed, that the Settlement of the
<hi>Crown</hi> was not done by <hi>Testament,</hi> but
by <hi>Letters Patents.</hi> And as at that time
there was no <hi>Fleet,</hi> nor standing <hi>Army</hi>
at all: so there was scarce any <hi>Money</hi>
in the Treasury. 2. The Duke of
<hi>Northumberland</hi> was indeed much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> but not for the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Bulloigne;</hi> but besides the general
Considerations, that had rendred him
odious to the whole Nation; he had
subbued the Insurrection of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
of the Commons against the Gentry,
and had been very severe in his Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Executions. 3. Q <hi>Mary</hi> did not
go to <hi>Norfolk:</hi> she went indeed very
near it, but she staied still in <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>LXVIII. Mr.</hi> Varillas <hi>tells us,</hi> that
the Earles of <hi>Derby, Essex</hi>
and <hi>Hastings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 321.</note> were not Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
in any respect, to those
who had married the Lady <hi>Jean Gray's</hi>
Sisters: so they declared for Q. Mary,
on two conditions, the one was, that She
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53298:64"/>
should never marry a Stranger: and the
other, that She should make no change in
matters of Religion; but tho Q. <hi>Mary</hi>
was absolutely resolved to observe neither
of these; yet since there are few Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of those who would lose a Crown
rather than not promise the things which
they neither can nor will observe, She
promised all that was asked of her; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which those three Earles being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that they had provided suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
for <hi>Calvinism;</hi> took the Field with
their Friends, and having assured all
people that they had received a full Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for the established Religion, they
quickly brought together an Army of
15000. men.</p>
            <p>Our Author is always unhappy,
when he comes to particulars: for 1.
the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> was a zealous <hi>Papist</hi>
and had protested in <hi>Parliament</hi> against
all the Changes that had been made.
2. He had no hand in the re-establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> for the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was done before there was any
occasion of raising the remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
3. There was no Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>
at this time: for that Title was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on none from <hi>Cromwels</hi> fall,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53298:65"/>
till the exaltation of Queen <hi>Elisabeth's</hi>
Favorite to it. 4. There was no Earl
of <hi>Hastings:</hi> the Earl of <hi>Huntingtons</hi>
Son carries the Title of Lord <hi>Hastings:</hi>
and our Author had bestowed on him
L. <hi>Iean Gray</hi>'s Sister. 5. The Earl of
<hi>Sussex</hi> was the person that did the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
service of all to the <hi>Queen,</hi> who
is not so much as named by Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las.</hi>
6. It was the People of <hi>Suffolk</hi>
and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> that asked those assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of the <hi>Queen</hi> in the matters of
<hi>Religion;</hi> but it does not appear that
any of the <hi>Nobility</hi> made any such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
7. Nor is there any mention
made of their asking any Assurances of
her, that she should not marry a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
8. The care, that our Author
uses here, in setting forth Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi>
Dissimulation, and her granting
of Promises, that she never intended
to observe, and the general Reflection
that upon that he makes on <hi>Crowned
Heads;</hi> looks as if he had a mind to
cover the Infamy of some late Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Promises and Oaths, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that this has been the way of
<hi>Crowned Heads</hi> at all times: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
this is to be a part of the <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:53298:65"/>
but since Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> had taxed
the <hi>zealous Catholicks</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as
<hi>Imprudent,</hi> for laying down Arms
upon King <hi>Henry</hi>'s word, why might
not he have put the same Censure here,
on those <hi>zealous Protestants,</hi> who took
up Arms upon Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> word;
since as he sets out the matter, they
had less reason to trust her, than the
other Rebels had to trust her Father?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LXIX. He tells us,</hi> that <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
marched against her
with some old Troops,<note place="margin">P. 322.</note> that he
had ready: fancying that She
was but 15000. strong; but he found She
was 30000. strong: two parts of three of
his Army refused to fight, and some went
over to the Queen with flying Colours:
so he was forced to return to <hi>London,</hi>
reckoning that he was still Master of the
City, and the Fleet: but at his return
he found the Gates shut upon him; and
that the City had declared against him,
whose Example was followed by the
Fleet. So seeing all was lost, he rendred
himself upon discretion, ten dayes after
he had crowned <hi>Jean</hi> of <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Section is as exactly writ as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53298:66"/>
the former; for 1. <hi>Northumberland</hi>
had no old Troops, and he marched
from <hi>London</hi> with 2000. Horse, and
6000. Foot, such as could be brought
together of the sudden. 2. <hi>Iean Gray</hi>
was never <hi>Crowned:</hi> she was only
proclaimed <hi>Queen. 3. Northumberland</hi>
never marched back to <hi>London,</hi> but
seeing the <hi>Queen's</hi> forces encrease, and
that none came in to him, he came
into <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and proclaimed Queen
<hi>Mary. 4.</hi> It was not so much the <hi>City</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> as the whole <hi>Privy Council</hi>
that declared for Queen <hi>Mary. 5.</hi> There
was no <hi>Fleet</hi> then to change sides: for
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> knowing nothing of the
past Age, and only hearing that at
present the <hi>English Fleet</hi> is the greatest
in the world, he has this ever in his
head, and fancies that it was so at all
times. 6. <hi>Nothumberland</hi> did not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself, but was apprehended as a
Criminal by the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> who
was sent to seise on him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LXX. He tells us,</hi> that <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland</hi>
was presently put in
Irons;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but he retained so great a
presence of Spirit, when he came
to be examined before the Council, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53298:66"/>
Mr. Varillas <hi>thought fit to set this out
with all the Pomp that his Sublime
could furnish: he puts Harangues in his
mouth, by which he confounded the
Privy Councillours, among whom he
names</hi> the Earl of Chieresberi: but his
crimes being so notorious, he with his four
Sons were condemned to dye as Traitors.
The Queen pardoned three, but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable
to the fourth: and when <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland</hi>
saw there was no hope of
life, he declared that he had been only
a <hi>Calvinist</hi> out of Interest; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
a great detestation of that Religion,
and of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Preachers of it: and suffered
with a constancy that was admired by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
that saw it: those who suffered with him
imitating his conversion; this had a great
effect on peoples spirits.</p>
            <p>1. Men of the Duke of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
quality, are never put in <hi>Irons</hi>
in <hi>England. 2.</hi> He shewed so little
courage, that he threw himself at the
Earl of <hi>Arundel's</hi> feet abjectly to
beg his <hi>Favour. 3.</hi> Our Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
his being brought to his Tryal,
before a Lord <hi>Steward,</hi> and the <hi>Peers</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> with an Examination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Council:</hi> and his making the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53298:67"/>
Council condemn him, shews that he
does not know the commonest points
of form in the Government of <hi>England.</hi>
4. All this Constancy and arguing that
he puts in <hi>Northumberlands</hi> mouth, is
taken from two points in <hi>Law</hi> that he
proposed to the <hi>Peers,</hi> that were his
Judges: The one was, <hi>whether a man
acting by Order of Council, and by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
under the Great Seal, could be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a Criminal:</hi> the other was, <hi>whether
one that had acted so, could be judged
by Peers, that had given him those Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and that were as guilty as himself.</hi>
5. Tho these were points in Law that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have some colour in them, yet
they were far from confounding any:
for a <hi>Council</hi> or a <hi>Great Seal</hi> flowing
from an <hi>Vsurper,</hi> is nothing: so this
Authority could not justify him: and
as for those who were as guilty as
himself, and yet were now his <hi>Iudges;</hi>
they were not convicted of the guilt:
and no <hi>Peer</hi> can be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide in a Tryal,
upon general surmises, how true soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they may be. 6. I confess it was
some time, before I could find out
who this Earl of <hi>Chieresberi</hi> was. At
last I saw it must be <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> who
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53298:67"/>
should have been a little better known
to Mr. <hi>Varillus:</hi> unless he has read the
<hi>French</hi> Story as carelesly as he has done
the <hi>English;</hi> for the Illustrious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
of that Family left such marks
of their valour behind them in <hi>France,</hi>
that one should think that <hi>Talbot,</hi> Earl
of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> should be the Family of
all <hi>England,</hi> in which a <hi>French Writer</hi>
should be the least apt to mistake. And
this confirms me in my opinion, that
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> has never read History.
7. There were none of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
Sons</hi> tryed at that time, but his
eldest Son the Earl of <hi>Warwick:</hi> for
he had been called by writ to the House
of <hi>Lords,</hi> and so was to be tried as a
<hi>Peer:</hi> but the rest were Commoners;
and were tryed some moneths after
this. 8. He makes Queen <hi>Mary</hi> less
merciful than she was: for it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
she would have pardoned both
<hi>Iean</hi> of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and her <hi>Husband;</hi> if
upon the <hi>Rebellion</hi> that was raised six
moneths after this, it had not been
then thought necessary to take to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
Councils. 9. It was believed at
that time, that <hi>Northumberland</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himself a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53298:68"/>
hope to save his life by the means. 10.
His constancy was not very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
for there passed some severe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulations
between Sr. <hi>Iohn Gates</hi>
and him: who as they had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
in the Rebellion, so now being
brought to suffer together, they died
reproaching one another. 11. It does
not appear, that any other of those who
suffered, changed their Religion:
Nor 12. Is it likely that such a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of men, who were so odious to
the Nation, and who in the making of
it, did likewise shew that they had made
a small account of Religion, could have
any great effect on those who saw it.</p>
            <p>LXXI. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> will never give
over his bold Quotations; for
here he tells us,<note place="margin">P. 328.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> Charles
<hi>the fifth advised Queen</hi> Mary,
<hi>not to proceed so hastily in the change of
Religion; and that he believed She would
find before, long, that it would not be
safe to her, to break her promise.</hi> And to
confirm this, he cites on the margin,
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifths Letters to <hi>Q.</hi> Mary. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>This would make one that does not
know the man, fancy that there was
some Register or Collection of those
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53298:68"/>
Letters, which he had seen; I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
seen those Letters; for the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals
of them are extant; and I shewed
them once to the <hi>Spanish Ambassadour</hi>
at <hi>London, Don Pedro de Ronquillas,</hi>
who did me the honour to desire me to
accompany him to the <hi>Cotton Library,</hi>
where I not only shewed him these
<hi>Letters,</hi> but as many of the other <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Papers,</hi> out of which I had drawn
my <hi>History,</hi> as could be examined at
one time: but for <hi>Charles</hi> the fifths
<hi>Letters,</hi> they are so little legible, and
the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s hand is so little
better than his, that I could not copy
them out, nor print them: some little
hints I took from them, but that was
all. 2. It seems Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> was not
much concerned in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s
breaking her word; for in those <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
that he makes up for <hi>Charles,</hi> all
that he makes him set before her, is the
<hi>danger</hi> of it, and that she could not do
it long safe <hi>(Impunement)</hi> if she had a
vast Army in any strong places, a great
Fleet, and a huge Revenue, then the
breaking of her word would have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> so little, that it
would not have hindred him from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53298:69"/>
her <hi>Panegyrick:</hi> tho the violation
of her Faith was so much the more
scandalous, that those to whom she
gave it, had setled her upon her Throne;
and perhaps he will find somewhat
parallel to this, to put in his <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>LXXII. He goes on with his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and tells us,</hi> that Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> writ back to the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
a more Heroical Answer
than can be found among all the Letters
of the Crowned Heads of the last Age:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
She told him what Wonders of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
She had hitherto met with, and
that therefore She was more bound than
any other not to be unthankful: <hi>and to
conclude with a soft period, She said,</hi>
She would be guilty of as many Crimes
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s She lived minutes without acquiting
her self of her duty. <hi>These effects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
on those words:</hi> She repealed
by Authentical Acts, all that had been
done by her Father or her Brother, to the
prejudice of the <hi>Catholick Religion:</hi>
and tho She had reason to fear the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
of some, who having lived long
without Religion, would not willingly
receive again that yoke which they had
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53298:69"/>
thrown off, yet She reduced them all
with more haughtiness, than the most
esteemed and the most absolute Prince
that ever reigned in <hi>England:</hi> She dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
the Armed Companies that were
about her; She renounced the title of
<hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and
re-established the Exercise of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion</hi> every where. And it is to
be considered, that all this was done in
the year 1553. and before <hi>Haviets</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> would make his <hi>Reader</hi>
believe, that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine</hi>
indeed; and he carries the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
as high as he can, that so when
he comes to write his <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> all
the Praises he has bestowed on her,
may give so much the more lustre to
his <hi>Monarch,</hi> who after all is to be
preferred to her: for tho she excelled all
the Crowned Heads of the last Age,
yet she must come humbly &amp; lay down
all her Glory to enrich the <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rik</hi>
of one of the Princes of the present.
2. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> would make us believe,
that he saw both her Letters, and the
Letters of all the other crowned Heads
of the last Age; &amp; I believe both is alike
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53298:70"/>
true. 3. Those soft and melting Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods
that he gives us out of her Letter,
have a sort of an affected Eloquence
in them, that may pass from a man like
Mr. <hi>Varillas;</hi> but they have not that
native Beauty and Greatness, that is
the stile of those that are <hi>born to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>
4. If our Author had examined
<hi>Queen Mary's Letters,</hi> he would have
found some of them of a far different
strain: he would have found her <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
King</hi> Henry's <hi>Supremacy; renounce
the</hi> Popes <hi>Authority; confess that her
Mothers Marriage was by the Law of
God and Man incestuous, and unlawful:</hi>
he would have found her <hi>express her
Sorrow for her former Stubbornness, and
Disobedience to her Father's most just
and vertuous Laws; and put her Soul in
his hands; vowing never to vary from
his Orders; and that her Conscience
should be always directed by him:</hi> and
when her opinion was asked of <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>Relicks,</hi> he
would have found her declare, <hi>that
in all these things She had no opinion at
all, but such as She should receive from
the</hi> King; <hi>who had her whole Heart in
his keeping, and might imprint upon it,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53298:70"/>
in these and all other matters, whatever
his inestimable Vertue, high Wisdom, and
excellent Learning should think conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for her.</hi> These were her strains,
while she was yet a Subject, and under
the yoke of a Father: and of these the
Originals are yet extant. 4. All the
change that she made the first year of
her Reign, was to abolish what her
<hi>Brother</hi> had done, and to bring things
back to the state in which her <hi>Father</hi>
had left them: upon which Cardinal
<hi>Pool</hi> writ her a Letter full of severe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulations;
for he said, <hi>this was to
establish Schism by a Law. 5.</hi> Our
Autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> represents all these changes as
made of the sudden, before she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
the people that came up with
her to <hi>London,</hi> and as if she had done
all by her own Authority, whereas it
was the work of three <hi>Parliaments</hi> one
after another. 6. The <hi>Queen</hi> kept still
her Title of <hi>Supream Head of the
Church,</hi> above a year after this, and in
two <hi>Parliaments</hi> that she called, she
carried that among her other Titles,
and in the vertue of it turned out <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
and licensed <hi>Preachers,</hi> besides a
great many other exercises of her <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy:</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:53298:71"/>
so far was she from laying it
aside at first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LXXIII. Mr.</hi> Varillas, <hi>after he had
diversified his</hi> Romance <hi>with
the intermixture of other
Affairs,<note place="margin">P. 352.</note> returns back to</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<hi>and lets us see</hi> how little the
<hi>Queen</hi> was inclined to keep the Promises
that She had made her Subjects: for the
day after her Coronation, it appeared to
the Curious, that She had made some
Infractions in her Promises touching <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
tho She had not yet been tempted
to break the other. She ballanced indeed
whether She should marry one of her own
Subjects or not. Card. <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> were the
only two that were left of the Blood
Royal. <hi>Pool</hi> had many great Qualities,
<hi>which are set out as Romances paint
their Hero's,</hi> as well as <hi>Courtney</hi>'s: who
was descended by his Mother from the
House of <hi>York:</hi> He was beautiful, had
a good meen, and was so well bred, that
at two and twenty, he was the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
Cavalier of <hi>Great Brittain.</hi>
He spake the Chief Languages of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
and was very learned. His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had been Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Friend, that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53298:71"/>
never left her day nor night: and some
have said, that the Queen once promised
to her, that She would marry her Son. <hi>But
he adds,</hi> That the <hi>Queen</hi> had owned
her Design for <hi>Pool</hi> to <hi>Commendon:</hi> yet
after all, <hi>Pool</hi> was near sixty, and
<hi>Courtney</hi> was very loose: so this disposed
her to the match with the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Spain,</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who had
projected the Conquest of <hi>France,</hi> desired
extreamly, in order to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing
of that design.<note place="margin">P. 361.</note> 
               <hi>A
little after this, he tells us,</hi> that
both <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Courtney</hi> were equally
near the Crown: <hi>Pool</hi> was the Grand-child
of a Sister of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sevenths,
and so he was of the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
but <hi>Courtney</hi> was the Grand-child of
<hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth.</p>
            <p>And now here are as any faults as
could be well laid together in so few
words: 1. The <hi>Queen</hi> was not Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
till the tenth of <hi>October,</hi> and
long before that time not only the <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi>
but men as ignorant as Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas,</hi>
saw how little regard she had to
her Promise for preserving the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
Religion: most of the <hi>Bishops</hi>
were by that time clapt up in the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53298:72"/>
               <hi>Tower,</hi> all preaching was prohibited,
except by those who had the <hi>Queen's</hi>
Licences; and such as came to put her
in mind of her Promises, were punished
as Insolent Persons. 2. He says, she
had not been yet tempted in the point
of Marrying a Stranger: yet in his
<hi>Preface</hi> he had set her forth as enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<hi>Commendon,</hi> with her design for
marrying the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and he
left her in <hi>August.</hi> 3. There were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others of the Royal Family, and
in the same degree with Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi>
whose Posterities are yet remaining:
these were the Earl of <hi>Huntington's</hi>
Family, and that of the <hi>Baringtones</hi> in
<hi>Essex.</hi> 4. Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> who died five
year after this, was but 59. when he
died. 5. <hi>Courtney's</hi> Mother was not of
the House of <hi>York,</hi> but his Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's
Daughter. A Mother for a Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is as great a fault as a Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a Great-grandmother, with
which he reproaches me so severely in
his Answer to my <hi>Reflections. 6. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
was so far from having any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of breeding, that he had been
kept a Prisoner thirteen years in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53298:72"/>
               <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> ever since his Father
was attainted. 7. His Mother was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all that while a Prisoner, and so
had not those opportunities of being
with the <hi>Queen.</hi> 8. Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> was
of the House of <hi>York,</hi> his Mother being
Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi>
that was <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourths Brother.
9. <hi>Courtney</hi> was so far from being
vicious and lewd, that he was rather
too sullen, which was imputed to his
Imprisonment in his youth, that had
made him Melancholy and studious.
10. The pretence of a promise that
<hi>Queen Mary</hi> gave to <hi>Courtney's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
to marry her Son, is by all other
Authors put upon Cardinal <hi>Pool:</hi> but I
believe both are alike true. 11. <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
was not Grand-child, but Great-grandchild
to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth.
12. It was believed at that time, that
the <hi>Queen</hi> had really such Inclinations
to <hi>Courtney,</hi> that if he had not by a
strange coldness neglected her, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
himself more to her Sister <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabeth,</hi>
she would have married him:
and that her hatred of her Sister, was
encreased when she saw to which of
the two <hi>Courtney</hi> gave the Preference.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53298:73"/>
13. The <hi>Queen</hi> had only insinuated to
<hi>Commendon</hi> her inclinations for Card<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Pool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>LXXIV. Mr.</hi> Varillas <hi>tells us of
one</hi> Sr. <hi>Thomas Haviet,</hi> a
zealous Calvinist,<note place="margin">P. 359.</note> one of a
great Family, and highly
esteemed, both by the Nobility and the
People <hi>(which he sets out in his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantical
way very elegantly as he
thinks, no doubt) and in a word,</hi> one
that had all the Qualities necessary for
the Head of a Party, except that of
being of the Blood Royal. This <hi>Haviet</hi>
then resolved to hinder the Match with
<hi>Spain,</hi> and in order to the doing of it,
he found it necessary to set up the Princess
<hi>Elisabeth:</hi> and <hi>Courtney</hi> being set on
by Rage and Iealousy, since he saw the
Queen disappointed him, and was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for the <hi>Spanish</hi> Match, joined like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
into <hi>Haviets</hi> Conspiracy.</p>
            <p>Most men besides our Author know
the names of those of whom they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to write; but who would
think that this <hi>Haviet,</hi> that has so
large a part of this story assigned him,
was no other then Sr. <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi>
that as is pretended, owned that he had
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53298:73"/>
corrupted <hi>Anne Bullen:</hi> and yet now he
is made a Rebel to advance the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who certainly could never forgive
so publick an injury as he had done her
Mother, if our Author's former Story
of him is true. Perhaps Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
perceived this: and therefore resolved
to give him here a new Name; for
tho all the printed Histories make him
Sr. <hi>Thomas Wiat;</hi> yet he will make
him <hi>Haviet,</hi> tho this name is not so
much as known in <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viet</hi>
may pass for <hi>Wiat</hi> as well
<hi>as Millethon</hi> for <hi>Maidston,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 362.</note>
and <hi>Camdavart</hi> for <hi>Southwark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 366.</note>
and <hi>Quincethon</hi> for <hi>Kingston.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 367.</note>
It is true, there is some sort
of affinity between <hi>Millethon</hi> and
<hi>Maidston;</hi> for they begin and end with
a Letter; and even that is much for
Mr. <hi>Varillas. Quincethon</hi> and <hi>Kingston</hi>
are more remote, yet an ill pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,
might make a man mistake the
one for the other; for I have often
taken notice of this, that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
has heard a great deal, but has read
very little History: yet how <hi>Camda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vart</hi>
could pass for <hi>Southwark,</hi> is that
which I cannot comprehend: and as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53298:74"/>
little how <hi>Haviet</hi> was put for <hi>Wiat,</hi> if
this last was not an Artifice of Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas</hi>'s.
But instead of following Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> thro all his Impertinences, I
fancy it will please my Reader better,
if I mention some particulars of that
business, which I drew from a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the matter writ by Sr. <hi>Thomas
Wiat's</hi> own Son, of which I give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in my <hi>Reply</hi> to Mr. <hi>Varillas.</hi>
               <q>Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi> tho the Duke of
<hi>Northumberland's</hi> Kinsman, would
not join with him in the business of
L. <hi>Iean Gray:</hi> but proclaimed Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Maidston,</hi> before he knew
that any others had done it: yet he
did not run to her for thanks, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others did: but she was so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of this service, that she sent the
Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> with her thanks to
him, to which he appealed in his
Trial. But he quickly saw how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were like to go, so he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a pass to go beyond Sea:
which he had put in Execution, if
his Wife's being big with Child, had
not stayed him till she was brought
to bed. He had observed so much of
the temper of the <hi>Spanish Ministers,</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:53298:74"/>
when he was Ambassador in <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifths Court, that his love to his
Countrey made him extream appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of the Misery of the Nation,
if it should fall under that yoke. He
never so much as pretended that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
was his motive: and <hi>Papists</hi> as
well as <hi>Protestants</hi> joined with him:
and if he had designed any mischief to
the <hi>Queen,</hi> it was in his power to
have executed it; for when he passed
by <hi>Charingcross, Whitehal</hi> was ill
defended: and many of the Earl of
<hi>Pembrokes</hi> men came over to him: but
he marcht on to the City of <hi>London,</hi>
having no other intentions but to
concur with them in opposing the
Match: and the <hi>Queen</hi> her self was so
fully assured that he designed no hurt
to her, that she was resolved to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him, if a Message had not come
from <hi>Brussels,</hi> upon which his Head
was cut off. He never accused the
<hi>Queen's Sister,</hi> tho he was once so
entangled by Questions, that were
put to him, that he answered some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that reflected on the Earl of
<hi>Devonshire,</hi> for which he afterwards
beg'd his pardon: and to shew that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53298:75"/>
he had alwayes vindicated Queen
<hi>Elisabeth,</hi> he not only did it in very
plain words on the Scaffold, but
said likewise, <hi>that she was not privy
to his Matters, as he had delivered in
his Declaration made before the Privy
Council.</hi>
               </q> This account of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as it supplys some defects that are
in my <hi>History,</hi> so it shews that Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
had told both the name of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the History it self, alike true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LXXV. He tells us,</hi> that this
<hi>Haviet</hi> having made himself
sure of the town of <hi>Millethon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 362.</note>
put off the Mask: and came up
to <hi>Rochester,</hi> at the head of 1200. Horse
and 8000. Foot: and was received into
it the 22. of Ianuary, 1554. He intended
to go on in great marches to <hi>London,</hi> but
all this did not disorder the <hi>Queen,</hi> who
put the Troops that She had about her,
under the Command of the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> and of his Brother, that was
<hi>Admiral</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> and ordered them
to march in the very minute in which
She received the news of the Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
tho it was just at midnight on the
22. of Ianuary. The two Brothers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
but four of their Companies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53298:75"/>
and the rest being disheartned
by that, the Brothers found it convenient
to return back to <hi>London:</hi> where the
<hi>Queen</hi> left nothing undone, that was
necessary to animate or encrease her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
yet She fearing lest the Citizens of
<hi>London</hi> should open to <hi>Haviet</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
Port, sent some to treat with
him, and to assure him, that if the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Match displeased the <hi>English,</hi> She
would never think on it any more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
he asked such extravagant high terms,
that all treaty was broke off.</p>
            <p>But 1. this <hi>Haviet</hi> when he was
strongest, and advanced to Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas's
Camdavart,</hi> was but 4000. strong
in all: but Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> is generous, and
would bestow a good Army on him.
2. Those who have been in <hi>Maidston,</hi>
will not find it a great matter to be
sure of such a place. 3. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
comes pretty near<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the true Date here,
but yet does not hit it; for it was on
the 25. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and not on the 22.
that <hi>Wyat</hi> came to <hi>Rochester.</hi> 4. His
Ignorance of the Map of <hi>England</hi> must
be suteable to the rest of his learning;
since it is but a very short day's Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from <hi>Rochester</hi> to <hi>London:</hi> and even
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53298:76"/>
his <hi>hearsay,</hi> which next to <hi>Florimond</hi>
is his chief <hi>Garand,</hi> might have helped
him here: since this is the part of the
whole road of <hi>England,</hi> that is best
known to Strangers. 5. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all the expedition that he makes
the <hi>Queen</hi> use, some dayes past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
She sent out any Troops, and so
the Midnight March is spoiled, which
no doubt he thought a beautiful stroke,
and for which he has somewhat in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,
perhaps to enrich the <hi>Panegyrick.</hi>
6. The <hi>Queen</hi> had no Troops about
her, and all she could get together,
was two Troops of Horse, and six
Companys of Foot, with which the
City of <hi>London</hi> furnished her: so she
sent first a <hi>Herald</hi> to <hi>Rochester,</hi> to try
if <hi>Wiat</hi> (alias <hi>Haviet</hi>) could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
to return to his duty. 7. The
Duke of <hi>Norfolk's Brother</hi> was never
<hi>Admiral</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> nor did he go
along with him at this time. 8. The
<hi>Queen</hi> made no such abject Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to <hi>Wiat</hi> as he pretends; for she
only sent some to see what it was that
he demanded, and when he proposed
very high Terms, they gave over all
treaty with him: here the <hi>Heroine</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:53298:76"/>
sinks a little, perhaps this must be to
hide some feeble stroak that must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the <hi>Panegyrick.</hi> 9. The <hi>Queen</hi>
went indeed into <hi>London,</hi> and gave the
Citizens very tender Assurances of the
love she bare to her People, and that
she did nothing in the Treaty for the
<hi>Spanish Match,</hi> but by the Advice of
her whole <hi>Council;</hi> but she never said
that she would not think on it any
more. 10. For his <hi>Rochester Port</hi> to the
City of <hi>London,</hi> he will find it in the
same Map, in which the Suburb at the
end of the Bridg, on the other side of
the River, is called <hi>Camdavart:</hi> for
he has given us all these marks of it,
and perhaps he found it so in some of
those Manuscripts, that were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to him, under the confidences
of Friendship: and I dare answer for
him, that he will keep this Secret most
Religiously.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LXXVI. He goes on, and says,</hi>
that <hi>Haviet</hi> stopt a little; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to see what answer the
<hi>Queen</hi> would send to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions:<note place="margin">P. 365.</note>
or perhaps it was because his
Troops were weary with a long march:
in the mean while the <hi>Queen</hi> put mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in a most wonderful order: She sent
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53298:77"/>
away the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadours, who
were an Eye-sore to her People: She cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Nobility and chief Citizens about
her, and promised to them in a most pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical
Harangue, to call a <hi>Parliament,</hi>
and not to take a Husband but by its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
by this She prevailed so far that the
Citizens were contented to let all the
Locks of the City Gates be changed, and
to deliver the Keys to the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
which was the critical thing that
saved all; so small a matter serves to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
or to overturn Monarchies, where
Heresy has once got in. So the <hi>Queen</hi>
having by the efficacy of her Harangue,
gained many brave men to come to encrease
her Troops, She placed some on the
Banks of the River to hinder the Rebels,
who were now at <hi>Camdavart,</hi> from pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
and She drew up the rest at <hi>St.
James</hi>'s, which was the place where
probably they would endeavour to enter
the City: but <hi>Haviet</hi> finding the Bridg at
<hi>Camdavart</hi> was cut by the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
left his foot that were heavily
armed, and marched with his light Horse
to <hi>Quincethan,</hi> where he passed the
River, having defeated 500. men that the
<hi>Q.</hi> had sent thither to dispute the passage.</p>
            <p>Every tittle here is Fiction, and the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53298:77"/>
Fiction is very ill contrived. 1. <hi>Wiat</hi>
could expect no Answer from the
<hi>Queen</hi> to his extravagant Demands; for
those whom she had sent to him, broke
with him in very ill terms. 2. That
Treaty was at <hi>Deptford,</hi> and instead of
a long March from that to his <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davart,</hi>
it is but a short walk of an
hour or two at most. 3. The <hi>Spanish
Ambassadours</hi> were never sent away;
here again the <hi>Heroine</hi> sinks. 4. She
made no Promise to <hi>call a Parliament:</hi>
but said only, that she would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but by the advice of her <hi>Council.</hi>
5. It seems there is some Mystery in
this, that Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> makes the <hi>Queen</hi>
as ready at all times to make Promises,
as she was resolved to break them: now
since Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> writes History, not
as he finds it, but as he thinks fit to
dress it, there is some reason to believe,
that in his representing Queen <hi>Mary</hi> so
little <hi>a Slave to her Word,</hi> he had still
his <hi>Panegyrick</hi> in his Eye. 5. If one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
any had Pick-locks to his
House, the changing of Locks, and the
looking after the Keys, were a very
proper method; but this is I believe
the first time, that ever the security of a
great <hi>City</hi> was thought to turn upon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53298:78"/>
such a matter: and Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Monopoly of this Secret in
Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tification, since it is most certainly
his own Invention. 7. If Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>
is so ignorant as not to know that <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder</hi>
was in use at that time, yet
<hi>Hatchets</hi> and <hi>Hammers</hi> were always in
use, and these are good enough against
Gates and Locks. 8. The <hi>Queen's</hi>
Troops could not well stand over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his <hi>Camdavart,</hi> to hinder <hi>Haviets</hi>
passage; unless they stood to the midle
in water: for there is no <hi>Key</hi> there, the
Buildings being continued to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
side. 9. The <hi>Bridg</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was
not cut, but only defended. 10. <hi>Haviet</hi>
had no Foot heavily armed, but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Countrey People brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and he marched with them all.
11. As our Author describes S. <hi>Iames's,</hi>
it seems he fancies there is another
Bridg upon the <hi>Thames</hi> there: but since
<hi>Haviet</hi> had not Boats enough for pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
he could not cross the River
lower than <hi>Kingston</hi> Bridg; for the
<hi>Thames</hi> is not fordable in winter below that.
12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Kingston</hi> Bridg was indeed cut; but that
was all the Opposition that he met there:
yet as our Author describes it, it does not
seem that he knew there was a Bridg there;
for he speaks only of <hi>Crossing the River.</hi>

               <hi>LXXVII. But now to conclude the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
<hi>he tells us,</hi> That <hi>Haviet</hi> broke
thro the <hi>Queen's</hi> Army at St. <hi>James</hi>'s,<note place="margin">P. 367.</note>
and advanced to the Gate of the City; but
here, the new Locks and Keys did mighty service:
for the Gates could not be opened, so he was forced
to retire, but even that was no more possible for him
to do, since the <hi>Queens</hi> Troops were in too good
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Order, and She her self appeared at the Head
of them, and did so wonderfully animate them, that
in the end poor <hi>Haviet</hi> was taken, and 200<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more
with him, who were all led along with him to the
Execution.</p>
            <p>1. There was no resistance made to <hi>Wiat</hi>
at all; for he marcht straight on to the <hi>Gates</hi>
of the <hi>City.</hi> 2. Certainly by Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s
Story he was the modestest Rebel that ever
was, who came and knockt at the Gates, and
then went away, because the D. of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
had the <hi>Keys.</hi> 3. If the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Troops had
been in such order, one would think they
would not have trusted so much to their
<hi>Locks</hi> and <hi>Keys,</hi> as to have suffered <hi>Wiat</hi> to
go on to the City Gates. 4. Our Author is
unhappy in every thing: for he did not
know that which was set out as the most
Extraordinary part of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s behaviour;
who did not come out and ride at the Head
of her Troops, as he fancies; but it being
<hi>Ashwednesday</hi> morning, She went on with
the Devotions of the day, and continued
all the morning at prayers. Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> says
nothing of this, for one or two reasons,
either because he knew it not, or because
he had not found out what was fit to be set
against this in his <hi>Panegyrick.</hi> 5. It was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53298:79"/>
upon some other part of the same
piece, that he was thinking, when he makes
200. to be taken with <hi>Wiat,</hi> and all to be
carried to accompany him to his Execution.
For there were fifty eight persons that were
attainted for the <hi>Rebellion;</hi> but there was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a small number even of those, that were
pickt out to be made Examples: many of
those that were condemned, being reserved
to be Instances of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Mercy: and
She was so far from delighting in Scenes of
Blood, that her Clemency on this occasion
was much magnified. To make every one
of the Prisoners dye, comes nearer the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of some later Practices, than the
Mildnesses of that <hi>Princesses</hi> Reign, who
except in the matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> gave no
cause to complain of the Rigor of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings:
She had not <hi>Chief Iustices</hi> that
hanged up <hi>Rebels</hi> by Hundreds, or that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them so suddenly, that they were
to be led out immediatly to Execution; such
things were not then known in <hi>England:</hi> but
She on the contrary, when 600. <hi>Prisoners</hi>
were taken, was contented with their
coming to beg their Pardons with Halters
about their Necks, and gave them all their
Lives. Her <hi>Council</hi> was wise: She designed
<hi>to change the Religion,</hi> and therefore She
thought the best way to recommend her
<hi>own,</hi> was to shew the greatest readiness to
forgive the most dangerous <hi>Rebellion</hi> that
perhaps ever <hi>Princess</hi> went through. The
hanging up of <hi>Rebels</hi> by <hi>hundreds,</hi> She knew
well, would raise in the minds of her People
a Horror against <hi>her</hi> and her <hi>Ministry,</hi> and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53298:79"/>
against her <hi>Religion;</hi> as if they had delighted
in Blood. Since Cruelty in all persons has
somewhat that is base as well as black. She
was merciful in her own nature, and the
Councils of that <hi>Religion</hi> were at <hi>that time</hi>
better laid, than to be capable of such Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p>And now I have done with Mr. <hi>Varillas's
History,</hi> and I fancy the world will have done
with it likewise very soon. I dare answer so
far for the <hi>Tast</hi> and the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Nation,</hi> as to depend upon it, that none
of his works will be any more asked after
there. I have kept my self as much within
the temper of stile, that I thought became
me, as was possible. I confess, it raises na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
somewhat, to see a man of his Age, and
that had, by I know not what chance, gained
some Reputation in the world, imploy his
Pen with so much malice to defame our
<hi>Nation,</hi> and our <hi>Religion:</hi> but by a curse pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to himself, his Ignorance is such an
Antidote to all the ill Effects of his Malice,
that his Writings can do no hurt, but to
himself, and to his Printers. I thought a
severe Correction was necessary, when he
had now for a second time shewed that he
was Incurable: and that the discipline that
I had formerly given him, had not brought
him to a sounder mind. And therefore if
this goes a little deeper, it was the Invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of the Evil, that forced me to it. Let
men write truth as to matters of Fact, let
them write it decently, and let them set
themselves against my <hi>History</hi> as much
as they will, I will answer them with all

the Softness and Decency, that becomes a
Man and a <hi>Christian:</hi> and I will either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
my Mistakes, if I am convinced of
them, or discover theirs with that Gravity of
stile, that is necessary: for to handle a man
<hi>without mercy,</hi> tho not <hi>without Iustice,</hi> (which
was the censure that an Eminent person
passed upon my former <hi>Reflections</hi> on Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi>) is a thing so contrary to my nature,
that it must be a very Extraordinary provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
that can carry me to it. And I dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to all men, even to those of the <hi>Roman</hi>
persuasion, if the Venom and Folly that is
spread over Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi>'s second <hi>Volum,</hi> does
not justify all that Scorn with which I treat
him. It must be confessed to be somewhat
Extraordinary, that in an Age, such as ours
is, and in a City such as <hi>Paris</hi> is, a man
should undertake to bring in the <hi>History</hi> of a
<hi>Nation,</hi> into his Work, concerning which
he has so little Information, as neither to
know the <hi>Map,</hi> nor the <hi>Names,</hi> the <hi>Laws,</hi>
nor the <hi>Government,</hi> nor the most publick
Transactions that are to be found even in
the worst and cheapest Books; and yet the
most amasing part of all is, to see this man
write with such an air of Assurance, and to
pretend to discover the profoundest Secrets.
He that would desire to see very ill sights, if
they are but extraordinary, would he temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to go and look upon Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> and
examin his Meen and his Phisiognomy a
little; for certainly he is a man of the most
singular Composition, that the present Age,
or for ought I know, that any other has ever
produced.</p>
