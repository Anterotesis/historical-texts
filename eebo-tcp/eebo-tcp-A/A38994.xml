            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There hath bin for these many years
<pb facs="tcp:40403:3"/>
divers ships scouting upon the <hi>Narrow Seas,</hi> from forreign Countries with false and counterfeit Colours, and great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations there is made by Neighboring Princes, both by Land and Sea: so that this Kingdom cannot be secured, unlesse a timely course be taken both by Sea and Land.</p>
            <p>But for security of this Kingdom, the Lords and Commons in this present <hi>Parliament</hi> assembled, taking it into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious consideration, gave Order to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, Lord High Admirall of England,</hi> forthwith to give effectuall Direction, that all and every the ships belonging to His Majesties Navie, which are fit for service, and not already abroad to bee with all speed rigged: It was likewise Ordered, that the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> should go <hi>Vice-Admirall</hi> over His Majesties Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Royall, whose very Name maketh his Foes to tremble, even the proudest, hautiest, and most insultingst Enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Great Britain.</hi>

            </lg>
            <p>He went himself in person in the Royall ship called the James and hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted vp saile with most puissant courage toward the Narrow Seas who being past the Peer of Dover he espied some certain ships not far distant from him. Who making towards them, they sayled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with all speed, not daring to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him; so that our greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies dares not strike Sail neer <hi>Britains</hi> Coast.</p>
            <p>Hath not the Lord often delivered this Royall Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> from the forreign Invasions of the Hostile and Bloud-thirsty Spaniard, he hath with his strong Arme sent his sharp Arrows amongst them, slew and overthrew them to the immense glory of his sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; so likewise hath noble <hi>Warwick,</hi> whose very fight made all his foes to fly</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40403:4"/>
He hath scoured most part of the <hi>Narrow Seas,</hi> and hath sent two of His Majesties ships to the Coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> so that there cannot any Relief come to the Rebels, without the hazarding of ships, goods, and all therin, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth glad the sorrowfull hearts of that Kingdome, being likewise comfortable Tydings to the Protestants in this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>And touching the Noble Earls dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet wisedome, in ordering and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of His Majesties Fleet, both for the security of his Majesties Royall Person, the quiet and content of the Honourable <hi>Houses of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He with a prosperous Gale, plowed the vast Bosome of the <hi>Narrow Seas,</hi> the curling waves seem'd proud to bear his dancing vessels. So vertuous Honour fild his couragious heart, and prompted him to chase the <hi>Turkish Pyrat</hi> from our shore; Now Merchants may send forth their wealth securely, and never dread the Robers of the Sea.</p>
