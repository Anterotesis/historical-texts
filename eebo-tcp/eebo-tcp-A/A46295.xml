            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honorable Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS rare and remarkable Piece of History, as it was Dedicated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> in generall, because of the quality of the Subject; Treating of the ruine of one of the most famous <hi>Cities</hi> upon Earth: So upon this Review, and new <hi>Edition,</hi> I take the boldness of Dedicating it to <hi>You</hi> alone; who are one of the Eminent Members,
<pb facs="tcp:32499:6"/>
and Ornament thereof; as also being Governor of that <hi>Place,</hi> wherein lies her chiefest security.</p>
            <p>It was formerly Dedicated to this <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> in the highest brunt of the late civill Confusions. And the Noble <hi>Author</hi> of the following Epistle thought it very seasonable to do so, out of an express design to awaken, and warn <hi>Her</hi> of her desperate condition at that Time; And it produced so happy effects, that it made such impressions upon the spirits of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the best Citizens, that they began to recollect themselves, and see their Error; The said <hi>Author</hi> representing unto <hi>them,</hi> that the same <hi>Crimes,</hi> and <hi>Crying sins,</hi> which raigned in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> before her last and utter destruction, were very rife <hi>then</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> which were, the spirit of <hi>Sedition,</hi> instable and stubborn <hi>Rebellious hearts,</hi> their <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings</hi> at <hi>Government,</hi> and an itch after <hi>Innovations.</hi> As also the defiling
<pb facs="tcp:32499:6"/>
of their Temple, the <hi>Irreverence</hi> and comtempt of the <hi>Priests,</hi> the violation of the Tombs of the dead, with other acts of <hi>Prophaness</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> But principally the <hi>Crucifying</hi> of the <hi>Lord of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The City of London was guilty at that time, of all these ugly and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Crimes,</hi> and may be said to be lead all along by a true <hi>Jewish spirit;</hi> And concerning the <hi>last,</hi> viz. the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> though no <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison</hi> may be made without a high prophaness, yet the manner of murthering CHARLES the first, may be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly said to bear a kind of analogy, and resemblance with it; Nay the <hi>Jews</hi> (whereof there are swarms now in this City) will not stick to say, that it was a Murther beyond theirs; for, what they did, they did it out of <hi>blindness</hi> and <hi>ignorance:</hi> for they neither knew nor acknowledged <hi>Him</hi> to be <hi>King</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:32499:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Jew:</hi> But the <hi>English</hi> did accuse, and arraign, they did condemn, and murther King CHARLES by the <hi>name of their own King,</hi> the <hi>King of England.</hi>
            </p>

their shoulders at it, and sometimes break out into a kind of confession, that their judgments could not last so long but <hi>for crucifying one that was more then a man;</hi> Besides, the punctuall accomplishment of our Saviours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions were sufficient to conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>nce any rationall creature; For, not long after, their <hi>Land</hi> became a stage of blood, and all kind of barbarisms. Their so renowned <hi>City,</hi> their Temple and <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> so fam'd all the earth over was made level to the ground: And observable it is, that these judgments fell upon their Temple at the highest time of holiness, at their Passover or Jubilee; so that one might say, That season which was ordained for their <hi>salvation</hi> turned to their <hi>perdition;</hi> Moreover the very inanimate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and vegetals, the very soil of the Country became co-sufferers with them, being forc't to part with her <hi>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as well as with her <hi>people</hi> ever since.</p>
            <p>From that time to this day, 'tis well known what Runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and Land-lopers they have been up and down the world; For although it is known there be many scores of thousands of them, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Moreover it is observed, that they apply themselves to the most sordid and servile conditions; for commonly they are either <hi>Lombardiers</hi> and Brokers for the pettiest things, as far as a blew point: Or they are Gabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers and Tollmen, having some inferiour places in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom-houses, a profession so undervalued, and held infamous by their Ancestours: Or they serve for Spies and panders for intelligence, so that there be few great Officers in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,</hi> but have a <hi>Jew</hi> for that purpose; For they are known to be the subtilest, and the most subdolous race of people upon earth, as also the most fearfull and pusillanimous; inso much
<pb facs="tcp:32499:9"/>
that they are imployed no where in the wars, nor worth the making slaves of.</p>
            <p>Now, the reason, why they are so far degenerated from their primitive simplicity and courage, is their frequent cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities, their desperate fortunes, the necessities and hatred they have been habituated unto from time to time. For no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on earth hath been so generally contemned, both by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Pagans; witness one Heathen Poet among divers ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>From hence they say their Messias is to come; of whom one may hear them discourse with such a relish, such a self-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing conceit and confidence that is wonderfull. This may be the reason why they instruct their children, and expound their law in the <hi>Lusitanian</hi> language in their Synagogues where women are not permitted to enter; for they hold them to be of an inferiour creation to man, and made only for sensuall pleasure, and propagation. They much glory of their mysterious <hi>Cabal,</hi> wherein they make the reality of things to depend upon letters, and words; but they hold, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath the sole priviledge of this.

               <p>This is that <hi>Antiochus</hi> that builded a great City upon the sea coast, and called it <hi>Antiochia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he made a golden Idol, commanding that the children of Israel should be brought unto it, and worship it. But some of them chose rather to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death for the religion of their God, and some other fell from the Synagogue their mother Church. Before this he took away also their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, their New Moon, and league of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: forbidding that in any wise they should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these Commandments in any place through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Dominions. For the which he put ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Israelites to death, and oppressed them more, then did ever any of their enemies or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. The second man in honor next himself in Jerusalem, was one <hi>Polipus,</hi> he erected an Image in the Temple, commanding the people of Israel to worship it: and whosoever was disobedient, to be slain. Therefore he put to death <hi>Hanna</hi> and her seven children, as it is mentioned in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. When <hi>Antiochus</hi> perceived this, it increased his hatred towards Israel, insomuch that he did his endeavour that none of them should escape or be left alive, except such as would worship the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Then fled many of the Israelites to the mount <hi>Modiit,</hi> and to <hi>Jericho,</hi> because of the law of <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> his lord, having to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the high Priest <hi>Mattathias</hi> son of <hi>John,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called <hi>Casmoname.</hi> The Priest enjoyned them to fast, and punish themselves before the

Lord with weeping sackcloth and ashes. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he saith unto them if ye will jeopard your lives for the holy Lord, why dye we like women? Let us go and fight with <hi>Polipus,</hi> and if we dye, we shall dye with honor: parad venture the Holy and blessed God will help us, and will not root out the remnant of Israel. To this counsel eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man assembled, and made a covenant with him upon this thing. <hi>Polipus</hi> hearing this, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his forces together, and made towards them to destroy them, and what Israelite soever he found in his way, he slew him, <hi>Mattathias</hi> the Priest, and all the remnant of Israel, understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Polipus</hi> came against them, they went up the mount <hi>Modiit</hi> with their wives and children. Then put he himself and his sons in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He had five sons, <hi>Judas</hi> the eldest, the next <hi>Johona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> the third <hi>Joachan,</hi> the fourth <hi>Schimeen,</hi> the fift, <hi>Eleazar.</hi> All these were va iant men of war. When <hi>Polipus</hi> came to them, he craftily spake to <hi>Mattathias,</hi> saying: Thou art one of the chiefmen in Israel, and a man of honor and estimation. Come down therefore, and all that be with thee, worship the Image, and strive not against the King, that ye may live and not be destroyed. Thou shalt be their Prince also, if thou shalt be conformable. But the Priest in no wise would be seduced by him, but rather cursed and reviled him. <hi>Mattathias</hi> had an Altar at the foot of the hill, whereupon when he had offered sacrifice to the most blessed God: there came one of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Israelites out of <hi>Polipus</hi> Camp, and killed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32499:17"/>
upon it a swine. This villain was young and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, but the Priest was old: yet when he saw what this lewd fellow had done, crying to his God to strengthen him, he challenged a combat between himself and the fellow. Which thing being liked both of the fellow, and of <hi>Polipus,</hi> with his whole army: <hi>Mattathias</hi> came down with his drawn sword in his hand, and the fellow stood against him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive him. But the Priest rushing upon him, by the assistance of his God, overcame him, cut off his head, and cast his carcass upon the Altar: whereat <hi>Polipus</hi> and his whole Hoast were much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonied beholding one another. The Priest stood still by the Altar, crying, which of you will come to me man for man? Then <hi>Polipus</hi> picked out a strong champion, the best of all his army, and brought him out of the arreis of his hoast, to teach him his lesson, how he should behave himself with the Priest. The Priest therefore drew toward the camp with his naked sword in his hand, as though he came to joyn with their champion: but leaving him, he turned his sword upon <hi>Polipus,</hi> struck of his head, and fled to the hill. Then blowing their horns, and making a shout together, they rushed down upon the Grecians camp. But when the Grecians saw that their grand Captain was slain, they fled, <hi>Chasmoname</hi> and his sons with all Israel followed the chase; overthrew them, and made great slaughter.</p>
               <p>This done, <hi>Mattathias</hi> the Priest went to Jerusalem, pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

His kingdom endured one year, which was the 212. year from the building of the second House. After this he fell sick, and like to die, charged his sons to keep the observations of the Lord, and to walk in his wayes: also to play the men against the Grecians, for the Religion of the Lord. Then brought he forth <hi>Judas</hi> a tall man &amp; a hardy, and placing him in the Sanctuary, took a horn of oyl, and poured it upon his head, whereat the Israelits clapped their hands, and gave a great shout, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God save the King, God save the King.</p>
               <p>Soon after, <hi>Judas</hi> gathered an Army of Israel, and made an expedition against the Remnant of the Greeks that were left in the Holds of Israel, and whatsoever he took in hand, God gave it good successe, Notwithstanding, <hi>Antiochus</hi> sent against him a Puissant Army, under the leading of one Captain <hi>Pelonius,</hi> against whom <hi>Judas</hi> so warred, that the Grecians went to wrack, for he espied his time when they were destitute of victuals, and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily set upon them, beat them down handsmooth, and approached to Captain <hi>Pelonius;</hi> slew the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantest about him, yea, and him also. When <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus</hi> heard this, he was in a great rage: wherefore he chose out a most valiant Captain, called <hi>Lysias,</hi> and sent him against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with 1000. Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Footmen without number. <hi>Judas</hi> having
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32499:18"/>
knowledge thereof, commanded a Fast through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Israel for three dayes, and afterwards took Muster of all his Army, and made over them Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. These said to their souldiers, <hi>Whosoever is afraid,</hi> &amp;c. Whereupon many of the people returned home, yet there remained 7500. of such courage all, that one would not have run away for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. <hi>Lysias</hi> divided his Hoast into three parts, committing them unto three Captains, <hi>Nicanor, Bagris,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> But after the Israelits had once given a great shout, the Lord beat down the Greeks, so that the Israelits destroyed nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of their enemies, and spoiled the whole Hoast, and they that remained alive, took themselves to flight. The next day King <hi>Judas</hi> kept his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, together with all Israel in the Temple, for the battel was upon the sixth day. The morrow after, the Israelits returned to the spoil of those that were killed, and after to pursue other that were not able to resist: but they found none, for they were fled into <hi>Astaroth Karnaum.</hi>

               <p>During the time of these Wars, <hi>Antiochus</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Land of Persia, for they had moved War against him, and done injury, wherefore he fought against him: but having the overthrow at their hands, he returned to <hi>Antiochia</hi> with great shame, where also he found his Armies with another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and foil. Wherewith he was in such rage, that he gathered together all the valiantest and best Warriours in all <hi>Grecia,</hi> yea all that were able to bear weapons, swearing he would bring with him

such an Army, that all the ground about Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem should not suffice them to stand upon, whom he would have with him, even for his footmen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And he set forward his Horsemen, with horses and wagons laden with all manner of munition for the Wars; as Bows, Shields, Targets, Swords, and Spears, Brestplates, and Morions, besides a great number of Elephants, and such, that twelve valiant men might fight upon one Elephant, the Elephants being to them as a fortresse. But King <hi>Judas</hi> taking heart to him, put his trust in his God, and joyned battel with him. At length when he with the power of Israel approached to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

King <hi>Antiochus</hi> also, being mounted upon his Mare, and not able to sit her in her flight, was thrown down. His servants therefore finding him, took him up, and bare him a while upon their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and (being a corpulent and grosse man) they were not able to carry him further, but cast him down in the way. The Lord had plagued him also and his whole Host before with a dry scab, or rotten mattier, and with other most horrible disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: therefore as he saw all these things, he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to be the hand of God. Whereupon he made a vow, that if he escaped, he would circumcise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with all his souldiers, and would convert them to the worshipping of the God of Israel; but God heard him not.

King <hi>Judas</hi> with all Israel, returned with great joy to the house of the Lord, offered sacrifice: and as they had laid wood upon the Altar, and the sacrifice upon that, they called unto the Lord, lovingly to accept their sacrifice, and in the mean space, fire came forth of the Altar by its own accord, consuming the sacrifice and the wood, the like never chanced unto them to this day. This miracle was wrought the 25. day of the moneth <hi>Elul,</hi> or <hi>August.</hi>

               <p>The King made an expedition also into <hi>Arabia,</hi> to war upon the people thereof, and made of them a great slaughter, brought them into subjection, and made them tributaries. In his return he set upon a great City of the Greeks, wan it, and razed it. After that, he made a road into Greece ten dayes journey, where came against him with a mighty Army the chief man in King <hi>Opiters</hi> Realm, next his person: but <hi>Judas</hi> discomfited him and all his people.

In that Battel was slain <hi>Eleazar</hi> son of <hi>Mattathias</hi> the Kings brother.

               <p>So he abod alone with his drawn sword in his hand, unto whom none of his enemies durst ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nigh, but with chariots and horsemen they environed him, and Archers shot at him, wounding him sore, till he fell down dead upon the ground, and they that were about him were taken alive. The time that he reigned over Israel was six years. Many of the Greeks Captains were slain also in that battel, and the King himself so wounded, that he was fain to get him into his Country to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his wounds. After he had recovered his health, he returned again, came to Jerusalem, and to all the Cities of Israel, with the power of the Greeks, wherewith he so afflicted them at that time for the space of four moneths after the death of <hi>Judas,</hi> that the like tribulation was never seen in Israel. In the mean season, the Israelits resorted to <hi>Ionathas</hi> the son of <hi>Mattathias,</hi> and made him King in <hi>Iuda's</hi> stead, and were sworn unto him.

His reign over Israel was six years.</p>
               <p>Then was <hi>Simeon</hi> his brother King in his stead; against him came <hi>Antiochus</hi> the second, King of the Grecians came to war; but <hi>Simeon</hi> met him and laid first and an ambush to entrap the Greeks, and then ordered his battel in array against <hi>Antiochus.</hi> After that, he with his whole Host made a face, faining as they fled, and retired, till they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who pursued them, to be within their danger, then the ambush brake forth upon the Greeks, made a very great slaughter. After this, <hi>Simeon</hi> returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</p>
               <p>Then sent <hi>Ptolomee</hi> King of Egypt, an Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to <hi>Simeon</hi> King of Israel, offering him his daughter in marriage. To this request when King <hi>Simeon</hi> had consented, <hi>Ptolomee</hi> came to Jerusalem, where was made him a great Feast, and they were allyed together. Whereupon <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of the Grecians writ to <hi>Ptolomee</hi> King of Egypt, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily to murther <hi>Simeon</hi> King of Israel. Whom <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomee</hi> durst not but obey, for at that time the King of Egypt was in subjection to the Greeks.

Besides this also, his son which came with him, <hi>Ptolomee</hi> cast in prison. These things justly chanced unto <hi>Simeon,</hi> for that he had transgressed the word of the Lord, that forbad all alliance with the Gentiles.

Then <hi>John</hi> his son reigned in his stead, who was called <hi>Hircanus</hi> in the Greek Tongue. The <hi>same-Ptolomy</hi> king of Egypt invaded Israel with all the power that he could make. But <hi>John</hi> the son of <hi>Simeon</hi> met him, and the Lord overthrew <hi>Ptolomy</hi> with his whole Host, that they were slain of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, and pursued to the City <hi>Dagon,</hi> about which time the Israelites made trenches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged it. Now within the Town they had the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of king <hi>Hircanus,</hi> whom <hi>Ptolomy</hi> caused to be set upon the walls, and to be scourged with whips in the sight of her son. When <hi>Hircanus</hi> saw the great affliction of his mother, he would have raised his siege, and departed from <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> But his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called unto him, and said, My dear son <hi>John,</hi> regard not my trouble, for all chastenings come from God. Proceed manfully with thy siege a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this City, for it is in great distresse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge me, thy father and brother murthered by <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> The king followed her advise, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully raised a Mount, from the which he battered the walls with Engines of Iron like Chariots, till they began to shake. Wherefore many of the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Town fled, and their companies began to shatter, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> seeing this, commanded to afflict his mother yet more, and to increase her scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, until the entrails of <hi>Hircanus</hi> was moved, that he could not abide longer to see his mother so cruelly handled, but leave the siege, and let <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> escape: who neverthelesse killed his mother, and fled into Egypt.</p>
               <p>In the fourth year of king <hi>Hircanus</hi> reign, <hi>Pius</hi>

king of Greece came and besieged Jerusalem with a great power and strength, whom <hi>Hircanus</hi> was not able to meet and encounter withal in the field, but suffered himself to be closed up in the City. The king of the Grecians therefore raised great towers against the City, apart from the wall, digged a trench, and cast up a mount. Then plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they their Engins named P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which although <hi>Hircanus</hi> liked not, yet they did so, and slew many of their enemies, and put them also to flight that they were constrained to encamp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves further off from Jerusalem. Then the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites came to the towers that the Greeks had builded, and razed them to the ground. Thus they issued out daily, skirmishing with <hi>Pius,</hi> until the Feast of the Tabernacles. Then sent <hi>Hircanus</hi> to <hi>Pius,</hi> desiring him that he would grant them Truce, and let them be at peace while the Feast lasted. His request <hi>Pius</hi> granted, and sent a fat Oxe to be offered to the God of Israel, covering his horns with beaten gold, and dressing him with fillets of christal, &amp; other precious stones, clad also in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Purple, and divers other precious cloaths. He sent moreover plate, both of silver, and gold, full of divers kinds of spices, all to be offered unto the Lord. When <hi>Hircanus</hi> saw this, he went out unto <hi>Pius,</hi> and after he had made peace with him,

he made him and his chief men of War a great Feast, and gave him a Present of I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But he tarried there not long, because the time of Pentecost was at hand. Wherefore <hi>Hircanus</hi> and the Host of Israel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; but <hi>Pius</hi> and his Army of the Grecians proceeded.

VVhereof when tydings came to <hi>Hircanus</hi> he was very glad, and returned to Jerusalem with peace and joy.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Hircanus</hi> made many great Battels with the Nations about him, and had ever vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>He also came to the Mount of <hi>Corizim,</hi> where he won a fort of the Sectaries and Samaritans, and razed the Temple that the Sectaries had there as their house of Sanctuary, which they builded by the licence of <hi>Alexander</hi> the first king of the Greeks. He that built it was <hi>Manasse</hi> the Priest, brother to <hi>Simeon</hi> the just. But <hi>Hircanus</hi> the high Priest pulled it down two hundred years after that it was builded.

               <p>The feast of Propitiation then at hand, <hi>Hirca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> made speed to Jerusalem to execute his office

at that feast, (for he was high Priest) appointed for Generals of his Army, <hi>Aristobulus</hi> his eldest son, and his second <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean season, they within the Town writ to the king of Greece, to come to succour them, which he did with a great power. But these two young men the kings sons, went to meet them with the strength of the Israelites, and gave them the overthrow, killing them up almost every one, to the number of twenty one thousand fighting men, and the rest fled.</p>
               <p>That done, the young men returned to the siege of Samaria. King <hi>Hircanus</hi> their father, had ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the coming of the Grecians against his sons, so that he perceived they should have the Grecians of the one side of them, and the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and Sectaries of the other: but he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what was hapned, for that victory chanced the ninth day of <hi>Tisre,</hi> or <hi>September.</hi> His heart therefore was careful for his sons, and for Israel; notwithstanding he proceeded in his office accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the feast required: as he entred into the house of <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> or the Most Holiest, to offer incense, and to call for mercy for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and for his Army, he heard a voice speaking unto him: Never trouble thy mind with thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and with the Host of Israel, for yesterday the Lord of mercy heard them, and according to the greatnesse of his goodness, for thy Fathers sakes: Let thy heart therefore be right, and thy hands pure. So the King going out of the Sanctuary, declared it to the people. Whereupon the next
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32499:24"/>
day he sent post to <hi>Samaria</hi> and was assure dry certified again that this was true. VVherefore King <hi>Hircanus</hi> was magnified greatly of all Israel, for they knew that the blessed Lord accepted his doings, inspiring him with the holy Ghost, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing his kingdom and Priesthood. After this he took journey to Samaria, besieged it a whole year, and at length wan it, slew all also that bare life within. He razed the walls, the palace, and burnt up the City. He had wars also with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and the Arabians: and God prospered all that ever he took in hand. Shortly after, God gave him rest and quietnesse from all that dwelt about him, and from all his enemies, so that Israel rested boldly in peace and tranquility all his time.</p>
               <p>On a time the King made a Feast to all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Israel, that they might make cheer with him. <hi>And being pleasantly disposed, he said, I am your Scholler, and whatsoever I do, that do I by your Authority. Wherefore I pray you, if you see any fault in me, or if I do not as becometh me, tell me of it, that I might reform my evil way.</hi> Then every man great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extolled and commended him, saying; who is like unto thee, our Lord King, so worthy of the Kingdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The King was well pleased with their answer, and rejoyced greatly. Yet was there one among them, an undiscreet man, called <hi>Elezaar,</hi> who spake unadvisedly to the king. And it please your Majesty, it were sufficient for you to have the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32499:24"/>
Crown of the Kingdom, ye might leave the Crown of the Priesthood to the seed of <hi>Aaron,</hi> for as much as your mother was Captain in mount <hi>Modiit.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent the King was moved and sore displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against the Sages: which certain of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that hated the Sages, and smelled somewhat of Sects, perceiving one of them, informed the King that whatsoever that undiscreet person had spoken, it was not without the advise of the Sages.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the King demanded of the Sages, what law shall that man have that in despight of the King speaketh things to his reproach? They made answer, he is worthy to be whipt. Then said one of the Saducees, the matter is plain, that according to the minds of the Sages, and at their bidding, he upbraided thee, and therefore they would not award him to die. Whereat the King held his peace, and gave never a word to answer: so all the joy was turned into sadnesse. The next day at the commandment of the King, proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion went to all the Cities in the Kings Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they should stand to the ordinance of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boch</hi> and <hi>Bithus:</hi> and whosoever should refuse to follow their Decrees, or would observe the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Sages, and obey their will, should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death. This was <hi>John</hi> the high Priest, which had the Priesthood forty years, and in the end became a Saducee. Notwithstanding the Israelites obeyed not the kings commandment, but rather privily followed the ordinances of the Sages. The king himself and all his servants followed the Traditions of the Saducees, making Inquisition
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32499:25"/>
for them that stuck to the constitutions of the Sages, and putting to death as many as he could get knowledge of. By this means he drew much people of Israel into this opinion. The time that <hi>Hircanus</hi> ruled over Israel, was 31. years, and then he died.</p>
               <p>After him reigned his son <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> for he had three sons, <hi>Aristobulus, Antigonus,</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> This <hi>Alexander</hi> was hated of his Father, and banished out of his presence. He went there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and made War upon Tyre and Sidon, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them, and compelled them to be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristobulus</hi> regarded not the high Priest-hood, but set light by it, wherefore he would not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the office thereof, but took the Kingdom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and set the Crown upon his head, and was called the great King. Besides this, he banished his mother, and <hi>Alexander</hi> her son, his younger brother, and would not suffer them to dwell in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. But he loved his brother <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and made him Lieutenant General of all his Wars, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him forward into the Wars against his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Wherein the young man <hi>Antigonus</hi> had good fortune, and prospered in all things that he took in hand, and returned safe to Jerusalem, where he entred into the house of the Sanctuary to pray for his brother the King, which at that time was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously sick: and also to acknowledge before the Lord God, his goodnesse and mercy towards him, in that he aided him against his enemies. Then came a certain wicked person unto the King, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32499:25"/>
informed him with this tale: Thy brother (saith he) returning from the wars, inquired of thy health, and when it was told him thou wast sick, he said, I will go to him to day and rid him out of the world. When the King heard this, he was wroth toward the Sages, and commanded his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be apprehended, and carried to the place of <hi>Starton,</hi> there to be kept in prison, till he had made further inquisition of this matter. In the mean space the Queen, the Kings wife, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be put to death there, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Kings mind. But when the King heard that his brother was killed, he cryed out and wept bitterly, smiting his breast in such sort with his hand, that he swouned, and much blood issued out of his mouth. He reigned over Israel two years.</p>
               <p>After him his brother <hi>Alexander</hi> reigned, who was also called, King <hi>Janai,</hi> being brought out of Prison, where his brother had put him, and made King of Israel. He was a mighty man, and valiant in all his wars against his enemies, prevailing against them. He had wars with the Philistims namely <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam</hi> and <hi>Ascalon,</hi> whom he put to the worse, and overcame them. This man refused not the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but was high Priest. It chanced on a time, when he stood at the Altar to offer sacrifice, one of the sages cast a <hi>Cedar</hi> tree on him, whereat he lifted up his right hand upon the Altar crying give me my sword. Then the Sages kneeled down before him, and sware they did t not of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt but rather (say they) that we thus spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32499:26"/>
before the Lord, would be merry upon the High solemn day. But the Kings servants answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed roughly again, saying; although ye play and rejoyce, yet it is not the manner of the country to use any such despightfull custome with the King. The contention waxed hot against them, till at length the Sages spake evil of the King, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in his teeth that he was an unhallowed and suspended person, and that his Grand-mother on the fathers side was a Captain in mount <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diit,</hi> whereby her seed was stained. The King was sore moved at that, insomuch that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Sages to be slain. Therefore, wheresoever they found them, in the Sanctuary, or in the streets of Jerusalem, they killed them forthwith. Then the King commanded that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man should obey the governance and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Saducees. So in those daies had the Sages great tribulation, some fell on the sword, some fled away, and some tarried at home with great dishonor.</p>
               <p>After these matters, the King made an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into <hi>Arabia,</hi> entred the country as far as the rock of the Wilderness, against <hi>Hattam</hi> King of <hi>Arabia</hi> and subdued his land. After that, he warred on <hi>Medaba</hi> and the whole Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> vanquished them, and bringing them under tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and so returned with honor to Jerusalem. When he had after this well bethought him of his doings, it repented him of his evil waies: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he altered his mind and began to make much
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32499:26"/>
of the Sages, submitting him to their ordinance, and esteemed their traditions.</p>
               <p>There was at that time a kind of Sect that were called <hi>Pharisees,</hi> of whom such as had escaped, the King sent to call them home again, and when they came into his presence, he spake unto them words of comfort saying, My brethren, ye shall understand, that the thing which is once done, must needs be tearmed as it is, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked. And truth it is, you cannot excuse the reproach that ye did me, nor I cannot call again the blood that I have shed. Notwithstanding I confess my fault unto you, and have changed my indignation to love, praying you to put out of your heart all rancor and malice, lay away all your mourning and sorrowfulness of your minds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in your reconciliation and atonement with me, and be of good cheer. But they made him answer: we will not lay away our hatred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, for thou speakest but deceitfully, and we speak that is truth. Furthermore, thou hast kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our chief men and Elders, neither hast thou only done us this injury: but as <hi>Hircanus</hi> thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther began this mischief, so thou hast holden on and continued it. Wherefore this hatred between thee and us hath taken some root, neither can we leave our lamentation till thou dye, and God take vengeance on thee for our sakes. Then shall we rejoyce when we see vengeance. So they departed from his presence, neither did the King give them any answer at all. But when they saw the King to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32499:27"/>
be incensed against them and by that means the matter might redound to their own harm, after consultation had, they went to the King of Greece, whose name was <hi>Demetrius,</hi> shewed him what <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> his son had don to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, and all the Israelites that bare them good will, and followed their traditions, and how they also hated <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the mischief that he had wrought them, so that if any man will come and revenge the malice of <hi>Alexander,</hi> they would be ready to aid him. <hi>Demetrius</hi> followed their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and assembling together all his people, to the number of 400000. horsemen, and footmen without number, he took his journey, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped against <hi>Sichem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King <hi>Alexander</hi> raised six thousand horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to aid him. But the King of the Grecians writ privily to the Antients of the Sectaries, that they should not aid <hi>Alexander;</hi> to the souldiers also that <hi>Alexander</hi> had hired, he sent rewards, gold and silver, that they returned home to their country, and aided not <hi>Alexander,</hi> whereupon he was not able to withstand <hi>Demetrius.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hearing that <hi>Demetrius</hi> was removed from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> toward Jerusalem, intending to take him in the City, he fled by night with a few of his men to the mountains, and lurked there.</p>
               <p>When the men of Israel that were in <hi>Judea,</hi> heard that the King was fled out of Jerusalem, and that the City was in fear to come into the hands of the <hi>Grecians:</hi> they gathered themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and stood for their lives, as though all had

               <p>This done, the King took heart to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Kingdom, but the Pharisees fled to <hi>Bethshemes,</hi> fortifying themselves against the King, who having intelligence thereof, gathered a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Then banqueted he all his servants upon the roof of his Pallace in a high place, where his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Peers did eat and drink, till they were drunk. And in his merry mood he commanded those eight hundred Pharisees prisoners to be fetcht forth, and to be hanged every man of them upon gallowses before him, at which sight he drunk and laughed heartily.</p>
               <p>After this he fell sick in the four and twentieth year of his Reign, of a grievous disease, a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ague, that held him three years; and for all this he shrunk not nor letted to go to the war to encounter and fight with his enemies, what nation soever they were round about him, as though he had been a whole man.</p>
               <p>In the 27. year of his Reign, which was the third of his sickness, he made an expedition into the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> against a certain City called <hi>Rabaga,</hi> to get it by force. At which time he was very sick and weak; wherefore his wife <hi>Alexandra</hi>

The King answered, Weep not, nor shew any resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of pensiveness: I will tell thee what thou shalt do, and if thou wilt follow my counsell, thou shalt prosper and Raign, thou and thy children as thou wouldest desire; put case I dye, there is no man in the world need know thereof: tell thou every man therefore that ask for me that I am sick, and will not that any man shall come at me. In the mean while anoint and season me with balms fight with courage against this City, till thou win it, and then return to Jerusalem with joy: and beware thou put on no mourning apparrell, nor weep, but bring me unto Jerusalem, and lay me on a bed like a sick man, and after call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the chief of the Pharisees, bring them where I am, and speak unto them gently in this sort: <hi>Alexander</hi> hath been ever your enemy, I know it very well: wherefore take him if ye list, and cast him into the fire, or to the dogs, or bury him it

The Queen did therefore as she was instructed of the King. And when she had won <hi>Rabaga,</hi> she joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> after that gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the elders of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and spake to them as the King had advised her. The <hi>Pharisees</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the King was dead, and that his body was in their hands to do withall what they list, they answered the Queen, God forbid, we should do this unto our Lord, the anointed of God: He was the King and high Priest; what though he were a sinner, yet his death shall be an expiation for all his iniquities. Therefore we will bewail him, and mourn for him, yea, we will carry his coffin our selves on our necks, and bury him as it becometh a Kings Majesty, and so they did. The time that he had raigned was xxvii. years; after him raigned his wife <hi>Alexandra</hi> in his stead; for the <hi>Pharisees</hi> after they had finished the seventh day of the morning, they committed the Kingdom unto her. She had two sons by the King: the Elder was called <hi>Hircanus,</hi> the other <hi>Aristobulus, Hircanus</hi> was a just man and a righteous, but <hi>Aristobulus</hi> was a Warriour and a man of courage; besides that of a familiar and loving countenance.

               <p>On a time therefore when the Queen sate in the throne of her Kingdom, she cal'd the antients

Then made she <hi>Hircanus</hi> her son high Priest, and <hi>Aristobulus</hi> Lieutenant of the Wars.</p>
               <p>She sent also to all the Lands that her husband and father in Law had subdued, and demanded the noble mens sons for pledges, which she kept in Jerusalem. So the Lord gave to the Queen quietness from all that were under her subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. She gave also the <hi>Pharisees</hi> authority over the learned sort, putting them in their hands to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at their will.</p>

The Queen gave them no word of answer; whereat <hi>Aristobulus</hi> was angry, and letted not to utter it to his mothers face, but she would not hear him.

He came therefore to the Prince of the Saducees called <hi>Galustius,</hi> who was a good man of war. And after he had gathered a strong army of the Saducees, his mother the Queeen sent unto him that he should return unto her, which he would not do, but rather went to war with the nations that dwelt about him, where he won twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Cities, and got him great renown thereby.</p>
               <p>Now as the Queen his mother waxed sicker and sicker, the chief Pharisees came unto her,

with her Son <hi>Hircanus,</hi> weeping before her, and saying, how they were afraid of her son <hi>Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> who if he should come into <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and take it, he would deliver them up into the hands of the Saducees. Unto whom she answered, I am as you see at the point of death, not able to talk much with you: there is here in my house great treasure, that my husband and my father gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their parents, Kings of the posterity of <hi>Chasmonany,</hi> take that to you, and make my son <hi>Hircanus</hi> King over you. If <hi>Aristobulus</hi> will disturb him, and make war against him, ye may leavy men of war therewith, and succour him as you think good. And even with this she fainted and dyed, and was buried amongst her people, after she had raigned nine years over <hi>Israel.</hi> The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees therefore and Priests, with all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> made <hi>Hircanus</hi> her son King in her stead.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32499:30"/>
and besought him, that he would not scatter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the inhabitants of the Lord. He condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto their desires, upon these conditions; that he should enter into <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with them and be King, and his Brother <hi>Hircanus</hi> should be High Priest; whereupon they agreed. Then as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> entred into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> his brother came out of the Sanctuary to meet him, and with embracing he kissed him. So <hi>Aristobulus</hi> was King, and <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> executed the office of the High Priest; The Lord also gave <hi>Israel</hi> rest and peace for a while.</p>
               <p>But afterward the Lord sent an evill spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which was the cause of translating the Kingdom from the stock of <hi>Chasmonany,</hi> and of the destruction of his posterity, for the sin of <hi>Hircanus</hi> the great, and the sin of <hi>Alexander</hi> his Son, in that they shed so much innocent blood, and drew <hi>Israel</hi> from the obedience of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, unto the lies and trifles of the Saducees.

               <p>The Saducees beat into <hi>Aristobulus</hi> head, that as long as his Brother <hi>Hircanus</hi> lived, he nor his Kingdom could never be established. Whereupon <hi>Aristobulus</hi> devised how to make away <hi>Hircanus:</hi> which thing a certain man called <hi>Autipater</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, a man of most power in all <hi>Israel,</hi> and thereto also a wise, expert, and learned in all wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; both in the laws, and in the knowledge of the Greek; just of his word, and prudent in any strange or new matters chanced.

               <p>
                  <hi>Antipater</hi> favoured <hi>Hircanus</hi> so entirely for his justice, and uprightness sake, that he opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him his brother <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> and the Saduces intent, giving him counsell to flye to <hi>Hartam,</hi> King of <hi>Arabia:</hi> but <hi>Antipater</hi> himself went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to break the matter to <hi>Hartam,</hi> of whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hartam</hi> was very glad.

               <p>Then <hi>Antipater</hi> swore unto him, He shall be (saith he) thy true and trusty friend, to do whatsoever thy heart desireth. Thus <hi>Hartam</hi> was perswaded, and they made a league together.

Thus when he seemed to be unwilling to pray, <hi>Hircanus</hi> men compelled him, drawing their swords, and saying, it thou wilt not pray, thou shalt dye for it.

               <p>In those daies all the world obeyed the <hi>Romans.</hi> That Captain therefore writ unto <hi>Hartam</hi> King of <hi>Arabia</hi> in this wise: <hi>Depart from Jerusalem, if not, thou shalt understand, thou hast broke thy league with the Senate of Rome, and the whole Army of the</hi> Romans <hi>shall shortly invade thy Land.

thou (saith he) defend <hi>Hircanus,</hi> all <hi>Israel</hi> will be content to be under thy protection, for they love him every man; but if thou defend <hi>Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> the people will not obey thee, for they hate him. <hi>Pompeius</hi> charged him that no man should be made privy to their communication; For I (quoth he) will send for <hi>Aristobulus</hi> to come to me to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masco,</hi> and then I will cause to be laid hands upon him, and deliver him bound to his brother, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing the Kingdom to him. <hi>Aristobulus</hi> upon the sight of <hi>Pompeius</hi> letters resorted unto him: <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> also came from the rock of the wilderness; and as they appeared together before <hi>Pompeius, Antipater</hi> desired him that he would do justice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Hircanus</hi> the King, and <hi>Aristobulus</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that rebelled against him, and took his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from him without cause, whose sayings, a thousand of the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> stood up and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed to be true: <hi>Aristobulus</hi> answered, <hi>I never strove with him for the Kingdom, untill such time as I saw all these that made</hi> Hircanus <hi>King, to run in great obloquie, and to sustain much reproach, because he was so feeble a person, and of no great wit, nor sought much the Kingdom: yea, till all nations that were about him, whose Dominions our progenitours conquered, began now to despise him, to pass little for offending him, to deny him tribute for his simplicity and mopishness, with lack of courage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Aristobulus</hi> had said, there stood up a great multitude of goodly and beautifull young men, apparrelled in cloth of <hi>Hyacinth</hi> and purple, with mighty targets upon them, &amp; other ornaments

of gold, chrystal, and precious stones, affirming with one accord, that <hi>Aristobulus</hi> said the truth: namely, that <hi>Hircanus</hi> was not favoured by the kingdom.

So <hi>Aristobulus</hi> came forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and <hi>Pompeius</hi> did him at that time no harm, but demanded to be given unto him all the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of the House of the Lord, which <hi>Aristobulus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to do; <hi>Pompeius</hi> in a rage, caused to lay him fast in heavy iron chains, and assaulted Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>After this had the Israelites civil Wars within Jerusalem, because the siege was grevious unto them, for they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

against him unto death. But much people disliked that, so that that side prevailed that would yield. Wherefore <hi>Pompeius</hi> entered the Town, and the House of the Sanctuary, killed much people of the Priests, and the people of the Land made <hi>Hircanus</hi> King of Israel the second time, and <hi>Antipater</hi> his Counsellor.

                  <hi>Aristobulus</hi> thus being prisoner, and his two sons with him, it fortuned that one of them (called <hi>Alexander</hi>) escaped: and having intelligence, that <hi>Hircanus</hi> and his Counsellour were gone out of Jerusalem, he came thither and rebelled against <hi>Hircanus,</hi> made up the breaches of the wall that <hi>Pompeius</hi> had battered: yea the Israelites resorted unto him, and made him King in <hi>Hircanus</hi> place. Whereupon he gathered an Army, and went forth to meet with <hi>Hircanus</hi> as he came homeward from <hi>Pompeius,</hi> where he gave <hi>Hircanus</hi> the overthrow, and <hi>Securus</hi> the receiver of the tribute fled and escaped.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Alexander</hi> returned to Jerusalem, from whence shortly after, <hi>Gabianus</hi> a Roman with a strong Army compelled him to flee to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And being in the same place besieged also of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianus,</hi> his Mother <hi>Aristobulus</hi> wife, went forth to <hi>Gabianus</hi> weeping, and besought him that he would not destroy her Son: for whose sake he did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> no harm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:32499:34"/>
                  <hi>Gabianus</hi> therefore having gotten all the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> made <hi>Hircanus</hi> King of Jerusalem now the third time: who set Roman Captains and Rulers in <hi>Jericho,</hi> and in <hi>Zephori,</hi> and through all the Land of Israel.</p>
               <p>It fortuned after this, that <hi>Aristobulus</hi> got out of prison at <hi>Rome,</hi> and came into Israel; to whom on every side resorted men in such sort, that he had a puissant Host of Israel. Whereof when he had taken Muster, he chose out eight thousand of the best, and with them went against <hi>Gabianus,</hi> where was a sore Battel fought between them, till the best of <hi>Aristobulus</hi> men were slain, and only one thousand left, wherewith he fled to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. But the Romans followed the chase, and slew them every man. Yet <hi>Aristobulus</hi> would not yeild, but fought alone, although his Helmet was broken, till he had divers sore wounds in his head: and then fell he to the ground, and the Romans took him yet alive, brought him to <hi>Gabianus</hi> who comforted him, commanding his Surgeons to heal him, and after sent him to the Consul and Senate of Rome, where he was put in prison yet once again. And this, the Senate taking pity of <hi>Aristobulus</hi> wife, which was reported to be a very wise woman, released her two sons out of Prison, and set them at liberty. <hi>Alexander,</hi> the one of those, could not be content, but rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led once again against <hi>Hircanus,</hi> and the Romans Governours. For he gathered together much people of Israel, encountred with one of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Governors that <hi>Gabianus</hi> had appointed, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32499:35"/>
gave him the overthrow: but proceeding further to fight with <hi>Gabinius,</hi> had the worse and many of the Israelites were slain, yet he escaped and fled. This done, <hi>Gabinius</hi> came to Jerusalem, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the kingdom of Israel to <hi>Hircanus</hi> the fourth time.</p>

When <hi>Pompeius</hi> understood that <hi>Caesar</hi> raigned at <hi>Rome,</hi> and had killed the Consul, and Senate, with all the Nobility of <hi>Rome,</hi> he gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his whole Army out of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and made toward him. <hi>Julius</hi> having intelligence of his

coming against him, sent for <hi>Aristobulus</hi> out of prison, spake friendly unto him, gave him a power, and made him grand Captain thereof, bidding him to go and encounter with <hi>Pompeius:</hi> Indeed his Army was a strong Army, and he himself a King of no small prowess, and valiantnesse. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> hearing that <hi>Aristobulus</hi> came against him, was sore afraid of his valiantnesse, and of his Host; wherefore he sent to the inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> that were under his obedience, that they should present <hi>Aristobulus</hi> with some gift, whereby they might deceive him, and poison him. The Inhabi ants of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at his request, sent unto <hi>Aristobulus</hi> a present, by certain Noble men, whereat <hi>Aristobulus</hi> was right joyful, and did eate and banquet with them, till he was overcome with drink, then they impoisoned him, and he died: The time that he raigned over <hi>Israel</hi> was four years, and six moneths.

               <p>
                  <hi>Pompeius</hi> receiving tidings of his death, the more gladder proceeded toward <hi>Rome</hi> to besiege it: But <hi>Julius</hi> met him in the way, and destroyed him and his Host, whereby the Em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These went and ranged about in <hi>Syria,</hi> roving and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in such sort, that the <hi>Syrians</hi> were weary of their lives, for fear of them. Wherefore the King of <hi>Syria</hi> sent unto <hi>Herod</hi> Ruler of <hi>Galilee,</hi> desiring him to kill that <hi>Hizkias</hi> and his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: whereupon <hi>Herod</hi> prepared himself, and went to meet with <hi>Hizkias</hi> as he returned from the spoil of <hi>Syria,</hi> came upon him unawares and slew him and his men. Whereupon when the King of <hi>Syria</hi> was certified, he sent a noble reward unto <hi>Herod,</hi> of Silver, Gold, and precious Stones; by which, and by like means, he became very famous. The Noble men of <hi>Juda</hi> made their complaint unto <hi>Hircanus</hi> upon <hi>Antipater,</hi> and his sons, for their sore oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Land of <hi>Juda,</hi> desiring that <hi>Herod</hi> might be summoned from <hi>Galilee,</hi> to appear in judgement and answer with other for the killing of <hi>Hizkias.</hi> The King therefore sent for him, and he upon that came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> appeared before the Judges, princely apparelled, with a guilt sword girt about him, whose pride an antient man (called <hi>Samai</hi>) blamed, and reprehended also his stout heart,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32499:36"/>
but he would not give ear unto him, nor yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Judges. When <hi>Hircanus</hi> perceived that the Judges had almost determined to give judge-ment against the young man, and to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, he took pity on him, and said, We will not give sentence to day, to morrow is a new day, and by that means delivered him out of their hands: <hi>Herod</hi> knew not afore that it was a matter of life and death, that night therefore he fled to the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> declaring all what had hapned unto him. The King of <hi>Syria</hi> let him have a strong Army, and came with him himself, purposing to besiege <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> But his Father <hi>Antipater,</hi> and his eldest brother <hi>Phaselus,</hi> came forth unto him, and rebuked him, saying; Is this the reward that thou render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est unto King <hi>Hircanus,</hi> that took pity on thee, and would not have thy blood shed? Therefore they willed him to depart from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> unto whom he condescended, after he had once let the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> know what he could, and had shewed them his power. <hi>Julius</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> about that time (as he was worshipping in the house of his God) was murthered by the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of certain of them which had served <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> that was slain, as is afore mentioned: The name of one of them that killed him was <hi>Cassius,</hi> of the Country of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who fled thither, being afraid to tarry at <hi>Rome:</hi> this <hi>Cassius</hi> had great dominions in <hi>Macedonia.

And forasmuch as he so sore oppressed the <hi>Jews,</hi> they therefore hated him, and conspired to kill him.</p>
               <p>There was a man in great authority about <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> named <hi>Malchias,</hi> by whose means they wrought this matter.

Soon after came <hi>Cassius</hi> to <hi>Tyre,</hi> from whence he sent Messenges to <hi>Hircanus</hi> to come unto him, who came, and with him <hi>Malchias, Phaselus,</hi> and <hi>Herod: Cassius</hi> entertaining them all in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore <hi>Hircanus</hi> stood in fear of <hi>Phaselus</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> being certain that this was their deed. Wherefore he said unto them, this <hi>Malchias</hi> was worthy of such a death, for he was a crafty man, and an Usurer.</p>

all men, albeit in his heart he conspired to kill him, which <hi>Alexandra</hi> his daughter, and Mother in law to <hi>Herod</hi> knew well enough, who opened it unto <hi>Hircanus,</hi> but he would not credit her at the first, till on a time he perceived the matter clear to be so: then devised he how to flye to <hi>Maloc</hi> King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> he sent therefore to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loc</hi> to send him horses, and a Chariot to flye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; but the Messenger dealt unfaithfully, and lewdly with him, for he brought <hi>Hircanus</hi> letters privily unto <hi>Herod,</hi> who rewarded him well for his labour, and bad him go to <hi>Maloc,</hi> and to let him know what answer <hi>Maloc</hi> gave. The Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger upon this, went and delivered the letters to <hi>Maloc,</hi> who fulfilled <hi>Hircanus</hi> request, sent him hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and a Charlot, writing in this sort: I have sent thee horses and horsemen, come therefore unto me, and whatsoever thy heart desireth, I will do it for thy sake: So the Messenger brought the answer se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to <hi>Herod;</hi> whereupon he sent straight to the place in which he understood <hi>Malocs</hi> men to lurk waiting for <hi>Hircanus,</hi> and caused to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them alive. Then <hi>Herod</hi> commanded to call together the Elders, before whom he willed also <hi>Hircanus</hi> to be brought, and of him the King demanded; tell me whither thou hast written any letter to <hi>Maloc</hi> King of <hi>Arabia?</hi> he answered, I writ none.</p>
               <p>Then was <hi>Ristius</hi> the Messenger brought in as his acuser, and the men of war also of <hi>Arabia</hi> that were apprehended, who declared the whole matter before the Council, so that <hi>Hircanus</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:32499:41"/>

               <p>Then <hi>Antigonus</hi> son of <hi>Aristobulus</hi> deposed him, cutting off his ear, and banished him out of the holy City.

                  <hi>Herod</hi> from the hands of the Elders, who would have put him to death, for the death of <hi>Hizkias.</hi> From that time <hi>Hircanus</hi> wrought no evil in the sight of the Lord, nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him in any great matter, save only in this, that he bare too much with <hi>Herod</hi> in shedding the innocent blood, wherefore his own life went for the other: Therefore happy is he that never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth any part of his duty. <hi>Marimi</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the son of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Herod,</hi> had a brother whose name was <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,</hi> him <hi>Herod</hi> would in no wise promote to the high Priesthood, because he feared the children of <hi>Chasmonany,</hi> although his wife made earnest suite, and lay sore upon him for the matter: But the King made high Priest one that was nothing of the kindred of <hi>Chasmonany,</hi> whose name was <hi>Haniel.</hi> Notwithstanding, when he had once dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched <hi>Hircanus,</hi> his wives Progenitors, father of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32499:41"/>
                  <hi>Alexandra,</hi> his mother in law; then he deposed <hi>Haniel</hi> the high Priest, and preferred his wifes brother <hi>Aristobulus</hi> to the dignity, who although he were but a child, yet he was wise, and of good understanding, and beautifull withall, so that in all <hi>Israel</hi> was not a goodlier, nor hansomer young man than he was: And this <hi>Haniel</hi> was the first that ever was deposed from that office of the high priest-hood; for never did King of <hi>Israel</hi> attempt the like afore <hi>Herod,</hi> who did this to quiet his wife, and to fulfill his mother in laws mind: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, this <hi>Alexandra</hi> his wives mother was not content, nor satisfied, for the death of her Father was such a grief: but alwaies spake snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly to the King, that he committed her to ward. Then she writ to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> Queen of <hi>Egypt,</hi> wife unto M. <hi>Antonius,</hi> a Noble man of <hi>Rome,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto her all the mischief that <hi>Herod</hi> had done to the posterity of <hi>Chasmonany,</hi> and desiring of her aid; to whom <hi>Cleopatra</hi> made this answer, if thou canst find the means to come to me secretly, thou shalt perceive what I shall do for thee.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Alexandra</hi> had read the Letter she sent to <hi>Aristobulus</hi> her son the high Priest, shewing him that she would flye to the Sea <hi>Japho,</hi> and from thence would take shipping into Egypt, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him also to flye with her. We will (saith she) make two Coffers, one for me, and another for thee: and we will with rewards allure our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to carry out us privily, whereby we may flye to save our lives. This their device was perceived of one of <hi>Herods</hi> Servants, who forthwith made
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32499:42"/>
the King privy unto it. The King commanded his Servant that bewrayed them, that when they did convey the Coffers, they should bring them to him, which the servant did. So when the Coffers were brought to the Kings presence, he caused them to be opened, and took out <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> and her son <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> to whom the King spake sharply, and rebuked them sore. But <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandera</hi> answered him again as short; insomuch that the King moved with anger, flung away from her into his chamber, saying: It is better to fit solitary in a corner of the house, than with a braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and scolding woman in an open place. The King dissembled the matter, and shewed no great displeasure a year after.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Aristobulus</hi> the high Priest, apparralled in his Pontificial vestures, stood in the temple nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Altar to offer sacrifices, the Israelits beheld his beauty, his wisdom, and behaviour in the ministery, whereat every man rejoyced, praising God, that had not taken all away, but left one to revenge the injuries done to the house of <hi>Chasmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nany.</hi> The King hearing this, was sore afraid, and not a little displeased, thinking to himself the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits would restore the Kingdom of their fathers unto him: He perceived every mans heart to be enclined towards him: Wherefore he deliberated a while, and in the feast of the Tabernacles he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Jericho</hi> with all his houshold, whereas he made a great feast to all his nobles and servants, placing them every one after hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

hand. And as they eat, drank, and made merry, certain of the Kings servants were disposed to go swim in Jordan. To these the King had given secret commandment, that they should desire <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stobulus</hi> to go and bath with them in Jordan, and then to drown him. So when they were going, they came to <hi>Aristobulus</hi> and moved him to keep them company, which he would not, unlesse the King gave him leave: wherefore he asked the king leave, but he denied him at the first yet at length the young man intreated him so instantly, that the king bad him do what he would.</p>
               <p>He went therefore with the other young men to swim. The king presently took his horse and returned to Jericho, with all his train, leaving the young men behind, which continued swimming till Sun setting, and as it began to be dark, they drowned the Priest <hi>Aristobulus</hi> among them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when tidings came to the king, and it was known that he was dead, the people wept and made great lamentation, considering his Virtue, Nobility, and Beauty, every man was full of sorrow that he should have so short a life: and they bewailed so much that it was heard afar off. But <hi>Marimi</hi> chiefly, and <hi>Alexandra</hi> the young mans Mother, could no wise be comforted. Yea, the king also wept &amp; made great mone, for it repented him that he had done so wicked an act; yet all the people knew well enough that the thing was procured by the king: insomuch that <hi>Alexandra</hi> his Mother in law, letted not to tell it him to his face,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:32499:43"/>
that he was the murtherer of her husband, and of her father, and now last of all, of her son, to whom the King answered neither good nor bad.</p>
               <p>From that day forwards there was continuall hatred between <hi>Alexandra</hi> and <hi>Marimi,</hi> and <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parim;</hi> the mother of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Salumith,</hi> his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that came of base and servile blood. For <hi>Marimi</hi> cast in their teeth to their faces, that they were not of the seed of Israel: but prophane, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, and of base birth. Notwithstanding <hi>Herod</hi> loved <hi>Marimi</hi> as his life, wherefore he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver displease her as long as she lived, nor say so much to her, as why saist thou so,</p>
               <p>These things done, <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> a Noble man of <hi>Rome,</hi> next unto <hi>Octavian Augustus</hi> King of Kings, being sent by <hi>Augustus</hi> to war upon the Kings of the West Countries, reigned in Egypt, and by the provocation of his wife, rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Octavian Augustus,</hi> made war with him, both by the Sea and Land.

                  <hi>Herod</hi> hearing that <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> was slain, and that <hi>Octavian Augustus</hi> was come into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he fainted for fear of the displeasure of <hi>Octavian.</hi> Yet at length he took heart unto him, prepared a royall present to be carried before him, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after himself to <hi>Octavian Augustus.</hi> And setting forwards, he called <hi>Joseph</hi> the husband of <hi>Salumith</hi> his sister, whom he made chief of his houshold, commanded him that if <hi>Octavian</hi> put him to death, he should poyson <hi>Marimi</hi> his wife, saying; It should not be seemly for Kings, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mean man should marry with a Kings widdow, and sleep with her upon the Kings bed.</p>

This <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> did not so. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess therefore that in his wars against your Majesty, I ayded him with an Army, with Horse-men and ships: Neither went I out with him for any wars upon mine own borders, but whensoever I went with him I helped him to the uttermost of my power. When he was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32499:44"/>
falling, I bolstered him up: and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>gst all these I protest also, that I would not be counted of your Majesty a breaker of league: but now <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> is dead Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether that it shall please your Majesty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store me my former estate or no, forasmuch as I have kept touch with <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> against your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty amongst others, if you put me to death, you will do me no wrong, but justice, because by the Law of arms I have deserved death.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Octavian Augustus</hi> heard him speak so, he said unto him: Arise thou King of Israel in peace, be of good comfort, and fear not, for thou art worthy to be nigh, yea next unto my person. I know that <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> was inticed by his wife and would not follow thy counsel, for if he had, I dare say he would never have conspired against me. So he commanded the Crown to be set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon <hi>Herods</hi> head, and made a league with him. Then they went both together toward <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> to be revenged upon <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> But that wicked woman when she saw her City to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, put on her most precious apparrel, and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the throne of her Kingdom, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Viper to be brought unto her: which as soon as she had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uffered to sting her brest, she di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As <hi>Octavian Augustus</hi> came to the Pallace, and saw her sit there, he rejoyced that he might be revenged of her, and commanded to thrust her from her Throne: but when they came to her, and found her dead, it grieved <hi>Octavian</hi> very sore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:32499:44"/>
In this while <hi>Joseph Salumiths</hi> husband disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto <hi>Marimi,</hi> that the King had commanded, if it so happened to him to be put to death by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> that he should poyson her. Whereupon <hi>Marimi</hi> conceived yet a greater hatred toward the King, insomuch, that when the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in safety and sound, and with honor also from <hi>Octavian,</hi> and that all his men and whole houshold rejoyced greatly, <hi>Marimi</hi> shewed no countenance of gladness, no not when the King himself told her how greatly he was magnified and honored of <hi>Octavian Augustus:</hi> but alwaies she was very sad. <hi>Salumith</hi> the Kings Sister perceiving that <hi>Marimi</hi> so vexed the King, she told him how <hi>Joseph</hi> her husband had lien with <hi>Marimi</hi> whiles he was with Augustus. But <hi>Herod</hi> (say what she could) gave no credit to her words, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that she envyed <hi>Marimi,</hi> until at length he asked the cause of <hi>Marimi,</hi> why she rejoyced not as others did, when he returned in safety from <hi>Augustus,</hi> but was very sad, which shewed her to have rancor and malice in her heart towards him. She answered; Thou hast said heretofore, that thou lovedst me above all thy other wives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines; yet thou didst will <hi>Joseph</hi> thy Sisters husband to poyson me. When <hi>Herod</hi> heard this, he was exceedingly abashed, that <hi>Joseph</hi> had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed his secret, and began to mistrust with himself that which <hi>Salumith</hi> had told him, that he had slept with his wife indeed, and upon that detected that secret. Therefore he departed out of his palace in a great anger and rage, whereby <hi>Salumith</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32499:45"/>
that he detested <hi>Marimi,</hi> and therefore she accused her further, suborning false accusers and forgers of lyes, to witnesse that <hi>Marimi</hi> would have poisoned the King, whereof she had divers presumptions also by her countenance. She added moreover, if thou (saith she to the King) let her escape thus, she will speedily destroy thee, and bereave thee of thy Kingdom, the law giveth a man this couns<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>With this, and such like words, she so moved the King, that he commanded to bring <hi>Marimi</hi> forth, and to be beheaded in the high street of the City. And as she was brought forth into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place of the City, all the women of the City followed her: <hi>Alexandra</hi> her Mother also cursed and railed at her, saying, Come out thou that hast abhorred thy Husband, and conspired against thy Lord: <hi>Alexandra</hi> wept also, as though it had been for the wickednesse that her daughter had committed, thinking surely to please the King by that means, and to blear his eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, if peradventure he might suffer her to live, till she might have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to poison him. <hi>Marimi</hi> thus going to execution held her peace, and looked neither to the right hand, nor to the left, nor yet feared death any thing, knowing that she was innocent in deed, and thought, and therefore God would render her a good reward in the World to come; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she bared her Neck without fear, and they cut off her head, shedding the innocent blood. But God made no delay in punishing the same,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:32499:45"/>
for there fell a sore plague and pestilence in the house of <hi>Herod,</hi> so that his chief servants, his Noble women, and Concubines died sore there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yea, throughout all <hi>Judea</hi> raigned vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>yed therefore unto the Lord, saying, wilt thou for the offence of one man, deal so cruelly with the whole congregation? the Lord took pity therefore upon the land, and withdrew the plague from the people. The King repented him also, that he had shed blood without a cause; and love so grew in his heart that he was sick, and at deaths door. Then <hi>Alexandra Marimis</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sought means how to poyson him, which being uttered unto the King, he commanded to apprehend her, and to kill her. In this manner dealt <hi>Herod</hi> with all the posterity of the <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> leaving none alive that were called by the name: <hi>Herod</hi> put to death also <hi>Josephat</hi> the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of <hi>Salumith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King had two Sons, <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stobulus,</hi> by <hi>Marimi</hi> his wife: They were both at <hi>Rome</hi> when their Mother suffered, for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King had sent them thither to learn the Roman tongue: When they heard tidings of their Mothers death, they wept and mourned for her, hating their Father for his cruelty. Soon after the King their father recovered of his sickness, was established in his Kingdom, builded strong Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and rose to great prosperity. In the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of his Raign, therefell a great dearth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:32499:46"/>
in the land, wherefore the King took out of his treasure, much gold and silver, and precious stones, wherewith he sent into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and procured plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of corn, and refreshed with bread all that lackt, and were in distress of hunger; yea, he spared not his own proper goods: And not only to the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lits</hi> shewed he this liberality, but also to all that came unto him out of other strange Nations, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his renown: Moreover, in all his wars he had good fortune: Besides this, he thought it good to renew the house of the Sanctuary, whereupon he deliberated with the <hi>Israelits,</hi> to have their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the building of it, after the same quantity and measure that Solomon King of <hi>Israel</hi> had builded it. For the <hi>Jews</hi> returning from captivity in the time of <hi>Coresch,</hi> began to build it after the measure that <hi>Coresch</hi> prescribed them, and not as it was before. The King of <hi>Israel</hi> hearing that the King was purposed to pull down the Temple to the ground, and build it afresh, they made h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>m no answer, fearing lest when he had pulled it down, he would not be so hasty to build it up again. But the King perceiving what they feared in their minds, said he would not slack the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor rest till he had brought it to pass. He said moreover, that he would take out of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury plenty of gold and silver, and give it to graving: also precious stones, stones of Thasies and Marble. To the Carpenters also and Masons he would deliver Timber and Stones, Gold and Silver, Brass and Iron, to make all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the work. Wherefore if he pulled down
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:32499:46"/>
the House he was able to build it straight waies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>So he pulled down the House, and repaired it again, and finished it in length a hundred cubits, al of white Marble so that the whole height of the stone was in all, a hundred and twenty cubits. For the Foundation was twenty cubits within the ground, and a hundred above. The breadth of every stone was twelve cubits, and the thickness thereof eight cubits; every stone was of like big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The gates of the House he covered with fine gold and precious Stones finely set therein: the thresholds were of Silver, and the tops also. He made also a Vine, of gold a marvellous cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning piece of work, the arms thereof or bigger branches, were glittering gold, the lesser bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, slips, or latest shoots of gold, somewhat red, and all above was yellow gold, whereupon hung clusters of Crystall. The Vine was so great that it weighed a thousand pound weight of pure gold. In all the world was not the like to be seen. He made also a porch, and before the porch two walls of Silver, marvellously and cunningly wrought. Behind the house toward the West, he made a court of a hundred fifty cubits long, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in breadth, which was paved with pure Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Toward the south and north, the length of the court was also a hundred and fifty cubits, and a hundred in bredth. He erected in it also a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Pillars of white Marble in 4 rancks. The length of one ranck was fourty cubics, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pillar was fourty cubits high, and three cubits thick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:32499:47"/>
The pillars were all of like measure, as the Court of the North side, and of the South was also of like measure, with all the pillars thereof. Towards the east, the court contained seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty cubits, even to the brook Cedron: no man ever saw the like building in all the world. The Vine that he made, placed he before the porch: In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he extream parts of the Court, he made also walks and galleries of such height that they that walked therein, might easily see the waters running in the brook Cedron by the space of a Cubit; Between the porch and the house al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (as though it were a vail or partition) the King made a wall of Silver, of half an handfull thick. In the which was a door of beaten gold, and upon the gate a sword of gold of twelve pound weight. There were certain Posies graven in the sword, as this; <hi>What stranger soever approached nigh here, let him dye for it.</hi> So the things that <hi>Herod</hi> made in the Temple, were wonderfull: neither was there ever heard of in all the world, any King that was able to erect such a building.</p>
               <p>When the work was finished, the King sent to <hi>Saroas</hi> his pastures, for his Cattel, from whence were brought him three hundred young Bullocks, and very many sheep, according to his Princely estate. So then they dedicated and hallowed the house with great joy and gladness.</p>
               <p>There was one certain day in the year, when as the King was accustomed to make a great feast to all his Court, to all his Nobles and Sages in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: Against that self same day the King was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:32499:47"/>
minded to finish his works, which made both him more glad, and all his people. The same also was commanded to be done in all the Provinces of his Kingdom, sending his Letters by his Pursuivants to the Noble men, Captains, and Presidents of the Provinces, that they would observe that day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner every year. The people also that were squandred in their enemies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, their head Rulers and Captains came out of every Country, far and neer, to see the House and the King, for they could never believe it, till they had seen it: and when they had seen it, it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded far that they had heard of it.</p>
               <p>These things done, the Kings two Sons, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus</hi> which he had by <hi>Marimi,</hi> came home from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in a great heat and fury, with a strong company, yea their hearts were very heavy also; for <hi>Alexander</hi> the elder had married the King of <hi>Capadoci as</hi> Daughter, and <hi>Aristobulus</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Salumith</hi> the King his Fathers Sister. These coming to Jerusalem, went not to the Court to do their duty to the King their Father, neither would they see him: whereby the King gathered, they went devising some mischief against him: Moreover, all his men gave him warning to take heed of them, and to keep his power or Guard about him. He had a Wife of base stock out of the Country, before he came to the Kingdom, by whom he had a son nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Antipater.</hi> And when he had put <hi>Marimi</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved wife to death, he called home his wife, which he had disdained before, to his Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:32499:48"/>
Wherefore, now seeing the two Sons of <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> hated him, he appointed <hi>Antipater</hi> his son to be heir apparant, and to raise his estimation, he gave him all his treasure, made him Lord and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of all that he had, affirming that he should raign after him. This <hi>Antipater</hi> had a subtile wit, and his talk was daily to his Father; <hi>If it like your Majesty, wherefore should you give me all these things, when as these two Lions shall be ever in my top, and ready to destroy me.</hi> By such surmised means he raised discord and hatred between them and their father, albeit the King was loath to hurt his two sons.</p>
               <p>Not long after he took his journey to <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Octavian,</hi> and his son <hi>Alexander</hi> waited on him, hoping that <hi>Octavian</hi> would be a means for him to turn his fathers hatred from him, and put all malice out of his mind. When the King was come thither, <hi>Octavian</hi> rejoyced much at his coming, saying, I have thought long to see thee. To whom hast thou left the Land of <hi>Juda? Herod</hi> answered, for the homage that I owe unto my Lord the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, I am come to appear before him, and to declare my chances with this my son his Servant. So he told him the whole matter, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end. Then <hi>Octavian Augustus</hi> bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the young man, because he hated his Father. The young man answered, How can I otherwise do? How can I forget the most chast womb that bare me, which was the holy stock. If I forget my mother that was slain guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>less and without crime, then let me forget my right hand. These and such
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:32499:48"/>
like words spake the young man, not without tears in the presence of <hi>Octavian;</hi> so that his bowels were much moved, and the Noble men that were about <hi>Octavian,</hi> could not abstain from weeping, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented greatly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Octavian</hi> first reproved <hi>Herod</hi> for his great trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression and cruelty; then laboured he to pacify the young man with comfortable words, bidding him to honor his Father, and to submit himself unto him. When he had done as he was willed (for he would not strive against the Emperour's commandment) <hi>Octavian</hi> took the young man by the hand, and put it into <hi>Herods</hi> bosome. Then his Father kissed and embraced him, so that they both wept; after that they took their leave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Octavian</hi> who comforted them, &amp; gave them a gift, committing it into <hi>Herods</hi> hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herod</hi> yet perceived, that the hatred of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Marimi</hi> would not be appeased: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon when he came home to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he called together all the Elders of Israel and said unto them, I had determined once to place one of my Sons, Captain over the people of the Lord, but I might not do it without the consent of <hi>Octavian Augustus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore I have appointed my three Sons, and have divided my Kingdom equally amongst them: Help ye them against their enemies, but in no wise shall ye help one of them against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And if ye perceive any breach of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship between them, do what lyeth in you to make it up. Whereunto he made them swear presently
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:32499:49"/>
in Jerusalem; and the bond being made, each man departed home to his house.</p>
               <p>But for all this, the hatred between <hi>Antipater</hi> and his two brethren was nothing diminished, for he feared them, because they were of the house of <hi>Chasmonany,</hi> and allied with Kings of great power; he suborned therefore false accusers, to say unto the King that the young men, sons of <hi>Marimi</hi> were determined to destroy him: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he set variance between <hi>Salumith</hi> and them, for she was in greater estimation than he, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the King did nothing without her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell; the same wrought he also between <hi>Pheroras</hi> the Kings brother and them. But to <hi>Salumith</hi> he said, doest thou not consider how the sons of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimi</hi> know that their mother was put to death by thy counsell? therefore if they may bring to pass to make the King away, they will hew thee to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

                  </gap>ion that <hi>Herod</hi> had given too leight credit, knowing how ready he was to hear an evil tale, which was the cause of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, that befell upon the people of his house: Wel, <hi>Herod</hi> thought his counsel good. One of them that accused the kings children, was <hi>Pheroras</hi> the kings brother; and to say the truth, he was the chief of all. <hi>Herod</hi> loved <hi>Archelaus,</hi> the king of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia</hi> as himself. <hi>Archelaus</hi> perceiving, turned his tale to rebuke the king, saying. Thou art now wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en old, &amp; well stricken in years, thou sufferest these backbiters to rule thee, who stir thee to work all these mischiefs in thy house; yea, <hi>Pheroras</hi> thy brother hath falsely provoked thee against thy sons. When <hi>Pheroras</hi> heard these words, he was sore afraid, for indeed he had seduced the king. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came <hi>Pheroras</hi> to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and besought him to save his life. <hi>Archelaus</hi> answered him, If thou wilt obtain pardon for thy wickedness, come and fall before his feet, and confess that thou hast spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken falsely against his sons, then will I promise thee that he shall be merciful un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done. The young men therefore came before the king, and fell down at his feet, and the king was loving to them, and embraced

them kindly. He made great joy also, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi> came in so good an hour unto him; to whom he gave for a gift seven hundred pound weight of Gold, with many precious Stones, and Concubines, and dismissed him. But <hi>Antipater</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain suborned false accusers, and writ counterfeit letters in the name of the kings sons, to one of the Captains, declaring how they would conspire and kill the king; and by such means he encreased the enmities between them and their father many wayes that the king commanded them to be put in prison and most strong irons to be laid upon them. Besides this, <hi>Antipater</hi> had surprized and won the hearts of the kings chief Rulers, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ts, that they procured his Barber to bear false witnesse against <hi>Alexander,</hi> how he hired him to kill the king, at such time as he should shave his beard. When the king heard his Barber speak, he was much troubled in his mind, insomuch that he said, I am weary of my life, to hear these pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanks that open my eares to fill my head with tales, I can do no way better than to give charge, that whosoever brings me any such accusations hereafter of any body, he shall suffer death for it, wherefore he commanded the Barber to be slain, and his two sons to be brought forth and hanged upon Gallowses, shedding their innocent blood.</p>
               <p>Then rejoyced <hi>Antipater,</hi> supposing himself to be as sure of the kingdom, as though it were in his hands, when he was not aware, that <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were never so high aloft, yet was there</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:32499:51"/>
                  <hi>one higher than he who considered his doings. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> had two sons, <hi>Thigarus</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus:</hi> And <hi>Aristobulus</hi> had three sons, <hi>Herod, Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the King returned to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (for he was in <hi>Samaria</hi> by the Lake side, when his sons were put to death) he commanded that his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews should be brought to the Court, and taking pity on them, imbraced and kissed them, weeping very sore, both he and all his servants: for it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented him for the hainous deed that he had done. But when the time of mourning was past, he called the chief of <hi>Israel</hi> together, and said unto them, <hi>I am now grown in age, and waxen gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, uncertain how shortly I shall die, I see here before me these little fatherlesse children, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can behold without great anguish of mind; for when I look upon them, I call to remembrance what great dammage I have done unto their father in my furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous outragiousnesse.</hi> Now therefore I would commit them to the tuition and custody of some man that might be a Patron and as a Father unto them, to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them continually to his power. All the people answered that he had well spoken. He spake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto his brother <hi>Pheroras:</hi> Thou shalt be their Patron and Defender, and shalt give thy Daughter to <hi>Thigarus, Alexanders</hi> Son. He also commanded his Son <hi>Antipater</hi> to give his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Herod,</hi> Son of <hi>Aristobulus.</hi> And the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were knit, and composition made in the Kings presence.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Antipater</hi> marked the love that the King
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:32499:51"/>
bare towards the Nephews, he began to be in great care, for <hi>Thigarus, Alexanders</hi> Son, had a Grand-father by the Mothers side, a King of great power, namely <hi>Archelaus,</hi> King of <hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He falls down therefore at the Kings feet, to dissolve and break the friendship that he bare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Nephews, and to leave speaking in their cause as he had done, but he prevailed not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left his father, and went to <hi>Pheroras</hi> the kings brother, made a confederacy with him, and desired him to frustrat the bond that was between himself and <hi>Herod,</hi> and also between him and <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garus</hi> the Son of <hi>Alexander</hi> that was hanged. So <hi>Pheroras</hi> came to the king, turned his mind, and dissolved the covenant of Marriage. This done, <hi>Pheroras</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> (that sate upon the kings Throne) were become great friends, banquetting one another, day and night, and discoursing of their affairs.</p>
               <p>When this came to the kings eare, he was sore afraid of their combinings, and commanded that his Brother <hi>Pheroras</hi> should for evermore be banished the Court: <hi>Antipater</hi> his Sonne was sent to <hi>Octavian Augustus;</hi> to establish the kingdom unto him, and to enter in League with him: For <hi>Herod</hi> was so old, that he could not go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antipater</hi> journeying toward <hi>Rome,</hi> passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <hi>Egypt,</hi> desirous to see it before the death of his Uncle <hi>Pheroras:</hi> And as he travelled by the high-wayes of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there came a certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:32499:52"/>
with a viall in his hand close covered, which cryed, saying; Who will buy a thing of great price before he see it? <hi>Antipater</hi> marvelled at his words, and ask't him what was in the viall: But the Seller told him not what it was before he had bought it, and paid dear for it: Then whispered he in his ear, telling him that it was a strong poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that would kill one out of hand. This vial <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater</hi> sent to <hi>Pheroras,</hi> to be kept until he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Rome;</hi> In the mean season <hi>Pheroras</hi> died, and his Wife hid the viall. After when <hi>Antipater</hi> came home again from <hi>Rome, Pheroras</hi> Wife and he fell at striffe, insomuch that she objected unto him, that he was the cause <hi>Pheroras</hi> was banished the Kings presence, the sorrow whereof was his death. On the other side <hi>Antipater</hi> went about to accuse her, sowing discord between her and the King, to stir him against her. He suborned also a certain Eunuch or gelded person, to go to the King and enform him how that at what time as he took dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure with <hi>Pheroras</hi> his brother, and banished him his presence, <hi>Pheroras</hi> procured a strong poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and gave it to his Wife, commanding her to destroy the King therewith: The king hearing this, was wroth with the Eunuch, and said, I sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for that venome long ago, when it was noised that thy houshold servants would give it me to drink, but I could not find the thing to be true; yea, I have been too rash in such matters for I put my Wife <hi>Marimi</hi> to death without cause, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandra</hi> my Mother in law with my two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: When <hi>Antipater</hi> heard that the king cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32499:52"/>
not the Eunuch, he made suite to the king to send him to <hi>Octavian</hi> the second time, for he was afraid of the Viall that was in <hi>Pheroras</hi> Wifes house. He had writ also with his hand, how that he sent it, intending therewith to poison the kings Sons Children; <hi>But he that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a pit for another, oftimes falleth into it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> So desiring the king to send him, he let him go.</p>
               <p>After this, the king commanded to make search, if the Eunuchs words were true or no, he sent first for <hi>Pheroras</hi> houshold servants, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined them whether ever they could perceive that <hi>Pheroras</hi> was in mind to hurt him. They all sware, No.</p>
               <p>Then the king commanded to scourge them very sore, but they confessed nothing although some died under their hands in the examination: Some he ordered with many kind of torments; of some he caused to pluck out their teeth; and as he had scourged a cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Notwithstanding, <hi>Antipater</hi> lingred for the space of six moneths, to see if he might learn some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of his father's doings, but he could hear nothing: The messengers his father had sent, lay upon him every day and urged him to make haste: Therefore at the seven moneths end, he took his journey towards <hi>Judea,</hi> and came to <hi>Caesarea.</hi> There heard he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

her the Court, but he could not learn what should be the cause, therefore he was strucken with such fear, that he would have gone back again. But they that waited upon him, being desirous to go home to their houses, and families, dealt crastily with him, and perswaded him, that if he should now turn back out of his way, he should justifie his enemies words to be true; but if thou come once to thy fathers presence (say they) who loveth thee so entirely, thou shalt prevail against thy foes, and get the upper hand of them that trouble thee.</p>
               <p>So he followed their counsel, and came to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. When he entred into the City, no man came forth to meet him, nor once to bid him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come home: For all the people hated him for his lyes, slanders, perverse and wicked counsel, but chiefly for fear of the King. Yet went he forward to the Court, although with a fearful heart: When he came to the King's presence, he fell down and did his duty: but the king turned away his face, and could not abide to look upon him. He went home therefore unto his house with a heavy heart, hanging down his head, and hiding his face. There his mother told him how their counsel concerning the vial of poyson was bewrayed, and how, the king was wonderfully incensed toward him: that increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his fear more and more. The next day by the kings command he was brought forth, and, before all the chief of Israel assembled together, the king sat to judge <hi>Antipater's</hi> cause: There the king rehearsed unto them, his sons lewdnesse and lyes, how he had seduced him, and incited him to kill

his children that were of the kings blood, far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more virtuous than he; insomuch that with a loud voice the king burst out, and bewailed his Wife <hi>Marimi</hi> whom he put to death without a cause, and his two sons, that they that were far off might hear him.</p>

As true as God liveth, he shall never have that which he gapeth for, so the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded he should be put to death: and there was not one that would intreat for him, or desire the King to the contrary, but every man was glad of his destruction.</p>
               <p>The King commanded the keeper to bring him forth to the Market-place; which done, his head was cut off, and so he missed of his purpose: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the King commanded his body to be taken and carried to the City of <hi>Ankalia,</hi> there to be buried, but not in the City: That done, and the people being returned from the burial, the King sent to call all the Nobles of <hi>Israel</hi> together, and enforcing his strength, he sat up in his bed, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to call his son <hi>Archelaus,</hi> on whom he laid his hands, and made him King over <hi>Israel;</hi> then

shouted every man, God save the King. The King lived five dayes after the execution of <hi>Antipater,</hi> then he fainted and died. He raigned over <hi>Israel</hi> 40. years; he was a worthy Warriour, a wise and prudent man, a goodly man of person, having God on his side.

After them came <hi>Archelaus</hi> his son that was made King; then followed him all the people: There were fifty of his servants that went about the Bier, every one having a chaffindish of Gold in his hand, wherein they burnt sweet woods, and perfumes continually; as many as went about him, casting upon the Hearse pure Myrrhe. He was born by certain great Lords, and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Israel,</hi> upon their shouldders, going lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely, and with a majesty, till they came to <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion;</hi> where they buried him with great honour, the like was never done to any King. These things done, there resorted together such as hated <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> and were weary of their own lives whiles he lived, rejoycing that they had escaped his hands, saying; We have looked till our eyes blear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, waiting for the death of <hi>Herod</hi> that Tyrant and bloodshedder, that oppressed us with such heavy yokes; that left us nothing to live on, for the tributes and taxes that he laid upon us; yet now <hi>Archelaus</hi> his son is worse than he: Wherefore they consulted together, and cast their minds and good will toward <hi>Antipater</hi> the son of <hi>Salumith,</hi> the Kings Sister, one of the blood of <hi>Chasmonany,</hi> and went with him to <hi>Octavian Augustus,</hi> requesting him to translate the kingdom from <hi>Archelaus</hi> to <hi>Antipater;</hi> but he would not grant them their suite: yea, he rather confirmed and assured the kingdom to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord; for he married his brother <hi>Alexanders</hi> Wife, that had children by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and committed many great offences.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Antipas</hi> also wrought wickedness, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry abominations more than any that was before him: for he took his brother <hi>Philips</hi> Wife from him, which had already children by <hi>Philip;</hi> for this shameful deed, <hi>Rabbi John Baptist</hi> the high Priest rebuked him, wherefore <hi>Antipas</hi> put him to death.</p>
               <p>There was at that time one Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a <hi>Man,</hi> for he was a worker of

wonderfull works, and a teacher of such men as glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did hear the truth; and had many Disciples, both of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and also of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This man was Christ. who, after he was accused of the chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of our Nation, and condemned by <hi>Pilate</hi> to be crucified, was nevertheless much beloved by them, who loved him even from the beginning.

                  <hi>Claudius</hi> being dead, <hi>Nero Caesar</hi> was Emperor. <hi>Agrippa</hi> raigned over Israel 23 years.

divers torments, until at length they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to rebel against the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and <hi>Nero Cesar;</hi> to rid themselves from under his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. And above all other, one <hi>Florus</hi> presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Captain of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously oppressed the <hi>Jews,</hi> and had done many things very wickedly. For not onely he shed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, ravishing at his pleasure, wives, and deflouring maids in the Cities of Juda, but also robbed with great cruelty, every man of his goods; he polluted the Temple, and upon the beams thereof, he hung those that he took displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure at.</p>
               <p>It chanced that <hi>Beronice,</hi> King <hi>Agrippa's</hi> sister, came at that time to Jerusalem out of devotion to vifit the holy place.

               <p>There was present at that time a valiant young man, <hi>Eleasar</hi> the son of <hi>Anani</hi> the high Priest. He while his father was executing his office, could not abide to see the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the way as he fled, he chanced to meet with King <hi>Agrippa</hi> coming from Rome, from <hi>Nero Cesar,</hi> and going home into <hi>Judea,</hi> to whom <hi>Florus</hi> declared what had hapned him through the youth of the Jews at Jerusalem: And as <hi>Agrippa</hi> had passed Egypt, and drew toward Jerusalem, his sister <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronice</hi> directed her letters unto him, moving him to rejoyn with the Jews, and to aid them: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple also came wholly the space of fourty miles out of the City of Jerusalem to meet him, and fel down flat before him, crying, God save our King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa.</hi> But the King studied all he might to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure quietness and peace to the City and people: So he entred into Jerusalem, accompanied with two Noble men of <hi>Rome,</hi> worthy Captains, whom he brought with him in his train; And when he came into the midst of the City, the people cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mainly out upon him, saying, <hi>Deliver us, O King, and let thy hand and help be on our side, to succour us, for we will never more be under the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>subjection.</hi> The King hearing this, pityed the people very much; notwithstanding, he was not content that they were minded to Rebel against the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Wherefore he called the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together at the entrance of the Court of the Temple, where were present the Elders of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:32499:59"/>
Israel, and all the chief men, with the high Priest <hi>Anani,</hi> and declared unto them the power of the Romans, the strength of their Kingdom, and what Nations round about them they had subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in such sort, as no remainder of them was left: Wherefore he besought them not to provoke the Romans, nor to destroy the people remaining in Israel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He added moreover,</hi> If ye will give ear to mine advice <hi>(saith he)</hi> I know it well dear breathren, that there resteth in your hearts a great grief, and I my self am full of sorrow and anguish, that we are not of power to withstand the <hi>Romans;</hi> albeit, if you will be ruled by my Counsel, ye shall find a redress for this matter. For where Counsel is, and good deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, there's safety, and things come to prosperous success; ye shall sustain for a while the yoak of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains, till I may certify <hi>Nero</hi> of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by my Letters, and entreat him to rid us of these Rulers; I beseech you, be not hasty of Liberty: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny seeking liberty, have fallen into further captivity and greater bondage; there be among our people ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evil disposed persons, whose delight is in wars, for it is their whole study; amongst whom many good men do also perish; wherefore hear my words: as for them that be wise, they may perceive the matter themselves; they that lack experience, let them learn wisdom at my sayings. Keep therefore silence, which shall be as well to mine, as to your own commodity, for I shall not need to strain my self, but speak the softlier withless pain; and ye on the other side may the better hear and understand what I say. If ye hold not your peace, ye
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32499:59"/>
shal have two discommodities; ye shal interrupt my com munication, and hinder your selves from hearing. But now to the purpose: Ye shall be content, and suffer till I write to <hi>Rome</hi> of these matters, that <hi>Cesar</hi> may remove these evill Rulers, and send us them that be more human, and gentle; If ye may have such a one, then shall ye not think your selves in bondage, but in liberty; and worthily, for then only is servitude grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, when as the Ruler is an unjust man, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now therefore stay your selves, quarrel not with them; for although they be wicked, yet will they be ashamed to do wrong openly, for what they do, they do it secretly; but if ye should accuse them too much, they would rub their foreheads, and do it openly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all shame; so should you make of your Judges, and Rulers, your open Enemies: But it were far better to suffer an unjust governour, then a just enemy; for the one robbeth men privily, the other is an open destroyer; provoke them not therefore. Consider the wild beasts that be under mens power, and kept in chains, as Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Bears, and Leopards: if a man let them alone, they are quiet and harm no man; but if a man go to their dens and anger them, they will fly upon him, and worry him, and others too that be present: The same ye may perceive in a fever, and an ague, which if a man will go about to cure at the beginning, he shall make it more grievous, but if he will remedy it by leisure, the fervency of it will easily be quenched. Now therefore refrain your selves, and take heed that you draw not <hi>Caesar</hi> upon your heads, and the whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire: <hi>Caesar</hi> coveteth not your harm, neither sent he unto you these Rulers to hurt you; his eyes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:32499:60"/>
see from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> nor his hand reach from <hi>Rome</hi> hither, for it is flesh and blood; but if you will abide, till I may send Embassadours to <hi>Cesar,</hi> I doubt not but I shall remove these Rulers, and rid you of them peaceably, without any war, or blood shed. If ye be utterly determined to resist the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, you shall understand, you be in no wise able to do it, for God is every where on their side, so that they be Lords throughout all the world, and all people serve them, and shall do so till their end shall come: But if ye will not do this for your own sakes, yet do it for your own Countries sake, your children, and wives, the Sanctuary and Priests, whom ye are bound to love and spare, lest ye cast away and undo them all at once. I beseech you take my words in good part, for I have spoken nothing but that is for your good, and that may further our peace with the Romans, which I most wish: If you will be ruled and chuse peace, I will take your part, and do the best I can for you; but if you will needs have wars, ye shall have it alone for me, I will not meddle with you.</p>

From that time forth the wars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased more and more, between <hi>Eleasar</hi> and his complices, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> with his hoast, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Elders, and Princes that took their part. Upon a time when the Captains of <hi>Agrippa</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Temple, certain cut-throat murderers, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the seditious, mixt themselves amongst the Kings bands, and getting behind their backs, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them with daggers that they had under their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:32499:61"/>
kets; so that the Kings souldiers having Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and great arming swords in their hands, such as they use in the wars, could not wield them in the press; by this means many of them were slain, and the seditious got the victory. Thus <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Philippus</hi> with the Roman Army were put to flight, and the Elders with the Sages that were desirous of peace, departed out of town, and fled to King <hi>Agrippa.</hi> Then had <hi>Eleasar</hi> and the seditious the whole rule of the City, and all to their great damage; for the fury of the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous increased to such outragiousness, that they set a fire King <hi>Agrippa's</hi> house that he had in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> spoiled all his treasure, and all that was any thing worth they divided amongst themselves, They burnt the books of accounts, and bills of debts, every one that were in his Palace. <hi>Bero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice's</hi> house also the Kings sister they set on fire; and they slew all the cunning Artificers that were Masters of the Kings works; so their rule and power in the City, grew every day more and more grievous then other.</p>

The <hi>Damascians</hi> also conspired together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all the Jews that dwelt amongst them, which thing they kept secret from their wives, because for the most part they favoured the <hi>Jews</hi> religion.

When the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> heard how the <hi>Aramites</hi> had dealt with the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Countrey, suddenly they put themselves in arms, and in a fury and rage, like as it had been Lions and Bears that had lost their whelps, they ran to <hi>Damasco,</hi> burnt their holds, put the <hi>Damascians</hi> to the sword, men, women, and children, even the very sucking babes: yea, their Oxen, Sheep, Camels, and Asses, with all other Cattle, leaving none alive.

               <p>After this the <hi>Syrians</hi> that dwelt in <hi>Sithopolis</hi> said to one another, put case the <hi>Jews</hi> return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and make war upon us, surely if they should so do, these <hi>Jews</hi> that dwell among us, would joyn with them, and deliver up the City into their hands, and then would they be revenged upon us, and destroy us, as they have done the other Cities of <hi>Syria:</hi> Therefore they agreed to say unto the <hi>Jews</hi> and inhabitants of the City with them, We understand your country men will invade us again, and make war upon us, wherefore depart ye forth of the City with your wives and children,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:32499:62"/>
and lodg in the wood nigh unto the City, till their army be gone again, and then you shall return unto us. The <hi>Jews</hi> were content to fulfil their minds, went out of the City, and placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the wood.</p>
               <p>There was amongst them a certain young man named <hi>Schimeon,</hi> a good man of war, fierce, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made, and very strong withall; he in the favour of the Gentiles had slain many <hi>Jews,</hi> and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much of the people of God. For during the time that the <hi>Jews</hi> besieged <hi>Scithopolis,</hi> he issued out continually, and skirmished with the host of the <hi>Jews,</hi> many times putting them to flight, and never would suffer them to waste the Town, or to do any harm to the inhabitants thereof.</p>
               <p>Now as <hi>Schimeon</hi> with his father <hi>Saul,</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest old man, and the rest of the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> that dwelt in <hi>Scithopolis,</hi> remained altogether bodily in the Wood, without mistrusting any harm; the <hi>Romans</hi> joyned with the <hi>Syrians</hi> in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, entred the Wood, and slew the <hi>Jews,</hi> all that ever they could find, to the number of thirteen thousand: <hi>Schimeon</hi> himself with his father and their families, had pitched their tents nigh unto a fair fountain that was in the Wood, to whom when their enemies came to slay them, and destroy their whole families, <hi>Schimeon</hi> ran upon them with his drawn sword, made a great slaughter of them, and constrained them to retire: But when a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude environed him, and he perceived all the rest of the <hi>Jews</hi> were slain, he with the houshold only remaining, neither saw he any way to escape; he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:32499:63"/>
                  <hi>stept upon a little hill with his naked sword, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Hearken unto me ye</hi> Syrians <hi>and</hi> Romans, <hi>and ye that dwell in</hi> Scithopolis, <hi>I will speak unto you a few words full of lamentation.</hi> Now I perceive that justly and not without a cause ye make war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, without any favour or consideration that I delivered you from the hosts of the Jews, and never suffered them to do any displeasure to you, your wives and children, nor to your City, as they had done to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities of <hi>Syria.</hi> For I am he, that for your sakes have warred against my Countrymen t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But indeed God of his just judgment hath stirred you up to reward me in this sort, to murther me, that hath so often preserved you: Now therefore ye shall bear me witness that I shall sufficiently and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, take vengeance of my own life, not without rage and fury, most severely, because I have slain my fellows and friends; I will therefore slay my self, to be avenged of my self; for my brothers blood that I have shed, and so shall I be revenged of their blood; and ye shall well perceive me to be of that courage, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ye shall slay me, and after boast and brag how ye have killed <hi>Schimeon,</hi> I will bereave my self of my life, and punish the shedding of my brothers blood no otherwise, than the Law punisheth a murtherer and man killer.</p>
               <p>When he had spoken this, his eyes were filled
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32499:63"/>
with blood, and his face with rage, and so infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with fury, laying apart all pity, ran and caught hold of his father, haled him out of the Wood, and slew him: Then slew he his mother, lest she should intreat him for the children, and be sorry for their sakes: That done, his wife came running of her own accord, and held her neck down to the sword, lest she should be constrained to see her children dye. Yea, <hi>Schimeons</hi> children came and offered themselves to be slain, lest they should see the death of their father, or remain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him to be delivered to the enemies. After this he slew all his whole family that not one of his should come into the hands of their enemies. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he gathered their bodies together into one place, like a valiant stout warrior, and then bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goared himself on his own sword, lest any man else should impair, his strength, or boast that he had killed him.</p>
               <p>All this <hi>Schimeon</hi> did with a great courage, to take punishment of himself, because he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed his love rather upon strangers, than upon his own people, and to declare his force and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>So he died an abominable and detestable death, save only it was an argument of his haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mind and great courage, as it is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Now when the <hi>Jews</hi> had thus rebelled against the Romans, and slain their souldiers, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, King <hi>Agrippa</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> and recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto <hi>Nero Caesar</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> all
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:32499:64"/>
that was hapned; whereupon <hi>Nero</hi> sent Captain <hi>Cassius</hi> (that was at that time in <hi>Syria,</hi> and had made war upon the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him and all his power, and subdued his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to the Romans;) and with him a puissant Army of the Romans, commanding him to go into <hi>Judea,</hi> to offer peace unto the people, to comfort them, and to bring them again into league with the Romans, if it might be. <hi>Cassius</hi> therefore took his journey towards <hi>Judea, Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> met him in the way, and informed him what had hapned unto him concerning the <hi>Jews;</hi> how he had offered them peace, and they would have none of it; how also they had burnt his Palace, and sacked it: <hi>Cassius</hi> hearing that, was very glad that he had gotten such an occasion, to revenge the blood of the Romans, and Syrians, which the <hi>Jews</hi> had shed: Wherefore he levied a mighty Army and came to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and wheresoever he did espy the goodliest buildings, those cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed he to be burnt. From thence went he to the City <hi>Japho,</hi> which he besieged both by land and Sea, and at length wan it, where he slew in the streets 84000 men. After that he came to <hi>Jades,</hi> where he first burnt all the Country about it, and whomsoever he caught without the Town, he slew them: But the Citizens of <hi>Zippory</hi> went out to meet <hi>Cassius,</hi> and besought him for peace, whom he spared; he came not nigh their Town, nor slew any that dwelt in their Countrey. The sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Jews</hi> that were in the City of <hi>Zippory,</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Cassius</hi> coming, fled unto the mountains;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:32499:64"/>
but in the way they lighted upon part of <hi>Cassius</hi> Army, whereof they slew 200 men, and woun, ded their Captain <hi>Glaphira:</hi> yet at length the seditious were put to flight, and many of <hi>them-Glaphira</hi> with his horsmen pursued, overthrew and destroyed, the rest fled to the mountains. Then <hi>Glaphira</hi> Captain of <hi>Cassius</hi> Army, went to <hi>Cesarea,</hi> that was subdued to the <hi>Romans,</hi> there to cure his wounds that the Jews had given him. Thence went he to <hi>Antipire,</hi> which as he would have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, he perceived it to be furnished with a great power of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and seditious: These hearing <hi>Cassius</hi> also was coming, they went pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to fight with him, but perceiving that <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> power was very great, they determined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with him in the plain of <hi>Gibeon,</hi> fifty miles from <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> whereupon the Jews with their companies fained themselves to flye, to the intent they might draw the <hi>Romans</hi> after them; And within six daies they came to <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and there rested: <hi>Cassius</hi> pursued after them with all his hoast, till he came to <hi>Gibeon,</hi> which he besieged and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted also. It chansed then upon one of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths in the morning watch, the Jews (armed at all points) issued out of the Town, to give their enemies a Camisado; so after they had given a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of war, they marched toward the hoast of <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> whereof they slew 515 horsmen, and footmen twenty seven thousand, with the loss of only 22. of their own company. In that battell did well appear the valiantness of <hi>Mugbas,</hi> a Captain of the Jews Army: One <hi>Baudius</hi> also played the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32499:65"/>
man, at that same time, for at the commandment of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Priest, chief of the seditious, he set first foot within the <hi>Romans</hi> camp. Then began the Jewish warriours to be famous, after they had once so manfully incountered with the <hi>Romans:</hi> This done, <hi>Castius</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> sent their Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours once again to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to <hi>Eleazar</hi> the son of <hi>Anani</hi> the Priest, chief of the rebells that were in <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> requiring peace, and to come in league with <hi>Eleazar,</hi> lest the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jews</hi> should be utterly destroyed by the <hi>Romans</hi> incursions, and invasions on every side. But <hi>Eleazar</hi> refused to hear the Legates, and slew one of them, because he made too many words, in perswading the peace and league.</p>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Eleazar</hi> assembled the Priests and people together, to go out and fight with <hi>Castius; Castius</hi> perceiving how <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and the people were affected, and what minds they were of, how they had utterly conspired to destroy the <hi>Romans</hi> that were there, and to consume them clean, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a sufficient trial also of the force and valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the rebels; he determined fully to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> for he perceived he was not able to match with the seditious, neither his own power to be compared with theirs. Wherefore he would go see what end should come of the wars, and what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel <hi>Caesars</hi> Majesty would give. Taking his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney therefore to the City <hi>Japho,</hi> he found there letters of the <hi>Romans,</hi> for thither was their army come. From thence went he with them and his own army to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made report to <hi>Caesar</hi> of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:32499:65"/>
such things as have chanced: whereat <hi>Nero</hi> was much abashed, and not only he, but all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome</hi> were sore astonied to hear of the great puissance and valiantness of the Jews: For which cause the Wars ceased for that year, so that the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> was at great rest, and quietnesse that year, through <hi>Eleazers</hi> means the head R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Therefore these are they that delivered Israel in the time of the second Temple, out of the hands of their enemies; what time as wars were moved against the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Country: what time also commotions and tumults began in Israel. The first War was made by <hi>Antiochus</hi> the wicked King of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> who had determined not to leave one man in Israel. His mischievousnesse procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so far, that he slew the people of God, the Sages, and Wisemen, Princes, Elders, and young men, children great and small, Israelits, Levites also, and Priests, until all the chief men of <hi>Judea</hi> cast their heads together, and went to <hi>Matthathias</hi> son of <hi>Jochanan</hi> the High Priest in the Mount of <hi>Modiit,</hi> where he hid himself for the iniquity of <hi>Antiochus</hi> and his Rulers, crying upon him, and saying, Deliver at this season the people of the Lord, and never think to escape thy self, whiles the most wicked enemy rangeth thus, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth upon thy people, and sheddeth thy blood.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:32499:66"/>
For the blood of all Israel, What is it but thy blood? and the eyes of every man are fixed on thee, hoping that thou should'st assist and aid them in this calamity, that they may finde deliverance by thy means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matthathias</hi> hearing this, wept bitterly, and said, Fear ye not, nor let these <hi>Macedonians</hi> dismay you, the Lord shall fight for you, Be ye only quiet. So then was <hi>Matthathias</hi> stirred, and delivered Israel out of the hands of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and after he had overcome him, he was high Priest for one year, and then died. In whose room succeeded <hi>Judas</hi> his son, who executed the office in the Temple six years, and was slain in battel. Then his brother <hi>Jochanan</hi> was chief in the Temple eight years, and died likewise in battel.

               <p>Then <hi>Jochanan</hi> his son succeeded his father in the office; this is he, that was named <hi>Hircanus,</hi> first of that name so called, because he vanquished a King of that name: He reigned 31. years, and died.</p>
               <p>After him reigned <hi>Aristobulus</hi> one year; he was called the great King, because he first put the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Crown upon his head, and turned the dignity of the high Priesthood into a Kingdom, unhollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and staining the holinesse thereof 480. years, and 3. moneths after the returning of <hi>Israel</hi> from <hi>Babylon.</hi> He being dead, his brother <hi>Alexander</hi> reigned 27. years: After whose death <hi>Alexandra</hi> his wife held the kingdom nine years, and then died.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:32499:66"/>
In whose stead succeeded her son <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> and reigned 3. years; In his time <hi>Pompey</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Captain came against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> wan it, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> bound him in irons, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him captive to <hi>Rome;</hi> in whose place he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>Hircanus</hi> his brother to succeed, who reigned forty years. During his reign rebelled <hi>Antigonus,</hi> son of <hi>Aristobulus, Hircanus</hi> brother, and with the aid of an Army of the Persians, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with <hi>Hircanus,</hi> took him prisoner, and sent him to <hi>Babylon,</hi> cutting off his eares, that he should never after be meet either for the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or for the Kingdom. <hi>Antigonus</hi> reigned three years: In his dayes <hi>Herod</hi> fled and joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the <hi>Romans,</hi> by whose help he slew <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> the third year of his reign, and reigned after him 32. years, and then died.

               <p>After him followed <hi>Agrippa,</hi> son of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> that was his brothers son; he reigned three and twenty years, after whose death his son <hi>Agrippa</hi> reigned twenty years. This is that <hi>Agrippa</hi> of whom we now speak of, and of the calamity that befell in his time upon <hi>Israel.</hi> For all the while he reigned, the Wars between the <hi>Romans</hi>

and <hi>Israel</hi> never ceased, until the people of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> were led captive into the Province of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> at that time also the Temple was desolate, I mean the desolation of the second Temple, which we saw with our eyes builded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>

                  <hi>The 20. year of the reign of King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>the 9. day of the 5. moneth, that is called Ab, viz.</hi> July: Nero Caesar <hi>sent a Present for a burnt-offering, to be offered in the Temple at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>requiring peace of the Elders and Sages of</hi> Judea, <hi>and</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <hi>and that they would receive him into league with them, saying;</hi> My request is, that you would offer my present to the Lord your God, for his service and religion liketh me very well; so that I desire you to joyn in league with me, according as you have done with the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> my Predecessors in time past. I have heard what <hi>Castius</hi> the Captain of mine Army hath done to you, which displeaseth me out of measure; wherefore I assure unto you a faithful league, by the consent and counsel of the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> that hereafter there shall never any <hi>Roman</hi> Captain stir hand or foot against you, but rather your Chieftains, Rulers, and Judges shall be all Jews, and of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> Yea <hi>Agrippa</hi> your King, shall be Lord of all your Rulers, and what he commandeth, you shall do it; the <hi>Romans</hi> shall only be called your Lords, and have no more to do with you.</p>
               <p>So when these Legates came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they went and spake with <hi>Anani</hi> the Priest, informing him of <hi>Nero's</hi> mind, and shewed him his Present, placing it afore him: The Present was this; A

Bull for a burnt-offering, with a Crown of Gold upon his head, his hornes also were covered with Gold; upon him was a cloth of purple powdred with precious stones: there went certain before him that carried ten talents of Gold, behind fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed very many Sheep for peace-offerings. When <hi>Eleazar Ananies</hi> Son heard thereof, he came and cast out of the Temple of the Lord <hi>Nero Caesars</hi> Presents, saying, We will not profane and unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law the Sanctuary of our Lord, with the offerings of strangers; for God will accept neither their burnt offerings, nor their peace-offerings: When he had so said, he sounded a Trumpet, set his men in array against the Host of the <hi>Romans</hi> that kept watch and ward in the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and slew many of them that day, with one of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains also, and another they took alive; He being a valiant man, and seeing the routs of the <hi>Jews</hi> to urge him grievously, said unto them, Save my life and I will yield; unto whom <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Rebell sware, that he would not slay him, but spare him for his manhood (for he had slain very many of the <hi>Jews</hi> before) whereupon he yielded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Eleazar</hi> said unto him: <hi>Like as thy sword hath made many Women childless, so shall thy mother be made childlesse of thee above all other; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with contrary to his oath, he commanded his servants to kill him.</hi> King <hi>Agrippa</hi> seeing this, was wonderfully sorry. Therefore as he stood in one of the streets, he cryed, O thou Rebel <hi>Eleazar,</hi> I pray God that this mischief, whereof thou art cause, and thy

It appeareth they shall have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to do, that study to make peace and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in thy dayes; for they are sure to be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thee. How long wilt thou continue to bring us into the Bryars, Thou enemy and hater of the Lord? Why doest thou destroy and waste the Vineyard of the Lord GOD of Hosts? <hi>Eleazar</hi> answered him, What takest thou upon thee the name of a King? if thou be a King, why com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandest thou not us to be punished? Where be thy valiant souldiers? Let's see, Come thou and they together and chasten me, that it may be tried whether thou be a King indeed or no; Thou slandest aloof off, and when thou speakest, thy feet are ready to run away, as though a dog should set himself against an armed man, and bark at him, bleating out his tongue. With this he winked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rebels his complices, to run upon <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and take him whiles he held him in talk: but that was perceived of one of <hi>Agrippa's</hi> servants whom he had appointed for the same purpose, to stand over against him as nigh as he might, to mark and spy if the Rebels could make any stir toward him, and to let him have knowledge; He therefore lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hand upon his head, gave a sign to the king to flee, saying, Away, away, for if thou tarry any longer, the seditious will slay thee and us together. <hi>Agrippa</hi> perceiving that, he gat from thence with all speed, and the Rebels pursued him, but in vain, for they could not overtake him. So he got to

                  <hi>Japho</hi> a Town under the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he was in safeguard.

Wherefore <hi>Nero</hi> joyned unto him again <hi>Castius</hi> with a huge Army, wherewith they both entred Judea, and wan many walled Towns, amongst which they razed <hi>Japho.</hi> For the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> perceiving the power of the Rebels to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, were afraid lest they should get it into their hands whereby it might be an anoyance in time to come to the Romans, chiefely seeing it was a notable Haven for their ships to arive in <hi>Judea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, both <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Castius</hi> led their Army towards Jerusalem, to war upon the Rebels, and utterly to destroy them. <hi>Eleazar</hi> and other Priests with much people hearing that, they issued out against them, and found them encamped in the way, between Jerusalem and Japho; But after they had joyned battel, many of the Jews were slain by the <hi>Romans:</hi> the residue, <hi>Castius</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> put to flight, and pursued the chase unto the gates of Jerusalem, besieged also the City for the space of three dayes.

So that <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> set forward with a chosen and pickt Army of the <hi>Romans,</hi> passed the seas, and came to <hi>Antiochia.</hi> The Jews having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of this, chose out of their Captains, three of the principal and most expert Warriours, of whom I <hi>Joseph</hi> Priest that wrote this History was one, who by the divine favour am not ignorant in feats of Arms, and famous in Acts of Chievalry; and <hi>Anani</hi> the High Priest, and <hi>Eleazar</hi> his son. To these three they committed the whole Land of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> dividing it to them by lot, and gave them a furniture of war.

The third lot fell to <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azar</hi> the son of <hi>Anani</hi> the Priest, to whom was joyned Captain <hi>Jehoscua,</hi> and other Jewish Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Vespasian</hi> taking his journey with his host from <hi>Antiochia,</hi> came and pitched his tents in <hi>Aramzofa.</hi> For he had devised thus with his council; First to invade <hi>Galilee,</hi> and after to try what they could do in <hi>Iudea.

He instructed the people also in feats of Wars, what the sound of Trumpets signified, what sound served to fall in array, what to gather the souldiers together, and what to divide them After he had instructed them in the knowledge and feats of War, he said unto them thus: <hi>Ye shall understand (dear Israelites) that ye go to fight at this present against your enemies, wherefore let no fear overcome your hearts, nor dismay you at the sight of your enemies, but play the men, and take a good courage to you, to fight for your Cities, for your Countrie, and for your selves: Be not afraid of death, but rather be stout in defence of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, that ye be not led away from it, and to fight for the Sanctuary of the Lord, that it be not stained and polluted with the uncleannesse of the</hi> Gentiles.

Consider, that it is better to die in battel, than to live in captivity and bondage; Therefore when as ye shall come to joyn with your enemies, and shall see any of them beaten down, and attempt to rise again, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever of you is by and seeth him, remember the zeal of your God, wherewith it becometh you to revenge his quarrel, and being moved therewith, strike him that he never rise again; but if you shall see any of your fellows down, being inclined with the zeal of your God, rescue him from the hands of your enemies, and if he be not yet killed, cure him.

               <p>After he had said this, he chose out of the <hi>Iews</hi> 60000. footmen, and but few horsemen: And out of these he chose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:32499:71"/>
                  <hi>Tiberias</hi> therefore seeing the Ships dispersed in that fashion, they conjectured it was done by some of <hi>Iosephs</hi> host, wherefore the <hi>Romans</hi> fled to the Town, got in, and shut the gates. <hi>Ioseph</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding came to one gate of the City, and cryed that the people might hear, saying; What meaneth this conspiracy of yours against me? ye fight not against me, but rather against the Lord God, whose Covenant ye have transgressed, and broke the Bond that we made with him; Ye have also violated your oath that you sware by the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> that we should fight against our enemies to abate their pride. The people answered from the walls, We beseech thee our Lord, hear thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants speak; God forbid we should joyn with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and not rather with the people of the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and his Sanctuary, with the people of his Inheritance: howbeit there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us certain proud men, ungodly persons, that have made a league with <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and have brought into the Town one of his chief Captains: wherefore and it please thee, my Lord, to enter the City with thy souldiers, come unto us, that we may live with thee, rather than to perish in the hands of them that hate us.</p>
               <p>So they opened the gates, so that <hi>Ioseph</hi> went in and took the Town. Then he caused to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend those ungodly persons that were there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout six hundred men, and laid them in irons, sending them to <hi>Tiarva</hi> which he had afore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: the other wicked men that had aided <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> he put to the sword. But the chief Governour
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:32499:72"/>
of the Town he apprehended alive, carried him out of the City, and commanded one of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to cut off his hands. Then the Captain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought Joseph, saying, I beseech thee, my Lord, let one of my hands be cut off, and leave me the other. Then Joseph and his souldiers laught him to scorn, judging him to be no valiant man, nor of haughty courage: Joseph bad his souldier give him the sword in his own hand, and let him cut off which hand he list, and leave him which he will. So the <hi>Roman</hi> Captain took the sword, and cut off his left hand himself, leaving him the right, and so he was let go. He came therefore unto <hi>Vespasians</hi> Camp, to shew them what shame was done him.</p>
               <p>After this, the Citizens of <hi>Zippory</hi> rebelled also, making a league with <hi>Vespasian</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> host. <hi>Ioseph</hi> being certified of this, made thither with his host to besiege it, but the Town abid the brunt of the assault that <hi>Ioseph</hi> could prevail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against it, wherefore he besieged it a long season.</p>
               <p>About that time, it was signified also to them of Jerusalem, that the <hi>Askalonites</hi> had entred in friendship with the <hi>Romans.</hi> They sent therefore <hi>Neger</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> and <hi>Shiloch</hi> the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and <hi>Iehochanan</hi> with a power of the common people, who came to <hi>Askalon,</hi> and besieged it a great space.

to give a Camisado to the <hi>Iews</hi> that besieged the Town, entred their camp, and made a great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, continuing the same till it was day-light, so that about 10000. of the <hi>Iews</hi> were slain, the rest never moved out of the place, saying, It is better for us to die in this battel, than to flee from our enemies; therefore they took a good heart unto them, and stood manfully in their stations and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, trusting in the Lord God of <hi>Israel;</hi> and when it was day, they also set themselves in array against <hi>Antony,</hi> slew many of his men, not without losse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of their own part: for <hi>Shiloch</hi> the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and <hi>Iehochanan</hi> of Jerusalem were destroyed, by the <hi>Romans,</hi> with others of the Jews, to the number <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

thousand good men of war, to bury the bodies of the Jews that were slain in the conflicts by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony.</hi> They sought also the body of <hi>Neger</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domite,</hi> but they found it not, till at length he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them out of the Sepulcher, saying, I am here: For God hath delivered me out of the hands of mine enemies, to the intent I may be avenged of them in the wars of the Lord. So <hi>Neger</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them at large, all things how they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto him: wherefore the Jews rejoyced great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they had found him alive, and that he was saved by such a miracle, and the Lord delivered him: Therefore they put their trust in the Lord, believing that God would be present with them to aid them, whereof this deliverance of <hi>Neger,</hi> they took for a sure token. The <hi>Romans</hi> kept themselves within the Town for fear of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were come to bury the bodies. So the Jews buried all the bodies of their own part that were slain in both battels, for the <hi>Romans</hi> were not able to prohibite and let them, but held them in the Town. And when the burial was finished, they took <hi>Neger</hi> with them to Jernsalem, to give God thanks there for his deliverance at that present. Then <hi>Joseph</hi> the Priest gathered his strength, aad came upon <hi>Askalon</hi> with his whole Army, assaulted them, got the upper hand, and won the Town; after slew <hi>Antony</hi> and all his people with the Sword, that of all the valiant men of War that were with him, not one escaped. Besides this, also the Villages and Hamlets that were thereabout without the Town, he burnt them all: And so served he
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32499:73"/>
all the Towns thereabout, that had entred into league with the <hi>Romans,</hi> slaying both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> that dwelt in them with the sword, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as he found, and their houses he burnt.</p>
               <p>This done, <hi>Ioesph</hi> returned again to Zippory sought with them and got the upper hand, there shed he much blood of the people that had conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the <hi>Romans,</hi> utterly destroyed them, burnt their Cities and Villages, led their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren prisoners unto Ierusalem; and all the <hi>Romans</hi> he found there, he put them to death.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Vespasian &amp; Titus</hi> had heard of all that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> had done against the <hi>Romans,</hi> both how he slue their Garrisons as many as he could find in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and all the <hi>Iews</hi> that had made any league with him and his sons, they were wonderful incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and in agreatrage. They took therefore their journey, and came to <hi>Apitelma,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Acho,</hi> where at that time, <hi>Agrippa</hi> King of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> was abiding, and forty thousand men with him, all good men of war, and archers every one: these joyned themselves with <hi>Vespasians</hi> Army by which means the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp became very great.

But the <hi>Edomites</hi> had not associated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> for they were in subjection to the Jews and served them, so that not one of them aided the <hi>Romans.</hi> For long before, they had moved war against Jerusalem, and could not get the victory, but the Jews prevailed against them, and subdued them.</p>

                  <hi>Hircanus</hi> also the first King of the <hi>Jews</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised them.

After this, <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> with all their host, took their journey from <hi>Acho,</hi> and came to <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> and in the mount they pitched their tents: Wherefore when tidings was brought to Joseph, how the host of the <hi>Romans</hi> lay upon the mount of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and how <hi>Vespasian</hi> had sent before him a great power, to repair the broken waies, to fill the holes, and cast down the hills; to levell the way, that his people might pass the better, for he was sore moved against the <hi>Jews: Joseph</hi> issued out of <hi>Zippory</hi> with all his power, set upon them and slew them, taking such vengeance of them,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32499:74"/>
as never was the like before, for his God was with him: <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> hearing of this, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to set upon <hi>Joseph</hi> at unawares, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set all the waies, that he should escape of no side; but Joseph had intelligence of their coming, wherefore he left <hi>Zippory,</hi> and went to <hi>Tiberias,</hi> whither <hi>Vespasian</hi> followed: Joseph perceiving them coming, fled from thence to <hi>Iorpata,</hi> the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest City in <hi>Galilee,</hi> closed up the gates, and there remained with his Army. Then sent <hi>Vespasian</hi> certain Noble men, Embassadours to Joseph, to debate the matter with him in this wise: <hi>Vespasian</hi> Generall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, desireth to know what it should avail thee to be thus pend up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a walled town, he wills thee rather to come forth to intreat of peace with him, and to enter into a league together; for it shall be to thy avail to serve <hi>Caesar</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that thou mayest live, and not be destroyed, nor any of thy people with thee. Then Joseph sent Embassadours again to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> demanding truce for a few daies, that he might deliberate upon the matter with the people, and let them understand his words; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure (saith he) they will be perswaded to make peace with thee, and then will we enter league with the Roman Empire. So <hi>Vespasian</hi> cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from fighting against Joseph, permitting him to consult of the thing. Upon that, Joseph sent Embassadours to all the people at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to the Priests, Chief men, Rulers, and to the rest of the people, giving them to understand <hi>Vespasians</hi> mind: <hi>Ye shall understand brethren, that</hi> Vespasian

Generall of the <hi>Romans,</hi> sent his Embassadors unto me, enquiring, What it would avail us, to be stiffe against them, and not rather to come forth, and intreat of peace, and to joyn in league together, that we may serve the Emperour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> so to save our lives, and not to be destroyed: And I pray ye, why will ye lose your lives, your wives, your sons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Why will ye all fall together on the sword? that both they that should be left alive among you, shall be led Captive out of your Countrey, to a people that they never knew, whose language they understand not; and your Country to be made desolate, your Sanctuary laid wast, that there shall not be so much as one man left to enter into it. Never suffer this, you that be wise men, but rather receive my counsell, and come hither to us, that we may deliberate together, what conditions of peace we shall make for the safety of our lives, rather than to be destroyed; and that we may use the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of your Countrey, being at peace therein: For life and quietness, is to be preferred before death and banishment.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants therefore of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> both Priests, Chief men, Rulers, and Noble men of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, with the rest of the people, sent unto <hi>Ioseph,</hi> saying; Take heed to thy self, that thou never consent to this, to receive conditions of peace with them, but be strong to fight, till such time as thou shalt consume them, or till thou and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dye in battel, and so shalt thou fight the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of the Lord, for his people and his Sanctuary, with the Cities of our God: in the mean season, be it as it may, but let thy power not be with them.</p>

When Joseph heard the determination of the people of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> how all sorts with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent willed by the Embassadors the continuance of the wars; he was wonderfull wroth, and in a great fury issued out with all his people, and set them in array against <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and the Roman host, in which conflict were slain very many of the Jews: and from that day forward, <hi>Vespasian</hi> began fiercely to war upon the <hi>Iews.</hi> He departed thence to the City <hi>Geerara,</hi> a great City in the highest <hi>Galilee,</hi> besieged it, and won it; razed it, slew all the people, Man, Woman, and Child, Oxen, Sheep, Camels, and Asses, leaving nothing alive; And then he said, Now begin I to be revenged for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, which the <hi>Iews</hi> murthered in the land of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea.</hi> From thence he departed, and brought his Army to <hi>Iorpata,</hi> where Joseph remained: The first day that he incamped about <hi>Iorpata,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his souldiers with meat and drink plenty, and made them good cheer, then furnished he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man with weapons.</p>
               <p>So on the next morning early, the Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my gave a great shout, and beset the City round about on every side. In this business <hi>Ioseph</hi> stood upon a certain Tower, from whence he beheld the huge camp of the <hi>Romans;</hi> wherefore he sounded forth a Trumpet and gave a sign to battel, issued out with the whole power of the Jews that he had with him, and set upon the <hi>Romans</hi> camp at the foot of the hill, continuing the fight from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till night; And when it began to be dark, they ceased fighting, and departed the one from the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:32499:76"/>
other; the Jews to the town, the Romans to their tents. In this battel were many slain on both sides, as well Jews, as <hi>Romans.</hi> The Romans advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing themselves, proudly and stoutly said, We will quickly vanquish this little Nation, as we have subdued all other Nations that we have conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they shall annoy us no more, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we shall be at rest. The <hi>Jews</hi> also on the other side encouraged themselves against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> saying; At this time we will all dye toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the zeal of the Sanctuary of our God, and never suffer these unclean persons to pollute it; and having once destroyed them, we shall be quiet: So what with the pride of the <hi>Romans</hi> on the one side, and the stiffe-necked stubbornness of the <hi>Jews</hi> on the other; much people was slain in that fight, for it continued till the second, third, and fourth day. In this while, all the <hi>Jews</hi> that dwelt about <hi>Iorpata,</hi> fled unto <hi>Vespasians</hi> camp, and joyned themselves to the <hi>Romans</hi> to aid them; and ever as <hi>Joseph</hi> skirmished with <hi>Vespasian</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, <hi>Vespasian</hi> sent a power to assault the City. So <hi>Joseph</hi> and his men fought with <hi>Vespasian</hi> without the Town, and the <hi>Iews</hi> that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town defended the wall against the Army of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that was a lesser host made of the main Army: but the <hi>Iews</hi> that were within the Town, began to diminish every day, untill very few were left. The hardiest also of <hi>Iosephs</hi> souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the worthiest young men that fought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, were all slain, except a very few, with whom <hi>Ioseph</hi> fled and recovered himself into the Town,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32499:76"/>
rampering up the gates after him: but as <hi>Vespasian</hi> with all his Army besieged <hi>Iorpata</hi> a long while, he espied at length a Conduit without, that ran into the City, where of the Citizens drunk because the water was good and sweet; that he cut off, and derived the waters thereof besides the City, whereby the inhabitants of the City were destitute of beverage, having nothing left them but Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters. <hi>Ioseph</hi> therefore perceiving that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit water whereof they were accustomed to drink was taken away, conceived with himself; Now will the <hi>Romans</hi> brag and boast against us, and think to take us at their pleasure, whiles we have no water, but shall be constrained to dye for thirst: He took therefore garments, and dipped them in the well waters that were in the Town, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them here and there over the wall, to declare to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they had water plenty in the Town, lest they should conceive any hope of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Town, thinking they had no waters.</p>
               <p>Then commanded <hi>Vespasian</hi> a mount to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed nigh to the Town side, to plant an iron Ram upon, to batter the walls with, and beat them down.</p>
               <p>The manner of the making of an iron Ram, is thus.</p>
               <p>First they take a great long thick beam, upon the forepart whereof they put a great strong head, made like a <hi>Rams</hi> head, with horns, all of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall strong iron, the weight of it is as much as half the beam, &amp; covereth the beam to the midst. Then fasten they into the ground over against the place
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:32499:77"/>
that they intend to batter, two great Trees, like two masts of ships, between which they hang the beam that is called the Ram, with strong ropes made of hemp, the best that may be gotten, and iron wier twisted together: At the hinder part of the beam from the wall-ward, are rings of iron surely fastned, with ropes made with hemp and wire, tied to them: that when the assaulters will batter the walls, they push forward the beam as though it were a spear, and fasten his strong horns among the stones. Then hung they weights at the rings of the hinder part, and much people a far off take hold of the ropes that come through the rings behind, and hale that part of the beam upon the ground, and by such means they shake the wall, that they make it quake again.</p>
               <p>Thus in many places they did wrest, and wrench out the stones of the building, so that afterward the wall falleth down. There be also other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of engines, as an iron Ram upon four wheels, bound with iron and fastned with iron nails. To this they make four feet, as hath a Ram, as the bigness of the beam requireth. The biggest for the most part is thirty cubits long, and the least is ten. And look how many feet the Ram hath, so many wheels hath it also, for every wheel hath his foot by him: and when they will batter the wall, certain men appointed thereunto, draw it f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>st a good way off, then a great multitude of men take hold of the hinder part thereof, by four porters or levers of wood that are put therein, and with all their strength shove forward the Ram to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:32499:77"/>
strike the wall they will batter. The head of this iron Ram that goeth upon wheels, hath no horns but is blunt, made of the strongest kind of iron, with a wonderful thick neck: they have also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both sides of the engine, a pentise of wood for the safegard of them that shove forth the Ram be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, from the arrows or stones of them that are upon the walls. The Rams that <hi>Titus</hi> used at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, for the most part ran all upon wheels. Of the other sort he had only a couple, as we shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in this place.</p>
               <p>The beam of this Ram we even now described, was as thick as ten men could fathom, and the length thereof was fifty cubits. It was also hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low within, and filled with Oxe-hides folded and sowed toget<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>n that the fashion of the leather might be set as upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d over with iron plates. The leather was put within, that the beam should not break wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>h the poise of the weights that were hanged by the rings behind, whereas men appointed for the purpose, haled at the ropes to draw back the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eam. The wood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that went about the leather, served to keep the leather in fashion. They covered it with an iron plate, lest they that kept the walls should set it on fire: the horns that were upon the head of the Ram, were as many as they listed, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fewer than ten, and then the beam was XX. cubits long, nor also more than fifty, and then the beam was a hundred cubits in length. Betwixt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:32499:78"/>
every horn was as thick as a man could fathom, the length was a cubit and a half at least. The wooden wall or pentise was as long as the leather that was put in the beam, and it was set on both sides to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the hinder part of the beam, to defend the men that laboured to batter the walls, lest they should be hurt with arrows or darts.</p>
               <p>The Ram that <hi>Vespasian</hi> used at <hi>Jorpata,</hi> which he besieged, and me in it, was made in this sort. The length thereof was fifty cubits: it had twenty five horns in the head, which was as thick as ten men, every horn also was as thick as one man, and betwixt every horn, the space of one cubit: The weight that was hanged at the hinder part, was a thousand five hundred Talents, every Talent was about a hundred Troy weight; the men that laboured in the executing of this Engine, were fifteen hundred. To remove it from one place to another, or from one City to another, were appointed a hundred and fifty yoke of oxen; or else three hundred brace of Horses and Mules: If they were to assault any Forts or Cities that stood on hills, then they did divide it in parts, and bring it up to the siege by piece-meal, and there it was set together again.</p>
               <p>Now when the <hi>Romans</hi> had battered the walls of <hi>Jorpata,</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> perceived them to shake, he took great sacks, filled them full of chaff, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them down by the walls, that the horns of the Ram could not come nigh the stones of the wall, but light upon the sacks, which by reason of the softnesse of the chaff, hindred and brake the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:32499:78"/>
stroke, that the walls were lesse hurt: For the nature of soft things is, to give back to the hard, and to weaken their force.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Vespasian</hi> seeing the subtilty of <hi>Joseph,</hi> used also policy for policy; for he sent into the Town secretly, <hi>Jews,</hi> spies, which when the batteries should be, might cut asunder the cords that the sacks were tyed to, and with them slip down the walls, where the <hi>Romans</hi> were ready to receive them, that they should not hurt them in the fall; and immediately they struck the wall with the Ram. There was at that present in the City, a certain valiant man, named <hi>Eleazer,</hi> of the house of <hi>Anani</hi> the high Priest that then dwelt at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:</hi> This <hi>Eleazer</hi> perceiving the <hi>Romans</hi> to go about to batter down the wall as they did before, plucked out of the wall a mighty stone, so that he made a great hole, or gap, whereat he slid down the wall, and stradling did light on the Engine, made fast an iron chain to the horns thereof, and got again up nimbly and quickly, from the beam into the Town, with the chain in his hand, for the wall was not very high above his head, as he stood upon the Ram; then the other tall fellows took hold upon the chain, fastened it to the pillars and walls in the Town, that the <hi>Romans</hi> might rather be constrained to break their Ram, than take it away from thence.</p>
               <p>The Priest <hi>Eleazer</hi> yet once again boldly went down and sat upon the beam, slew fifty men that laboured about the Ram, and the rest he put to flight; then returned into the Town being drawn
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:32499:79"/>
up again from the beam to them that were within the Town, greatly rejoycing in his manhood. After that, he went up upon a high Tower, from whence he tumbled down with a mighty force a great stone, and a hard, on the head of the Ram and brake it, that both a great part of the head and the hornes fell on the ground: For the iron that it was covered withal was old and rusty, so that it was much wasted, and eaten therewith; the ropes were also old. After that, <hi>Eleazar</hi> went down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, took part of the head that was broken, and hurled it into the Town; the <hi>Romans</hi> that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either he slew, or put to flight. The Archers shot at him, and wounded him with five Arrows, wherefore by the help of his fellows upon the wals he climbed up, otherwise he had not been able for the grief of his wouuds.</p>
               <p>The people then gave a shout for joy of the victory of the worthy Priest <hi>Eleazar</hi> that had slain the Romans, and broke their Ram, wherein they put their confidence, and brought part of it into the Town, and fastened it with an iron chain, that the Romans could not pull it back again to them, nor have the use of it afterward, wherefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the best Cities of <hi>Jorpata</hi> armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that day, being stir'd with the great courage that they had seen in <hi>Eleazar;</hi> and went down, hewed the beam to pieces, brought the poyses with the Rings, and two masts with them into the town: and the same day died <hi>Eleazar</hi> with great renown, as one that had fought for the Sanctuary of the Lord, and for his people and Country of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:32499:79"/>
like a faithful servant and souldier of the Lord: whom all the people mourned for, burying him in the Town, honouring him for his death, worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and faithfulnesse, appointing him a worthy memory also, for that he had waged battel with the enemies of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The young men of the Jews seeing this, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially two of them, the one called <hi>Nitra,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Polipas,</hi> men of great wisdom and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therewith expert in the Wars, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with zeal of the God of Israel, opened the gates, and issued against the <hi>Romans,</hi> skirmished with them, and slew many of them. But at length they were slain themselves in the skirmish, for the Sanctuary of their God, for <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp; their country.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Joseph</hi> saw the Wars to encrease more and more, he issued out, and made a great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the <hi>Roman</hi> tents, burnt the mount and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of War that the <hi>Romans</hi> had left; by which means the Wars waxed yet hotter, insomuch that <hi>Joseph</hi> repulsed the <hi>Romans.</hi> For when they saw the Jews so desperately give their lives for their God and Land, they would not abide their force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vespasian</hi> seeing his men shrink, he stood up, and encouraged them, exhorting them with fair words and promises, as well Gold and Silver, as meat and drink, wherewith the <hi>Romans</hi> allured, fought with <hi>Joseph</hi> that day unto the Sun-setting, and as the battel waxed hot, the Jews wounded <hi>Vespasian</hi> with an arrow in his right leg, which sore dismay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they saw the blood run down his leg: and that day was a sore fight betwen the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:32499:80"/>
Jews and the Romans. <hi>Titus</hi> seeing his father wounded, being sore abashed, ran to him to help him, to whom his father said: How is it my son, that thou art thus astonied? <hi>Take heart to thee, and with a courage revenge thy father of these Jews that have now the better hand of us.</hi> So both <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian,</hi> with all their whole host, fought that day a sore fight, and many were slain on both parts, yea, very few were left on <hi>Josephs</hi> part, with whom he returned into the Town.</p>
               <p>The next day, the <hi>Romans</hi> raised a new mount, instead of that which <hi>Joseph</hi> burned, and planted another iron-Ram thereupon, between two posts accordingly; for <hi>Vespasian</hi> had brought four of this sort with him from <hi>Rome,</hi> but other battering pieces upon wheels, had he with him thirty, what more what lesse; the bigger sort were 30. cubits long, the lesser ten. He brought also ten En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to hurle great stones withal, which he had placed about the walls. The <hi>Romans</hi> therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the assaults against the Town, as they were wont before. But the Town was now desolate and naked of the stoutest warlike men, for they were all slain in the fights. Albeit <hi>Joseph</hi> remained and a few with him, who went every one, and the women also, to defend the walls, for there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most no men left fit for the War. Then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> flung, with the Engines that stood on the mount, stones into the Town on every side. It chanced that a great stone hit a woman with child with such violence, that it passed through her body, and carried the child with it, by the space of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:32499:80"/>
half a mile. They cast up and raised yet other Mounts also, from whence they flung stones. And another like chance hapned. A stone came and hit one of <hi>Josephs</hi> men of war, a valiant man, in such sort, that it divided his head from his body, and made it fly a large mile off. At the same time, one of the <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers devised with himself, how to hit <hi>Joseph</hi> with a venomed arrow, and gat him under a wall where <hi>Joseph</hi> was, to accomplish his purpose; but <hi>Joseph</hi> espied him, and cryed to him, Hold thy hand, thou wicked fellow, and do not kill me: With that the fellow star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted somewhat aside, being afraid at <hi>Josephs</hi> voice, and suddenly the Jews out of the Town poured hot Oyl upon him from the wall, and his skin was scalded off, and he ran away naked, howling, and yelling to the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp, where he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vespasian</hi> and his son <hi>Titus</hi> were fully determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to continue the assault, until the 47. day notwithstanding the walls were so high, that they could not win the Town. Yet at length the men were so spent within the Town, that they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alive, were so wearied with toyling, that they were not able any longer to furnish theirwatch upon the wall. This, upon a certain night, <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> understanding, scaled the walls at a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where watchmen were lacking, and after them many more of the <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers followed, which went down on the inside, and brake open the great gate of the Town, whereat entred the whole Army of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And being within the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:32499:81"/>
Town, sounded their Trumpets, and shouted to battel. The Jews with the alarum, tumult, and hurly burly of the Romans, awaked out of their sleep, and were sore afraid. Notwithstanding every man took him to his weapon, and drew to the Market-place as fast as they might. They had made the Market-place of the Town so large of purpose, that if any businesse should happen there might come together the whole City if they would: and as they looked about them, they saw the Roman Army entring in at the Town, by the way that came from the great gate. Then fought they with the Romans, and divided even in the Market-place where they stood, exhorting one another, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let us die here fighting, and never suffer our selves to be taken alive. But <hi>Joseph</hi> and forty men with him, worthy men all, fled away into a wood, where they found a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Citizens were slain in that conflict, for they would not yield, nor commit themselves to the Romans, they trusted them so little. For on a time, a certain Jew besought a Roman souldier to save his life, and the Roman sware unto him, saying, God deal thus and thus with me, if I slay thee, therefore yield and come hither to me. The Jew required him to give his right hand that he might trust him, and the Roman reached him his left hand. The Jew being dismayed in that great fear mark't not that it was his left hand; But when the Roman had once hold of him, he kept him fast with that hand, and with his right took his sword, &amp; slew the Jew that then was naked,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:32499:81"/>
having cast away his weapon, upon trust of the <hi>Roman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Jews</hi> saw how the <hi>Roman</hi> regarded not his oath, but slew the <hi>Jew,</hi> that upon the trust of his promise and oath, had yielded himself unto him; they determined to die altogether, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to trust the <hi>Romans:</hi> Whereupon they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with themselves, utterly to die for the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Lord God of <hi>Israel;</hi> but in so doing, they slew much people of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and far more than they had done in any other battel, yet at length the City was taken. When <hi>Vespasian</hi> had knowledge where <hi>Joseph</hi> and his company was, he sent <hi>Nicanor, Pilerinus,</hi> and <hi>Callicanus</hi> with him to <hi>Joseph,</hi> to will him to come forth, and he should have his life and not be slain; upon that <hi>Joseph</hi> debated the matter with them that were with him in the Den, requiring their advice: For my part, (saith he) if ye will follow my counsel, I think it best we go unto them; but upon this condition, That they will make us a formal assurance of our lives, effectually as we shall require them; which done, I doubt not but <hi>Vespasian,</hi> when we come unto him, will extend his favour towards us.</p>
               <p>When these men perceived <hi>Joseph</hi> to be inclined to yield unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> they said, We marvel at thee (O Prince <hi>Joseph</hi>) at thee, we say, that wast chosen out of thousands of people, and promoted to the Priesthood, and Kingdom, to sanctifie and hallow the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> who wast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so appointed Captain General of so great an host,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:32499:82"/>
and hast seen with thine eyes the shameful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of thy people, with the displeasures and damages of thy Sheep, that thou hast yet any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to live in this dishonour. What seest thou that thou wouldest desire to live? Should'st thou not rather desire death than life? Peradventure thou perswadest thy self that they call unto thee to save thy life, or for thy commodity; but without doubt this were a vain perswasion: For they call thee for none other intent than to take thee alive, and to brag how they took <hi>Joseph,</hi> that was consecrated and addicted to the Wars, and make it an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that their power prospereth. Now therefore (our dear Brother and our Prince) consider that this they will do, yea if they save thy life. But put the case they put thee to death; Were it not better for thee to die on thine own sword, than on theirs? yea, if it were for nothing but this, it is better for thee to die than live; lest thou should'st hear their reproaches, their upbraidings, and their quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: and if they preserve thee alive, never think they do it for thy good, but rather for thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and shame, which is far more grievous than death it self. Wherefore, our dear Brother, and our Prince, What comes in thy mind, that thou purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest to live, after that thou hast lost thy people, and thy brethren?

not live after the destruction of his people, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Almighty said unto him; <hi>Let me alone, that I may wreak mine anger upon them, and consume them.</hi> Why dost thou not call unto thy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance <hi>Aaron</hi> his brother, that went betwixt life and death, in withstanding the Angel that plagued the people, and offered himself to die for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the plague might cease from <hi>Israel?</hi> Where is King <hi>Saul,</hi> and his son <hi>Jonathan</hi> that foughtfor the people of God, and died in the field? Could not <hi>Saul</hi> have saved his life, and his sons both, if he had been so disposed? But he, when he saw <hi>Israel</hi> had the overthrow in the battel, he had no desire to live longer, but chose to die ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to live, and would not be separated from his brethren neither in life nor death, as well he, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> his son; these were dearly beloved, and most amiable men, (as the Scripture termeth them). Why doest thou not remember (our dear Prince) the righteousnesse of <hi>David,</hi> the anointed of the Lord, who seeing a most grievous pestilence to rage upon the people of Israel, said, <hi>Let thy hand (O Lord) I beseech thee be turn'd upon me and my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house: For I am he that have sinned, I have transgressed: as for these thy sheep, What have they done?

               </p>
               <p>Where is the holy Law smothered and stifled in thy heart? Art not thou an anointed Priest, that hast declared and taught us the Holy Law, whereby we might learn how to love our Lord GOD with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our strength? If it be so that the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:32499:83"/>
service of God consists not in this, that we should love him whom he loveth, and die for his Covenant and Sanctuary together with his servants that be slain for the unity of the name of the Lord; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in standeth it then? Hast not thou oft-times taught and proved unto us, how that every man that dieth in the wars for the Lord, his Sanctuary, his people, and his Law, he is to be counted in the Lords lot, and made worthy to go unto the great Light, and shall not see everlasting darknesse? Art not thou that <hi>Joseph</hi> the Priest, that hast cryed so often in battel: I am <hi>Joseph</hi> the Priest, consecrated to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, that have vowed my life for the people of the Lord, his Sanctuary, and his Land? But now when thou hast yielded thy self unto them, and they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee despitefully, What wilt thou say unto them? or what amends canst thou have at their hands? I, put the case they cast in thy teeth, and say, thy words be lyes: How shalt thou avoid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? Art thou not he that said'st, that we should fight for the people of God, until we die in the conflict, and in so doing, death should be ransome for our sins: and that we were sure to go to that great Light, that is the light of life. Which if it be true according as thou hast said, Why then wilt thou shun death, and not follow thy people that are gone before thee to that same light? Ever hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thou hast had the upper hand wheresoever thou cam'st, insomuch that they that heard of thee, trembled for fear: and now wilt thou yield thy life to captivity to the <hi>Romans</hi> as a vile slave? Shall not this thy dishonour redound also to the people

of God? Thou art a Prince, a King, and a Priest, Wilt thou be bound in chains? Every man shall say, This is he that gave his souldiers, and the rest of the people to die, but saved himself, and his own life.</p>
               <p>So when they had made an end of talk, each man drew out his sword, and came to him in the midst of the Cave, saying: Hearest thou, <hi>Joseph</hi> our Prince? if thou wilt be ruled by us, first we shall slay thee as a Lord and a great Prince, and thou shalt chuse what death thou wilt die, that thou mayest die honourably. But if thou refuse to die honestly, assure thy self of this, we will every man set upon thee, and kill thee.</p>

                     <hi>Joseph</hi> answered, Indeed I know, my brethren, that your words are just and true; For who is so mad to desire to live in this hurly burly? and would God that he would call my soul unto him, and receive it unto him also. For I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that it were more expedient for me to die, then to live, for the great troubles that have passed through my heart; but he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the secrets of mens hearts, and it is he that giveth life unto men. It is our GOD that closeth souls within the bodies, and letteth them out again, because he is the living God, in whose hands remain the souls and spirits of all living creatures: He hath left with us the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life, and closed it up within our bodies. What is he that will open that he hath shut? How shall we loose that he would have knit fast with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us? Do ye not all know, how the life is a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:32499:84"/>
thing that he hath left us to keep, and that we are his servants? If then we cast away life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God take it, Shall he not worthily be displeased with us, so that we shall not find life in the place of the living with <hi>Abraham</hi> our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of famous memory, and with those just and godly men our forefathers? Do ye not know, that they went not unto God before they were called; and when they were called, they came? and so dealt God with all the holy and godly men. To <hi>Moses,</hi> our Master of worthy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the elect of God; ye know that the Lord God of <hi>Israel</hi> said, Get thee upon this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Abiram,</hi> and so he did; but he would not have done it of himself, had not God called him; whereby ye may see, it is not lawful for a man to surrender his life unto the Living GOD, except he require it again.</p>
                  <p>Take example I (pray you) of <hi>Job,</hi> what time he curst the day that he was born in. Might he not either have hanged himself, or have run upon a knife, or, at the least, have followed his wife's counsel, to curse God and die? Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he abode patiently in most extream pain, waiting till God demanded again his life, and then restored it unto his Lord God, and would not restore it undemanded, but tarried till his appointed time came. King <hi>David</hi> also of famous memory, said, Lead thou my life out of this pinfold and prison; For he knew that the life was inclosed in the body, and that none might let it forth but God: I wot well
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:32499:84"/>
that death is a great commodity, so that the soul may return in his due time, unto God that gave it us. I know it also, That he that dieth in the Wars of the Lord, he shall come to the great Light: But I know not what can appease Gods wrath, towards the soul of that man that killeth himself, and maketh haste to restore his soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, and without the Lords calling. Wherefore my friends, and my brethren, I would ye should know it, I am no more coward than you, and I do not disagree with you, because I am of a faint heart, for fear of these present ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities; but this I know, I should commit a hainous offence against the Lord, if I should kill my self. And how say ye (you Princes) that stick unto your God? to you I speak, Tell me, who shall make intercession unto God for us, if we should commit this sin, and each kill one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? Would not a man judge him a slave, a fool, a froward person, a rebel, and a desperate man, that should be forced with any misery, to be so mad, that because all things fall not out as he would wish, would therefore hang, or desperately murder himself with his own hand? Such ye know the law thus punisheth: Their right hand is cut off, wherewith they forced themselves to die, then they are left unburied, as men that have destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their own souls: By what reason then shall we kill our selves? I would wish that we might be slain of our enemies, rather than we should so shamefully murder ourselves, whereby ever after we should be taken for man-slayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:32499:85"/>
If any man kill himself, as <hi>Saul</hi> whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, without doubt he committeth a hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime, and such a one as no satisfaction can be made for: Besides that, he shall be reckoned faint-hearted, and as one that despaireth of his recovery: wherefore our fore-fathers have taught  us, <hi>A man ought not to despair of his safegard and deliverance, which cometh of God, no not when the knife is put to his throat to cut it.</hi> For King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> of famous memory, when he heard these  words of <hi>Esaias</hi> that worthy Prophet; <hi>Make thy Will, and set thy things in order, for thou shalt die, and not escape;</hi> Neverthelesse he fainted not, nor ceased not to pray to God, for the prolonging of his life in theworld, that he might amend his life, and send a better soul unto God. Then the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> seeing his unwearied and strong hope, with his repentance, suffered him to live fifteen years longer; But as for <hi>Saul,</hi> he was not appointed King over <hi>Israel</hi> after the  Lords mind, but only by the people that craved of <hi>Samuel; Give us a King to rule over us:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon afterward God departed from <hi>Saul,</hi> for he was not obedient to Gods will, but went about by force to establish his kingdom. The Lord then seeing the wickednesse of his heart, gave him over, and chose him another to be King over his people; anointing <hi>David</hi> his servant, whiles <hi>Saul</hi> was yet living; which <hi>Saul</hi> perceiving, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted <hi>David,</hi> and laboured with all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to destroy him, because he knew God was with him, and prospered all that he did;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:32499:85"/>
whereas contrarily, all went backward with himself.</p>
                  <p>For these causes I say, he chose rather to die than live; he also would not live after the people of Israel were overthrown in the Mountains of <hi>Gilboa.</hi> And, in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he slew himself for nothing but because he was a faint-hearted coward, and utterly despaired of his safegard. For although he said, <hi>Lest these uncircumcised come and run me through:</hi> Yet, if he had been of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>valiant courage, he would have stood to his defence to the death: Peradventure God would have delivered him: But he contrarily, all in despair, procured both himself, and his son, a shameful death.</p>
                  <p>But ye shall consider this, he was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful King, and therefore did God rid him out of the World. For as he did not spare his own life, nor his son's: so did he not spare others. And whereas ye alledge <hi>Aaron</hi> unto me, I would know of you, why he put himself between the living and the dead. Was it not because he would turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the plague from Israel? If he had known that he himself should have been stricken therewith, doubtlesse he would not have striven against the striker; but trusting in the holinesse of his righteousnesse, he stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angel to deliver Israel from that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery: Therefore I am not to be compared with <hi>Aaron,</hi> albeit I am one of his children,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:32499:86"/>
and never yet in all my life did I shrink to venture my life in the Wars of the Lord: And now I am not determined to kill my self, lest I should sin against God, and spoil my soul of hope of salvation: I know it well, and it were more expedient for me to be slain of mine enemies, then that I should kill my self. And if ye say the word, Let us go forth, and suddenly set upon our enemies to kill, or to be killed, in this battel of the Lord, and so shall we do well: peradventure God will give them into our hands; <hi>For God is able to save as well by a small Army, as by a great.</hi> Then if ye see me to be afraid of mine enemies sword, ye shall thereby know me to be a coward, and one that fawneth upon his enemies, and hunteth for their favour; But ye shall see me go before you, as a valiant man, nor once to turn my face from death. What did ye ever see in me, that you should judge me fearful? Did ye ever know me refuse to fight? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town of <hi>Jorpata</hi> I have ever kept my quarter and ward, and every day have I fought with mine enemies, whom I have not spared, but impaired; and that not a little, whiles I defended that little City forty eight daves against them. For I thought with my self, peradventure I may drive away the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Lord out of our Land, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them from Jerusalem, that they go not thither. And so have I fought with them, till all my valiant souldiers be spent, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:32499:86"/>
none left but you; I could no longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their force, yet I would not yeild my self as a prisoner unto them, therefore I fled hither with you into this Cave. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Brethren, ye shall understand, that death is commodious and good indeed, which comes in time: But it is neither good nor godly, for a man to kill himself and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to go afterward for that deed into hell and perdition. And what other thing can more clearly set forth a mans proud, and haughty mind, with his hope in God, than for a man to suffer patiently, whatsoever chanceth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, until his end come? Behold the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and other Beasts, how they are wont to withstand their enemies that lie in wait for them, to the intent they may save their lives, whose armour is in their teeth and claws, wherewith neverthelesse they hurt not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but use them against other that assault them, till they either overc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We, although we have no warlike Weapons, yet have Nature armed us as well as them: For albeit we be not of such strength as they, yet hath we such armour, that we may defend our selves therewith, both from man and beast; But how can we break the band of love one to another that proceedeth from God, who hath chosen us his people and inheritance to sanctifie him? How then may we be enemies one against another, and kill one another? If that be true, as ye cannot
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:32499:87"/>
deny it, that although we be many thousands, yet we are counted as one soul, and members of one body: Then how can any man ever find in his heart to strike his own eyes or feet, or any other of his members to destroy it, except he be mad, and besides himself? Moreover, dear Brethren and Friends, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider to what end the Master of a ship doth abide the tempest of the Seas, and striveth day and night with the floods thereof? Doth he not do it to save the Ship, and his life from death? If so it be, he sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>uld willingly for the same purpose put himself in jeopardy of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, or run on Rocks, Would not the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-men say; See yonder desperate fellow that destroyeth himself, his Ship, with the the Merchants, and their riches? Suppose an earthly King should give his officers to keep certain precious Jewels: Were it not convenient that they should keep them till such time as he should call for them again? If they should at their pleasure cast them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before the King call for them, Shall they not move him to anger? And if a man come into the presence of the King uncalled, Will not the King check him, and say unto him, What dost thou here before I call thee? So now, all the souls of Israel are the Lords, who hath bestowed them unto men according to his mercy and good pleasure, who also will receive them again when it pleaseth him; and when his time is come, every soul shall
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:32499:87"/>
depart unto his place of rest. Therefore if a man will with his own hands, let forth his soul out of his body before his time, God will not receive it, neither shall it find any rest, but be destroyed, and why? Because it is expulsed, and thrust out of his place before his time, and before God do call for it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it shall wander inconstantly for ever. Why then (my dear Brethren and Friends) do you advise us to kill one another, and to expell and banish our souls from us, they being not call'd for? How can we put away this opprobry? How can we make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for this sin? Who shall pray and make intercession for us? And with this <hi>Joseph</hi> wept abundantly, insomuch that they laught him to scorn.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> Joseph <hi>held up his hands to heaven,  saying.</hi> Thou Lord Almighty art our Father, thou hast formed us, and by thy great mercy taken us out of the clay: thou art he that leadest us in thy faith, and the multitude of thy mercies and benignities towards us hath not ceased.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, we are thy handy-work every one of us, and a long time have we been called thy people. Thou art Lord over all creatures and souls. Thou dost what thou wilt, and none dare say to thee, Why dost thou so? Thou art our Father, we are clay, thou hast given us our shape and fashion; therefore if it please thee to take our souls, take them by the hands of thine Angels, that we commit
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:32499:88"/>
no evil against them. And if these my fellows that be present with me will not be partakers of my prayer; behold my life alone, for the which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thy benign clemency, if it please thee take it, for thou gavest it me, therefore do with it whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it shall seem good unto thee: It is in thine hands, thou lendest it me, and hast preserved it within me: I will not destroy it my self, or let it out of my prison, before thou demand it; for thou knowest, that as man cannot live without thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and appointment, so likewise he cannot die without the same. Vnto thee therefore do I lift mine eyes, thou that dwellest in Heaven, to deal mercifully with thy servants, and with me, to turn our hearts that we consent not unto this, to murder our selves: If thou know any among them, that intend so wicked an Act, I beseech thee, O Lord my God, let me find favour in thine eyes; give them an heart to hear wholesome counsel, that I may deliver my self and mine own life, which I commend into thine hands, that thou wouldest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it unto thee, for in thy hand is the life of every living creature.</p>
               <p>Thus when <hi>Joseph</hi> had finished his prayer, he turned him unto his fellows, and saluted them; Then said they, Thinkest thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to move our minds, because thou hast pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto God for thy self, and for us? Did not we tell thee ere while, like as we tell thee now, that we are determined to die by one means or other? wherefore say thy mind, and tell us by w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:32499:88"/>
ever known thee a just man, and a worthy Prince, therefore art thou worthy to die first. <hi>Joseph</hi> perceiving his fellows were utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to die, and would give none ear to his perswasions, for he could by no reasons draw them to his opinion, he went subtilly to work with them on this wise; Seeing it will be none otherwise, Brethren (quoth he) I will shew you my advice: Ye are determined to die, ye say, and that upon your own swords, therefore there is no better way, than to do it by lot in this wise: Let us cast lots amongst our selves, that we may be joyned together by couples, then will we cast lots which couple shall die first; afterwards they two shall cast lots betwen them, which of them shall kill his fellow; he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth shall choose him one of the second couple to kill him; likewise the second couple shall cast lots between themselves, who shall die first, and he that is left shall choose him one of the third couple, whom he hath a fancy to be killed of: then they shall try by lot who shall die first, who being slain, the other may choose him one of the fourth couple to kill him, and so even till all be slain, that we see not the captivity of our people: The last couple that remain shall do thus; Run one upon the others sword, or else let them cast lots between themselves, and upon whom it falleth, let him die first: But forasmuch as we are forty and one, so that we cannot be justly joyned in couples; let us cast lots first of all, and see
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:32499:89"/>
which of us shall first be slain, and when he is once out of the way, then let us divide the couples: He that is to be slain first, let him choose one of the first couple, and cast lots, and do as I have devised. Then every man liked his device (which was Gods doing who heard <hi>Josephs</hi> prayer) and said all with one mouth, We will do as thou hast advised, and to thee it appertaineth to divide the men, and to cast the lots; <hi>Joseph</hi> answered, But let us swear by the name of the Lord, that this device shall stand, be ratified, and performed; whereunto they accorded, and sware all by the name of the Lord, that they would have this device to be ratified and kept, which <hi>Joseph</hi> had inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by casting of lots. Then <hi>Joseph</hi> cast lots, who should be the odde man, and it fell upon <hi>Jehojada,</hi> the son of <hi>Eliakim,</hi> a <hi>Galilean,</hi> which was a valiant man, and chiefest in every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel next to <hi>Joseph,</hi> and the principal perswader of this wicked fact to kill themselves; After that, did he craftily divide them into couples, so that the lot of his own couple came forth last of all, who looked to be saved, and trusted in God, believing that he would deliver him from this abominable deed.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Jehojada</hi> chose him one of the first c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>uple, who slew him; That done, the first couple cast lots, between them, so the one killed his fellow, and chose him one of the second couple to kill him; Then they of the second couple, cast lots between themselves in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:32499:89"/>
of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and the one killed the other; then he that remained, chose him one of the third couple to slay him; And in this manner did they all, till they were all slain, and none left alive, but <hi>Joseph</hi> and his fellow, who said unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> Go to, let us cast lots, that we may go to our Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joseph</hi> answered, We will do so if thou be so disposed; but first hear me, I pray thee, speak a few things in thy ears; Tell me, Have not these sinners rebelled against God, in this murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselves so shamefully? neither could I by any means disswade them, nor divert them from this opinion; Wherefore should we two fin against God so grievously, and against our own souls? If the lot should so fall that I should kill thee, I should be counted a man-slayer, and that worthily; and it may so chance I shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape after thee, and save my life; but if the lot should so fall, that thou shouldest slay me, thou should'st be taken also for a murderer, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure thou should'st not escape after me; yea, although thou thinkest that thou may est: But assure thy self of this, we lose our hope in God, in as much as we sin against our own souls. For all these men that thou seest here dead, Lo, they have sinned against their own souls, dying without discipline and good order. If thou wilt say, How shall we do by reason of the oath that we have sworn? Dost thou not know, that he that breaketh a wicked oath, doth nothing wickedly himself therein? For a man is not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:32499:90"/>
constrained to perform any oath unto God, but to the keeping of his Laws; and hereupon is it that <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I have sworn, and will perform;</hi> for neither vow nor oath that is made against the Commandments of God, can be ratified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. And what more is, before we swear, our fathers sware first long ago, at the Mount of <hi>Sinai,</hi> that they and their children should keep the Law of the Lord. <hi>Moses</hi> also made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them upon the same, and not only with them that were there, but also with us. How then dare we be so bold to swear, to break the Law of God, and become man-killers? Seeing it is one of the ten Commandments expresly, <hi>Thou shalt not kill.</hi> Wherefore my Brother, thou shalt understand, that we need not be solicitous, nor careful for the oath that we have made, but rather to break it, for God will never be displeased with us for that: For I being afraid of these wicked persons that lie now here dead, invented this subtile means and way to swear, that I might save my life: Now therefore, my Brother, if thou wilt be ruled by mine advice, thou shalt save thy life and mine, and I will cast no lots, nor perform the oath that we made, which is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

him, but said: Lo, I am content, do what thou thinkest good, because thou art a man of God. And blessed be the Lord God of Israel that hath not withdrawn his mercy from me, but made me to be in thy lot, whereby my soul is saved from going to hell: Thy lot is a just lot: <hi>For the Lord will not leave the scourge of sinners, upon the lot of the just.</hi> Much besides this spake <hi>Josephs</hi> Companion to him, for he was sore afraid of him, lest he should have killed him, if they had encountred together; for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> was a better man of his hands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Joseph</hi> chose him into his lot, that he might be able to make his party good with him. In this point <hi>Joseph</hi> played the wise mans part, for he escaped by this means, both from the hands of those wicked fools, and also from his fellow. Therefore <hi>Joseph</hi> called out of the Cave to Captain <hi>Nicanor,</hi> and said to him in this wise: Wilt thou promise me, that neither thou, nor any of thy men that be here with thee, or in the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp, shall kill us, before thou hast brought us unto <hi>Vespasian?</hi> and let him do with us as he thinketh good. <hi>Nicanor</hi> answered: So, and so, deal God with me, if I fulfil not thy request, if so be thou wilt come forth unto me, together with the men that thou hast with thee. <hi>Joseph</hi> answered him, I will come forth to thee, and so many more of us as be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: for it is come to passe, that some of us be dead in the Cave, wherefore, how can they come forth? Then said <hi>Nicanor,</hi> Never think
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:32499:91"/>
(friend <hi>Joseph</hi>) that I come to deceive thee, Come forth and trust in thy GOD, for thou needest not to fear. <hi>Joseph</hi> said: Swear unto me this, by the God of Israel, although he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to thee. <hi>Nicanor</hi> answered, I swear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee by that God that made the World by his wisdom, that thou needest not to fear me, but boldly mayest come forth unto me. So <hi>Nicanor</hi> made a covenant with <hi>Joseph</hi> and his fellow, confirming and ratifying it in writing, after the manner of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and reaching it into the Cave upon a spear, holding the point of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>pear in his own hand. <hi>Joseph</hi> took the writing, read it, and believed <hi>Nicanor:</hi> Then came he forth to <hi>Nicanor,</hi> and his fellow with him.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Nicanor</hi> sitting upon his seat of State that was made him in the wood nigh to the Cave, saw <hi>Joseph</hi> come toward him, he rose up, and embracing him, kissed him, set him on his right hand, and wept with him abundantly: he honoured his fellow also, placing him between <hi>Pollerinus</hi> and <hi>Gallicanus,</hi> whom he had then present with him. Then <hi>Nicanor</hi> asked him for the rest of the men that were with him, desiring that they should come forth, and he would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them also, and do them no harm. <hi>Joseph</hi> declared the whole matter unto him, and told him what was become of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicanor</hi> hearing of the pertinacious stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Jews hearts, and their wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, was wonderful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:32499:91"/>
and went from thence, with <hi>Joseph</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion unto <hi>Vespasian.</hi> When the <hi>Roman</hi> Army saw <hi>Joseph,</hi> they were greatly astonied, and gave a mighty shout; some rejoyced that <hi>Joseph</hi> was taken, saying, This is good luck, that our eyes shall see our long expected desire. Other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and let tears fall from their eyes with pensive hearts, saying, Is not this that worthy man who made all the <hi>Roman</hi> host to quake for fear, and whose fame and renown was known throughout all Lands? How is it come to pass that so mighty a man is taken in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and amongst his own people? If this chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth unto such a man, to be taken in his own Land, in the midst of his families and friends; How shall we escape in a strange Land? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evil disposed persons of the <hi>Roman</hi> soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, went to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and said, Sir, you shall do well to command this man to be slain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, that hath been the destruction of so many of the people of the <hi>Romans.</hi> This is the very same, that shot the arrow and stuck you in the leg; Put him to death, and then shall ye be sure he shall never move war more amongst you. If ye do not, ye shall see him one day again raise an Army against us, and destroy us. But <hi>Joseph</hi> did find friendship at <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi> son's hands, which came of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Therefore when he heard those wicked mens words, that desired <hi>Vespasian</hi> to put <hi>Joseph</hi> to death, he disapproved their advice, and partly in mockage he taunted them, saying, Will you
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:32499:92"/>
tell my Father what he hath to do? will you give him so wicked counsel, to kill that man that yieldeth himself to us, upon the trust of our league and band of friendship, which you now go about to break and frustrate? Did not Captain <hi>Nicanor</hi> in my fathers name and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars,</hi> with all the <hi>Roman</hi> host, make a Covenant with him? Take heed what you say: Is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to break the <hi>Caesarean</hi> fidelity? Moreover, who can tell whether it may so happen, that some of us be taken by the Jews, like as <hi>Joseph</hi> is prisoner herc with us? VVhen <hi>Vespasian</hi> heard his sons words, it pleased him, and he spared <hi>Joseph,</hi> not suffering him to be slain, but committed him to a certain Captain of his, and carried him about with him through the Cities, together with King <hi>Agrippa.</hi> After this <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> removed his Camp to <hi>Thalmida,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is called <hi>Acho,</hi> and from thence he went to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> a great City.</p>
               <p>When they of the City saw <hi>Joseph,</hi> they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto <hi>Vespasian,</hi> Kill him, kill him, or else he will one day be an occasion to stir great wars against thee. But <hi>Vespasian</hi> gave no ear to them. Whiles he was at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> tidings came to him, that the Citizens of <hi>Papho</hi> invaded and spoiled the Isles that were subject under his Dominions with a Navy. <hi>Vespasian</hi> hearing thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to lay wait for them, that they might be met withal. So there was an ambush laid wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:32499:92"/>
                  <hi>Vespasian</hi> entred the Town and took it without great resistance, because their souldiers were absent.</p>
               <p>When the Rovers therefore returned with their Navy, and saw the <hi>Romans</hi> in the City, they laboured to set a land; but suddenly a huge tempest, and a mighty storm, drove all their ships against the rocks that were in the sea shore, (for there was no haven for ships) and there they were lost many of them, and those that swam to land the <hi>Romans</hi> slew: they that were drowned in the Sea, and slain by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> were in number four thousand good men of War, besides them that were slain in the Town 40000. all <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, <hi>Vespasian</hi> set forth <hi>Valericus</hi> and <hi>Taribus,</hi> two Roman Colonels, with his son <hi>Titus,</hi> who went, besieged, and wan the Towns of defence that were in <hi>Galilee;</hi> And thus did <hi>Titus</hi> use them, They that yielded unto him, he saved their lives; and whosoever withstood him, he slew.

                  <hi>VEspasian</hi> departing thence, took his journey to <hi>Gamala,</hi> which is a Citie upon the top of a Mountain; the name thereof is called <hi>Gamala,</hi> of an Hebrew word <hi>Gamal,</hi> that signifieth to Requite, or to do a good turn, because it is the best City that belongeth to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof were all very rich. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty also, called <hi>Seleucia,</hi> was not far distant from it, a Countrey replenished with good Towns, Gardens, Brookes, and all kinde of fruitfull Trees; <hi>Agrippa</hi> besought <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian</hi> that he would not destroy this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Let me go first (saith he) and offer them peace, peradventure they will take it, that they may save their lives from destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; <hi>Vespasian</hi> was entreated, saying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Go and do as thou wilt, for thine honour's sake I will do so much for thee. So <hi>Agrippa</hi> went to them, and spake friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and peaceably unto them, and they received him in like manner, but they meant deceit, saying; Thou art our Lord and King, to whom therefore doth all

that is of any price, or to be desired in all Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael belong but unto thee? Therefore come near unto us, and debate the matter with thy Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agrippa</hi> crediting these Words, came close up to the City, and as he listned to them that talked with him, one cast a great stone from the Wall, which lighted just between his shoulders; with such a violence, that it struck him prostrate to the ground, and brake his back, with one of his arms also. But his Servants stept to him, took him up, and carried him to <hi>Vespasian;</hi> who seeing him so sore hurt, sware he would never go from thence, till he had taken the City, and ordered them in like manner as he did at <hi>Tiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> to leave not a man therein. The Roman Physicians did bestow such diligence about <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that they cured him.</p>

                  <hi>Vespasian</hi> in his rage against the <hi>Seleucians,</hi> because they had wounded their King, besieged and assaulted them. The Jews within the Town encouraged one another, saying, Let us stick to it now, and play the men, for we have no other hope to save our lives, seeing we have thus used the King. Certain stout men of them therefore issued out, and encountring with the <hi>Romans,</hi> made a great slaughter amongst them. After that, the <hi>Romans</hi> made ready their Engins, planted their battering Rams, playing with them against the Walls; and by that time night came, beat so great a part thereof down to the earth, that <hi>Vespasian</hi> and much people with him

might enter at their pleasure. But <hi>Vespasian</hi> gave commandment to his Army, that they should not enter that night into the Town, but stand and compasse the walls until the morrow, that they might the better see how to win it. Notwithstanding, they would not be ruled by him, but entred. Then the <hi>Jews</hi> came upon them, drew the chains crosse their streets, and closing the wayes of the City, intrapped them in such sort, that they could go neither one way nor other. After that, sett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But <hi>Vespasian</hi> and his, fled to the Mountains, that he might be there in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: and from thence he sent to <hi>Titus</hi> his son that was in <hi>Syria,</hi> for the <hi>Roman</hi> Army that he had sent with him to <hi>Persia,</hi> which <hi>Titus</hi> led into <hi>Jury.</hi>

               <p>Shortly after, <hi>Vespasian</hi> gathered souldiers, and, repairing his Army, joyned with <hi>Agrippa's</hi> company, and returning to <hi>Seleucia,</hi> wan it, and slew every man, leaving none alive: and afterward going again to the Cities of <hi>Galilee,</hi> took them, serving them in like sort. After that, he came to the City called <hi>Nascela,</hi> which was a walled Town, and of all the Towns of defence throughout all <hi>Galilee,</hi> none left but it.</p>
               <p>This he besieged, because thither resorted

many cut-throats and wicked persons, without the fear of God, such as were robbers and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Land of <hi>Judea.</hi> Amongst whom was a certain man named <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> learned, wise, and prudent, especially to do mischief; a witty Counsellour, and of such eloquence; that he could perswade cunningly, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men from that they had purposed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, he was a murtherer, ready to shed blood, and to do any mischief; a great robber, and one that ever gaped for other mens goods, by which means he was become very rich: wherefore there resorted unto him all vain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons man-slayers, rebells, and ruffians like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self giving them large rewards, that they might be of his fraternity, his brethren, and adherents, and he to be their head. <hi>Titus</hi> was sent to this City by his Father, to offer them conditions of peace; whither when he was come, he sent his Emba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:32499:95"/>
and the third day we wil give him answer; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Titus</hi> was content, and deferred the assault for two dayes. These things were done on Whit-sun-even, which was called the Feast of weeks, and harvest. The night afore the third day appointed was come, <hi>Jehochanan</hi> and his complices gat out of the Town, and fled toward <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> ere <hi>Titus</hi> knew thereof: On the morrow he sent his Embassadors to demand their answer, what they would do; They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, we desire to enter into a league with you, for we are yours, and submit our selves to your pleasure, upon the condition, that none of the <hi>Romans</hi> hurt us, either in our bodies or goods. <hi>Titus</hi> upon this made peace with them, confirming it by Writing sealed, for the better assurance thereof. So they opened the gates, and <hi>Titus</hi> came into the Town with his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the Jews received him with great joy, honouring him very much.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Titus</hi> enquired for <hi>Jehochanan</hi> and his confederates. The Citizens declared unto him, how he fled by night with all his unto <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: Titus</hi> hearing that, sent after to pursue him, yet they found him not, he had made such speed. Notwithstanding, many of the people that went out of the Town with him, that they might escape the danger, both men, women, and children, old and impotent persons they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, slew them every one, and returned with a great spoil. After this, <hi>Titus</hi> won all the Cities in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and set Rulers in them. Then <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:32499:95"/>
dislodged from hence, and came to the Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> which hath snow on it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; the height thereof is thirty furlongs, and upon the top is a plain twenty three furlongs long: Thither sent <hi>Vespasian</hi> one of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains called <hi>Palgorus,</hi> which took the Mountain, and the Town that stood thereon.</p>

Then <hi>Anani</hi> beset the Temple round about with 6000. of the choisest and ablest men of the people, well armed all of them with jackes and sallets, and as well weapon'd, with every man a sword, a target, and a spear or pike, to keep the Temple, that they should not come forth. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Anani</hi> cast in his mind, that besides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading them in the Temple, which were nowaies seemly, it should also be as great a damage, if the people of the Lord should assault one another in that place. For these causes, he sent Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to <hi>Jehochanan</hi> the <hi>Galilean,</hi> chief Captain of the seditious and thieves, offering him peace; but <hi>Jehochanan</hi> refused it: For the seditious had sent for the <hi>Edomites</hi> to come and aid them. The <hi>Edomites</hi> had been ever from their first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning very valiant and warlike-men, yet they were subject to the <hi>Jews.</hi> For <hi>Hircanus</hi> King of <hi>Juda</hi> had conquered them, and caused them to be circumcised, binding such of them as were the best Warriours to this service, to stand in arms, and keep watch and ward upon the walls of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> day and night, and the rest of them to pay tribute to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon a certain night came two and twenty thousand of these <hi>Edomites,</hi> all good men of War, against <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> When <hi>Anani</hi> the Priest, and the people that were with him, heard the noise of the <hi>Edomites</hi> Army, he went upon the walls, and demanded of them what they were, from whence they came, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would? They answered, We are
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:32499:97"/>
               <hi>Edomites,</hi> and came out of <hi>Idumea,</hi> to visit the Lord God and his Temple, and to see in what case his people standeth: for thus we come ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our accustomed manner as ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. <hi>Anani</hi> answered, You are dissemblers, and not as your words do shew, neither come ye to seek God and his Sanctuary, nor yet to aid his people, but rather to the supporting of <hi>Jehochanan</hi> grand Captain of Thieves. Were it not better for you to assist the Sanctuary of God, than these sinfull seditious persons, that covet nothing els then to lay waste the House of God, and to destroy his People? They in the most holy City of God, do shed the blood of Just, Godly, and Innocent men; through whose wickedness the <hi>Romans</hi> have the upper hand of us, because we have civil wars at home with the Seditious, and external with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Yea, the wickedness of the Seditious is grown so far, that the most part of us had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be slain by the <hi>Romans,</hi> than of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the <hi>Jews.</hi> If so be ye be come to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, ye shall understand that ye offend our Lord God exceedingly, to help sinners and murtherers, that tread the people of God under their feet, like as men tread grapes in a wine-press, and make the Temple of the Lord a dwelling-place of man-killers and wicked persons. Ye say, Ye come to seek the Lord: how is it then that ye are thus in Arms, after the manner of war? Ye shall understand, we shut not the gates of the Town because of you,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:32499:98"/>
lest ye should come in, after your accustomed manner: but because of your armour and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons that you have with you, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The <hi>Edomites</hi> answered, We marvell not a little at thee which art the high Priest, our Lord and mediator, and at the rest of the Priests of the Lord, with the Elders and Judges of the people that be present with thee; and your wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand you take us for your enemies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you stop us of our entrance into the City, to visit the Lord God after our accustomed manner. In that we be armed as ye object un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us? Do ye not know that <hi>Vespasian</hi> draweth nigh to come to this holy City? This we hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of, was the cause that we took our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons with us, to come to ayd you, and keep the Town, as we have been wont these many years. But how should ye gather this, that we come to support the wicked and seditious that be with you: when as from the first day that ever we and our fathers were circumcised, we never swarved f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

God forbid we should do this, for we all both that be here, and the other <hi>Edomites</hi> also, be servants of the Lord and his people, to maintain and defend the Law, the people, and the house of the Lord. Whiles they were thus talking together, there arose up a great cloud, and lightnings were seen with fire, and darkness with mighty thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>claps, and showers of hail, that all that saw it were wonderfully afraid. Wherefore the people fled wholly; left not only the walls, but <hi>Anani</hi> also: for they could not abide to tarry any longer. But <hi>Anani</hi> took heart unto him, and abode it, to mark those horrible signs of heaven which did appear, that he might judge what they betokened.</p>

            <p>And he gave his Judgment indeed (but not according to the truth) that the thunder and hail with darkness, signified Gods help, by the hope whereof they should defend the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

of the Lord. So likewise judged all the Elders that were with him, without perceiving that all these signs betokened the evils that should come upon <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and all <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they that were shut in the Temple, perceived that they that kept the Watch before the gate of the Temple, were fled also for fear of the tempest, they went and opened the doors of the Temple, and in that darkness, which although it was so great, that one could not see another for the thickness thereof, neither durst any of the Town once look out of his doors (they were so afraid of those terrible signs of the Element) yet came those desperate fellows, the Seditious out of the Temple, drew toward the walls without all fear, with saws and other instruments, to cut asunder the barrs of the gates. And when the crashing of the thunder and hail was greatest, then labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they hardest, in wresting asunder the locks and bolts of the gates, lest they should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. And ever when the thunder clap was past then stayed they and left off till it came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Thus plaid they till they had broken and opened the gates, and let the <hi>Edomites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City: who being once come in, wandred here and there, for that night, devising how they might set upon the Citizens of the Town, and utterly destroy them.</p>
            <p>They call'd out first their confederates, that remained in the Temple, brought them thence, and joyned together with the <hi>Edomites,</hi> swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

one to another, that they should be one people and one Army. And forthwith, being so confed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the morning they laid hands on the rich men, haled them before the Judges, and lxx. Elders, which otherwise is called <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim,</hi> whom they called together: And there wicked <hi>Jehochanan</hi> the <hi>Galilean,</hi> spake unto them in this wise.</p>
            <p>Why condemn ye not these rich Cobs, that have made a conspiracy with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and determine to betray this holy City i to their hands? namely, one <hi>Sechariahu</hi> a just man, a perfect, godly, and vertuous, one that feared the Lord, and loved both God and man; but for his riches only which were great, this <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan</hi> (Captain of the Seditious) appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him, willing the Elders to condemn him to death, for that he had joyned with their enemies, (as he said) to betray the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them. The Priests, Elders, and Judges hearing his words, and perceiving that both he and the rest of his bloody band, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing else than to make this man away, although they knew him to be most innocent, they wept and fighed greatly: <hi>Jehochanan</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them weep for <hi>Sechariahu,</hi> and that they would not condemn him, respecting his justice and integrity; What, quoth he, do you begin to mourn before there be any corpse present?

their hearts he would force them to retire; and by that means his body was full of skars, his face and head wonderfully mangled with the wounds that he had received in the battels, that he had been in for the people of the Lord; yet now because he would not follow the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous mind of <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> and take his part, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan</hi> commanded him to be apprehended, and brought before him, and when he was come, said thus unto him; Make thy Will, and set thy house in order, and confess thy self unto the Lord, for there is no way with thee but death: And so they led him out of the Town to kill him there, lest there should be any business about his death, if he had been put to death within the Town; for all the Citizens of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> loved him, and he likewise loved them. When they were come to the place of execution, <hi>Gorinian</hi> fell down before them, and besought them with tears in this wise; Seeing ye have so determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that ye will needs slay me, when as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I have committed no crime, nor any offence, and that ye will in no wise spare me although I be innocent, as you know well enough your selves; yet I beseech you, let me obtain this one thing at your hands, that you would do so much at least wise at my request, as to bury my body; other favour I desire not. They made him answer, If thou hadst not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us thereof, we had thought to have done it, for so we were determined with our selves; but now, seeing thou art so bold as to demand this of us, we will slay thee, but buriall
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:32499:101"/>
gettest thou none; thy body shall be cast forth unto the beasts of the earth, and fowls of the ayre. <hi>Gorinion</hi> yet besought them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, untill the most cruell <hi>Jehochanan</hi> struck him, and slew him, and after threw out his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the beasts of the field; This done, they returned into the City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vespasian</hi> in the mean season drew nigh to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem;</hi> for he had pitched his tents at <hi>Cesarea,</hi> where he relieved his army, and paid his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers great wages, wherefore they tarried in the City many daies: For when <hi>Vespasian</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the wars in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he said unto his people, Let us make no haste to besiege <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> till such time as they have slain one another among themselves, and so at length their pride will be pulled down, when as they see themselves waste away with cruell war, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and thirst. For <hi>Vespasian</hi> was a wonderfull politick man in all feats of war, and his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom never turned him to more commodity, than by this device only. So he sojourned at <hi>Cesarea,</hi> with his men many daies: In the mean season, the people of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> made war upon <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> and his complices, till innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable of them were destroyed. Some of them were slain with swords, some the Seditious kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with short daggers. For certain of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious carried short daggers secretly under their garments, wherewith they would come so suddenly upon an honest and just man, and thrust him to the heart, that he should fall down
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:32499:102"/>
dead in the place, without knowledge who struck him: So by this means what with swords in open fraies, and what with daggers secretly, many of the people were slain, and far more that way than by the <hi>Romans,</hi> insomuch that now very few Citizens were left alive. Thus when <hi>Jehochanan</hi> had gotten the upper hand of the City, he sent an Army out of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to go and take the Cities that had made peace with <hi>Vespasian,</hi> which they sacked and razed to the ground, and whomsoever they found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> they slew: Yea, <hi>Jehocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> went with them himself, spoyling and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away all the riches that they found in them. They took also the City <hi>Gerara,</hi> that stood beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> whereas they remained. The inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> both Priests, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the rest of the people, sent Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> to desire peace of him, and succour against <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> and his wicked rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which daily in the Town slew very many of the people of God. The Citizens also of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> sent Embassadours unto <hi>Vespasian,</hi> saying; If thou wilt be Lord over the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and desirest to assure the rule thereof, and establish it unto thee, then hearken unto our counsell, and come unto us without delay, to deliver us from the hands of <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> and the wicked seditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that with all their might endeavour to spoyl all our goods, and to get the dominion over us, our wives, and children, to none other
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:32499:102"/>
purpose, than by that means to destroy us ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, that no remnant of us should be left. If so be thou wilt come, and valiantly withstand them with thy power, we will also fight against them in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Town, till they be all slain, and then thou shalt be our Lord; And that done, thou mayest go to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> without any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, or hinderance of any man; for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of that City desire the same, and would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become subjects unto the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When as therefore <hi>Vespasian</hi> heard the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Citizens of <hi>Gerara,</hi> he took his journey thither to succour them, and deferred to go to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But <hi>Jehochanan</hi> heard of his repair, wherefore he slew the chief Governour of <hi>Gerara,</hi> and got him out of the Town with his companions, and took them to their feet, determining to flee into a certain wood: <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> having knowledge thereof, made after them, sending out <hi>Poligorus,</hi> who overtook them, and made a great slaughter of them And in his return toward <hi>Gerara,</hi> upon <hi>Jordan</hi> side, he light upon much people going to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that they might escape together with the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Them <hi>Poligorus</hi> drove back to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, where he slew 13. thousand of them; the rest leaped into <hi>Jordan,</hi> and were drowned, to the number of 91. thousand men, women, and children, with much Cattell that were all drowned together in the River, insomuch that the channell of <hi>Jordan</hi> was so stuffed, and stopt with dead bodies, that the waters rose
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:32499:103"/>
and ran over the banks here and there into the fields, and plains: yet at the length the waters increased, and bare the carkases down the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as far as the sea of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which is the sea of Pitch, otherwise called the salt-Sea; and all the banks of <hi>Jordan</hi> lay full of dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Vespasian</hi> took his journey from thence, and went into the land of <hi>Edom,</hi> where he won two strong Cities, the one called <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith,</hi> the other <hi>Cephar Toco,</hi> and slew ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of the people thereof, leading the rest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in bondage. Thence he dislodged, and came to a Town call'd <hi>Chamath Gedi,</hi> which he subdued. In this City were wel-springs of hot waters, from whence the hot baths of <hi>Tiberias</hi> have their Originall. The natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Astronomers of that Country, held an opinion that these are the heads of all the hot Wel-springs in that whole Country. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from thence, he came to <hi>Samaria</hi> and won it.</p>
            <p>Then repaired he again all the Towns that he had subdued, and made up their walls, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Garrisons therein, to ayd him, what time he should besiege <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> That done, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Cesarea,</hi> to take muster of his whole Army, and prepared to go to besiege <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the mean season, came Messengers from <hi>Rome,</hi> and brought him word that <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour was dead, and how that as he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:32499:103"/>
was a hunting in the Country, the fire of the Lord came down from heaven, and fell upon him, that he died of it.</p>
            <p>After whom reigned <hi>Galba,</hi> not one whole year: for, afore it was fully ended, he was slain by the noble men of <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his stead, a fool, yet a sore cruel man, much given to Drunkenness, so that he was in all points unworthy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>The Noble men of <hi>Rome</hi> that were with <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian</hi> hearing this, greatly disdained at that matter, and said, Was there never a Noble man in <hi>Rome</hi> left, to be placed in the Empire, but ye must choose a drunken wine-sucker? why did ye not rather elect the mighty Prince <hi>Vespasian</hi> that is here with us, a Sage and a Wise man, thereto also most valiant, one that conquered many Cities, and vanquished many Nations, and those most fierce? What puissant Kings hath he subdued under the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? How far and wide hath he enlarged the Empire of the <hi>Romans?</hi> And now when as the Empire ought to have been bestowed upon <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian,</hi> or some one like unto him, and none such could be found amongst you, ye bestow it upon a fool, and a blowbole drunkard, wherein ye have done very undiscreetly. Well, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Rome</hi> shall have a better Emperour one day, and God say Amen.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Princes that were there, laid their heads together, and decreed to make <hi>Vespasian</hi> Emperour. Therefore with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

they went unto <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and said unto him, Thou shalt be our head, for the Empire belongeth to such a one, and thou shalt have Dominion over us. But <hi>Vespasian</hi> refused to take it on him, and would in no wise consent to them. Notwithstanding they compelled him, and placed him upon the Throne of Majesty, setting an Imperiall Crown upon his head, which he would have put away, and pulled off with his hand because he would not be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Wherefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains drew out their swords and said, Thou shalt be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and reign over us, therefore refuse it not: if thou do, thou shalt dy upon our swords. <hi>Vespasian</hi> therefore seeing himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, being afraid of his life, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to suffer himself to be proclaimed Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Then all the Army was sworn unto him, and he sate upon the royall seat, as Emperour and King of Kings.</p>
            <p>The civil wars at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> encreased more and more, and much blood was shed through the wickedness of <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> Captain of the theeves, a limb of the divel, and through the cut-throat murtherers that were with him, who had all even sworn the utter destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the City of the Lord, and the deaths of the people.</p>
            <p>There was also another cut-throat <hi>Ruffian,</hi> of a noble house of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> about the same time, called <hi>Schimeon,</hi> who began also to follow <hi>Jehochanans</hi> manners in slaying

innocents, and robbing and raving in <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> For <hi>Anani</hi> the High Priest had once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him Prince and chief Captain of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:</hi> and afterwards finding him an enemy, banished him the City.

Shall I that have been in such estate, now be cast out of my dignity, and be constrained to wander here and there as a banished man? He went therefore through all the Cities of <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Galilee,</hi> causing to be proclaimed in the streets and market places, and sent his letters where he could not come himself, in this manner and form: <hi>Whosoever listeth to be rid from the bondage of his master, or hath had any injury in his Country, or what servant soever desireth to be set at liberty, or who so cannot abide the rule of his Father or Master; all that be in debt, and stand in fear of their Creditors, or fear the Iews for shedding any innocent blood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lurketh solitarily in woods or mountains, if there be any man that is accused of any notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crime, and in any danger therefore; To be short, whosoever is disposed to rob and to do injury and wrong, to haunt whores, to steal, to murther, to eat and drink at other mens cost,</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:32499:105"/>
               <hi>without labour of his hands, let him resort to me, I will deliver him from the yoak and danger of the laws, and will find him his fill of booties and spoils.</hi> There assembled unto him about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand men, all Murtherers, Theeves, Rebels, Lawless persons, wicked and Seditious men.</p>
            <p>Then began <hi>Schimeon</hi> also to vex the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> to turn all upside down wheresoever he came. When the Citizens of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Priests, Elders, and <hi>Anani</hi> heard tidings of <hi>Schimeons</hi> despightfull wickedness, how he held on stil oppressing the people of God, they were very pensive, saying: Now will this fellow more trouble us than <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> be he never so cruel. They consulted therefore and agreed, secretly to send a power against him, that might suddenly fall upon him, and overthrow him. Peradventure (say they) they may slay him, or take him alive, before this wickedness grow to further inconvenience, and joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with our foes; then shall they assail us both within the Town and without.</p>
            <p>They sent out therefore against him a great Army of <hi>Israelits</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> with Chariots and Horse-men, and foot-men in great number, which came where the Camp lay, and found him in the corn fields destroying of the grain, pulling down of barns, and burning all both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>orn and Olive trees: Then the <hi>Jerusolemites</hi> divided their Army, &amp; set upon <hi>Schimeons</hi> tents suddenly, smote them down, and made a great slaughter upon the Seditious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:32499:105"/>
But shortly after, <hi>Schimeon</hi> gat the upper hand of the People of God, for he came upon them in the night season, and made a sore slaughter amongst them; Then they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, took themselves to flight towards <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and <hi>Schimeon</hi> pursued them, killing them unto the hard gates of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so that many of them were slain in the way, and very few escaped.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Schimeon</hi> went and moved war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Edomites,</hi> to subdue them unto himself, which before were under the Dominion of the <hi>Jerusolemites.</hi> And first, he came to the City <hi>Asa,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Gaza,</hi> for it was the first City within the borders of <hi>Edom,</hi> as men came from <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But the <hi>Edomites</hi> met him in the field in great number, and joyned battel; neither part had the Victory, therefore at length they retired both.</p>
            <p>Then was <hi>Schimeon</hi> in so great a rage, when as he could not overcome these <hi>Edomites,</hi> that he wisht him out of his life. So he ceased fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a while, and encamped himself in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Land of <hi>Edom,</hi> right against it, and there abode, thinking to set upon them at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time. And as he was devising how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all things, there came unto him an <hi>Edomite</hi> called <hi>Jacob,</hi> one of the chiefest men among them, and a Warriour. He hearing of <hi>Schimeon's</hi> Proclamation, was moved to come and enter a League with him, and thereupon sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d unto him: Never let it discomfort thee, that thou
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:32499:106"/>
couldest not overcome the <hi>Edomites</hi> at the first battel: If thou wilt be ruled by my counsel, thou shalt win all the Cities in the whole land, and I will deliver them into thy hands</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Schimeon</hi> desired to know how: therefore said he, Let us hear thy counsel, and shew us how it may be brought about, and when it is come to passe, then will we honour thee, and regard thee accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacob</hi> said, Give me one half of thine Army, which I will lead with me into an ambush: then shalt thou in the morning betimes set thy men in aray against the <hi>Edomites</hi> for a stale; and when thou shalt perceive them to come against thee, then make as though thou fleddest, until thou hast staled them out of the Town into the fields to pursue thee.</p>
            <p>Then will I with my men come out of our ambush, and make speed to the gates, where we shall kill the Warders, and suddenly enter the Town; and killing all that we find there, set up a flag upon the Tower of the Town. Then when the <hi>Edomites</hi> shall see that, their hearts will be dead for sorrow; and so mayest thou turn again upon them, and beat them down at thy pleasure: Or if thou like not this device, hear yet another way. I have been a Captain against them a long while, therefore I will return in the night season into the Town; if the Watch examine me from whence I come, I will tell them I come from <hi>Schimeons</hi> Camp, whither I went as a Spy; Then will I go to the Elders of the Town, and desire
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:32499:106"/>
them to let me have a company of the best fouldiers, and I will bring <hi>Schimeon</hi> into their hands, if he set upon us again. For I have view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Camp, and his power, and understand that he intends to morrow to fall on us, which thou shalt do indeed. And when thou seest me to issue out against thee, thou shalt set thy Spear in the Rest, and come towards me; then will I take me to flight, and cast a fear in the <hi>Edomites</hi> hearts, that they shall flee also; which done, thou mayest pursue and slay them, at thy pleasure overcome them, and enter the Town; then that Town great <hi>Asa</hi> once taken, thou shalt quickly win all the rest. When <hi>Schimeon</hi> heard this, he went and deliberated with his own Councel, and they liked the last advice best, wherefore that they concluded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So <hi>Jacob</hi> the <hi>Edomite</hi> returned by night to <hi>Asa,</hi> and declared to the Ancients of the Town, how he had been in <hi>Schimeons</hi> Camp, and had viewed his Army, whereby he had percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved good hope, that he should deliver <hi>Schime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> into their hands shortly. The Elders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made him grand Captain, and chief of all their men of War, charging every man in this wise: Forasmuch as none of you are so expert in the knowledge of warfare as is <hi>Jacob,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoveth you to follow him in all things. If he set forward, set ye forward; whereas he pitcheth his tent, pitch ye also; if he stay, stay ye; if he fleeth, fleeye; To be short, when he returneth, then return ye, and go not one
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:32499:107"/>
hair breadth from that that he shall command you, neither one way nor other. Upon the next morrow <hi>Schimeon</hi> issued out of his Camp, with all his Army, and upon that, assembled <hi>Jacob</hi> his men, and went out to meet him; But when they came to the point ready to joyn, and <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> with his company had charged their staves against them; by and by <hi>Jacob</hi> left the Field, turned his back and fled, and the chief souldiers that were about him, fled with him. The rest of the people seeing their Captain flee, they took themselves likewise to flight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man: then <hi>Schimeon</hi> pursuing, made a great slaughter of them, and won the Town, bringing them under his subjection. And when he had sacked the houses of them that were slain of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and spoiled their goods, which was very much; the rest that he took prisoners and kept alive, he made peace withal, and joyned them unto his own Camp.</p>
            <p>After that, he departed from thence, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with 40000. good fighting men, part <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,</hi> and part <hi>Jews,</hi> and came to <hi>Chebron,</hi> which he won, and destroyed all their grain, and corn fields: Yet after, he repaired their Walls; and such of them as were left alive, made peace with <hi>Schimeon,</hi> who received them into League with him, and they became his men, and followed him in all his Wars. So he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loged from thence with all his Army, which by the accession of the <hi>Chebronites</hi> was now won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully encreased, and determined to invade <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:32499:107"/>
And when he came nigh unto the City, he ranged here and there, destroying the fruits that were upon the ground, and also their corn.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Jehochanan</hi> having intelligence of <hi>Schimeons</hi> coming to besiege the Town, and how he had destroyed the fields, thought to have gone out of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to fight with him, but he durst not; for his Spies had told him that he should not be able to overcome him, he had so puissant an Army, and so well appointed. Yet neverthelesse he issued out, and lay in ambush for <hi>Schimeon.</hi> In the mean space, by chance <hi>Schimeons</hi> wife (that was fled out of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with her men and women servants towards her husband, for fear lest she should be slain for her husbands sake, if she should have tarried at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) passed by where he lay in his ambush: Her he took, and brought again to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> not a little proud of such a prey, thinking, Now we shall have <hi>Schimeon</hi> at our pleasure, seeing we have his Wife our prisoner: he loveth her so entirely, that he will do for her sake whatsoever we will have him. This came to <hi>Schimeons</hi> ear, who had taken that time many of <hi>Jehochanan</hi>'s men, and cut off their right hands, sending them with such shame to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> to their master. He sent moreover Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours to <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> willing him to send him his Wife, in such sort, that she might come to him with all that was hers: or if he refused to do it, he should be extremely handled; for
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:32499:108"/>
he would take the Town ere it were long, and, to <hi>Jechanan</hi>'s shame, cut off the hands and legs of all them that did inhabite it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jehochanan</hi> hearing this, was sore afraid, and all that were with him, and therefore they sent him his Wife; whereupon <hi>Schimeon</hi> kept him within the Town. And as <hi>Schimeon</hi> played the Tyrant without, so likewise did <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi> within. For <hi>Jehochanan</hi>'s souldiers ravished the <hi>Israelites</hi> Wives, and shed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, <hi>Schimeon</hi> left the Town for a space, and returned into <hi>Idumea;</hi> for he had word that the men of most power, and the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sort of that Country rebelled. Whereupon he sacked and spoiled all the Towns of <hi>Idumea,</hi> and left them nothing: insomuch that he was become very rich, and then returned to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> bringing the <hi>Edomites</hi> wholly with him, that were meet for war: and many of the <hi>Jews</hi> resorted to him, and with his power he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> even at the very gates. Yet the Tyranny of <hi>Jehochanan</hi> and his Complices ceased not, but increased more and more daily in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> insomuch that they taught the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to murder their neighbours, and to commit adultery with their wives: by which means fornication was rife and common in the City. Yea, many of the people and youth shaved their beards, letting the hair of their heads grow, and accompanied themselves with women, that they might exercise their adultery
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:32499:108"/>
safer, and not be espied; which sin did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defile the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and without doubt furthered the desolation thereof. The gates also of the Town were closed up, that no man might go in nor out. And whoso went out, fell into the hands of <hi>Schimeon,</hi> and was slain: they that tarried within, were constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to see before their faces, their shame in every street and corner; and if any found fault, he was slain straight by <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> that most cruel Captain of the seditious Rebells.</p>
            <p>The Citizens therefore seeing the tyranny of <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> to be without measure, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled all together, and encountred with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan,</hi> and were slain a wonderful sort of them in that conflict. And except the <hi>Edomites</hi> that were fled to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> from the tyranny of <hi>Schimeon,</hi> had succoured the Citizens, the whole people of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had been utterly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and slain every mothers son by <hi>Jehochanan;</hi> his power was so great.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Anani</hi> the high Priest, and the other Priests, with the ancient, faithful, and Sages, and the rest of the people of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> seeing the wickednesse of <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> and that they could not suffer it any longer, consulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deliver the Town to <hi>Schimeon,</hi> and bring him in, and make him their King, to help them against <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> whom they took to be far worse than <hi>Schimeon,</hi> hoping that it might come to passe, that <hi>Schimeon</hi> should slay <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan</hi> at length. They sent therefore <hi>Amittai</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:32499:109"/>
the high Priest to <hi>Schimeon,</hi> to bring him into the Town; But <hi>Schimeon</hi> craftily denied it, saying; What should I come into the Town to you that hate me, and of late banished me your Town? Yet they ceased not, but sent the same <hi>Amittai</hi> to him again, to entreat him in the name of all the people, to come into the City. And by this means, upon a certain night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he entred into <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with his whole Army: Notwithstanding, he was no sooner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town, but he brake his promise and league that he had made with the Citizens; and whereas he had promised to succour them, and aid them, now he was altered, and became their enemy, joyning himself with <hi>Jehochanan:</hi> And those two Rebells reigned in the City of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by course, one one moneth, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other another. So, where before <hi>Schimeons</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they thought much to bear the yoke and oppression of one seditious person, now were they constrained to hold down their shoulders, and bear the yoke of two.</p>
            <p>Yet within two dayes after, there fell a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and discord between <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> and <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi> about <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Priest, the son of <hi>Anani</hi> the high Priest. This <hi>Eleazar</hi> was the beginner, and first sower of sedition amongst the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> whom <hi>Schimeon</hi> would now have put to death, to be revenged of his father that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished him out of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> but <hi>Jehochanan</hi> took <hi>Eleazars</hi> part, and defended him; For <hi>Eleazar</hi> was alwayes <hi>Jehochanan</hi>'s friend, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:32499:109"/>
aided him. His father was high Priest, and bare a great rule in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> wherefore <hi>Eleazar</hi> was of a great estimation and authority with the Elders, so that they durst not apprehend him; and his father also looked negligently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and let him do what he list, because he had no more sons but him. So he was the first that assembled naughty persons together, and held ever on <hi>Jehochanans</hi> side, from his first coming to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And for his sake, fell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision and dissention between <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> and <hi>Schimeon,</hi> so that they became enemies, and warred the one upon the other ever after, as we shall declare hereafter.</p>

               <p>IN this while, <hi>Vespasian</hi> had sent <hi>Antony,</hi> and <hi>Mankiminus,</hi> (two Noble men, and of his Council) to <hi>Rome</hi> against <hi>Vitellius,</hi> that they might make him out of the way, and then would he come to <hi>Rome</hi> to receive the Imperial Crown there.</p>
               <p>These two Captains went therefore and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an Army, by whose aid they set upon <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to <hi>Rome</hi> to his Coronation, dividing first his Army into two parts; whereof he took the one with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> as a safegard for himself whatsoever should happen, and the other he left with <hi>Titus</hi> his son, to besiege <hi>Jerusalem</hi> withall. So departing, he left his son <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> commanding him to remain there, till such time as he should signifie unto him otherwise by his Letters, and shew him what he should do; and that in no wise he should attempt the siege of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the mean space. <hi>Titus</hi> answered, <hi>I shall do (dear Father) according unto your commandment, for to you it belongeth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and unto me to obey.</hi>

                  <hi>Vespasian</hi> took with him King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Munabas</hi> his son, he fearing lest they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, and me <hi>Joseph</hi> Priest and prisoner also fast bound in chains; for so had his Council mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, saying: We cannot say the contrary, but that we have found no sign of rebellion in <hi>Joseph</hi> hitherto, neither think we that he hath gone about any; but, Who can tell when we are gone hence, whether he will not flee to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and help <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Agrippa</hi> and his son; albeit they had no irons upon them, neither on hand, or foot, but only had their Keepers appointed them, that they should not step aside.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Vespasian</hi> drew nigh <hi>Rome,</hi> all the Citizens came forth to meet him, and received him with great joy, and mighty Shews. Then he commanded that I should be put in prison, but <hi>Agrippa</hi> and his son he let go at liberty.

I also intreated the Jaylor to let me have Keepers with me, and so to bring me to the place where he should be Crowned <hi>Caesar:</hi> which the Jaylor granted me, and went with me himself to the place, and brought me where I might see all that was done. Within few dayes after, <hi>Vespasian</hi> took displeasure with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> upon the information of certain evil disposed persons, that had slandered him, and perswaded <hi>Vespasian</hi> that he went about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, and how he had sent letters unto <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> concerning the same matter; wherefore <hi>Vespasian</hi> put both him, and his son <hi>Munabas,</hi> to death.</p>

               <p>The same year and moneth that <hi>Agrippa</hi> was put to death, God moved the minde of <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian</hi> to remember me with his mercy: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commanded that I should be fetched out of prison, and brought to his presence. And as I stood in irons before him, <hi>Caesar</hi> bad me welcome, and spake comfortably unto me, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thou knowest very well that I have loved thee from the day I first saw thee, and though I have kept thee continually in durance, do not think I did it of any ill will or malice toward thee; but rather thou mayest perswade thy self, I did it lest the <hi>Roman</hi> Princes should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain at thee, and say: See, here is a fellow, that in our wars hath endamaged us so greatly, yet now goeth he check-mate with us, in as great favour as we: Let us kill him, and put him out of the way. But, my friend <hi>Joseph,</hi> be of good chear, I will deliver thee from these iron-bands, and thou shalt be with me in no worse case than one of my chief Princes. I will send thee into <hi>Jewry</hi> to my son <hi>Titus,</hi> to whom thou shalt be as a father and a counsellour.</p>
               <p>Thou knowest, <hi>Titus</hi> was he that took pity on thee, and would not suffer thee to be put to death; Yea he hath sundry times moved me to release thee of thy bonds, and to honour thee, which I have deferred to do, only for this cause that I shewed thee. I made him answer, But how can I be quiet, or in surety of my life
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:32499:111"/>
as long as I am in thy company and thy sons, seeing <hi>Agrippa</hi> and his son, were suddenly put to death by you? <hi>Caesar</hi> answered, Hold thy peace <hi>Joseph,</hi> I never looked for any goodnesse of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and his son. Thou knowest not what they had wrought against my Majesty, and how they went about to rebel; thou hast born their bones with thy hands. Doest thou not know I honoured him and his son in <hi>Jewry,</hi> how I would not suffer any of my Army to annoy any of his Cities? I answered, Yes, I know it was so, as your Majesty saith. Then said he; But for all this hath <hi>Agrippa</hi> requited me again with evil. For what time as the Nobles of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Jewry</hi> went about to make me Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, thinking me somewhat more meet to rule the Empire than <hi>Vitellius, Agrippa</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them that they should not make me Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, affirming that there was nothing in me worthy wherefore they should promote me to that dignity. And after when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he went from one Bishop to another, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to go to the Bishops, to accuse me of such crimes as in my conscience I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of.</p>
               <p>By this I perceived that <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s heart was full of rancour and rebellion, and therefore I judged him to death. <hi>For where as wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is, there it is meet that condign punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should not be lacking.</hi> And I put his son to death likewise; <hi>For the son of a Traitour ought not to live upon the earth, because that in</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:32499:112"/>
                  <hi>his heart remaineth the work of his father, being conceived and born of a rebellious seed:</hi> But I have found thee alwayes faithful and true, and therefore I commend my son to thy wisdom. With this, he commanded my irons to be taken away from me, and being released and at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he set me honourably among the Princes and Senatours. Then said I unto him, Is not this a great dishonour unto me, that I should be delivered from my bonds, and neverthelesse my Countrymen that be with me to be kept in prison still? Now therefore, if I have found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in thy sight, and if thou wilt do any thing at my request, loose the bonds likewise of all the rest of the <hi>Israelites</hi> that be with me: set them at liberty also, and thou shalt be assured that I will be thy faithful Counsellor while my life lasteth, and an enemy to thy foes, to make War upon them that assail thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vespasian</hi> granted <hi>Joseph</hi> his request, and willed them to be set at liberty, as many as were prisoners with <hi>Joseph.</hi> Shortly after sent he <hi>Joseph</hi> to his son <hi>Titus,</hi> that abode at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to whom he writ concerning <hi>Joseph</hi> in this manner.</p>
               <p>I send unto thee here (my beloved son) <hi>Joseph,</hi> a Prince of the Jews, a man of experience, trained in war, in whom is great wisdom; he shall be thy father, and faithful counsellour, thou shalt not do against his counsel, neither one way nor other, for he is a wise man. Wherefore thou shalt reverence and honour him according as he is worthy; for the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:32499:112"/>
Lord God is with him, and believe not rashly any man that defames <hi>Joseph</hi> unto thee. Yea, rather put him to death straightway, that will accuse him: for <hi>Joseph</hi> is a faithful man, and a good Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and who is so ruled by his counsel, shall have a prosperous successe in that he goeth about. Therefore when <hi>Joseph</hi> shall come unto thee, after he hath refreshed himself a few dayes of his labours and travels at the Sea; then shalt thou prepare thine Expedition against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to besiege it. And if the <hi>Jews</hi> receive thee peaceably, and will submit themselves under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, then beware thou endamage them in nothing, but rather repair their Cities, and let them be free from all Tribute for the space of two years; yet on this condition, that thrice every year they set a Flag with the Arms of the <hi>Romans</hi> upon their walls; that is to say, at their three solemn Feasts, whenas all the <hi>Israelites</hi> were wont to resort unto <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to appear before the Lord their GOD. Moreover they shall offer for us every Feast a Sacrifice, upon the most holy Altar that is in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And if they refuse to make peace with thee, thou shalt utterly rase their Towns; and whosoever are left alive, and escape the sword, those shalt thou lead away captive. If they desire to have <hi>Joseph</hi> to be their King, we are coutent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. In any wise remember to be ruled by <hi>Josephs</hi> counsel; he shall be thy father, and thou his son.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Joseph</hi> departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> and came to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> who hearing of <hi>Josephs</hi> arrival, was wondrous glad, and all the Antient wise men, with him; For <hi>Joseph</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:32499:113"/>
was full of the spirit of wisdom, understanding, counsel, valiantnesse, knowledge, and fear of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we went forth to meet him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Captains of the <hi>Romans</hi> Army, and received him with great honour. Then <hi>Joseph</hi> delivered to <hi>Titus</hi> his fathers Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: which <hi>Titus</hi> having read, said unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> Whatsoever my father hath written in these Letters, I would have done no lesse by mine own accord: but sith my father hath admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed me of the same, I ought to do it the more. Wherefore remain here with me, and I will be thy son, and thou shalt be my father, to rule and govern me with thy counsel.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Joseph</hi> abode with <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> a whole moneth after he came from <hi>Rome.</hi> Then consulted they together to go to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and besiege it; for <hi>Joseph</hi> understood well enough, <hi>That this came of the Lord, and that his word could not be letted, or hindered. Titus</hi> therefore and <hi>Joseph</hi> with him, departed from <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Another part followed seditious <hi>Iehochanan;</hi> the third was for <hi>Schimeon.</hi> So that in the midst of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was civill wars, and without the same, the <hi>Roman</hi> Army made roads from <hi>Cesarea,</hi> even to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> by the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no man durst go forth, lest he should fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the enemies hands, nor enter into the Town to bring any necessaries thither. <hi>Anani</hi> being a perfect godly man, and seeing the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:32499:114"/>
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> governed by the pleasure of the Seditious, gave over his third part that stuck to him, to <hi>Eleazar</hi> his son, which was the first author of sedition, and he that gave the first occasion, and the cause of all the mischief that befell in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and in the whole Land of <hi>Judea.</hi> For he began a conspiracy against the <hi>Roman</hi> Garrisons, and provoked <hi>Israel</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to lay hands upon them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore there assembled unto the seditious <hi>Eleazar, Jehudah, Chezron, Schimeon,</hi> and <hi>Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kihu,</hi> young men of the Nobles of <hi>Jerusalem. Eleazar</hi> with his company took the Temple, and the Courts about it, appointing of his men, some to be spies, and some to keep watch and ward about the Temple of the Lord.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> who because of the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort of the people unto him, was stronger than <hi>Eleazar,</hi> he took the market place and streets, and the lower part of the City.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Schimeon</hi> the <hi>Jerusolemite,</hi> took the highest part of the Town: wherefore his men annoyed <hi>Jehochanans</hi> part sore with Slings and Cross-bows.</p>
               <p>Between these three there was also most cru. el battels in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for the space of four daies, without ceasing or any breathing, and every day were very many slain, so that the blood of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were then slain, ran in every place most abundantly, through the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-places and streets, yea even to the Temple
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:32499:114"/>
of the Lord, like unto a flood that had come of great showres; and unto the thresholds of the gates of the Temple, the dead bodies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed one another by heaps, for no man bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them. <hi>Jehochanan</hi> having the middle part of the Town, had <hi>Schimeon</hi> on the one side of him, and <hi>Eleazar</hi> on the other.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Schimeon</hi> had the best place; from whence he might annoy both <hi>Jehochanan</hi> and <hi>Eleazar. Eleazar</hi> did also what he could to endamage <hi>Schimeon.</hi> And <hi>Jehochanan</hi> that was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, encombered them both, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to little purpose. For <hi>Schimeons</hi> company flung stones, and shot at them sore: but when as <hi>Jehochanans</hi> part flung likewise at them, the stones rebounded back upon themselves. Thus amongst these three the battel was sore, and encreased every day, that all men were in great terrour and fear thereof.</p>
               <p>Then assembled to the Temple much people of the Priests and Elders, beseeching these Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine and Domesticall enemies, not to pollute and defile the Temple with their slaughters, and were almost all slain for their labour. The same day was slain the Priest <hi>Anani, &amp; Joshua</hi> a Priest, both of the chiefest Priests. <hi>Sechariahu</hi> also the most faithfull Prophet of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Then had the continuall Sacrifice ceased 36. daies: for ever until that time, was there some good men or other of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that offered alway sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
               <p>But now when they would have continued it,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:32499:115"/>
and the Priests laid the sacrifice upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the Seditious would run upon them and kill them, so that the Priests bodies and their cattel that they would have sacrificed, should fall dead to the ground together. They that resorted also out of the Country of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for devotions sake, the Seditious slew, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroyed them, that almost no one of them was left alive.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the dead bodies of men lay cast in the Temple, and that without number troad under feet: yea, the dead body of the Priest that was offering sacrifice, lay upon the earth together with his offering. And when any man would offer any sacrifice, straight way one or other of the Seditious would step to him and kill him, that the blood of the sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ifice and sacrificer, should be mingled together; In somuch that the pavement of the Temple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of marble, was made so slippery with the blood and fat of them that were slain, that no man could go upon it without falling. And the Priest should no sooner lay hands on the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but he was slain, and straight another dead body should fall upon him stranger or other, they spared none: So thus the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the good and bad, clean and unclean, wicked and vertuous, theef and true man, lay one upon another, and their blood mixt together in the midst of the Temple, without respect of any man, of what degree or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soever he were: Wherefore the fight and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:32499:115"/>
slaughter waxt great, both in the Town, and in the Temple. Nay, whomsoever the Seditious overcame, they set fire on their houses also; whereby the fire took into the great men's hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that were nigh the Temple, and into the store-houses, whereas against times of necessity, and besieging of the Town, were laid up in store, corn, wine, and oyl, to the number of a thousand and four hundred store-houses, all filled full of victuals. For the Elders and other godly men, what time as <hi>Vespasian</hi> was in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> they made up the doors of those Garner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, and laid in victuals into them, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for two hundred thousand men twenty years, and now in this one battel of the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious they were burnt every one, stick and stone, which was a speedy cause of famine, and hurger in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time also, the Seditious pulled down and razed all the fair houses, and goodly buildings, that there should be no monument of any noble house, left to any in the City of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> So thus you see at that time the Lord visited the Citizens of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with four kind of plagues, sword, pestilence, hunger, and fire: besides this, a fift was added, the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of all beautifull and glorious buildings. And wheresoever a man turned him, there was nothing but desolation, pollution, (namely of the Temple and all holy things) uproars, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all rest and refuge; no help, no succour, but every corner of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was full of how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:32499:116"/>
and yelling, wailing and weeping, sobbing and sighing of women, and children. Here should ye hear the roaring &amp; groaning of woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men, not yet thorough-dead; there the mourning and lamentation of the Elders, youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger children crying out for hunger; to be short, most sorrowfull oppression of them that lived, done by the Seditious: Such lamentations were made every where, that happy and fortunate was he that before this day died, and unhappy and in a wofull case were all such as remained alive to see this day.</p>
               <p>All these things when I <hi>Joseph</hi> heard tydings of, I tore my hair with my hands, and cast ashes on my beard, sitting in great sorrow on the ground, bewailing the misery and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And this lamentation made <hi>Joseph</hi> upon <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> How is the City (quoth he) laid wast, that was wont to be more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and more renowned than all the Provinces upon the earth? How is the City that was heretofore in such highness and dignity, now brought under the foot, through the sons of the Citizens thereof? Whereas sometime was the dwelling place of the faithfull, now bear rule there such men as provoke and stir Gods wrath against it, and turn it away from their God, wasting it as theeves. In the which sometime remained the brightness of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, it is now become a by-word, and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-stock to the enemies, replenished with blood of wounded and slain men. Instead of mirth,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:32499:116"/>
gladness, rejoycing, harps and psalteries; is sorrow, sighing, heart-breaks, mourning, and pensiveness come in place. Even as heretofore the priests executed the service of the Lord in offering sacrifices; so likewise now, seditious persons murthered godly and faithfull men: where was wont to be the dwelling place of most wise and prudent men, now it is made a common hostry of wicked murtherers &amp; theeves. O Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> have not Angels in time past come down from heaven to earth to fight thy battels? Have not the floods of the seas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted them, that persecuted thee? Hath not the earth swallowed up them that despised thee, and the winds scattered them a- sunder that made insurrections against thee? hath not thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from heaven destroyed thine enemies, and stars fought against thy foes? What means this therefore? and how cometh it to pass, that thou hidest thy face from us? to whom hast thou delivered the sheep of thy pasture? Look upon us our God, and behold thy people and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that thou broughtest out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with a mighty power, and a strong hand, with wonders and signs, leading them untill this day in thy faith; take pitty upon them in thy mercy, and extend not thy wrath against thy servants.</p>
               <p>Where art thou <hi>Moses</hi> the son of <hi>Amram?</hi> stand up and see thy people and flock of sheep, which thou feedest all thy life with thy wisdom; see how Wolves and Lions tear them; see how the <hi>Israelites</hi> are become foes to their own

lives and souls; yea wasters and destroyers are sprung up of their own selves. Behold the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD, for whose sake thou lifted'st up thy staff over the sea, wherewith thou struckest and dividest it, that it was made dry ground, so the <hi>Israelites</hi> passed through, and escaped their enemies.

see not the Sanctuary turned into a vile sink of blood? for the dead bodies of Priests lye in midst of it. The holy City <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a strange City, as though the name of the Lord had never been in it: and the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of the Lord is in that case at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as though the Godhead had never dwelt therein: for the Temple is turned into a den of theeves, a lodging of Seditious persons, a tabernacle of cruel murtherers.

               <p>These died not for their offences, but because they found fault with the <hi>Israelites</hi> when they sinned.

helhounds, and blood-suckers, that have brought all these evils upon thee? how are the Priests of the Lord, and his Prophets slain, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those holy men? For, before the holy Temple, was the Prophet <hi>Sechariahu</hi> that just and holy man, butchered and murthered, yea, without all buriall, neither was his blood co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with earth, but yet still wandreth about and cryeth in thee.

How are the hearts of the people turned so aukwardly, that they will bear no admonition of just men? but are like unto blockish Images, that neither see, nor hear, nor yet understand any thing.

They would not be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by sinners, but ventured themselves to die, offering their lives, not for their sous and daughters, but for the Sanctuary of the Lord and his Temple, left it should be polluted with the Idols of the Gentiles. Where remaineth now the rod of God, that holy rod that budded and blossomed in the daies of gladness? Now is both the spring withered, and the rod it self also. The rod of faith is withered, the rod of the Kingdom, the rod also of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whence the holy Law is taken away; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any man that can tell where to draw any waters of thy Heavenly mercy. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, the mercifull men that have been in times past to their brethren, both alive and dead; how are they now turned into most cruel ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and have mercy of no man? Where is the multitude of their mercies, wherewith they were wont honorably to bury their dead? Now the corses of their dead bodies cover the face of the whole earth, and there is no body will vouchsafe to bury them: yea, they that would cannot be suffered, but straightwaies come others to them that kill them before they

can do it, so that they also die and lie unburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are strewed about here and there in the fields. Such is the guise in thee now adaies, neither the father to bury the son, nor the son the father; the Seditious watch so diligently those that be dead, lest any man should bury them, which if they do, they are also slain by them, and lie unburied themselves. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord that is in thee, which was wont to smel sweetly of spices, anointings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, how is it now choked with carrion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, and most pestilent stinch of dead bodies, and blood of the wounded?

                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:32499:120"/>
                  <hi>there is no comfort at all.</hi> Yea, the very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that thou hast bred, brought up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, the self same have stuffed the Temple of the Lord that is in thee, with unburied car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases, every man killing his neighbour, and the Seditious suffering no man to bury them, but slaying all that attempt to bestow any such work of mercy upon the dead, in such sort, that they fall dead upon the corpses which they would have buried; and by that means both the corpses lye cast out into the field, no better than the carcases of brute beasts that be found in desart places. Yea, the iniquity and cruelty of thy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens (O <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) is grown so far, that they were not content only to kill their neighbours, but they must also hew their miserable limbs in pieces, for else they thought they were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently revenged; although that in so doing many times the stinch of the dead, took worthy vengeance again of the living, by casting them into incurable diseases. All these evills are come upon thy people, because they have forsaken the law of the Lord, and have transgressed the Covenant that he made with their brethren; because also they have sinned against the Lord God of their fathers, in shedding the blood of just men, and innocents that were within thee, even in the Temple of the Lord. And therefore are our sorrowfull sighings multiplied, and our weepings daily increased, for that we have been the cause of all these evils that are befallen us, and are not yet ended. O Lord our God, our
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:32499:120"/>
sins are gone over our heads, and the wicked acts that we have committed in thy sight are innumerable. The Lord our God is righteous, it is we that have rebelled against his will; we have prophaned and unhallowed his Law, we have broken his Covenant, and ever the more that his wrath kindled against us, the more have we transgressed against him. Wherefore to him belongeth justice and judgment, he hath worthily powred the fury of his displeasure on us; to us only belongeth shame, as we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly at this day: But he will once turn again and have mercy upon us, vanquish all our fins, and cast them all into the deep bottome of the sea, so be it.</p>
               <p>After these things, the third day of the first month, in the first year of the reign of <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian, Titus</hi> his son took muster of his men in the plain of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> to know the certain number of them, which he had not done afore, since his fathers departure; and he found them very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, insomuch that they seemed almost to cover the earth. This done, he took his journey from <hi>Cesarea</hi> with his people, and came to <hi>Samaria,</hi> where the Citizens received him with great joy, and much honored him, wherefore he spared them, and did them no harm.</p>
               <p>From thence he came to <hi>Ajelona,</hi> thirty fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> there he pitched his tents, and leaving them there, took six hundred horsemen with him, and came to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to view the Town, to know of what height

the walls were of, what strength there was in the Town, especially of the Seditious, of whom every where great rumour was; finally to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive peaceably all such as were desirous of peace. So when he came to the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>l he saw no man, neither to go out nor in; for the gates were shut up, and the Seditious had laid an ambush without the Town to trap <hi>Titus,</hi> who went somewhat before accompanied with a few, the rest following a pretty way behind. Whiles therefore he was in viewing the walls, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious issued out of their ambush that they had laid nigh unto <hi>Ajelona,</hi> and set upon the back of <hi>Titus</hi> men behind. Then issued another Party out of the Town, so that they had <hi>Titus</hi> between them, and running upon him, sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him from his men, and environed him on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very side; where they slew sixty of his men, and might have slain him also, save that they coveted to take him alive. <hi>Titus</hi> seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self beset, and forsaken of his own men, that thought it was impossible for him to escape, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving also that they went not about to kill him but to take him alive; moreover, that he could in no wise escape, except he would make an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and run through their bands; he took a good heart unto him, and valiantly brake through, slaying whomsoever came in his way to lay hands on him, and so he escaped. If they had intended to have slain him, they might have done it, but being desirous to take him alive (as he said) they abstained from striking him, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:32499:121"/>
so they lost him: And God did not deliver him into their hands, that by him he might scourge <hi>Israel.</hi> But the <hi>Jews</hi> seeing him to be thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped, repented sore that they had not killed him; saying one to another, What meant we that we killed him not while we might? it was ill done of us. Therefore they pursued him, hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Ajelona,</hi> and perceived the hearts of Kings to be in the hands of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next morning brought</hi> Titus <hi>all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>determining to encamp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the Mount</hi> Olivet: <hi>wherefore he first spake unto his souldiers in this wise.</hi> This day ye go to fight against a mighty Nation, whose war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours be as strong as Lions, valiant as Libards, and nimble as Fawns that run in the Mountains, to overturn Chariots, and such as sit upon them. Now therefore take good hearts unto you, and be coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, for it behoves you. Do not think them to be like the Nations that heretofore ye have had to do withall: I my self have experience otherwise of their valiantnesse and sleights of war.</p>
               <p>This said, he marched in aray most strongly, that they should not be scattered asunder, and gave them charge, especially to the Vangard, to take heed of stumbling upon Wells and Cisterns, whereby they might be hindred, for as yet the day was scarce broken: and besides
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:32499:122"/>
this, <hi>Titus</hi> had knowledge how the <hi>Jews</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his coming had digged secret trenches and pitfalls. Wherefore to avoid them, he led his host to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> in which place it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came in their minds to dig.</p>
               <p>Therefore when he came to the Mount <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> he encamped there against <hi>Jerusalem</hi> right over against the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> that ran be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the City and the Hill, and many times ran very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The next morning they of the Town seeing <hi>Titus</hi> to be encamped on the Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> the Captains of the Seditious with their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies assembled together, and fell to agreement every man with another, intending to turn their cruelty upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> confirming and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the same attonement and purpose, by swearing one to another, and so there was peace amongst them. Wherefore, joyning together, that before were three several parts, they set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the gates, and all the best of them issued out with an horrible noise and shout, that they made the <hi>Romans</hi> afraid withall, in such wise, that they fled before the Seditious, which sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly did set upon them at unawares. But <hi>Titus</hi> seeing his men flee, rebuked them, saying, <hi>Are ye not ashamed of this timourous cowardliness, when ye are so many, and a hundred for one of them? Whar ignominy is it, so many to be repulsed of so few?</hi> Wherewithall <hi>Titus</hi> stayed them, and brought them manfully to withstand the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:32499:122"/>
so that very many were slain on both sides. But the <hi>Romans</hi> were not able long to abide the force of the <hi>Jews,</hi> albeit that <hi>Titus</hi> with his choi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For to forsake <hi>Titus</hi> they were ashamed, and to resist the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they were not able. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Titus</hi> and all his Company made his party good against the <hi>Jews,</hi> who at length left the field, and withdrew themselves towards the Town. Then <hi>Titus</hi> being wroth with his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that they had fled from the <hi>Jews,</hi> said unto them: <hi>Shall I not be revenged of these</hi> Jews? <hi>Shall so few of them put us to flight, not able to stand in their hands? and will ye flee or retreat, seeing me abide by it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day <hi>Titus</hi> took all his Army, save a few that he left in his Camp to keep his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and went down the Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> setting his men in battel aray, even against the gates of the City.</p>
               <p>Then exhorted he them to play the men, and although they were come down the hill, yet they should not fear the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning their Camp that they had left behinde them, for the Brook <hi>Cedron</hi> (saith he) is between our Camp and the <hi>Israelites.</hi> With these words they were encouraged, and determined to encounter with the <hi>Jews</hi> under the walls hard to the gates
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:32499:123"/>
of the City, trusting to the safegard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Brook <hi>Cedron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Captains of the Seditious likewise used policy: for they dividing their men, sent one company to passe suddenly the Brook <hi>Cedron</hi> to invade and spoil the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp that was left in the Mount <hi>Olivet.</hi> These therefore went and fought with the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the Mount, and drove them out of their Camp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> looking behind him, and perceiving that the <hi>Jews</hi> had gotten over the Brook, and were in hand with his men, he was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully afraid, seeing himself environed with bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels on every side.</p>
               <p>They within the Town, when they saw their fellows once at the Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> they opened the gates, issued out with all their power that was left in the Town, and encountred with <hi>Titus,</hi> where he had set his men in array over against the gate, where they made a great slaughter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which (desirous to avenge the shame gotten the day before) fled not, but stoutly withstood their force. Also the <hi>Jews</hi> took heart to them, fought manfully, and beat down the <hi>Romans,</hi> so that at length they betook them to flight toward Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and in their flight many of them were slain by the <hi>Jews</hi> that pursued the chase. Upon this, divers of <hi>Titus</hi> souldiers (seeing themselves beset both before and behinde) counselled <hi>Titus</hi> to flee with them to the Mountains to save his life, lest he should be slain by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:32499:123"/>
they all together with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For thou (say they) art a great Lord of many Kingdoms, and God shall one day bring thee to the Imperial Crown of our Lord thy father: Now therefore if thou shouldest be slain of the <hi>Jews,</hi> we are all but dead; and what good should thy death do, either to thy self, or to others, to be slain like one of us? <hi>Titus</hi> would not be ruled by them, nor receive their counsel, but kept his ground boldly, without once turning his face, saying, <hi>I will choose rather to die with honour, than to live with shame:</hi> And with that he rushed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Jews</hi> that were nigh him, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to recoyl.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Jews</hi> that had environed the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Camp, saw that, they left the <hi>Romans,</hi> and came flocking about <hi>Titus</hi> by routs, assailing him on every side, indeavouring also with all their might to overcharge him; Where in that place was a sore and vehement fight, and much people slain on both sides; yea, <hi>Titus</hi> escaped narrowly from being slain in that fight, and had died indeed, if certain of his valiant soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had not returned unto him, and rescued him out of the <hi>Jews</hi> hands.

               <p>It came to passe then, that the external wars paused, and intestine civil wars returned most terribly amongst the Seditious at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> For upon the first day of the high solemn Feast of Passeover, Captain <hi>Jehochanan</hi> and his men came into the Temple of the Lord, where he was honourably received of the Priests and Elders, with the rest of the commonalty. And when they were within, they cast off their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per garments, under which they were armed with coats of fence, and swords tyed to their thighs. After that they beset the doors, and laid hold of the Priests, slew them and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple also, their hearts were so cruelly bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their brethren; neither regarding the reverent countenances of old men, nor inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the prayers of them that besought them, without sparing women or children, no not the sucking babes.</p>
               <p>This done, <hi>Jehochanan</hi> stood up, and openly protested, that neither <hi>Schimeon</hi> nor <hi>Eleazar,</hi> nor any of the rest of the Captains of the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, nor any man else, should have the soveraignty in that City but he. The other hearing that <hi>Jehochanan</hi> had wrought such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure to the people of God in the Temple, rose together, and slew very many of <hi>Jehocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans</hi> part; but in the mean season, what of the one part, and what of the other, the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> went to wrack, and were slain in great number.</p>

When they saw <hi>Titus,</hi> they came and besought him to enter the Town, and deliver them from the cruelty of the Seditious, and they would be his servants, for these wars had made them almost weary of their lives.

And as they were thusdebating the matter, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly they heard an uprore in the Town, and wonderful hurly burly; some crying, Open the gates, &amp; let <hi>Titus</hi> come in, other cryed, Shut the gates, and let not the <hi>Romans</hi> come in.

Much more spake <hi>Titus</hi> to his men, rebuking them sharply, not mentioned here, but decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at large in the Volume that we writ unto the <hi>Romans.</hi> When he had said these words, his Princes and Captains fell every one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to the earth, and besought pardon of him for their rashnesse, in that they had so unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly, and without order against his mind, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with the <hi>Jews.</hi>

               <p>After this, <hi>Titus</hi> considering how earnestly the <hi>Jerusolemites</hi> were set one against another, how they were become such cruel enemies, that each of them conspired others death, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the pits, cisterns, and trenches that were about <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to be damn'd up, and stopt with earth, that the wayes might be levelled for his Army.

                  <hi>Eleazar</hi> also was against him, and joyned with <hi>Schimeon,</hi> becoming an enemy to him that before had saved his life, and so they both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether assailed <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> neglecting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Town.

               <p>Extreme and dreadful was the civil conflict at that season, between the foresaid Captains, and so sore, that the blood streamed down the channel out of the gates of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> like as a brook that runneth out of a fountain and welspring.

               <p>Furthermore, thou art called <hi>Jerushalem</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, because that whoso understands the dignitie, and worthiness of the place wherein thy Sanctuarie is, shall bid the Angels of heaven to teach in it the doctrines of the holy Ghost, and the spirit of wisdom and understanding, wherewith little children, and the unlearned in thy Land, may be made wise.

               <p>Therefore when as the Priest came into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to minister, apparelled in these four colours, he said before the Almighty God; I am come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent my self here in thy sight (O Lord of the world) in four kinds of colours, that represent the parts of thy world, and in such wise do I appear before thee, as though I should bring all the whole world into thy sight: Moreover, the aforesaid apparel was garnished with pure gold, and precious stones, after the likenesse of the Tribes of the sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was called <hi>Israel;</hi> that in that garment, he might have the soveraignty before the Angels that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and by them prevail to bring the vertue of the holy Ghost; by the which they should obtain wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that dwell in thee, and prosper in their study, and faith, that they might have wisdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing together: His loyns also were girded with linnen flops, wherewith he covered his secret parts (for it becometh Priests most of all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be shamefac'd and bashful) especially when he should minister in the two Sanctuaries, the outer, and the inner, which is the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> or holiest of all. In the outer, the Priests minister as the High Priest commandeth them: but in the inner, that is the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> entreth no man save the High Priest only, and that but once a year. For in it was the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

               <p>And thou <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at that time wast stronger than other Cities, Lady of Provinces; for great Kings and Princes builded thee.

How cometh it to passe therefore that thou art brought thus low? and the Gentiles have the rule over thee now, and besiege thee, rasing thee, and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee down? yea, they are now in the midst of thee.

               <p>In this conflict, the men of <hi>Alexandria</hi> that served <hi>Titus,</hi> behaved themselves like tall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, in the rescuing of the slings from the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet the <hi>Jews</hi> prevailed, and got the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand of them, till <hi>Titus</hi> came with a strong power of choise men to succour the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derians,</hi> where twelve of the stoutest <hi>Jews</hi> were slain.</p>
               <p>In the same skirmish <hi>Jehochanan</hi> a Captain of the <hi>Edomites</hi> that came to aid the <hi>Jews,</hi> was slain by an <hi>Arabian</hi> that came behinde him, and shot him with an arrow, whiles he was talking with the <hi>Romans</hi> that intreated him to come to them: For whom the <hi>Edomites</hi> mourned and lamented sore, for he was a good man of war. The next night certain of the Seditious, chiefly of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanans</hi> and <hi>Schimeons</hi> company, issued out, and came to the three woodden Towers that <hi>Titus</hi> had erected before the walls, to view out of them the Town, and to see what the <hi>Jews</hi> did: within which, were placed, and without also, a strong party of able souldiers for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; Upon those without fell the <hi>Jews,</hi> and slew many; the other fled to <hi>Titus</hi> Camp. The <hi>Romans</hi> that were in the Towers, knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the matter, and trusting to them that

were set about the Towers for their safe-gard, slept all the night: After the <hi>Jews</hi> had thus slain the <hi>Romans</hi> watch, and put them to flight, they came to the Towers with saws, and cut the feet asunder, so that they fell suddenly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them that were within, which were very many, and slue them every one; <hi>Titus</hi> hearing the alarum, and the crashing of the falling of the Towers, was sore afraid, and all the whole Army; and not knowing what the matter was they durst not stir toward it, so the <hi>Jews</hi> returned safe into the Town.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, <hi>Titus</hi> brought his whole power to the walls, and while the <hi>Jews</hi> were at contention in the Town, he addressed another Ram, wherewith he suddenly struck the outer wall, and battered it through: whereupon the people that warded that wall, were forc'd to withdraw themselves within the safe-gard of the second wall. Then <hi>Titus</hi> commanded his souldiers to raze to the ground that wall that he had pierced, and to carry away the stones thereof, that there should be no let nor hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to his men; This was the most substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and strongest wall of all, thicker than both the other, and was builded by <hi>Herod:</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> labouring earnestly in the defacing of the outer wall, were slain in great number by the <hi>Jews</hi> from the middle wall, before they could finish their purpose.

These exhorting one another to play the men, did valiantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the <hi>Romans,</hi> so that the conflicts then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be sore and hard. The <hi>Romans</hi> for their renown and fame, laid on stoutly, and the <hi>Jews</hi> again stuck stiffely to their defence, seeing their end at hand if they were slack. <hi>Titus</hi> now and then exhorting his souldiers to play the men, promising them that would valiantly make any enterprise upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> abundance of gold and silver, and much honour withall. Then stept forth one of his souldiers named <hi>Longinus,</hi> and put himself amongst the routs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were issued out of the Town, where he slew a couple of the chief of them, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered himself again within the array of the <hi>Romans;</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi> shrunk not from the <hi>Romans,</hi> for they were in a fervent rage and wonderfull disdain; and to further their courage, <hi>Schimeon</hi> came to his men, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them with a loud voyce saying; For

               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> also admonished his to keep their array, and not to give back to <hi>Schimeon.</hi> Then went he himself to that part of the Town where <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanans</hi> ward was; there he caused a batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ram to be planted, and bent against the wall, (for there was a very large Plain.) There was at that time in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> one called <hi>Kantor,</hi> who got to him a company of the Seditious, and shot from the walls into the <hi>Romans</hi> Army, where he slew very many, and compelled the rest to retire. This <hi>Kantor,</hi> with nine other tall fellows, whereof he was the <hi>Decurion,</hi> defended one part of the Town: Now as the <hi>Romans</hi> ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Ram to batter the wall, <hi>Kantor</hi> cryed unto <hi>Titus,</hi> I beseech thee, my Lord <hi>Titus,</hi> be mercifull unto this most famous City, that is almost beaten down already, do not deface it utterly, but take pitty of the Sanctuary that is in it, and destroy not the habitation of the Lord God: <hi>Titus</hi> at his request commanded his men to stay, and to leave off battering the wall; Then said he to <hi>Kantor,</hi> Come forth hither to me, and thou shalt save thy self, I will pardon thee, thou shalt not be destroyed; <hi>Kantor</hi> answered, I will see if I can perswade these my fellows to come with me.

Then one of the <hi>Romans</hi> let flye an arrow, that wounded <hi>Kantor</hi> upon the face, and glauncing from him, slew another that stood by him: Then <hi>Kantor</hi> cryed out, What do ye? will ye shoot at us that desire to be at peace with you, which ye granted your selves, and now will break your promise that ye made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us? Is this the reward, my Lord <hi>Titus,</hi> that thou renderest me, for going about to flee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that thy souldiers should shoot at me, hearing me require conditions of peace? Now therefore, my Lord, may it please thee to send hither some man of honour, to whom I may come down and receive assurance of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, to be as one of thine own men: <hi>Titus</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he meant good faith, spake unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> willing him to go and make peace with the <hi>Jews</hi> in his name, then to bring him unto him, that he might find safe-gard of his life, from the common destruction; <hi>Joseph</hi> answerd, Why wilt thou send me?

For <hi>Joseph</hi> mistrusted some subtilty, knowing <hi>Kantor</hi> afore. So <hi>Titus</hi>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:32499:132"/>
sent one Captain <hi>Jiarus,</hi> who said unto <hi>Kan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> Come down and let us go together to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi> son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kantor</hi> desired him to hold abroad his cloak lap, that he might hurl him down his money that he had there, (lest the <hi>Jews</hi> perceiving it, would take it from him) and then he would come down. And as <hi>Jiarus</hi> held up his lap to receive the money that <hi>Kantor</hi> spake of, <hi>Kantor</hi> with all his might cast down a great stone, which <hi>Jiarus</hi> espying, lept aside and avoided: but it lighted upon one of his fellows, and slew him. <hi>Titus</hi> was wonderfull wroth at this, and forthwith planted yet another Ram against the wall, and at length laid it flat upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Then commanded <hi>Titus</hi> to make fires about the Wall, where the <hi>Jews</hi> should think to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape; <hi>Kantor</hi> seeing that, would have fled, and as he made haste to escape the fires, the weight of his armour bare him down into the fire, and there he died, more desirous of death than life.</p>
               <p>Then entred the <hi>Romans</hi> within the second wall, against whom the Seditious issued, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ce that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed against their enemies, slue many of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and forced the rest to retire unto the first wall that they had beaten down afore.</p>
               <p>In this skirmish <hi>Titus</hi> himself took a bow, and shot at the <hi>Jews</hi> in such wise, that not one of his arrows were spent in vain, but that it
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:32499:132"/>
did some annoyance unto the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> notwithstanding gave them the repulse from the Town, and they were not able to make their party good with them. Within four daies after, came unto <hi>Titus</hi> a new supply of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers out of all quarters for ayd to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by whose help they prevailed against the <hi>Jews,</hi> at such time as they issued out of the Town, and constrained them to withdraw themselves within the walls.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Titus</hi> pittying the miserable state of the City, Temple, and People of the Lord, at that time commanded his people to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the walls, and to leave off the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault for a while, that he might offer peace to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to see if they would now be content to submit themselves unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> to have quietness and rest without danger of destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore he gave them truce for five daies: and upon the fift day he came to the gate of the City, where he straightway es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed <hi>Schimeon</hi> and <hi>Jehochanan</hi> together prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fire to destroy the <hi>Romans</hi> Engins of war: for all the <hi>Jews</hi> had agreed together with one mind, still to withstand the <hi>Romans.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Titus</hi> perceiving the <hi>Jews</hi> to be so desperately bent that they had even vowed their lives to death, he began to offer and propose unto them conditions of peace, and sharply to reprove and blame their obstinate stubborness: saying, I have now won two of your walls, and ye have but one left. Therefore, if ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

will continue still in this self willed froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, what will ye do (most miserable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) when as I shall gain also the third wall, and quite destroy your City, pulling down your Temple and all? Why do ye not rather favour and spare your own lives, your wives and children? But the <hi>Jews,</hi> set upon a sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len obstinacy, would in no wise hear <hi>Titus</hi> speak.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Titus</hi> sent <hi>Joseph</hi> to declare his mind unto them in Hebrew, that they might safely credit his promises, and the peace that was offered. <hi>Joseph</hi> therefore went and stood over against the gate, keeping himself aloof off, for he was afraid to come nigh the wall, knowing that the people hated him, because he had yielded himself to the <hi>Romans;</hi> He called therefore unto them aloud: Hearken all ye <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> I will declare unto you that which shall be to your commodity; Then the people gave ear unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> who spake unto them in this wise.</p>

                  <p>YOu should ere this (good people of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) have fought so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whiles your Cities were yet stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and your Land replenished with peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ere ever this mischief had lighted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: Now that with murthers and slaughters amongst your selves having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed one another, and polluted the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Sanctuary with the blood of the murthered, and not spared your own lives, you are become few in number, a small sort of you left, What hope have you to prevail? Again, you have provoked a valiant Nation, which is ruler over all people, and hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all other Lands, which also hath those Nations in subjection under him, which sometimes reigned over you; besides this, you wage battell with the <hi>Romans</hi> without all discretion and wisdom, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of this famous City, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:32499:134"/>
of the Sanctuary of the Lord, without any compassion of your own lives. Neither yet do ye forsake your purpose, for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you continue in this self-will to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>Romans</hi> still, which is nothing else than to spread abroad this calamity further, both on the people of God, and on his holy Temple. Albeit, I am not afraid only for this holy Temple, and most renowned City, lest it should be razed and destroyed, but for the Sacrifices and burnt offerings, lest they should cease, as the daily sacrifice is ceased; And why? because we have sinned against our Lord God. Wherefore is his shaddow departed from us; Because that in this same Temple we have kept wars, making it an habitation for the wicked, a tabernacle of seditious persons: yea, even the Ministers and Holy men of God have ye murthered, and within the walls of the Temple have ye shed innocent blood without measure. See now (dear brethren,) and mark what Ordnance, what Engins, what Instruments of destruction, are prepared to beat down the Temple, the fire is already kindled to set a fire the Sanctuary, and loe, even your very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are so pitifull of your Temple, that they would not have it defaced.</p>
                  <p>But you (dear brethren and friends) why are ye led with no remorse of your selves, that your enemies may once remove from you these Engins of war? What have you now left to trust unto, when as two of your
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:32499:134"/>
walls are already battered down, and one only remaineth? You will say peradventure, we put not our trust in our walls, but in our God: Are ye not aware that your God hath long agone given you over, and hath turned him to your enemies, because they have with greater honour and reverence worshiped his name, than we which rebelliously are fallen away from him? Wherefore God assisteth not us, but our enemies: insomuch, that except it be in such countries, whereas either for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream cold of the one side, or exceeding heat on the other, no man is able to abide, all Lands, all Nations are under their Dominion. Tell me, I pray you, what hope have you, seeing God hath made them a terrour unto all Nations upon the earth, who serveth them? Why will not you obey them, that you may live and not perish? Do ye not consider it is come to their turn to rule over all, that God hath committed Dominion unto them, and ayded them with his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance?</p>
                  <p>Remember you not how God in times past aided the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> insomuch that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the dominion over all the whole world? but afterward departed from them, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted you to get the Soveraignty over other Nations: After that forsook you again, and gave the Empire to the <hi>Chaldeans, Assyrians,</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> which reigned far and wide over many countries: Now also hath he given them
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:32499:135"/>
over, and helpeth the <hi>Romans</hi> these many years, so that they bear rule over all. If you will object and say, To what intent should God give the dominion unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> or other Nations over the world, and over his inheritance and people also, which is an holy people, a peculiar and special Nation of all the earth? Should ye not be ashamed to say this? With what discretion can you wonder at this, knowing that all mankind one or other, are the handy-work of God, who exalteth whom he list, and whom he listeth he thrusteth down? Ye say, Ye be the children of God, and his proper possession, and ye aspire to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; therefore it cannot be that God should determine any thing upon you by chance, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or sudden anger and displeasure.

How can you stay upon his help, when as he hath withdrawn his loving countenance from you, and your sins have made a divorce between you and him? O my dear children and brethren, let never this imagination enter into your hearts, for it shall nothing avail you! Why will you, my dear brethren and friends, make war upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> when as they are Lords over Nations, and pierced the streets of <hi>India,</hi> and all the Isles of the Sea, even to the great Ocean-Sea; and from thence to all the parts of the East,

whose dominion extendeth to the extream parts of the earth? Yea even to <hi>Britain,</hi> which is environed on every side with seas, whose people are huge like Giants, of a big stature, and of mighty courage, most expert archers, and valiant souldiers in battel; To whom when the Captain of the <hi>Romans</hi> came, they gave him the repulse, and would not be subdued; but when the Princes of the <hi>Romans</hi> came, they brought them into subjection and se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>But you say (my brethren and friends) you will rather all dye, than serve the Prince of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that death is better for you than life, to be driven to see with your eyes, the calamities of the sanctuary of the people of God. Search the Histories and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles from the time of your Ancestours; When was there any time wherein you were free from the yoak of the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> Do you not know that <hi>Jacob</hi> our father of worthy memory, who was alwaies with God, took his journey into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to be a stranger in a strange land amongst a proud kind of people, left he, his children, houshold, and cattell, should perish with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? There he had with him his twelve sons which he had begotten, and dwelt there also with his small family, for fear of the grievous famine that was at that time. Remember you not, when that <hi>Judas</hi> with his brethren went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> how <hi>Joseph</hi> was moved as a stranger, to pick a quarrel against his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:32499:136"/>
to bring them into bondage, bearing yet in his mind what injury they had done unto him? Wherefore some of them he cast in prison, and hanged them at his pleasure with crafty accusations; especially <hi>Judas,</hi> who was the chief amongst them, of whom all the <hi>Jews</hi> took their name, who if he had been so disposed, had been able to lay <hi>Joseph</hi> at his foot a thousand times, not knowing him to be <hi>Joseph:</hi> Wherefore when he was so rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and so sharply taunted of him, he might have killed him in his rage: for he was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bold man, and a hardy, and of a very Noble courage, who surely would not have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it nothing to have slain the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and many more of them. Notwithstanding he did not so, but contrary submitting himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoak of <hi>Joseph,</hi> called him his Lord and good Master; and supposing him to be some <hi>Egyptian,</hi> he humbled himself before him, to obtain his petition, and to get Corn, least his father, his brethren, and their family should die for hunger.</p>
                  <p>What should I say of <hi>Joseph,</hi> so beautifull, so wise, and witty a man? Was not he fain to serve in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> house; wherein although his wisdom was well known, insomuch that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> set more by him, than by all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men that were then alive; He was also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Lord, great Master, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Father; Nevertheless he humbly besought <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he might sustain his Father and Brethren
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:32499:136"/>
with bread, knowing at that time the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion belonged unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people, being given them of God. And although <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> had list to return into the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> with all his fathers whole houshold without <hi>Pharaohs</hi> leave; no man could have letted him to do it, for he bare the greatest rule at that time in <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet he did not so. <hi>Benjamin</hi> also was likened to a ravening wolfe for his fierceness, when he was fetched again by force of <hi>Josephs</hi> steward, faining a lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: how chanced he did not kill him? Or else when he alone pursued <hi>Benjamin</hi> and his other brethren; could not he if he had list have slain the man, and buried him, so that the matter should never have come to light? Notwithstanding they did nothing so, nor so: but <hi>Judas</hi> wisely weighing the exaltations, and directions, the promotions, and disgraces, with the common courses of the world, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again with his brethren into the City, went to <hi>Joseph</hi> and besought him, untill his bowels were moved to pity, and he was known of his brethren.</p>
                  <p>All these things doth the most holy law of the Lord rehearse unto us, and putteth us in mind of, for this intent, that we may learn to bear for necessities sake, the yoak of him that hath the preheminence and rule for his time. Neither let any judge or think that <hi>Joseph</hi> offended God, in that he submitted himself under the yoak of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh;</hi>

for it is no shame for a wise man to crouch unto him, whose help he standeth in need of, whatsoever it be, much more if he be a King, or a Lord; know ye not that our fathers were in bondage to King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Egypt?</hi> But after the Lord remembred the covenant that he made with our fathers, and had determined to lead them out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> he sent <hi>Moses</hi> our master of famous memory, his Angel, his chosen, who knew the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But at what time as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> oppressed the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> too sore, our master <hi>Moses</hi> (by Gods help) brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with a strong hand and stretched forth arm, against the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whom he punished with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall plagues; by that means delivering the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of the hands of their Lords and Masters, and bringing them to the mount of God, made them heirs full of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; that is to say, of the most holy law of God.</p>
                  <p>And after <hi>Joshua</hi> had subdued the holy land to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and that they inhabited it, there chanced unto our fathers, times of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, as is mentioned in the books of the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:32499:137"/>
Prophets, so that they were constrained to serve the King of <hi>Ashur</hi> a long season, and the Kings of <hi>Persia;</hi> To the <hi>Chaldees</hi> also were we in bondage, although not very grievous, but tolerable. Moreover with other Kings of the Gentiles we had wars, and sometimes we were put to foils, sometimes we had the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-hand.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, my brethren, tell me, What shame were it to you, if ye were subject unto the <hi>Romans?</hi> Or what are you to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to other Nations that be under their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion? Do you not see that the <hi>Romans</hi> reign over your enemies, and bear rule over them that sometimes were your Masters, and hate us? Were it not reason that you should love them, which have brought down your enemies, and revenged you of them? Which notwithstanding you have nothing at all done, but rather have hated them, as men void of all perceivance, without weighing and considering, that since the time you were under them, ye have alwayes lived in much peace. And I my self, when I withstood the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> knew very well that I should be overcome at length, but I could do nothing because of the seditious persons that were with me, which would in no wise follow my counsel: Yea, it stood me in hand to have a care of mine own person, that I were not killed of them, after I had once counselled and moved them to give up the Town. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:32499:138"/>
seeing the matter stood so, and God knew my heart, I thought best to fight against the <hi>Romans</hi> as I migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when I was in the Cave with my forty companions, I had been lost and perished, had not God given me counsel, making me a way to escape and save my life. For they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most slain me, because I gave them counsel to yield themselves to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and obey them. For I saw this was the time of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to bear rule, and that God had appointed them to be Lords over all Nations. For this is his manner, like as above he hath made some to be rulers over othersome; even so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath also he hath set Rulers over the Kings of the Earth. Who can controll him that is stronger then he? The <hi>Romans</hi> at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, have the Dominion over all Lands and People, over the <hi>Egyptians, Assyrians, Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Chaldees,</hi> (to every one of these you have been in bondage) and over other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also, which nevertheless do till their ground, sowe, mowe, plant, and gather in their fruits: and who hath the profit of these goods and labour but the <hi>Romans?</hi> who whiles the other toyl and travel, do live in peace and rest themselves.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore mark this also my brethren, the Kings of <hi>Macedonia</hi> once had the rule of the whole World, specially in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> but at this
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:32499:138"/>
day their Empire is taken from them, and they are become subjects to the <hi>Romans.</hi> They when the <hi>Romans</hi> first set upon them, were very haughty and stubborn, determining to resist the <hi>Romans:</hi> notwithstanding they were overcome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their subjection at this day. What should I speak of the people of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> which heretofore alwayes have vexed and annoyed you? Doth not the meanest amongst all the Princes of the <hi>Romans</hi> bear rule over them?</p>
                  <p>What hope then have you to escape, when ye know the <hi>Philistines</hi> were ever stronger than you, and you were oftentimes overcome of them? As for example, <hi>Saul</hi> your King was slain by them. But you will say, <hi>David</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed of the Lord of <hi>Israel,</hi> pulled them down, and brought them into subjection. Wote ye what? then God looked upon you with a favourable countenance, and fought your battels Himself: but at this day, He is in no wise present with you, for he hath turned away his countenance of salvation from you, Because ye have sinned against him. And which of you can say, he hath intelligence of the secret of the Lord, or hath received any such watch-word as God gave at that  time unto <hi>David? When thou shalt hear a sound of mourning in the tops of Mulbery-trees, then shalt thou set forward, for then shall the Lord go before thy face, smite the Tents and</hi>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:32499:139"/>
                     <hi>Camps of the Philistines,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. Whosoever (I say) hath knowledge of any such token, let him reveal it to his neighbour, and I could well consent to follow it. But seeing there is no such thing, hearken unto me, my dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Come and serve the <hi>Romans</hi> in peace and tranquillity. It shall be no dishonesty for you, with the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> to be subject to the <hi>Romans:</hi> they that sometime were your Masters, shall be now your fellows and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. But if you will persevere, and stand in your opinion still, I will enter into this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with you: Tell me, I pray you, when were ever your ancestours free, and when were they not entangled with the wars of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and the Dominion of other Nations? Had you not ever the victory from the time you came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> until the reign of <hi>Saul</hi> the son of <hi>Cis?</hi> So long as the Lord was your King, you were in bondage to no man, you served God as your only King. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that your evil and corrupt desire stirred you to be irksome to the Lord, and, lest he should reign alone, to chuse a man to have the Dominion over you, according as the custom was in other Nations (I mean <hi>Saul</hi> the son of <hi>Cis,</hi> and the other Kings every one) then served you him, you and your sons, and the chiefest of you became his servants, your goodliest daughters were made his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionaries, his Cooks, and his Bakers. After <hi>Saul,</hi> reigned <hi>David,</hi> of worthy memory, who
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:32499:139"/>
ruled over many Nations: But he also brought you into bondage, and put divers of you to death, to satisfie his pleasure withal. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, you served <hi>Solomon</hi> his son, who no lesse than the other, even as he listed, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised Dominion over you: he also took up your sons and daughters, and made them his slaves.</p>
                  <p>After this, succeeded other most wicked Kings: so that from that time your Country began to go to wrack, and he that was the best amongst them was <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> which said unto you, <hi>My father corrected you with whips, but I will scourge you with Scorpions.</hi> And so did the rest of the Kings, which reigned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; very few of them pleased God. All the other wrought abomination, not one of them did any good, or reigned in the fear of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And in this manner remained the Empire long time with you, until the Kings of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> came and led you Captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> where you were kept until <hi>Cyrus</hi> time, King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who sent you again into your own Country with a wonderful deal of gold and silver, with great honour, which was counted unto him for righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Cyrus</hi> death, there rose against you the most wicked Kings of <hi>Greece,</hi> who war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon you, gave you great overthrows, until God stirred up the spirits of certain Sage Priests of the stock of <hi>Chasmonani,</hi> that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:32499:140"/>
revenged your injuries. At that time you were Brethren and Friends with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and friendship grew betwixt you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years.</p>
                  <p>After that, you fell from the stock of <hi>Chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monani,</hi> which had delivered you, and chose one whose name was <hi>Herod,</hi> who oppressed you grievously.</p>
                  <p>After him succeeded <hi>Archelaus</hi> his son, he yet laid a sorer yoke upon you; wherefore falling upon him, ye protested never hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to serve the Kings of <hi>Juda.</hi> So going to the <hi>Romans,</hi> willingly ye submitted your selves under their subjection, to serve <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> the Emperour, who ordered you gently. Him you served as other Nations did, and it was to your praise, because ye were under a good Governour.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, now my Brethren, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of my people, What mean you at this present, that you have determined to die, and do not rather spare your selves and your children? Consider I beseech you, the things that grow upon the earth, and all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; beasts, worms that creep upon the ground, fowls of the air, and fishes of the sea; Do you not see that ever the stronger hath the Dominion over the weaker; neither is it any rebuke or shame for the weaker, to give place and obey that which is stronger: For the Oxe and the Goat are in awe of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Ram and the Ewe of the Woolfe,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:32499:140"/>
the Cow and the Lamb fear the Bear, the Goat, the Liberd, the Hawk, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Eagle, the Dove of the Hawk. Weigh the manner of beasts and birds amongst their own kind, you shall see ever the bigger and stronger, to be master over the lesse and weaker: And so in all other things, the stronger set themselves before the weaker al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore ye mortal men, learn by me: Did not one God make all things, and He himself hath Dominion over them all? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, all things are so knit together amongst themselves, that no one thing can stand without another. But he that holds up all things, is the Blessed God, who if he list, can bring them all into dust again, His Name be extolled for ever.</p>
                  <p>Take example, I pray you, from the parts of the whole World; you shall see one part to be in subjection, another to bear rule. Be not then too stiffe-necked to pervert the natural courses of the World, but rather let your ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction follow the causes and events of the same, which if you do, you shall be esteemed wise men.</p>
                  <p>Now my dear Countrymen, never think it shame for you to serve the <hi>Romans;</hi> it is time for you now to turn to the Lord with your whole heart, and then you shall have the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over other Nations, according to your desire: this shall then come to passe, when
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:32499:141"/>
you follow your Lord God with all your strength. Therefore never think that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> which have rule over you at this day, are of lesse power than other people, that heretofore have had dominion over you. For they are a mighty Nation, their Empire and rule over other people they have from above, as I have proved to you by the similitudes of brute beasts, which according to nature bear rule one over another: Notwithstanding, in mankind it should never have come to passe, that the bigger should so have dominion over the lesse, unlesse for their sins; for the the which they are so punished, that one is compelled to bow his neck under anothers yoke.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, my dear people, take hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and meeknesse unto you, never co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet to alter the law of Nature, but rather receive my words, and follow my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell; Obey the <hi>Romans,</hi> prepared and ready to make league with you, according to their bountifulnesse, that ye may live and do full well.</p>

               <p>WHen <hi>Joseph</hi> had spoken these things, in the hearing of the Citizens of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> they burst out and wept, gnashing with their teeth, and railed at <hi>Joseph</hi> over the walls, hurling stones and darts at him, to have killed him. Therefore when <hi>Joseph</hi> saw they would not follow his counsel, butwere so stiffe-necked, he began to rebuke them, crying unto them in this wise; Wo to all froward people, and such as rebell against the Lord God! What mean ye you wretches? what have ye to leane unto, that ye are so stubborn, when neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Lord is gone from you? For you are wicked people, and have sinned against him. How can your sins be purged which you have committed in the Temple of the Lord, by shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of innocent blood, without all mercy? Ye are most guilty, for ye have fought in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Sanctuary of the Lord, ye have defiled it with dead bodies of them which ye have slain in the very midst thereof. Besides, ye have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned and unhallowed the Name of the Lord with making of Wars upon the Sabbath day, &amp; upon your solemn and festival da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:32499:142"/>
and purenesse of heart, wherewith they served God, and again he delivered them? But you, what have you to trust unto, when as ye are unfaithful? Your shelter and protection is departed from you, and your Lord God aideth your enemies, whose power he maintaineth to destroy you; if you ima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Open your eyes, and see what <hi>David</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed of the Lord said: <hi>For the Lord will save neither by sword nor spear.</hi> Call to your remembrance (ye very fools) <hi>Abraham</hi> your father which begot you, by what means he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently had taken away <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife from him: surely none other way did he obtain the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then by prayer to the Lord, who stirred the spirit of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and put him in mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store his wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> clean and undefiled. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was quiet in his bed, and at rest from all troubles; but <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that great Lord and Ruler, was punished in the mean season with great plagues, because of <hi>Sarah</hi> whom he had taken to him by violence, to deflower her, which God would not suffer, but rather unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Pharaohs</hi> flesh, that he was fain to shew the secret parts of his body to Physitians, to see if they could heal them. But who can cure the infirmities which God sends? or who knows his intents? For who knew that <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> biles

Wherefore when as no man could cure <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> he was fain to speak <hi>Abraham</hi> fair, and to intreat him to pray to God to take away from him his plague, and so by his prayer <hi>Pharaoh</hi> recovered.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> apparelled <hi>Sarah</hi> in precious garments, gave her gifts of Gold and Silver, and precious Stones, and sent her home honest, pure, and holy, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> living then at his own house. <hi>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:32499:145"/>
wherefore after that, he was no more repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of the Prophet; for the Lord had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to destroy him, as it is written in the books of the Chronicles of the Kings of <hi>Juda.</hi> Therefore he was taken prisoner afterward like a fox, when he had fought against <hi>Joas</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Bethshemeth;</hi> and so was he compared to a low and vile thorn or shrub, and <hi>Joas</hi> unto the Noble and high Cedar-tree. Yea, all the evils that ever hapned unto us in any age, it came of our selves, for our Lord God is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in all his works, that ever he wrought upon us: Our enemies never did us so much harm, as we our selves did, unto our selves. Ye wot, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> took the precious vessels of our sanctuary away to <hi>Babel,</hi> and brought us them again undefiled; but we polluted and defiled them our selves, and the Temple also with innocent blood, which we shed abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within it, adding sinnes to sinnes evermore and more, breaking the Law with our evill acts.</p>
               <p>For who brought the <hi>Romans</hi> first against the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but <hi>Hircanus</hi> and <hi>Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus?</hi> For they being at dissention betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and one hating the other, called the <hi>Romans</hi> against this City. Who brought <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Sosius,</hi> Princes of the <hi>Romans,</hi> against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but <hi>Herod</hi> being at variance for the Kingdom with the house of the <hi>Chasmonanites?</hi> Who also called <hi>Nero Caesar</hi> to reign over us? Did you it not your selves? Now therefore
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:32499:146"/>
why rebel ye against the Empire and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Romans?</hi> If you will say, Because the <hi>Roman</hi> President <hi>Edomeus</hi> ordered you too bad: had it not been meet rather to complain of him to the Emperour, then to rebel against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and to make war against them? But you will say, We rebelled against <hi>Nero Caesar,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did us too much wrong. Wherefore then rebel ye now against <hi>Vespasian Caesar,</hi> a most mercifull man, and one which never hurt you? Or, why make ye not peace with his son to be under him, according as other Nations be, that ye might live, and not perish?</p>
               <p>Have ye not a sufficient proof of his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and mercifulness, when as he had cause to be cruel upon no man so much as upon me, which drew out my sword against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and killed many of them?</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, neither he nor the rest of the <hi>Romans</hi> have done me any harm. Yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have bestowed many benefits upon me: and although I was in their hands, yet they have saved my life.

First, the Lord is not amongst you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that through the tumults which you have made amongst your selves, almost the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Shiloa</hi> are dried up, which heretofore when the Nations made war against you, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in great abundance, and ran over the banks on both sides. But you are contumacious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, that ever provoked the Lord God unto wrath, you have made slaughters one upon another, in the midst of the Temple of the Lord: how can then the glory of the Lord dwell amongst you? Know ye not because of <hi>Korah</hi> and his Congregation, the Lord said unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and to his people: <hi>Seperate your selves from among this congregation, and I shall consume them in the twinkling of an eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you are far worse than they. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all remorse or pity, ye pull down the Temple of the Lord with your own hands, and your selves set fire on the Sanctuary, which most noble Kings, and most holy Prophets builded: and besides all this, ye neither spare your sons nor daughters. And although

I be in the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp, yet I am not absent from you, for my most dearly beloved wife is present with you, the wife o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

My dear Father and Mother are also with you, very aged persons: for my Father is at this day a hundred and three years old, and my Mother fourscore and five: but the years of my life are very few, evil, and full of tribulation and sorrow, about three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and seven, neither have I lived yet so long that according to Nature I should desire to die.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, if so be you trust not me, but suppose I have proposed these things to you deceitfully, and that there is no trust of <hi>Titus</hi> Covenant and bond, or that his league should be to your hindrance and discommodity: Go to, if it come to pass, it shall be lawfull for you to kill my Father and Mother, and my Wife. Yea, I swear unto you by the Lord our God, that I shall deliver my life also into your hands, that you may do with me what ye list: and by that means shall the blood of my Parents, my Wives, and mine, be in pledge.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the Ancients of the City come forth, and I will make a league betwixt them and our Lord <hi>Titus.</hi> And doubt ye not, but as hitherto the Lord God would you should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now therefore my brethren, I thought it my part to declare all these things to you, and it is in your power to choose whether you list: for who so will, let him give ear unto me; and who not, let him abstain from my counsell.</p>
               <p>The people hearing these words and sayings of <hi>Joseph</hi> the Priest, wept wonderfully, for they could have been concent to have followed his counsell. At this time <hi>Titus,</hi> gave command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the <hi>Romans,</hi> to send again the <hi>Jews</hi> that were prisoners, and the slaves into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: By what means he shifted from himself the blood of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and laid it upon the necks of their Masters; for <hi>Titus</hi> took pity of them through <hi>Josephs</hi> Oration, and his good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell. The common people of the <hi>Jews</hi> desired nothing more, then to have come forth, and to fall to an agreement, to make peace with <hi>Titus;</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:32499:148"/>
but <hi>Schimeon, Eleazar,</hi> and <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Seditious, set strong watch and ward at every gate, charging them to kill all that should go forth: Thus were many killed which would have fled forth to <hi>Titus,</hi> and the City of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was closed up, and no man could get out nor in. In the mean season fell a great dearth and famine in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> insomuch that the Seditious searched every mans house and cellar for food.</p>
               <p>And because a certain housholder withstood them, they killed him. Thus they dealt with all them that dwelled at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> till the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals in the Town was all spent, that men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to seek dung and even mans excrements to eat, by which means much of the people died for hunger. Whosoever at that time could get any hearbs or roots, mice, serpents, or other creeping worms (whatsoever they were) to eat, he was counted happy, because he had found meat to sustain and save his life withall, in that hard famine, and terrible hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Moreover, whosoever had any corn in store that no man knew of, he was afraid to send it to the mill, or bake it, because of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of the Seditious, lest they should take away from them their sustenance; wherefore many did eat the dry co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>n unground in their cellars privily.</p>
               <p>At that time also were many exceeding rich men in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which stole meat one f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>om another; so that the father snatched meat from
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:32499:148"/>
the son, and the son from the father; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther snatcht from her children, the children likewise from their mother; and such as fled out of the gates, or otherwise, let themselves down over the walls in the night season, who being suspected be to the Seditious persons, the <hi>Romans</hi> killed them without. This evil therefore and distress increased so long, that the people had devoured all that ever crept on the earth, from the mouse to the spider, from the newt to the weesell; whereby a most grievous pestilence followed, that innumerable of the people of the Land died, and there was no man to bury them.</p>
               <p>When they chanced to find any dead horse, or other beast in the Town, a man should see many <hi>Israelites</hi> strive and fight for it; in all points like to famished Ravens lighting upon a dead carcass, so that in such contentions very many were slain. Therefore when divers men with their wives and children, gat out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to gather hearbs to eat, and chanced among the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> laid hold of the little children, and killed them; saying, We will dispatch these, left when they grow once to mans state, they make war upon us as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do at this day. So many as came out of the gates of the City now and then, the <hi>Romans</hi> killed and hanged them upon gallowses, over against the gates of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to the number of five hundred: After the same manner <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon, Jehochanan,</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> dealt with
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:32499:149"/>
those <hi>Romans,</hi> whom they could by any train catch, and hanged them up upon the walls. Whosoever also they could perceive would flee unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> they hanged them likewise over the walls to the number of 500. But <hi>Titus</hi> gave commandment to all his souldiers, that no man, upon pain of death, should kill any of them that fled out of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> For he took pity of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and ceased not to speak friendly, and lovingly to the <hi>Jerosolemites;</hi> so that he went yet once again to the walls, and spake unto the <hi>Jews</hi> in this sort.</p>
               <p>Hear I beseech you the counsel of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and come unto me that you may live, and not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish utterly. Spare your people: why will you oppress them vexed with hunger, thirst, pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and besieging? But the Seditious hearing <hi>Titus</hi> speak, were wonderfully incensed, and intended to add mischief upon mischief, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling yet more cruelly the people of God. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they railed at <hi>Titus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>o provoke him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that he might leave off speaking to the people, which had now almost lost their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and fear of the Seditious.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Seditious spake unto the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> It is better for us to dye with hunger, and to be killed in this affliction, so to come to the bliss, and light we hope for, than to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ive, and see the most holy Temple of God defiled and destroyed. When <hi>Titus</hi> saw this, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an iron-Ram to be set to the wall to batter it, that he might deliver those poor
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:32499:149"/>
wretches out of <hi>Schimeon, Eleazar,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanans</hi> hands, who held them in as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
               <p>At the same time as they erected that Engine to the wall, it hapned there was in the Camp a certain young man whose name was <hi>Memaganin,</hi> son of <hi>Antiochus</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> one of the Kings of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who came at <hi>Vespasians</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to aid <hi>Titus.</hi> The same young man was very swift, a good runner, and a hardy soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, but he lacked discretion. He came to <hi>Titus</hi> and said, I cannot but marvel at thy souldiers that vanquish all Nations, and dare not set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Jews</hi> to kill them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> hearing the young King say so, smiled and said; How chances it, that being of this judgment, thou armest not thy self, and makest thee ready to do like as thou sayest? Why drawest thou not out thy sword to declare thy manhood upon them?</p>
               <p>Wherefore the young King incouraged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and called together all his <hi>Macedonian</hi> soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, then approached to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and began to skirmish with them, shooting with their bows and arrows apace. But at length the <hi>Jews</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them so, that not one of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> escaped, save only the young King, which by his good foot-manship and swift running, gat away, and returned to <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Memaganin</hi> was of the kindred of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the great, King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which had the Dominion of the whole world, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:32499:150"/>
whom all Nations and people stood in awe of. <hi>Josephus</hi> the Priest demanded of him whose son he was? He answered, I came of the seed of <hi>Alexander,</hi> I am the tenth from him. <hi>Joseph</hi> said, It may well be as thou hast said, that thou art of the succession of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> for the valiantness of thy heart that thou hast shewed declareth no less. Howbeit thou shalt understand that the <hi>Romans</hi> have done wisely to abstain from the assault at this time, because they knew they should have to do with a most valiant Nation, which thou having so well tried, mayest report and testify when thou art asked the question.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Titus</hi> divided his whole Army, and layed them privily in ambushes round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the walls. He prepared moreover Rams of Iron to batter the walls. Of these four, one he planted upon the side of the place called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tochia;</hi> the Engine was thirty cubites long. The same night Captain <hi>Jehochanan</hi> with his company issued forth, and undermined the ground under the wheels of the wagons that bare the Rams, putting pitched boards, oyled, and done over with brimstone, in the trenches under the wheels; and under the boards, they spread leather, which likewise was smeared and done over with pitch, oyl, and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
               <p>Then they set fire upon the boards, which burnt till they came to the feet of the Rams: and they being set on fire and burnt, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:32499:150"/>
fell upon the Watch that was appointed to keep it being asleep, and killed them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the <hi>Romans</hi> were much dismayed, and said, It is not possible we should assault this City here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: for they have burnt all our Engins of war, wherewith we have subdued all other Kingdoms: so that now of fifty iron Rams which we brought with us, we have but six left, and the Seditious <hi>Jews</hi> have burnt three of them, what shall we now do? How shall we batter the walls hereafter? The <hi>Jews</hi> upon the walls hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their words flouted them, and laught them to scorn. Wherefore <hi>Titus</hi> incensed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, commanded the other three Rams to be addressed in the place of those which were burnt. In the mean season, while the <hi>Romans</hi> were at work, four young men moved with great zeal, whose names were, first <hi>Thopatius Galileus,</hi> then <hi>Magarus Chebronita,</hi> the third <hi>Jorminus Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronita,</hi> the fourth <hi>Arius Jerosolymita.</hi> These all armed, issued out of the Camp of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that then stood about their three Engins and iron Rams, devising how to batter the walls of the City; of whom, some these young men kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the other fled. Then two of them stood at defence to keep off all them that approached nigh the Engins, whilethe other two, <hi>Jerusolymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> and <hi>Schomronita</hi> daubed the timber, with a certain matter which they had prepared to make it take fire, and straightway set fire upon them, so that suddenly the Rams were on a light fire, Then they all four joyning together withstood
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:32499:151"/>
the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they should not come at the Engins to quench the fire. Shortly the <hi>Rams</hi> fell down, and the <hi>Romans</hi> stood aloof, hurling stones and shooting thick at them: for they were afraid to come nigh them, because of their great fierceness, although they were three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men that kept the Rams. Yet these four set nothing by them, nor yet never went off the ground, till the Rams were clean burnt up, shot the <hi>Romans</hi> never so thick at them. <hi>Titus</hi> hearing the valiantness of these young men, and the harms they had done unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> made speed with his whole Hoste to save the Rams from the fire, and to apprehend those young men. Then forthwith issued out <hi>Schime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Jehochanan,</hi> and <hi>Eleazar,</hi> Captains of the Seditious, with their souldiers, sounding their Trumpets, and made the <hi>Romans</hi> retire, that they could not come nigh the fire, and so res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued the four young men from the <hi>Romans</hi> that had environed them round about.</p>
               <p>In that skirmish were killed ten thousand and five hundred men. Then gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the whole Army of the <hi>Romans</hi> to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the <hi>Jews</hi> at once, approaching hard to the walls of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where they cryed unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> saying; What, are you Oxen or Goats, that you fight on this fashion upon the Walls? Will you be taken in the midst of the City, like as Oxen and Goats are taken in their folds? If ye be men, come forth and let us try our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood here in this Plain. But you by stealth and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:32499:151"/>
at unawares set upon them that keep our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, snatching them up like as it were wolves should snatch sheep, then run away into the Town, as the wolves run into the Wood, If there be any manhood in you, behold we are ready here, come forth to us, so many for so many, and then we shall see what end will come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. When the Captains of the Seditious heard that, they spake unto the warriours that were in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> Which of you will go out with us to these dogs, to shew our force and stomachs, for the Sanctuary and City of the Lord? Then five hundred tall fellows of their own accord, issued out upon the <hi>Romans</hi> suddenly, and slue eight thousand men, and compelled the rest to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the walls. The <hi>Romans</hi> then felt what valiantness the <hi>Jews</hi> had; for the <hi>Romans</hi> were in number fourty thousand fighting men, and the <hi>Jews</hi> were only five hundred, whereof not one of them was killed in that skirmish.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> a far off shot at the <hi>Jews,</hi> and hurled stones; to whom the <hi>Jews</hi> said; Come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to us, are you not they that called us forth, and provoked us to come to you? why come ye not now nearer? you go about to drive us away with arrows and stones. What do you think us to be dogs, and that we are afraid of your stones? Are we not men, yea, we are your Masters and betters, for you r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:32499:152"/>
                  <hi>he cried to his people, saying:</hi> Is it not a shame for you, ye <hi>Romans,</hi> and a wonderfull great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, to flee from the <hi>Jews,</hi> so hunger beaten, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished, almost dead for thirst, and besieged? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, how shall ye put away this your rebuke, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy? When as all Nations, which heretofore ye have most valiantly subdued, shall hear that ye flee from these dead <hi>Jews,</hi> whose whole Land we h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Besides this, they are very few, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable; they have no Nation to aid them, we have help of all Lands: Why then do ye flee from their sight, like as small impotent birds flee from the Eagle. What though the <hi>Jews</hi> vow and hazard themselves desperately for their Temple and Land; why do you not the same also in these wars, to get you a renown of valiantness.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Jews</hi> prevailed that day, and had the upper hand; wherefore they returned into the Town with great glory, having put the <hi>Romans</hi> to so great a foil. <hi>Titus</hi> commanded his to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress and prepare the other two Rams that were left, to batter the walls of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> withall: Wherefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Carpenters cast a trench, to prepare and set up the Rams in such places as <hi>Titus</hi> had assigned them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were aware of it well enough, but winked at that matter as yet, untill they had planted the master beams between the standing posts. So when the work was finished, even to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:32499:152"/>
the hanging up of the Engins betwixt the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding posts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o shake the wall withall; the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> being secure and void of care, nothing mistrusting that the <hi>Jews</hi> would stir, because they had been quiet a few nights, and never is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued forth of the City: Upon a certain night, a pretty while before day, the three principall Captains of the Seditious, came and cast their heads together, to devise what they should do. <hi>Eleazar</hi> gave this counsell, and said; You two the last time issued out, and burnt three Rams, and got you renown, and I kept the gates the while; now keep ye the gates, and I will issue out with my men against the <hi>Romans</hi> to get me a name also.</p>
               <p>The other answered, Go then on Gods name unto them, the Lord God of the Sanctuary which is in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall be present with thee, but beware thou be not slain, and in any wise thou be not taken alive; to whom he answered, The Lord God shall keep me, for upon the trust of the righteousness of my father <hi>Ananias</hi> the high Priest, and his sincere service unto God, I will set upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleazar</hi> therefore chose 100. valiant soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and with them he issued out of the Town before day: The same night the <hi>Romans</hi> had made fires about their Engines where they watched, because of the cold: The Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and souldiers that kept the watch and ward about the <hi>Romans,</hi> were in number a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty. The day was the 27. of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:32499:153"/>
month of <hi>September,</hi> which was the ninth month that <hi>Titus</hi> had besieged <hi>Jerusalem. Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> and his company thus being issued out, came and found some of the <hi>Romans</hi> snorting about the fires, other watching in their wards, and killed them all, that not one remained. Then some of <hi>Eleazars</hi> Company set fire upon the Rams, burnt the standing posts, ropes, chains, and other instruments of war; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers that were there, they apprehended alive and burnt them, so that no man escaped.</p>
               <p>When it was day, <hi>Titus</hi> observed the smoak of the fire, mounting up very foul, and stinking of the wood and men together; he drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place therefore with his Host, to see what the matter was: <hi>Eleazar</hi> in the mean sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and his company, took as they might get, every man a piece of the Engins out of the fire, or some of their heads that they had killed, and returned with great joy, flouting the <hi>Romans,</hi> and laughing them to scorn by the way, till they came to the gates of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where they were received of <hi>Schimeon,</hi> and <hi>Jehochanan</hi> with great honour.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, came many souldiers and great bands of men out of all Nations, that were subject to the Empire of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to aid <hi>Titus;</hi> to whom <hi>Titus</hi> declared what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him in that siege, the stoutness of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and how they had annoyed many waies the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> army, adding moreover and asking them; Did you ever see four men withstand
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:32499:153"/>
ten thousand, and five hundred, so that they being all together, could neither overthrow them, nor take them prisoners? but the four slew them, like as it had been tops of Coucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers smitten off with most sharp swords? When they heard this, they wondred all very much. Then <hi>Titus</hi> spake unto his host, and to them which were newly repaired unto him, to shew their advice and best counsel what was to be done, lest we should be ashamed (saith he) before all them that shall hereafter hear of our Wars.</p>
               <p>The gravest and most ancient of the Nations that were newly come to his aid, answered; If it please your Majesty, let the <hi>Romans</hi> breath a while and take their rest, which are now wearied with the sundry battels of the Jews: and we, who are not so broken with labour, but fresh and lusty, shall try what the <hi>Jews</hi> can do; we cannot think that they are able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand so great a multitude.</p>
               <p>But the Princes of the <hi>Romans</hi> desired <hi>Titus</hi> that he should not permit them this, lest he should increase their own sorrows, if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they should be discomfited (say they) of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the matter redound unto their own shame. For if we which are acquainted with them, and know their manner of fight, cannot sustain their violence, How shall they do it that never had proof of the strength and force of the <hi>Jews?</hi> They shall be to them like Hyssop which groweth upon the walls, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:32499:154"/>
of the Cedar-trees of <hi>Libanus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other said, nay, they should do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with them. And they urged <hi>Titus</hi> so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, that they constrained him to grant them their desire. Then <hi>Titus</hi> gave them leave to set upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> thinking with himself, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the <hi>Jews</hi> may be put to the worse of these men that will fight without fear, not knowing the force of the <hi>Jews:</hi> for the <hi>Romans</hi> that have had trial of their strength, fight fearfully and warily. So the Lords of the strange Nations, chose out of their Armies eighty thousand men; Ten thousand <hi>Macedonians,</hi> twenty thousand <hi>Britains,</hi> five thousand <hi>Aramites,</hi> ten thousand <hi>Africans,</hi> ten thousand valiant <hi>Burgundians,</hi> five thousand <hi>Redarans;</hi> last of all, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> These therefore went into the Plain which is by the Sepulcher of <hi>Jehochanan</hi> the high Priest, and from thence made an assault upon the <hi>Jews</hi> that were upon the Walls, setting up their scaling ladders. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan</hi> said to <hi>Schimeon</hi> and <hi>Eleazar,</hi> his two Companions; If you think good, I will issue forth, and skirmish with these uncircumcised, to let them see what I can do. <hi>Schimeon</hi> answered, Let two of us do it, and the third keep the gates and walls; for thou alone art able to do nothing against them, they are so many. <hi>Eleazar</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this advice, offering himself to bear <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan</hi> company. <hi>Schimeon</hi> bad them go, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Lord of the Sanctuary give them into your hands, and deal not with you at
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:32499:154"/>
this time according to your works.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Jehochanan</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> issued with one thousand five hundred good men of War, the ninth day of the moneth <hi>Tebeth,</hi> which was the tenth moneth that <hi>Titus</hi> had besieged <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and overthrew of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of that host fifty seven thousand and five hundred men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides three thousand whom they took prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: but of the <hi>Jews</hi> were no more slain in that fight than only seven, whose bodies with much rejoycing and great triumph they carried with them into the Town, and buried them there, lest peradventure the uncircumcised should have misordered them. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were left, with great shame and dishonour returned unto <hi>Titus,</hi> who reprehended them because they would not believe the <hi>Romans.</hi> The next day following, the <hi>Jews</hi> brought forth the three thousand Nobles and Gentlemen that they had taken prisoners, and plucked out of every one of them an eye, and cut off every man the one hand, after sent them back with shame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to <hi>Titus</hi>'s Camp.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Titus</hi> consulted with all his Princes what were best to do with the <hi>Israelites:</hi> and when every man had said his mind, he liked ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a mans counsel, but said unto them; Well, I have devised this with my self, which I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and no man shall bring me from my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: we will keep the siege without any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault or skirmish, for their victuals failed them long ago, and so they shall be famished.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:32499:155"/>
Besides this, when they shall see us cease to fight with them, they will fall at variance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, and kill one another.</p>
               <p>This counsel was thought good of all <hi>Titus</hi>'s Princes, wherefore they besieged the Town as <hi>Titus</hi> commanded, and closed up all the wayes of the City round about, lest the <hi>Jews</hi> should as they had done before, come upon them unawares. They appointed moreover, watch day and night, to take heed that no man should come out of the Town to gather herbs for their sustenance.</p>
               <p>Then encreased the hunger in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which if it had not been so grievous, the City had never been won: for the souldiers of the Town were lighter than Eagles, and fiercer than Lions. There died therefore of the famine wonderful many of the <hi>Jerusolemites,</hi> so that the <hi>Jews</hi> could not find place to bury them in, they were so many in every place of the Town. Many cast their dead folks into their Wells, and tumbled afterwards in themselves and died. Many also made themselves graves, and went into them alive, where they tarried day and night and died unmourned-for. For all mourning and accustomed lamentation for the dead was left off, because of the unmeasurable famine, which was so great that it cannot be told, and I cannot relate the thousandth part of the mischief that followed of the hunger. <hi>Titus</hi> seeing the innumerable carkases of the dead that were cast into the Brook <hi>Cedron</hi> like
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:32499:155"/>
dung, was wonderfully amazed with fear, and stretched out his hands toward heaven, saying, <hi>Lord God of Heaven and Earth, whom the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites believe in, cleanse me from this sin, which surely I am not the cause of: for I required peace of them, but they refused it, and they themselves are cause of this mischief, they have sinned against their own souls and lives: I beseech thee, impute it not to me for a sin, that the</hi> Jews <hi>die on this manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time, certain wicked persons of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> slandered <hi>Amittai</hi> the Priest falsely, saying to Captain <hi>Schimeon,</hi> Behold, <hi>Amittai</hi> the high Priest, which did let thee into the City, goeth about to flee to the Tents of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Thou hast experience of his great wit and wisdom, how he also knoweth all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wayes into the Town, Temple, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary; and who can tell whether he will bring the <hi>Romans</hi> some night at midnight into the City? Therefore <hi>Schimeon</hi> sent certain to fetch <hi>Amittai</hi> and his four sons unto him.</p>
               <p>They that were sent, brought <hi>Amittai</hi> and but three of his sons, for one was fled to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and came to <hi>Joseph.</hi> When <hi>Amittai</hi> with the other were brought to <hi>Schimeons</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, he besought him he might not live, but to be put to death by and by, lest (saith he) I should live to see the death of my children. But <hi>Schimeon</hi> was hard-hearted, and would not be intreated: for it was Gods will that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittai</hi> should be punished, because he was the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:32499:156"/>
bringer of <hi>Schimeon</hi> into <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fell he into his hands, which for good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him with evil. <hi>Schimeon</hi> commanded a sort of murderers to place <hi>Amittai</hi> upon the walls in the sight of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and said unto him; Seest thou, <hi>Amittai?</hi> Why do not the <hi>Romans</hi> deliver and rescue thee out of my hands? thee I say, which wouldest have fled away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? <hi>Amittai</hi> answered nothing to this, but still besought him before his death, he might kisse his sons, and bid them farewell; but <hi>Schimeon</hi> utterly denied him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Amittai</hi> wept aloud, saying to his sons; I brought (dear children), I brought this thief into this Town<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, wherefore I am counted now for a thief my self: All the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which is come upon me, and you, it is mine own doing, because I have brought this sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious villain into this holy City; I thought then, Peradventure he will be a help to the Town, but it is proved contrary; for he hath been a most cruel enemy to the same. It was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us to keep one seditious person, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan,</hi> I mean, which took unto him <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> the first beginner of sedition; but I must bring in also this wicked <hi>Schimeon,</hi> which is joyned to our foes to destroy us. Indeed I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brought him in for any love that I bare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but all the Priests and the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the people sent me to fetch him; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, I am worthy of this just judgement of God, because I took upon me such an embassage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:32499:156"/>
What should I speak of thee, thou most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Schimeon,</hi> for whithersoever thou turnest thee, thou bringest all things out of frame: Indeed, thou dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>est justly with me, because I have sinned unto God, to his people, and his City, in that I have brought thee in, to be a plague to it; wherefore I am worthy to be stoned. Notwithstanding, it had been thy part, thou wicked murderer, to deliver me and my sons from the hands of the other Seditious, for I have wrought them displeasure; but to thee have I done good: Howbeit our God will not alter, nor change his judgements, which is, that I should fall into the sword of thy hand, for that I made thee to enter into this City, wherein I offended God grievously. If I had purposed to flee unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> could I not have done it before I brought in thee? for at that time bearedst thou no rule over us, and before we called in thee, <hi>Jehochanan</hi> with his sedition, was an offence unto this City; Wherefore we perswaded all the Ancients of the Town, that thou shouldest be an aid unto us, to drive out our foes: but thou in whom we put our trust, art become our enemy: yea, thou hast been worse than they; for the other put men to death privily, thou dost it openly. Who is he that hath strengthened the power of the <hi>Romans?</hi> Art not thou he which hast killed the Souldiers of God in the midst of the City of <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> for few have been slain without. <hi>Titus</hi> would have made peace with us, taking
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:32499:157"/>
pity upon us, but thou didst lett and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, every day moving new Wars, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring new battels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> gave charge to his souldiers, to lay no hand upon the Temple; but thou hast pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and defiled the Temple of the Lord, shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding blood without measure in the midst there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Titus</hi> went back from us upon the holy day of the Lord, and ceased from fighting; saying, Go and observe your holy Feasts in peace: but thou unhallowedst the Feasts of the Lord, and puttedst out the continual fire with innocent blood? All these evils which thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (thou murderer) are imputed unto me, because I brought thee into the Town: Now therefore this vengeance is appointed to mine age by the Lord God, and by thy hands shall I go to my grave with sorrow, because I by my foolishnesse was an actor in this mischief that is wrought by thee. Albeit now, thou wicked <hi>Schimeon,</hi> in this that thou killest me, ere that mine eyes may see the burning of the Temple, it pleaseth me very well. But what needest thou, murderer, to put my sons to death before my face? Why doest thou not spare mine age? would God that as I shall not see the burning of the Temple, so also I might not see the blood of my children shed before my face. But what shall I do, when God hath delivered me into the hands of a most wicked man? We that were the ancients of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> abhorred <hi>Jehochanan</hi> because he murdered old men without all
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:32499:157"/>
reverence, but he slew no young men; thou destroyest old and young, great and small, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pity or mercy: <hi>Jehochanan</hi> mourned for the dead, and buried them also; but thou playest upon instruments at their burials, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to the Lute, and soundest the Trumpet.</p>
               <p>Then spake he to <hi>Schimeons</hi> servant, who was ready with a sword in his hand, and an axe, to kill him, and to cut off his head; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Go to now, and execute <hi>Schimeon</hi> thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's commandment; Behead the sons in the sight of their father, and let me hear the voice of thy cruelty in my sons, which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I forgive thee; for as I shall hear and see that, against my will; so, I dare say, thou kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest them not willingly. Would God that <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> would suffer me to kisse my sons, and whiles I am yet living to embrace them ere they die. But thou, gentle minister, in one thing shew thy pity towards me, that when thou hast put my sons and me to Execution, separate not our bodies, neither lay their corps asunder from mine, but so, that my body may lie uppermost and cover theirs, to defend them from the fowls of the air, lest they devour my sons bodies; for it so may come to passe, that they may be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: I beseech thee also, that my mouth and lips when I am dead, may touch my sons faces, that so I may both embrace and kisse them.</p>
               <p>But what do I delay, or linger any longer, seeing the enemies deny me this, to kisse them vvhiles vve are yet alive? See thou therefore
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:32499:158"/>
that our bodies be not severed, and if <hi>Schimeon</hi> will not permit this, that our bodies may be joyned in this world, yet can he not lett our Souls to be joyned; for after I shall be once dead, I doubt not but I shall see the Light of the Lord. His sons hearing their fathers words, began to weep very sore with their father, who said unto them, Alas my sons! Why weepye? What avail tears? Why do ye not rather go before me, and I will follow as I may? For, what should I do now, seeing God hath given me into the hands of a most cruel Tyrant, who spareth neither mine age, nor your youth? But I trust we shall live together in the Light of the Lord: And although I cannot be suffered now to see you enough, yet when we shall come thither, we shall be satisfied with beholding one another.</p>
               <p>Go ye therefore, my dear sons, and prepare us a place. O that I might go before you: the Lord knoweth I would do it gladly. But ye my sons, marvel not at this that is chanced unto us, for it is no new thing.

               <p>Therefore be of good comfort (my sons,) and lament not for my sake.

               <p>Then said <hi>Amittai</hi> to <hi>Schimeons</hi> servant which should kill him, Make speed, I pray thee, and kill me first before my children die, then after kill them also, that we may die together: for it is more expedient for us, than to see the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord turned into a butchery or slaughter-house to slay men in.</p>
               <p>After cryed he to God, saying, I beseech thee, O Lord God most High, which dwellest in the Highest, judge this <hi>Schimeon</hi> according to his works, reward him according to his deservings. For thou art the God Almighty and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Let not this Destroyer die therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people of thy pasture: but that his

               <p>To the intent therefore that thy judgements may be declared in him, I beseech thee, make him to be taken Captive of his enemies, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his wife, children, and family, and all that ever love him. Neither give unto his soul any part with the people of God; nor let his portion be with the just men in thy Sanctuary; for he is unworthy of them, because he hath not only sinned himself, but hath caused <hi>Israel</hi> to sin. Wherefore let his judgement and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence go forth from thy sight, that he may see his Wife, Children, and his whole House, led into captivity and bondage before his face.

               <p>After these words, <hi>Amittai</hi> said to the servant who was appointed to kill him: I beseech thee, Let me find so much favour at thy hands, that when thou hast slain my sons, thou wouldst kill me with the same sword, while it is yet wet with the blood of my sons, that our blood may be mingled; and this may be a recreation to my soul. Kill me also in the fight of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they may avenge me and my sons, upon this most cruel <hi>Schimeon;</hi> they shall be witnesses against him, that I was not their friend. But would God my affaires were all in that state as they were before; for then should they perceive me to be an enemy of <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meons,</hi> and a friend of theirs. Would God I had withstood <hi>Schimeon</hi> at the first earnestly, as I made War upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> that I might have avoided his cruelty from the people of God. When he had said all these things, he prayed before God Almighty, saying, <hi>O God which dwellest in the Highest, thou only art most mighty and fearful, open now the eyes of thy judgements, consider and judge betwixt me and seditious</hi> Schimeon, <hi>whose malice is become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable upon the people of GOD, that he which sheddeth the blood of them that fear thee in the midst of the Temple, may be rebuked of thee with rebukings, according to his works: make speedy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and prolong not, and that for the deaths sake of thy Saints; for thy judgements are the judgements of truth.</hi>

Then <hi>Schimeon</hi> gave commandment to four Cut-throats of his, that three of them should kill <hi>Amittai</hi>'s three sons before their Fathers face, and the fourth should kill <hi>Amittai</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so the blood of the sons was mixt with the blood of their father. Afterward <hi>Schimeons</hi> servant took the body of <hi>Amittai,</hi> and laid it upon the bodies of his sons, as his desire was, then tumbled them over the Walls: After that, <hi>Schimeon</hi> commanded that <hi>Chanacus</hi> the high Priest should be put to death, whose body was cast unto the bodies of <hi>Amittai</hi> and his Sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristus</hi> also the Scribe, one of the Noble men of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was killed at the same time, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Certain seditious persons hearing this, told it unto <hi>Schimeon,</hi> who commanded them to be apprehended, and murthered the same day.</p>
               <p>After this, there passed by eleven of the Noble men of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which seeing four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two innocents to be put to death by <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi> they lift up their eyes to the heavens, and said, <hi>O Lord God of Israel, How long wilt</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Eleazar</hi> the son of <hi>Anani</hi> the Priest, seeing the malice and wickednesse of <hi>Schimeon</hi> to be great, and that he destroyed the just and godly men of the City, and that there was no hope left, he betook himself to the Tower of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> remained in it, and kept it with his. <hi>Jehu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> also, a Captain over a thousand men, which kept a Turret that <hi>Schimeon</hi> had made to put just and good men in, got him upon the top of the walls, and cryed to the <hi>Romans,</hi> if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they would deliver him, and the rest that were at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Wherefore he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to escape with his one thousand men that he had with him, and came towards the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> But the <hi>Romans</hi> trusted them not, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had spoken this for deceit, wherefore they came not to help him. <hi>Schimeon</hi> upon this killed <hi>Jehudas,</hi> and the thousand men which he had with him, and commanded their bodies to be tumbled over the walls, in the sight of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Schimeon</hi> cryed to the Princes and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the <hi>Romans,</hi> saying: Lo, these are <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hudas</hi> company, these would have come forth unto you, take their carcases to you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive them again if you can, or else deliver the rest which yet live, out of our hands.</p>

                  <hi>Gorion</hi> the Priest, father of <hi>Joseph</hi> the Priest, who wrot this Book to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> was at that time in bonds and prison, in a certain Turret, a man of great age, being a hundred and thirty, and no man could come unto him, nor from him; <hi>Joseph</hi> therefore went to the Turret where his father was kept, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how he did. He beheld also the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret afar off, if he might espv his father, and comfort him. And as he passed by looking up to the Turret, the Seditious hurled a stone at him, which hit him on the head, that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him. The Seditious seeing <hi>Joseph</hi> cast out of his Chariot, determined to go down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; but when <hi>Titus</hi> had knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he sent a great strength to help him up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and to defend him, that his enemies did him no wrong.</p>
               <p>The Seditious, going about to take <hi>Joseph,</hi> sounded a Trumpet very loud, which when <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> mother that was kept in <hi>Schimeons</hi> house heard, being now 87 years of age, asked what was the cause of the hurly burly; they told her that the Seditious issued out at that shout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Joseph</hi> to take him: When she heard that, by and by she run out of the house that she was kept in, and climbed up the walls, as lustily as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and that I should not be suffered to see him, and to bury him? I had trusted he should have buried me, and that he should have been a help to me in mine age; and when my whole Family by the Seditious was almost made away, and extinguished, yet I said, This shall comfort me. Now therefore, what shall I do, when I have none left to comfort me, of all my children that I bare; for between the Seditious and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles our enemies, they have slain 18. sons that I had; and what shall I do now from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, but covet death, for I desire not to live now any longer? And how should I receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny consolation, when I see my son dead, and I cannot bury him? Lord! that I might dye by and by, for I cannot live any longer, since my son <hi>Joseph</hi> is now dead.</p>
               <p>She went up yet further upon the walls, till she came to the Turret where her husband was in prison, and stretch't out her hands towards heaven, crying with a loud voyce, O my son <hi>Joseph,</hi> my son, Where art thou? come and speak unto me, and comfort me. The Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearing her, laught her to scorn; but the <hi>Romans</hi> when they heard her, and understood by <hi>Joseph</hi> that it was his mother, they wept and lamented her case, and many of the <hi>Jews</hi> also that were in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> but they were fain to refrain it, lest they should be perceived of <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meons</hi> cruell cut-throats.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Josephs</hi> mother said to the Seditious that were with her upon the walls, Why do ye

She answered, How sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>These, and such like, while she reasoned wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Seditious heard, and mocked her: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she wept the more abundantly, so that the <hi>Romans,</hi> and some godly men, hearing her wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, could not abstain from weeping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joseph</hi> when he heard the voice of his Mother, got on armour, and approached to the wall, accompanied with most valiant <hi>Romans,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him from the arrows of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and spake to his Mother.</p>
               <p>Fear not, my dear Mother, nor take any thought for me, for I have escaped the hands of the Seditious, God hath not suffered me to come into their hands: wherefore I have

heard the words of these wicked counsellours, that advised thee to kill thy self, and thine answer to them, which before thou gavest them I knew thou wouldest answer: God forbid, say I, God forbid, that <hi>Josephs</hi> Mother and the Wife of <hi>Gorion,</hi> should consent to the counsel of the wicked. Wherefore, (my dear Mother) be content, and bear the yoke of the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous patiently, and humble thy self before them: <hi>Neither strive against the miseries and calamities of this time, which thou caust not alter, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</hi> For they shall perish, but we shall stand and continue.</p>
               <p>There were certain men of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at that time, that came to the Gates, overcame the Ward, and got out with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and so escaped to the <hi>Romans,</hi> because they could no longer abide the famine, and the iniquity of the Seditious. They were faithful Citizens, and of great authority; whom when <hi>Joseph</hi> heard of, he so prevailed, that <hi>Titus</hi> spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, and received them to mercy.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Joseph</hi> bare witnesse, and reported of them, that they were Noble men of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> wherefore the <hi>Romans</hi> received them, and gave them food and sustenance; but certain of them could not brook nor take it, because of their great hunger wherewith they had been long pined, and when the meat descended down into their bellies, they died straight. Their little Children also, when they saw bread, they fell upon it, and received it indeed
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:32499:163"/>
with their teeth, but they were not able to chew it, and died holding the bread between their teeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> seeing them die when they tasted the meat, had pity and compassion upon them, and was very sorry, saying unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> What shall I do for thy people, which assoon as they begin to eat, die straightway? <hi>Joseph</hi> answered, My Lord, I remember I have seen this experience, that they which fast long, and after would take meat, first they must drink a little sodden milk, or else eat of a certain corn called <hi>Simel,</hi> sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in milk, wherewith they strengthen their bowels before they take meat; especially such as walked through wildernesses, whose bowells were long empty, when they came to places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited and found meat, they were wont to use this means.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Titus</hi> commanded his men to do as <hi>Joseph</hi> bad them, whereby many of the <hi>Jews</hi> recovered, and many died of the flux. These <hi>Jews</hi> which escaped thus out of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to the Camps of the <hi>Romans</hi> had swallowed their Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, to hide them, lest they should be found of the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p>They therefore which recovered and broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked meat, when they would satisfie Nature, they went alone out of the Camp, and after sought their Gold and Silver and precious Stones, which were digested in their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and so did they every day. At length
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:32499:163"/>
certain <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> espying the <hi>Jews</hi> to use this fashion, told it amongst their fellows, one to another, and made a conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to lay wait for the <hi>Jews,</hi> and whomsoever they got, they ript their bellies, to find the Gold and other Jewels which the <hi>Jews</hi> had hid there. And by this means the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> had murthered two thousand <hi>Jews.</hi> But when <hi>Titus</hi> heard of this he was wonderful wroth, and commanded them to be apprehended that had done this wicked deed, and to be put to death, whose goods were given to the <hi>Jews</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alive. They that were put to death for this fact, were two thousand <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> together.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Titus</hi> espyed the Princes and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to have decked their Armour with Gold and Silver, some of them also to wear Golden Scepters, and some Scepters of Silver, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ornaments upon their heads: he called them together, and said unto them, Lay away this vain ostentation, these things are they that provoked the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> to work this wickedness, against these poor miserable <hi>Jews</hi> which fled forth unto us, that they might live under our protection. The captains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and Princes of the <hi>Romans</hi> hearing <hi>Titus</hi> commandment were obedient, and straight laid away from them those Ornaments of Gold and Silver. <hi>Titus</hi> also gave commandment, that the rest of the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Aramites</hi> shou d be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the Camp, and that no man hereafter
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:32499:164"/>
should commit any such haynous deed against the <hi>Jews.</hi> Notwithstanding, when as any <hi>Aramite</hi> or <hi>Arabian</hi> could get any <hi>Jew</hi> far out of the Camp that no man might see it, he killed him.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Camp, no man either did, or said, any evil unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> save cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ungodly Ruffians, which had learned of the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> those evil and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked pranks: for they also when they chanced to meet with any <hi>Jew</hi> out of the Camp, if there were no man by, they killed him, and took away his Gold and Silver that lay hid in his bowels.</p>
               <p>When this came to <hi>Titus</hi>'s ear, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make Proclamation in this wise: Whosoever he be that hath seen, heard, or known any thing of this horrible deed, which is committed of certain <hi>Romans</hi> upon the Jews; or whosoever hath done any such thing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, let him come and make relation unto <hi>Titus,</hi> which if he do, the matter shall be forgiven him, if not, he shall bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his own wickednesse, and stand at his peril, if any thing be proved against him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Therefore certain <hi>Romans</hi> who were consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themselves that they had committed the deed, and being afraid of <hi>Titus,</hi> reasoned with themselves thus: If we do not confesse unto him the truth, he will by his wisdom search out these offenders, and punish them to death; Wherefore trusting unto <hi>Titus</hi>'s words of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:32499:164"/>
the Proclamation, they came all, whosoever had either done it himself, or known other to do it; and declared it to <hi>Titus,</hi> saying, This have I done, This have I known, This was I accessary unto, and have not hitherto made thee privy thereunto. There were of them in number 320<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> men, that made this Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; All those <hi>Titus</hi> commanded to be cast into hot Ovens, and to be burned. This done, the <hi>Jews</hi> were more safe ever after in the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp without any jeopardy, no man hurting them, either in word or deed; yea, if any <hi>Roman</hi> found a <hi>Jew</hi> abroad wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he conducted him gently and peaceably into the Camp.</p>
               <p>There was a certain Scribe of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at that time, a faithful man, whose name was <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachen,</hi> son of <hi>Seruk</hi> the Scribe, whose Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours had served <hi>Esdras</hi> the Scribe of worthy memory, in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and being a keeper of the East gate which was in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> upon that side towards the Brook <hi>Kidron,</hi> noted the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the dead that were carried forth to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying by that Gate, and found they came to 115. thousand, eight hundred and eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which were all of the Nobles and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; or, at least, of the substantiallest men of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> upon a time (<hi>Joseph</hi> being present) asked the question of those Princes of the <hi>Jews</hi> which were fled unto him, saying, I charge you upon your fidelity, to shew me how

many <hi>Jews</hi> be dead in the Town, since the time I besieged it to this day. They gave him the number therefore, every man as far as they knew, of the dead that were carried forth at all the gates to be buried, and the sum amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to 700575. besides them that every where lay dead in the houses and streets; and besides them also that were slain in the Temple, and they that lay here and there unburied: Which when <hi>Titus</hi> heard, he marvelled greatly, and said, It is well known to the Lord God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that I am not the cause of these evils, for I desired to be at peace with them oftner than once, but the Seditious evermore would have nothing but War War.</p>

               <p>AT that time the hunger began to wax ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great in the Town', amongst the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, who never lackt before, for they took it alwaies from other men by force, till now at length they were distressed with hunger them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so that after they had eaten up all their horses, they ate also their dung, and the leather of the Chariots; neither was there left any green Boughes on the trees, nor any herbs, that the Seditious might get to eat.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Romans</hi> had hewed down all the trees, and cut down all the bushes round about <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:32499:165"/>
by the space of thirteen miles, so that the whole field and territory of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which heretofore was replenished with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous goodly gardens, and most pleasant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radises.</p>
               <p>After that the <hi>Romans</hi> made up another Iron Ram, very terrible; this they bended against the walls, to see if there were any souldiers left in the Town, so stout as they were in times past: When the Captains of the Seditious saw that, they issued out with their companies against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and slue very many of them in that skirmish. Wherefore <hi>Titus</hi> said, It is not wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to fight with them any more, but rather with the Rams to shake and batter the wall, for they have no more but this wall left, and so we may bring our whole Army at once upon them, and subdue the Seditious.</p>
               <p>This counsell of <hi>Titus</hi> was liked of all the Princes and people. The Captains of the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mistrusting what the <hi>Romans</hi> intended, that they would be occupied hereafter in battering the wall, began to build a countermure within, overgainst the place where the <hi>Romans</hi> wrought with their Ram, which was in the Plain by the Tomb of <hi>Jochanan</hi> the high Priest, for there was none other place besides, that they might approach unto with their Rams; and there the Rams had m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Seditious made this Countermure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not able to burn the Iron Ram
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:32499:166"/>
as they had done before, being now almost fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished, and so pin'd away, that they could scarce stand upon their Legs. For if they had been so lusty as they were before, and able to set the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines on fire, the <hi>Romans</hi> had never been able to win the Town, but should have been compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to leave the assault, as they were constrained to give over skirmishing and fighting. On a certain time, when the <hi>Romans</hi> fled, the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, pursuing and killing many of them, said, The <hi>Romans</hi> will be weary, leave off their siege, and go their waies, that we may dwell at liberty, and turn to the Lord our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And when they returned at this time (or at any other time) prosperously into the Town, they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the people more cruelly, exacting food of them, and saying, Give us meat, if ye will not, we will eat your flesh, and your sons. But the <hi>Romans</hi> took courage to themselves to fight stoutly, and said one to another; Let us stick to it hard, and be valiant in our fights: it shall be a shame for us to flee from these feeble and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-starved Jews, which are more like dead Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, than living persons. Therefore they began most earnestly to set upon the walls, and to make a battery: suddenly, they beat down a great part of that inner wall which the <hi>Jews</hi> had newly erected, and gave a great shout, saying, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is won, we have gotten the Town. But when they looked a little further, they espyed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countermure raised over against the breach: Wherefore the <hi>Jews</hi> thorow the Town gave
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:32499:166"/>
also a great shout, and sounded their Trumpets, rejoycing that they had another new Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure for that which was battered down. The same was in Captains <hi>Jehochanans</hi> Ward. The <hi>Romans</hi> seeing the countermure, and hearing the <hi>Jews</hi> make such triumphs in the Town, were much astonied, all their joy was dashed and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into dumps, so that they could not tell what they should do with that stubborn people of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> which had done them such damages. The <hi>Romans</hi> set upon the Town again another way, whom <hi>Titus</hi> willed to remove the Engine, and to bend it to the new wall, whiles it was yet green and unsetled, saying; Let us batter it and we shall see it fall by and by, and then shall we enter the Town. The <hi>Roman</hi> Captains followed not <hi>Titus</hi> counsell, but scaled the walls which they had battered. The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Countermure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Then said some of the <hi>Romans,</hi> We will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver besiege this Town any longer, for we shall not be able to get it while we live. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us break up and depart, before we be all destroyed with this siege: for except we do so, we shall be consumed therein. <hi>Titus</hi> seei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>g his souldiers to make so hard a matter of the winning of the Town, called them all together, and said unto them; <hi>Tell me now, ye</hi> Roman
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:32499:167"/>
Captains, do ye not know that all wars and other business whatsoever they be, are more hard, and require greater diligence in the end, then in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning? In which who so travel, if they faint in the end, do they not labour in vain? Even as your labour shall be in vain, if ye give over the siege now.</p>
               <p>Consider a Ship, when it hath compassed the whole Sea, and is now ready to arrive at the shore, being troubled with a Tempest, if the Mariners should then be negligent, the Ship may be easily lost, and all they which are in it perish, the Mariners disappointed of their purpose, in that they shall not attain unto the place which they coveted to come unto.</p>
               <p>Likewise builders, if they finish not their work, but leave off afore they make an end, is not all their labour lost and spent in vain? Husbandmen also, if they till their ground, and then sow it with seed, shall they not lose their pains, unless they will also mow it?</p>
               <p>In like manner, you have fought very long against this City, many valiant Captains and worthy men have been slain, and now you may see the strongest walls of the Town are broken and made equall with the earth, the people your adversaries consumed with hunger, pestilence and sword: what shall it then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail you all that ever you have done, if you slack your diligence, and will not finish the work of the siege? Have ye not then imployed your labour in vain? And why should this new wall so dismay you? Yea, why do you not prepare your selves to beat down this new Wall, which yet is slenderer then the other
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:32499:167"/>
three that ye have cast down? If so be ye would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to leave off the siege, had it not been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you to have done it at the beginning, whiles your Army was yet whole? Now, when as you are few, and your most valiant Souldiers slain, why do you not rather choose to dye then to live?</p>
               <p>Did not you once enter this Town, in the time of <hi>Nero Caesar,</hi> and defend the honor of his name? now therefore when <hi>Vespasian</hi> my father raigneth, who is not only of greater power then <hi>Nero,</hi> but also more gentle toward you then ever was <hi>Nero,</hi> If you should abate and slack your endeavour &amp; diligence, it should be to your great shame and reproach.</p>
               <p>Why take ye not example of these <hi>Jews</hi> valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whom now already, sword, pestilence, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine bath wasted, so that they have no hope left: nevertheless, they fight still, and never give over. Do you not see every day, how some of them issue out of their Town, and boldly assail you, not without jeopardy of their lives, insomuch that oftentimes they die for it? Which things they do for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause, then to get them praise and renown for their great prowess.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Titus</hi> had well debated these and such like things, in the ears of his souldiers, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain valiant man named <hi>Sabianus,</hi> said unto his fellows, Who so dare go to assault these <hi>Jews,</hi> let him come hither to me, that we may ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Command of <hi>Caesars</hi> Son our Lord and Captain. And forthwith he took his Target, and his drawn Sword in his hand, made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Town with a eleven tall fellowes
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:32499:168"/>
following him, whose valiantnesse and courage <hi>Titus</hi> wondred at greatly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> kept their ward upon that part of the wall, where the <hi>Romans</hi> had a repulse of late: so when they saw <hi>Sabianus</hi> and his company draw fast toward them, they began to assail them with stones and arrows; but <hi>Sabianus</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting light at them, charged home upon the <hi>Jews.</hi> Shortly one of the <hi>Jews</hi> met with him, and gave him such a blow, that he felled him to the ground; yet he gat up again, and fought for all that manfully; and, as one that had rather leave his life, than the reputation of his valour, he did fight till another <hi>Israelite</hi> came and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lew him out-right. Three also of his fellows were killed fighting valiantly in that place; the other 8. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Camp, so sore wounded, that they died the next day every one. Further, other <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> seeing <hi>Sabianus</hi> act, and studying to do the like: the next night they took counsel about 20. of them, and agreed to assault the Town.</p>
               <p>This their enterprise when they declared to the Standard-bearer of <hi>Titus,</hi> he and many other of the <hi>Romans</hi> went with them. They all scaling together, and clammering up the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, gat up upon the wall, sounding a Trumpet, and gave a great shout. The <hi>Jews</hi> being at their rest, as men opprest with hunger and weariness; and hearing this Alarum and shout of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> were wonderfully amazed, not knowing what the matter was, or how they should defend themselves. <hi>Titus</hi> also heard the shout: and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:32499:168"/>
when he had enquired the matter, he chose out certain valiant men, and drew towards the breaches with them. In the mean season, the day was broken, and the <hi>Jews</hi> rising from their sleep, espyed <hi>Titus,</hi> upon the walls, and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereat greatly. The <hi>Romans</hi> therefore ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering toward <hi>Titus,</hi> came very thick into the Town, some by the breaches of the wall, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some through the vault, whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont now and then to make irruptions, and to recover themselves within the Town again. The <hi>Jews</hi> set themselves in aray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Romans</hi> in the very entry of the Temple: upon whom the <hi>Romans</hi> ran with their drawn swords; for they had no other armour, nor the <hi>Jews</hi> neither, being so hastily taken at such a sudden. The battel waxed very hard, and wonderful vehement on both parties, the like was never seen in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> nor heard of, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time: for every man clave hard to his next fellow, &amp; no man could flee on any side. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the battel waxt strong, with clamours and shouts on both parties: now the joyful shouts of the vanquishers, now the wailings on the other side, of them that were put to the worse. The <hi>Romans</hi> encouraged and exhorted one another to fight, saying, This is the day which we have long looked for. The <hi>Jews</hi> again took heart unto them, saying, It boots not to flee hence; but, for the glory of the Lord and his Temple, let us die <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>anfully, as necessity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth us: and so doing, we shall be
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:32499:169"/>
counted for sacrifices and offerings. Which earnestnesse on both sides, filled the entry of the Court of the Lord with blood, that it stood like unto a pool or pond. And that fight continued from the morning, till that time four dayes.</p>
               <p>Then a certain souldier of <hi>Titus</hi>'s, whose name was <hi>Golinus,</hi> a valiant man, as was ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the company of <hi>Kurtus,</hi> seeing the <hi>Jews</hi> prevail, and to have the upper-hand of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which now had left off fighting, and fled, the <hi>Jews</hi> pursuing them: in a rage he ran against them, and met them at the wall which <hi>Herod</hi> builded, called <hi>Antochia,</hi> drove them back, and made them to take the entrance of the Temple again, where, preasing into the forces of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he was wounded of a certain <hi>Jew.</hi> And when he perceived himself wounded, he would have lept back, but stumbled at a slone in the pavement of the Court of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and fell down, where he fought yet still, till a certain <hi>Jew</hi> killed him out-right. He fought indeed very boldly and valiantly, but unwari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for he considered not his ground wherein he had to do with the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> waiting for <hi>Golinus</hi> return, and hearing him to be slain, would have gone himself to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue the rest of his that were with him: but his men would not suffer him, fearing lest he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self should be slain. The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore got the upper hand that day, and slew very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Romans</hi> in that battel, spoyling them
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:32499:169"/>
also (which were killed) of their armour.</p>
               <p>These were the names of the <hi>Jews</hi> that made the skirmish: Of the Company of Captain <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan, Elasa,</hi> and <hi>Iphtach;</hi> of <hi>Schimeons</hi> Company, <hi>Malchiah,</hi> and <hi>Jaicob,</hi> a Prince of the <hi>Edomites;</hi> and <hi>Arsimon</hi> and <hi>Jehuda,</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> the son of <hi>Anani.</hi> These with their Companies made this slaughter of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the entrance of the Temple, and drove them back to <hi>Antochia,</hi> where they kept them up that they could not get out. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Titus</hi> perceived that the <hi>Antochia</hi> was in the <hi>Romans</hi> way, and hindred them, he caused it to be razed and pulled down to the ground; These things were done upon the fifth day of <hi>May,</hi> the third moneth, upon the even of the solemn Festival day of weeks, which otherwise is called Pentecost, and that was the 14th moneth from the beginning of <hi>Titus</hi>'s siege against this City.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, upon the third day of the Feast of weeks, the <hi>Jews</hi> as many as were at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> kept holy dayes, and celebrated the Feast. <hi>Titus</hi> taking with him <hi>Joseph</hi> the son of <hi>Gorion,</hi> went into the house of the Sanctuary, where the Seditious and souldiers of the <hi>Jews</hi> were gathered together; and called unto <hi>Jehocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> and the rest of the Captains of the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to whom he spake by the means of <hi>Joseph,</hi> being his Interpreter, in this wise.</p>
               <p>What hath this Temple offended thee (thou seditious <hi>Jehochanan?</hi>) Why hast thou brought
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:32499:170"/>
upon it this great evil and mischief? If so be thou trust so much to thy strength, Come forth to us with thy men into the fields, and we shall fight with thee thy fill. Is not this your solemn Festival Day? Why then will ye fight in the place where ye should offer your sacrifice? Ye pollute and defile the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie of your God, and his Name, and we spare it, knowing it is the House of God: And the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause why we make War upon you, is your stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born stiffe-neckednesse, that you will not submit your selves to us, whom God hath given the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion unto, whose will ye labour in vain to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. Either therefore if ye will fight no more, humble your selves under our subjection, that ye may save your lives: or else, if ye be determined still desperately to fight with us, then get you forth from hence, and let us go into the fields, there to set our battels in aray. Why wil you defile your San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie, and hinder the worshipping of your God?</p>
               <p>Much more besides this spake <hi>Titus,</hi> partly blaming their stubbornnesse, in that they had defiled their Temple, and yet ceased not to pollute it more and more; partly with fair words and gentleness, exhorting them to yeild, admonishing them not to resist so mighty an Army, when as they could not do it without danger of utter destruction.</p>
               <p>These and many other things <hi>Joseph</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Hebrew to the people, as <hi>Titus</hi> willed him, but the <hi>Jews</hi> answered never a word; for <hi>Jehochanan</hi> had given charge, that no man should speak.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:32499:170"/>
Then Captain <hi>Jehochanan</hi> answered <hi>Titus</hi> himself, saying, We can offer no kind of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice more acceptable to God, than to devote, hazard, and abandon our own bodies and blood, for his Names sake: Wherefore we will die free-men in this our Town, and will never come in bondage to serve you.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Titus</hi> made him answer by <hi>Joseph,</hi> saying, This your City, I grant, is a holy City, and your Temple is most holy, which no man doth deny: but ye have grievously sinned, in that ye have polluted the Temple of the Lord your God, by shedding in it innocent blood of Saints, and the Priests of God, with other most godly and holy men.</p>
                  <p>By what reason can ye then say, that ye shall be accepted for sacrifices, and offerings before God? yea rather, God abhorreth and detesteth you utterly; when as he requireth in his sacrifices, that they should have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault nor spot: but ye are all bespotted, so that no sound place is left in you.</p>
                  <p>For tell me, (I pray you) if there be any more abominable spot in man, than sin, when he transgresseth the Law of God, as ye have done; Neither is there any wisdom or intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in you. For wise men would wisely bear with the calamities of times, and know the courses of things. How then are ye so foolish to say that ye are an acceptable and well pleasing sacrifice to God, when as ye resist the will of God so proudly?
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:32499:171"/>
But thou <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> and the rest of the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Captains that are with thee. Tell me, Art thou not a mortal man, subject unto the griefs and vexations of this life, and worms meat as we be? Should he not displease thee, that should take away and violate a Table or such like thing, prepared to the honour of thee? and wouldst thou take it in good part, and hold him excused that should so do unto thee? Why then hast thou taken away the sacrifices of thy God out of his Temple, and hast stuffed it with innumerable dead bodies? Who can see or hear this, and abstain from weeping, when he shall know so many <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> to have suffered death by thee, and <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> thy fellows? Neither canst thou yet apply thy mind to cease and leave off thy malice, and yet neverthelesse perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thy self, that God is with thee, and that thou with thy fellows, art an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice unto God, nothing perceiving that your sins separate you, and keep you asunder more strongly than any brasen wall.</p>
                  <p>It is true, I confesse, that it becometh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valiant man, to stand stoutly in the defence  of his people, City, and Country. <hi>For it is better to die valiantly, than to come into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of his enemy that goeth about to pluck him from his Religion, and drive him out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> But I came not hither for that intent, to draw you from your Religion, nor to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:32499:171"/>
banish you out of your Land, or else to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it and your Cities: but this is the cause of my coming hither, to offer you peace, and to make a League with you, that ye should take upon you our yoke, and be our subjects as ye were before. Where did you ever hear of a people in all the World, that hath shewed themselves so merciful and gentle, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards other, and towards you, as we have done?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Captain of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> after he had wasted our Country, and at length was taken by us, Was he not had in great honour and reputation of us, and with such civility handled, that we made him King of his people? And so dealt we with <hi>Antiocbus</hi> the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> and other Kings that we took prisoners. Ye brag that ye keep the Vigils and Feasts of your God: Why then follow ye not the example of <hi>Jechoniah</hi> your King? who to save the Temple of your God from destruction, and lest your people also should be led away into bondage, or be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed with the sword, yielded himself and his house into the hands of the King of the <hi>Chaldeos.</hi> Why spare you not your own lives, your City, and Sanctuary?</p>
                  <p>Now therefore hearken unto me, and I will make a League with you before the God of this House, who shall be a witnesse betwixt me and you; by whom I swear, that I will never break this League, neither
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:32499:172"/>
do you any harm, nor spoil your goods, nor lead you away captive, nor yet constitute any Ruler over you, but a <hi>Jew</hi> of your own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; even <hi>Joseph</hi> the Priest which is with me, shall be your Prince, if you think it good; and all the faithful men also which are with me, shall return home again; ye shall inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite your own Land, ye shall have the use of the fruits thereof with peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, without any corruption, or alteration of the service of your God; wherefore cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit me, and make a League with me. And that you may trust me the better, ye shall have pledges, <hi>Joseph</hi> a Noble-man of your own Country, and other Princes and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Come forth therefore and treat a peace with us, bow your shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and humble your necks to serve us, like as all other Nations do, and as you have done your selves in the time of <hi>Nero Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> that ye may live and not be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed  keeping your Religion safe and sincere.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joseph</hi> the Priest hearing the words of <hi>Titus</hi> and his clemency, in that he was minded to spare the <hi>Jews,</hi> burst out aloud and wept in the presence of the Captains, and of the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious very bitterly: but they nothing regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joseph</hi> therefore seeing that <hi>Titus</hi> could do nothing with the Seditious, said unto their Princes, I marvel nothing that this City tends to desolation, and destruction, for
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:32499:172"/>
I know the end of it is at hand. But this is it that I marvel most, that ye have read in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and understand it not, which is now fulfilled in all points, and yet never a one of you doth mark it: <hi>The continual sacrifice is already ceased a good while ago, the annointed Priest is cut away, and put down.</hi> These things though they be most manifest, yet your hearts cannot believe them.</p>
               <p>And many other words spake <hi>Joseph,</hi> full of admonition and consolation, but the <hi>Jews</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to hear him: When he had made an end therefore, and the Seditious had so hardened their necks, <hi>Titus</hi> turned him, and departed out of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> saying, Let us go hence, lest their sins destroy us. Wherefore he pitched his Tents without the City, in the same place where he encamped at first. For he was afraid both for himself and his Army, lest they should be circumvented and closed in, and slain cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in so great City as that was.</p>
               <p>Certain of the Priests of that time, and of the Nobles of the Town, with other godly men, did wisely provide for themselves, and came forth to <hi>Titus,</hi> submitting themselves to his mercy, and were received of him peaceably with great honour; whom <hi>Titus</hi> commanded to be conducted into the land of <hi>Goshen,</hi> where in times past the <hi>Israelites</hi> dwelt in the dayes of <hi>Jacob</hi> their Father, and <hi>Joseph</hi> Lord of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thither sent he them, and gave it them in
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:32499:173"/>
possession, to them and to their heirs for ever after; commanding a company of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> safely to conduct them, till they came to the land of <hi>Goshen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> directed his letter also to the <hi>Roman</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident which was set over <hi>Egypt,</hi> to take pity of the <hi>Jews</hi> that he had placed in the land of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shen,</hi> to sustain and succour them, and to see that no <hi>Roman</hi> nor other should do them harm, or annoy them by any manner of means. Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also of the <hi>Jews</hi> coveted to go forth of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> but they were disappointed by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, that they could not do as they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And who can tell whether they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with their own sins, and destined to destruction with their seditious brethren, when as their hands also were polluted with the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and iniquity of the Seditious? Wherefore the Seditious closed up all the walls about the Temple, that none of the <hi>Jews</hi> which were in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> might get out to <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Titus</hi> knew that many of the <hi>Jews</hi> were desirous to flee unto him, and could not because of the Seditious, he went again to the place where he was before, &amp; <hi>Joseph</hi> with him: Whom when the people saw to be there with <hi>Titus,</hi> they fell a weeping, and said unto him, We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our sins, and the transgression of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we have swerved out of the way, against the Lord our God; for we see now the mercy and gentlenesse of <hi>Titus,</hi> the son of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and that he taketh pity upon us; but what

               <p>But when he saw that none of the Seditious gave any regard to his words, he chose out of the <hi>Romans,</hi> thirty thousand valiant fighting men, and gave them commandment to take and occupy the entry of the Temple, which is a holy Court, and determined to go with them himself; but his Nobles would not suffer him, but willed him to remain upon a high place, where he might behold his souldiers fight: and when they see thee afar off, their hearts shall be comforted, and they shall fight according as thou wilt wish them: but come not at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Temple thy self, lest thou be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> followed the counsel of his Captains, and went not out at that time with his men to the battel. He made chief Captains of that host of thirty thousand, one <hi>Karilus</hi> and <hi>Rostius,</hi> two great Commanders, who had order to set upon the <hi>Jews</hi> that night, when they should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep with wearinesse.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> therefore doing after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment set upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:32499:174"/>
having intelligence of the matter, kept dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent watch, and withstood the <hi>Romans</hi> all the night. But the <hi>Romans</hi> were not hasty to fight in the dark, fearing lest it might turn to their own harm. As soon therefore as it was day, the <hi>Jews</hi> divided themselves, and bestowed their Companies at the gates of the entrance, and fought like men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Karilus</hi> and <hi>Rostius</hi> beset the Temple round about, that not one of the <hi>Jews</hi> might escape out, and so the battel encreased between them for the space of seven dayes; sometimes the <hi>Romans</hi> getting the upper hand of the <hi>Jews,</hi> driving them within the entrance: sometime the <hi>Jews</hi> encouraging themselves, made the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> retire, and pursued them to the walls of the <hi>Antochia:</hi> in this manner fought they these seven dayes.</p>
               <p>Afterward the <hi>Romans</hi> turned back from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and would not fight hand to hand with them any more. Then <hi>Titus</hi> commanded, the walls of the <hi>Antochia</hi> to be pulled down fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that there might be place for all his host to enter.</p>
               <p>The famine in the mean season grew more grievous, so that no food was left. For the <hi>Jews</hi> began now to issue out, and steal Horses, Asses, and other beasts, whatsoever they could catch, even out of the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp, that they might dresse them some meat, and sustain their lives; which they doing oftentimes, at length the <hi>Romans</hi> perceived it, and were wonderfully
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:32499:175"/>
displeased at the matter, wherefore they set Watch and Ward round about the Camp, lest by the deceit of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they should be spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their cattel. So after that, the <hi>Jews</hi> could steal no more thence.</p>
               <p>Afterward notwithstanding, they armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and issued out at the East Gate, and brake the Wall that <hi>Titus</hi> had raised for his own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, lest the <hi>Jews</hi> should issue out upon a sudden, and come upon him at unawares. A sort of tall fellows therefore of the youth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out at the breaches of the wall, and got up quickly to the Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> where they found Horses, Mules, Asses, and much other cattel; and slaying their Keepers, they drove them before them with great shouts into the Town. The <hi>Romans</hi> perceiving it, pursued them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the young men divided themselves into two Bands: the one to drive the booty, and the other to resist the <hi>Romans.</hi> So there was a sore fight between them; but the <hi>Jews</hi> got the upper-hand, and went their wayes clear with the prey toward <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Jews</hi> came forth, constrained by the necessity of hunger, and fought for their living: the <hi>Romans</hi> had no cause to fight, save only for shame, to see their cattel driven away before their eyes; for otherwise they put not their lives in jeopardy to fight unto death, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, yet there was many of the <hi>Romans</hi> slain in that fight.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> while the <hi>Romans</hi> pursued them
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:32499:175"/>
in vain, got into the Town with their spoil and prey, and straightway turned upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> and drove them back, pursuing them again till they came almost to <hi>Titus</hi>'s Camp, which when the other <hi>Romans</hi> saw, they iss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>So the <hi>Romans</hi> prevailed against the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time, and for a certain token of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they had this young <hi>Jew</hi> prisoner. <hi>Pornus</hi> that took him, was had in great estimation for that act, of <hi>Titus</hi> and all the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> apparrelled the boy, and committed him to <hi>Josephus</hi> to keep. This boy had a brother amongst them that escaped into the Town, a vile personage, evil-favoured, and of a low sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his name was <hi>Jonathan.</hi> He seeing his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken prisoner, cometh forth of the Tomb of <hi>Jochanan</hi> the High Priest over against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and cryed unto <hi>Titus,</hi> and to all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, saying, If there be ever a man among you, let him come forth unto me, here will I abide him, and fight with him upon this ground: and ye shall know this day, whether the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> or the <hi>Jews</hi> be the better men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> despised him, yet d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>st they not meddle with him, but said, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>f we kill him, we shall never be counted the better men for
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:32499:176"/>
such an act, and if he should kill any of us, it should be a great dishonour to be slain of a wretched captive. <hi>Jonathan</hi> said to the <hi>Romans,</hi> How much is the manhood of the <hi>Romans</hi> to be regarded in our eyes? Have not you been slain and put to flig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

We have destroyed our selves, one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with civill Wars, so that we are but few left; but what are you? Who is so hardy of the best of you all, to come and declare his strength, and to fight with me? I am one of the meanest, and outcasts of the <hi>Jews:</hi> Pick you out the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and valiantest man amongst you all, and you shall know by and by, whether part is more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant. When <hi>Jonathan</hi> had spoken thus proudly, there came forth one of the most valiantest soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose name was <hi>Pornus</hi> the same that had taken the brother of this <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> &amp; brought him to <hi>Titus;</hi> he came no sooner at <hi>Jonathan,</hi> but he was killed of him straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, leaving behind him a double and differing inheritance to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and the <hi>Romans;</hi> to <hi>Jonathan</hi> a same of fortitude and valiantnesse, to the <hi>Romans</hi> of shame and reproach.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jonathan</hi> had slain the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> changed his name, and called him <hi>Jehonathan,</hi> by an honourable name, and gave him a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>r of dominion in his hand: But <hi>Jehonathan</hi> when he had gotten the victory, gave not
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:32499:176"/>
the power to God, but ascribed it to his own prowess, and became very proud withall; he was not content with one victory, but would yet provoke the <hi>Romans,</hi> railing at them, and calling for another valiant Champion to be sent him, that I may kill him (saith he) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my force upon him; and even as he said so, one of the <hi>Romans</hi> whose name was <hi>Pornan,</hi> struck him through with an arrow at unawares, and killed him; by whose example ye may perceive, <hi>It is everie mans part chiefly to take heed, that when they overcome their enemies, they rejoice not over-much, nor wax proud for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for, who knoweth what end they shall have themselves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things done, the <hi>Jews</hi> seeing the walls of the Temple, and three walls that compassed the Town, to be razed and pulled down, knowing also that they had no help left, nor any thing to trust unto, they consulted what was best to be done. There was a great house joyning upon the side of the Temple, that King <hi>Solomon</hi> had builded, of a great height, whose walls also the Kings of the second Temple had raised on height, and had decked it with Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Firre, and Cedar-trees. The <hi>Jews</hi> went and annointed every where the Cedar Timber of the house with brimstone and pitch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly: So when the <hi>Romans</hi> came again to the Temple to assault the <hi>Jews,</hi> and pursued them unto that Palace: They entred the Palace after the <hi>Jews,</hi> who went out again another way,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:32499:177"/>
and some climbed up to the battlements of the house, others set up ladders to scale it: Then rejoyced they wonderfully, saying, The Palace is taken, now have the <hi>Jews</hi> no pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> also stood in harness round about the House, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> kept the gates of the Palace, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:32499:177"/>
if they perceived any man go about to escape out of the fire, or to come down off the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, them they killed with their swords.</p>
               <p>In that fire was a certain great Commander, of the stock of Kings, whose name was <hi>Longinus,</hi> to whom the <hi>Jews</hi> cried, and flouted him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Another great Commander also was in that fire, whose name was <hi>Artorius,</hi> who looking forth from the top of the house, saw one of his dear friends by <hi>Titus,</hi> which was called <hi>Lucius,</hi> to whom <hi>Artorius</hi> called, saying, My dear friend <hi>Lucius,</hi> get on thy Armour and come hither, that I may leap down upon thee, and thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est receive me.

Wherefore <hi>Lucius</hi> ran and held his lap open at the house side, and <hi>Artorius</hi> leapt down, and light upon him with such weight, that they both died therewith. <hi>Titus</hi> commanded the covenant that they two made before their death, to be written on a sword with blood, and their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to be noted in the Chronicles of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that it might be an example to all men to learn true friendship by: At that time therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> revenged themselves meetly well upon the <hi>Romans.</hi> The fire burnt till it came to the <hi>Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kijahu</hi> King of <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:32499:178"/>
the Temple of the Lord, which the <hi>Romans</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fled out of the Town, and got them to their tents, a great part of them being destroyed by the cruelty of the <hi>Jews,</hi> so that few of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. The rest therefore lay still in their siege round about the Town, saying, We shall not be able to win the Town by the sword, but rather we must be fain to drive them to yield by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, wherefore they compassed it on every side: In the Town was now no victuals left.</p>
               <p>There was a certain rich woman at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> of a Noble House also, whose Name was <hi>Miriam.</hi> Her dwelling was beyond <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi> but when she perceived the wars to grow more and more in the time of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> she came up with her neighbours to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> bringing with her not only her men servants, and women servants, and all her whole family, but also her goods and riches, which were very great.</p>
               <p>When the hunger was grievous at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the Seditious went from house to house to seek meat; they came also to this womans house, and took away from her by force, all that ever she had, and left her nothing remaining. By this means she was oppressed with very great hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, so that she wished her self out of the world, but her time was not yet come to die: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that she might slack her hunger, and sustain her self, she began to scrape in the chaffe and dust for beasts dung, but could find none. She had one son, and when she saw the famine wax greater and greater upon her, she laid aside all
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:32499:178"/>
woman-hood and mercy, and took upon her an horrible cruelty: For when she heard her boy weep, and ask for meat, which she had not to give him, she said unto him, What shall I do my son? For the wrath of God hath environed the whole City, in every corner thereof famine raigneth; without the City the sword killeth up all, within we stand in fear of the Seditious; our enemies prevail without, in the Town are fires, burnings, and ruines of houses, famine, pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, spoyling and destroying, so that I cannot feed thee my son. Now therefore my son, if I should die for hunger, to whom should I leave thee being yet a child? I hoped once that when thou shouldest come to mans estate, thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est have sustained mine age with meat, drink, and cloth, and after when I should die, to bury me honorably, like as I was minded to bury thee, if thou shouldest have died before me. But now my son, thou art as good as dead alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for I have no meat to bring thee up withall, because of this great famine, and cruelty of the enemies, both within and without: If thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest die now amongst others, thou shouldest have no good nor honorable Tomb, as I would wish thee: wherefore I have thought good to choose thee a sepulcher, even mine own body lest thou shouldest die, and dogs eat thee in the streets; I will therefore be thy grave, and thou shalt be my food: And for that, that if thou hadst li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and grown to mans estate, thou oughtest by right to have nourished me, and fed me with
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:32499:179"/>
thy flesh, and with it sustain mine age, before that famine devour thee and thy body be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, render unto thy mother, that which she gave unto thee, for thou camest of her, and thou shalt return into her. For I will bring thee into the self same shop, in the which the breath of life was breathed into thy nostrils; forasmuch as thou art my well beloved son, whom I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alwaies with all my strength: Be therefore meat for thy mother, &amp; ignominy and reproach to the Seditious, that by violence have taken away our food.

Many therefore of the common people stole out in the night forth of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with all their substance to the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp, and shewd <hi>Titus</hi> of this.

At length thou broughtest them into this holy Land by great and terrible Miracles and Wonders: For thou dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst up the water of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and madest them stand up in a heap, till they were passed over: Thou didst cause the Sun and Moon also to stay their course for thy peoples sake, til they might vanquish their enemies. Thou wouldest that thy Name should dwell amongst them, and thou gavest them this City by inheritance: Some of them thou didst choose for thy self to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which might conduct thy people, teach them,

and lead them into the right way, to give them warning of future miseries, that they might take heed, and beware of them. Moreover, thou didst choose of them Priests to serve thee, and to bless thy people Israel; certain godly men amongst them thou drewest unto thee, and in a fiery Chariot thou didst carry them up to Heaven; Thou smotest the tents of the King of <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>When <hi>Titus</hi> had sayed all these things, he commanded to bring an iron Ram, and to bend it against the new wall which the Sedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>He appointed also a strong band of men to keep the Temple, that it might not be propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and unhallowed by any of his: But his Princes and Captains answered; Unless this House be set on fire, thou shalt never subdue this people, in regard that to preserve it, they vow to die.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding <hi>Titus</hi> would not hearken to their counsell, but appointed some of his own souldiers, and such <hi>Jews</hi> as had come in to him to keep Ward, giving them charge to preserve the Temple and <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> lest it should be polluted.</p>

when <hi>Titus</hi> heard, he hastened to quench the fire, and save the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> but he could not do it, because it was set on fire in so many places: thereupon <hi>Titus</hi> cried unto them, that they should forbear, but they would not hear him: For as a vehement floud of Waters breaketh through all things, and drives them down before it; with such a furious violence the Gentiles rushed upon the Lords Temple, the fire flaming every where out of mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>When <hi>Titus</hi> saw he could not restrain them from the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> with words, he drew out his Sword, blaming the Captains of his own people, and others that were not <hi>Romans</hi> he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and he cried out so long and so loud upon them, that he was grown hoarse.</p>
               <p>The Priests that were within the <hi>Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum</hi> withstood the <hi>Romans</hi> stoutly, till they were able no longer to lift up their hands: Wherefore when they saw there was no other safeguard left, they leaped into the fire, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other <hi>Jews</hi> with them, and so burnt all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, saying, <hi>What should we live any longer now there is no Temple?</hi> Yet <hi>Titus</hi> ceased not to strike the people, and chase them from the Temple, and being grown so weary, that all his strength fail'd him, he fell upon the ground, and forbore crying upon them any further.</p>
               <p>After that the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> was burnt, <hi>Titus</hi> arose, and entring therein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>These things hapned, because they gave cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to a false Prophet, and marked not the signs that appeared formerly: For the year next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> there was seen a star on the Temple so bright, as if a man had so many drawn swords in his hands; And the same time this Star appeared, which was at the solemn passover, that whole night the Temple was light and clear as mid-day, and continued so seaven nights together. Understanding men knew well enough that this was an ill augury, though others thought it good. The same time also they brought a heifer for a sacrifice, which when she was knocked down, she calved a Lamb.</p>
               <p>Besides, there was a certain gate called the East gate, that was never opened nor shut, but twenty men had enough to do about it, and the creaking of the hinges might be heard a far off; This gate was found open without any mans help, and they could not shut it, till a great number joyned their strength.</p>
               <p>Moreover there was discerned on the <hi>Sanctum</hi>

               <p>There appeared also the same time, four Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots with horsemen, and great blasts in the skie, coming towards <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> In the feast of the weeks, the Priest likewise heard a man walking in the Temple, and saying with a great and wonderfull terrible voice, <hi>Come let us go away out of this Temple, let us hence away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But especially there was one surpassed all these; a certain man in the City, of a base de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, called <hi>Joshua,</hi> began to cry upon the feast of Tabernacles, in this wise; <hi>A voice from the East, a voice from the West, a voice from the four winds of the Heavens, a voice against</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>a voice against the Temple, a voice against the bridegroom, a voice against the bride, and a voice against the whole people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he cried very oft, so that they of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> hated him, and said unto him, Why criest thou alwaies this cry; But the Governour of the City for bad them to wrong him, supposing he was mad: Therefore for four years space he never left crying out, <hi>Wo to Jerusalem, and to the Sanctuary thereof.</hi>

               <p>Afterward came <hi>Schimeon</hi> also forth of his den, being driven to it with famine.

               <p>The number of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well Citizens as others, that came unto the Feast to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which were slain, partly by the <hi>Romans,</hi> partly by the Seditious, during the whole time of these Wars, was known to be eleven hundred thousand, besides them whose number was not known; only they were counted which were slain and buried: Besides them, they also were not reckoned, that after the death of

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the fortitude of <hi>Abraham</hi> our father, and the fact that he did: for having but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly son, whom <hi>Sarah</hi> bare unto him in her age, he never staggered nor stayed at it to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him up to the Lord God for a burnt-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: for he thought not that he should kill him, but perswaded himself most certainly, that he should promote him to the life and light of the Lord, forasmuch as for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

life, and aspiring to everlasting felicity, would not avoid the jeopardy of his life, when as he might have done it. For although <hi>Pharaoh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> said, He came not against him, but against the King of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> yet would not <hi>Josiah</hi> hear him, but rather proceeding against <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> in arms, was slain in the battel, and went unto that great Light in the Garden of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, which is the lot and inheritance of the just. We know that in this world no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the reward of his righteousnesse, but it is laid up for him in the other world: where he shall reap the fruit of his righteousnesse, that he hath sown in this world. Neither doth long life in this world profit a man to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of everlasting blisse, except he work righteousnesse, and lead his soul forth of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, into light: like as contrariwise, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life hindreth no man from everlasting happinesse, if so be it, his soul have no defect in those things that pertain to the world to come. For <hi>Abel</hi> which was slain of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lived no long life: yet when he had ended it, he obtained everlasting rest: but <hi>Cain</hi> that lived long in the world, was a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer and a runagate in this earth; and after this life, went to perpetual misery. Now therefore, my Brethren, if we also shall live any longer, our life shall be a miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, and our dayes, dayes of vanity and travel: yea, our soul as long as it shall remain in this body, it shall be tossed with great tribulation: but if it once go forth
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:32499:190"/>
then shall it rejoyce, and never be afraid. And all the dayes that it is in the body, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaveth weeping and mourning: for it is the Spirit of life, which is hedged within the body, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The spirit is also that which quickneth the flesh, that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the dust of the earth, for flesh cannot quicken the spirit.

The eyes also of the body, cannot perceive what time the spirit resorteth to the flesh, and departeth from the same; for the spirit of man which is his soul, is from heaven, but the flesh is taken from the earth. Wherefore the soul may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Wherefore the soul is glad when it depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the body, like as one that hath been bound, is well contented when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Thus the <hi>Passeover,</hi> first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by God in mercy, to save the <hi>Israelites</hi> from death, was now used by Him in justice, to hasten their destruction, and to gather the Nation into a bundle to be cast into the fire of his anger. Besides those who were slain, nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty seven thousand were taken captives; And they who had bought our Saviour for thirty pence, were themselves sold thirty for a peny.</p>
            <p>The General of the <hi>Romans</hi> in this action, was <hi>Titus,</hi> son to <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Emperour; A Prince so good, that he was styled the Darling of mankind, for his sweet and loving nature; (and pity it was, that so good a stock had not been better grafted!).

            <p>Secondly, because on their conversion they must renounce all their goods as ill gotten; and they will scarce enter in at the door of our Church, when first they are to climbe over so high a threshold.</p>
            <p>Lastly, they are debarred from the use of the new Testament, the means of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus we leave them in a state most pitiful, and little pitied.</p>
            <p>To give you then a right Character in brief; They are a people that know how to comply with the times, and the condition which they live in: especially if their profit be concerned in it; reviled like dogs, and used like slaves, yet never shew so much as an angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.

               </gap>t the opinion of being restored by the <hi>Messiah</hi> to that temporal power which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them by the <hi>Romans,</hi> was prevalent as well amongst <hi>Christs</hi> Disciples, as the rest of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is, as I take it, clear enough in the Holy Gospel. In such a Kingdom, and no other, do the two sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> desire to sit, on both hands of their Master. And the same was it, and no other, which all of them expected, as appeareth by the words of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> Luke 24. 21. that <hi>Christ</hi> should have restored unto them: <hi>We thought,</hi> said he, <hi>that This would have proved the man, that should have redeemed,</hi> From what? from sin and Satan, or the curse and bondage of the Law?

               <hi>O</hi> Lord, who art <hi>righteous</hi> in <hi>all thy wayes, and holy in all thy works,</hi> we acknowledg and admire the justice of thy proceedings, in bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hardning the <hi>Jews;</hi> as for their manifold impieties, soespeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb facs="tcp:32499:204"/>
for stoning thy Prophets, despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thy Word, and crucifying the Lord of Life. For which thou hast cursed them, according to the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thy Prophet, <hi>to abide ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies without a King, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Prince, and without a Sacrifice, and without an Image, and without an Ephod, and without Teraphim. But thou, O Lord, how long? How long O Lord, holy and true? How long Lord? wilt thou be angrie for ever? Thine anger is said to endure but a moment;</hi> but, Lord, how many millions of millions of momeuts, are contained in sixteen hundred years, since thou hast first cast off thy first and antient people, the <hi>Jews?</hi> Remember <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> not for any merit in their persons, which was none, but for the mercy in thy promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which is infinite, so frequently
<pb facs="tcp:32499:204"/>
made, and so solemnly confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. But O! remember the Orator on thy right hand, <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> our <hi>Lord,</hi> which was made of the seed of <hi>David according to the flesh;</hi> and the Orator in thine own bosome, thine essential and innate Clemency, and let these prevail, if it may stand with thy good will and pleasure, that thy people the <hi>Jews</hi> may be received into the arms of thy mercy. As once by a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and woful imprecation they drew the guilt of <hi>his blood on them, and on their children:</hi> So by thy free im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, drop the merit of his blood <hi>on them, and on their children.</hi> For the speeding of whose conversion, be pleased to compose the many different judgements of <hi>Christians</hi> into one truth, to unite their disagreeing affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in one love; that our examples may no longer discourage, but invite

them to the embracing of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
