            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Credit and favourable Reception that this Book of Dr. <hi>Ellis</hi>'s has met with amongst Men of Letters, is a sufficient Apology for giving it a new Birth, and making its Use of a larger Extent. It was Published in <hi>Latin</hi> in the Year 1660. Reprinted in 1694. And because both Impressions are now quite sold off, it became necessary either to give it a new Edition, or a new Language: The latter (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of more general Use) was chosen: And therefore I have endeavoured to make the Author speak as good <hi>English,</hi> as a Sententious and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative Stile would easily bear, without too much wresting and wandring from the Sense.</p>
            <p>It is something wonderful to observe, how igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant many People are of the very Articles of that Religion, which they have all along professed themselves to be Members of: As if it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> without having any tolerable System of its Doctrine, much less knowing how to defend them against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ss Spirits in this Age,
<pb facs="tcp:61508:3"/>
make it highly necessary for every Christian to consider well, and examine what it is he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and what Foundation his Faith stands upon: that he may be <hi>ready always to give an Answer to them that ask him a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Hope that is in him, and may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by sound Doctrine to convince the Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which purpose this short <hi>Defence of the Articles of the Church of England</hi> is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an <hi>English</hi> Dress, for the greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and more general use of all Readers: Wherein may be found (though short and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, yet) very clear and strong Arguments; and such, I am perswaded, as will not fail to work upon all well-disposed and ingenuous Minds. I have not thought fit to interpose, except in One or Two Places, where the Obscurity of the Subject, or the Author's Sense, seemed to require it; and there too I have set a distinguishing Mark. And now, if the Whole shall in any Measure contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to remove Mens Doubts, or instruct their Minds; to confirm their Faith, or reform their Manners, here is a glorious End, and there needs no further Apology to be made.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61508:4"/>
either with Relation to the Error of some that say the Planets are Gods, or else according to some certain Similitude; as Magistrates are sometimes called so.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>The Phrases of</hi> [Time past] <hi>and</hi> [Time to come] <hi>are spoken of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not Eternal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Such Words are spoken of God, not as tho' he had any Variation thro' them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Eternity does comprehend all Times.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>The Scriptures testifie, that God has Hands and Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore he is not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporcal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Such Parts are not attributed to God, as really such; but by way of Similitude, and upon the account of his Actings, as the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eye is to see; from whence it is that the Eye, when 'tis spoken of God, means his Power of Seeing, not after a sensible, but intellectual manner; and the like is to be said of all other Parts of the Body.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>It is said,</hi> Gen. 6. 6. <hi>that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; and elsewhere, that he was subject to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Repentance is indeed attributed to God, as if he were affected as Men are, because he acts sometimes after the manner of one that repents; but this is spoken not as to any Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in God, but as to the Effect of the thing: And the like is to be said of other Passions.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 5. <hi>The Angels are not reckoned up by</hi> Moses <hi>among the Works of the Creation.</hi>

Host; and the Apostle to the <hi>Colossians (Chap.</hi> 1. 16, 17.) expresly affirms, That God is the Creator of all things Visible and Invisible.</p>

                        </gap>. <hi>It is objected, That the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity is not true, but rather contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it self; because there is but One God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not Three; but there would be Three Gods, if the Father was God, the Son God, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost God. Now when we speak of a Person, we mean these Two things the Essence, and the manner of Subsisting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> From a Trinity of Persons in created Beings is rightly inferred a threefold Essence; but not so in Divine Beings. If we name a Person of the Holy Trinity, we mean a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Essence that is common to more Persons than One: But created things, because they are finite, their Substances or Persons must be separate. So <hi>Socrates, Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by a common Nature and Reason they are called Men, yet are not One but Three Men: And because in Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Being or Essence is infinite, therefore Three Persons subsisting in it, although they they be truly Three, yet are but One God.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 7. <hi>The Doctrine of a Trinity of Persons does infer a Composition in God. Where there is Essence and Person, there is a Composition ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a general or a particular Nature: And where there are these Two, there there is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>n: But in God there is both, because his Essence is one thing, and his Person another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> There is not in God a Conjunction of an universal and particular Nature, since God is the most simple Essence. Nature, and <hi>Suppositum</hi> (tho' two things) do not make a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61508:5"/>
Composition in God, as it does in created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in which Nature is one absolute thing, and the <hi>Suppositum</hi> another: whereas in God the <hi>Suppositum</hi> has a relative Nature, and a Relation does not compound, but distinguish; more especially in God, where the Relation does not really differ from its Foundation. Where there is an Union between Two absolute Things, <hi>there</hi> ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed there is a Composition: But in God, his Essence is absolute, and the Person relative: And Persons do not differ from one another really and essentially, but really and personally, <hi>i. e.</hi> by relative Personalities.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 8. <hi>Where there are One and Three Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there there are Four: Buut in God there are One and Three Beings; the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are Three, and yet Essence it self is none of these.</hi>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> All Flesh of pure Man is corruptible, and as Grass; but the Flesh of Christ is not such: The Prophet there speaks of the common and ordinary Condition of Mortals, and not of a most glorious Saviour, who is very God,</p>
                     <p>Obj. 5. <hi>The Apostle tells us,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 50. <hi>That</hi> Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; <hi>how then could Christ with both these ascend up into Heaven?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle speaks of Man as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and not washed from his Sins by Christ, or else of Flesh not yet freed from Corruption, That such shall not inherit the Kingdom of God; for the Body cannot enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven till it be freed from Corruption.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 6. <hi>Christ will not forsake us even to the last Judgment; for he told his Disciples,</hi> Mat. 28. 20. Lo I am with you, even to the end of the World. <hi>And in the way to</hi> Damascus <hi>he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to St.</hi> Paul. Acts 9. 17. <hi>And again in the Castle, he stood by him in the Night,</hi> Acts 23. 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ speaks of a Spiritual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence by his Grace, and not of a Bodily one by Nature: And then what if Christ did promise his Disciples that he would be with them by a Substantial Presence, if need so required? We are not to fix Christ so to the Heavens, as if he could not appear upon Earth, as perhaps in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner he did appear to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> although many understand that place of a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Vision: However Heaven is the ordinary place of his Residence.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 7. <hi>It is apparent that Christ will not judge all Men; for he that believes shall not come into Judgment,</hi> John 5. 24. <hi>The Prince of this</hi>

                        <hi>World, the Devil, is already judged,</hi> John 16. 11. <hi>And also he that believes not,</hi> John 3. 18. <hi>is condemned already.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> He that believeth shall not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Judgment of Condemnation, but of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: But the Devils and all Infidels are already judged in God's Decree, or in his revealed Word, or by their own Consciences, which is the beginning of their Punishment; but hereafter they will be condemned accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Revelation and Manifestation of Judgment already made, to the Acuteness of Punishment, and to the Consummation of Torments both of Body and Soul.</p>

                     <p>THE Holy Ghost proceeding from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, is of one Substance, Majesty, and Glory with the, Father and the Son, very and eternal God.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>Altho' the Spirit of Truth be said to proceed from the Father,</hi> John 15. 16. <hi>yet it does not seem to proceed from the Son, because it is no where said so in Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Although it be not said in the very Words, that the Spirit proceeds from the Son, yet 'tis plainly called the <hi>Spirit of the Son, Gal.</hi> 4. 6. And the <hi>Spirit of Christ, Rom.</hi> 8. 9. And then Christ says, <hi>John</hi> 15. 26. that <hi>he would send them the Spirit from the Father:</hi> In which Words he seems to mean, that it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from him likewise: Though, speaking as a Man, by way of Respect, he attributes it to the Father. There is no need to dispute too nicely about this Matter; if it be but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61508:10"/>
granted, that the Holy Ghost has an eternal Dependance on the Son, 'tis to no purpose to strive about Words and Terms.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>The Holy Ghost was not from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> John 7. 39.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This Place does not speak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Being or Person, but of the Gifts and Operations of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>Obj 3. <hi>The Holy Ghost is not every where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he changes place:</hi> The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, <hi>says the Angel to</hi> Mary, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. <hi>And in the same place;</hi> the Virtue of the most High shall over-shadow thee; <hi>therefore neither is he the most High.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Words <hi>[come upon thee]</hi> do not signifie any change of Place, but a particular Manifestation in some certain Place: And then the Holy Ghost is essentially the most High, tho' not personally so, if by the Name of <hi>[most High]</hi> the Father be understood.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>The Holy Ghost does not know all things; because none knows the Father but the Son,</hi> Mat. 11. 27. <hi>therefore he is not God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Word <hi>[none]</hi> excludes only Creatures, and not the Holy Ghost, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knows the Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 5. <hi>All things are made by Christ; and so is the Holy Ghost: Therefore he is not God</hi> Joh. 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> All things are said to be made by Christ which are made; but then only Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are made.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 6. <hi>He that prays to God, is not God; but the Hooly Ghost supplicates God for us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not said what the Holy Ghost acts immediately and of it self, but what it stirs up and effects in us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61508:10"/>
Obj. 7. <hi>He that is sent is inferiour to him that sends; but the Holy Ghost is sent by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then he is not of the same Mijesty and Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Mission and Obedience do not always take away an Equality of Power; for an Equal may sometimes be sent by his Equal.</p>

                        <hi>ART. VI.</hi> Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation.</head>
                     <p>HOly Scripture contains all things necessary to Salvation, so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any Man, that it should be believed as an Article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to Salvation. In the name of the Holy Scripture, we do understand those Canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose Authority was never any doubt in the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of the Names and Number of the Canonical Books.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomium, Jeshua, Judges, Ruth,</hi> the First Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Second Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the First Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> the Second Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> the First Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the First Book of <hi>Esdras,</hi> the Second Book of <hi>Esdras,</hi> the Book of <hi>Hester,</hi> the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> the <hi>Psalms,</hi> the <hi>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes</hi> or Preacher, <hi>Cantica</hi> or Songs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Four Prophets the greater, Twelve Prophets the Less.</p>
                     <p>And the other Books (as <hi>Hierom</hi> saith) the Church doth read for Example of Life, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61508:11"/>
Instruction of Manners; But yet does it not apply them to establish any Doctrine; such are these following.</p>
                     <p>The third Book of <hi>Esdras.</hi> The fourth Book of <hi>Esdras.</hi> The Book of <hi>Tobias.</hi> The Book of <hi>Judith.</hi> The rest of the Book of <hi>Hester.</hi> The Book of <hi>Wisdom. Jesus</hi> the Son of <hi>Sirach. Baruch</hi> the Prophet. The Song of the Three Children. The Story of <hi>Susanna.</hi> Of <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon.</hi> The Prayer of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses.</hi> The first Book of <hi>Maccabees.</hi> The second Book of <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do receive and account them Canonical.</p>
                     <p>It may be thought, that the Scriptures do not contain all things necessary to Salvation; for (Obj. 1.) <hi>It is necessary to Salvation, that we should know what, and how many Books are Canonical.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This is not so absolutely necessary, for we only enforce it, that the Faithful may be Baptized, may Believe and Live well.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>It is likewise necessary to know, that these Books came to us uncorrupted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Goodness of God is such, that he would not suffer those Books to be corrupted, which contain the business of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: There was a Promise made to <hi>Esay,</hi> that his Prophetical Writings should remain for ever, <hi>(Esay</hi> 30. 8.) and Christ has promised <hi>(Mat.</hi> 5. 18.)

                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>We ought to know how many Articles of Faith are to be believed by every one, under the hazard of forfeiting his Salvation; but neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> We have a Creed, that is collected from the Scriptures; but yet it is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation to have a distinct knowledge of the number of our Mysteries. One thing is needful (as Christ answered <hi>Martha (Luke</hi> 10. 42.) One thing is absolutely necessary, namely, that in comparison of Christ we should look upon all things as Loss. I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him Crucified, says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>We no where meet with the Means that God made use of, to purifie Females from Original Sin, or Males that died before the Eighth day, or indeed concerning the Gentiles, how they were to be saved under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> By the circumcision of the Men, the Females were consecrated; the Married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men belong'd to their Husbands, the Unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to their Parents: The purging of Females from Sin was done chiefly by Faith; they and the Children of Jews that died before the Eighth Day, were saved by vertue of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to <hi>Abram. I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed.</hi> God was not bound to any external Sacrament; even without that he could conferr his Grace: So also the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were justified by Faith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>All the Families of the Earth shall be blessed in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Obj. 5. <hi>If the Scripture be perfect, either the single Books of the Canon are perfect, or the whole Canon: It is granted, that the single Books of it are not so: And then the whole Canon is not, because many Books are lost, as the</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61508:12"/>
                        <hi>Writings of</hi> Nathan <hi>and</hi> Gad, <hi>with others,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 29. <hi>as also the Epistle of St.</hi> Paul <hi>to the</hi> Laodiceans, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The single Books have an essential Perfection, because they have the Matter and Form of the Word of God; the whole Canon has a proportionate one: The one has the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the part, the other of the whole: But we have all the Books that are Canonical; those Books that are lost, were Historical Narrations; and some others too, that were not Canonical.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 6. <hi>All that Christ said and did are not comprehended in the Scriptures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> All that Christ did and said, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for our Salvation, are in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 7. <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>bids us,</hi> 2 Thess. 2 15. <hi>to hold or keep the Traditions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Either the Apostle there speaks of those free and indifferent Constitutions that concern the Government of the Church, or concerning the Doctrine which he himself in Person had preached to them, and then even that was contained in his Writings, and other Canonical Books; for Tradition is wont to be taken in that Sense: Now he had delivered nothing contrary to the Scriptures, as some others had done.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 8. <hi>But besides, Those Books (which we call</hi> Apocrypha) <hi>should seem to be truly Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, because not only many Councils, but many Fathers have called and accounted them Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> We are to give credit to Councils, as far as they follow the guidance of Scripture, and no further; and if at any time General
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61508:12"/>
Councils call these Books Canonical, this is only in a comprehensive Sense, and has no other meaning, but that they were wont to be read in the Church for the ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Obj. 9. <hi>The Church is wont to cite many things from thence.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostles cited some things from the Writings of the Heathens, but we must not gather from thence, that their Writings are Canonical.</p>

                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Christ (as a Man) had not yet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; and for that reason, Grace thro' him was not yet offered.</hi>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It was unknown to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Conversion: Or, This Mystery was unknown to the Fathers, <hi>i. e.</hi> It was not so plainly and distinctly known as now it is; as you have it in that Text.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The ancient Church is called childish, not because it knew nothing of Christ, but because its Knowledge was very weak in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Church of the New Testament, which saw those things brought to pass, which were before prophesied of.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 5. <hi>Christ was the Mediator of a better Covenant, because it was established by better Promises,</hi> Heb. 8. 6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ is the Mediator of a better Covenant than that of <hi>Moses;</hi> for that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised only Blessing, upon condition they kept the Law: But the ancient Covenant, that was freely made with the Patriarchs, has the same Promises with the New Testament, in which Life is promised by Faith.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 6. <hi>Circumcision is called</hi> an everlasting Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 13. <hi>The Passover is called an</hi> everlasting Worship; <hi>and the whole Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Service is called an</hi> eternal Precept, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Ordinance, <hi>and therefore it does bind all Christians,</hi> Exod. 12. 14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Levitical Ordinances are called everlasting, <hi>i. e.</hi> so long as the Old Law should last; so that such a duration is spoken of, as the nature of the thing will bear. And the Word <hi>[Olam]</hi> in the Original signifies an Age or long time, but does not always denote an absolute Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 7. <hi>The Law of not cating Blood, does bind Christians,</hi> Acts 15. 29.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The eating of Blood was forbidden to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> not for ever, but for a time, to avoid giving Offence to the weak <hi>Jews,</hi>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61508:14"/>
who were not yet fully confirmed in the Faith of Christ, and did still believe, that this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was not quite abolished: But then you'll say, that abstaining from Blood and Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are both joyned together in the Apostle's Edict, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 29. therefore by the same ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that Christians are obliged to abstain from Fornication, by the same likewise are they bound as to the eating of Blood; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the eating of Blood and Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were joyned together by the Apostles, not that they really were, but only were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted equal. For by most Heathens, Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was accounted no Sin, and Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be wondred at by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they were so much in love with Chastity: Neither is it any new thing in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> to have moral, judicial, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Precepts mix'd together.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 8. <hi>None can make wiser Laws than God: Now the civil Precepts of the Law: Of not defrauding the Hirelings, of care for the Poor, and several others, do highly oblige every Christian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, no body makes Laws wiser than God; but among the Laws which He has made, some are only proper for the Jewish Commonwealth, and these do not bind Christians; but there are others which have the nature of common Justice, and a natural Law, and are the Explications and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the moral one, and the observation of them is likewise injoyned in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: But these do bind every one to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 9. <hi>The moral Law is not made for a Righteous Man,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 9.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Law as to its Punishments (whereof it threatens a great many) is not made for a Righteous Man to Condemnation, altho' it be made (as to its Rules) for Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. A just Man, even for the love of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, conforms himself to that Law, and then the threatnings of the Law signifie nothing to him. Consequently then, this can be nothing to wilful Libertines, that the Just are not bound by any Christian Laws.</p>

                     <p>THE Three Creeds, <hi>Nice</hi> Creed, <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>'s Creed, and that which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Apostle's Creed, ought thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be received and believed; for they may be proved by most certain Warrants of Holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>This Article seems to be imperfect, because it makes no mention of the</hi> Ephesian, Chalcedonian, <hi>and</hi> Constantinopolitan <hi>Creeds, which were wont to be approved of by the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This Article mentions the chief Creeds, not exclusively to others, as if they might not be true likewise; and it was not necessary to mention All.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>The Inventions of Men are not to be obtruded upon the Church, nor to be received as necessary to be believed; but the foregoing Creeds as such; and are proposed to our Faith, as if they were the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The aforesaid Creeds were indeed composed and methodized by Men; but yet they are not the meer Fancies of Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Holy Scriptures, which the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

supposes; but the Doctrine contained in them is conformable to the Word of God. Neither do we receive them with an equal degree of Faith with the Holy Scripture, but we give them the next place to That, and reverence them, as the chief Monuments of Faith.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>To omit others; that Sentence in</hi> Athanasius's <hi>Creed seems to be too severe, where he speaks of the Confession of Faith;</hi> That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept every one do keep it whole and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, without doubt he shall perish everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>What shall we then say of those that labour under an invincible Ignorance?</hi> How shall they believe on him, of whom they have not heard? <hi>says St.</hi> Paul, Rom. 10. 14, <hi>If then Men want the Means of Knowledge, and the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of this Doctrine has in no sort come to them, it is plain they are not to be blamed, and that they are free from Damnation; for God obliges no one to Impossibilities.</hi>

                     <p>ORiginal Sin stands not in the following of <hi>Adam</hi> (as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> do vainly talk; but it is the Fault and Corruption of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61508:15"/>
of every Man, that naturally is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of the Off-spring of <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby Man is very far gone from Original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and is of his own Nature inclined to Evil; so that the Fleth lusteth always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spirit; And therefore in every Person born into this World, it deserves God's Wrath and Damnation: And this Infection of Nature does remain; yea, in them that are Regenerated, whereby the Lust of the Flesh, called in <hi>Greek</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which some do expound the Wisdom, some Sensuality, some the Affection, some the Desire of the Flesh, is not subject to the Law of God. And altho' there is no Condemnation for them that believe, and are Baptized, yet the Apostle does confess, that Concupiscence and Lust has of it self the nature of Sin.</p>
                     <p>Against which it is Objected,</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>That God does not punish the same Sin twice; but he has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ready punished</hi> Adam's <hi>Sin in</hi> Adam, <hi>and therefore will not punish it in us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans. Adam</hi>'s Sin was not <hi>Numerically,</hi> but <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically,</hi> One; and that inclusive of the whole <hi>Species:</hi> As he sinned, so have we likewise sinned in him, and we are justly punished in our selves.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>It is plain, there is no such thing as Original Sin, because</hi> the Son shall not bear the Iniquity of the Father, <hi>says the Prophet,</hi> Ezek. 18. 20.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Son does not bear the Personal Sins of his Father; but the Sin of the first Man was a stain of the whole Nature; when therefore any one is punished for the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> he is punished for his own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61508:16"/>
Obj. 3. <hi>Sin is a voluntary thing; but Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin is not so in Infants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Original Sin is voluntary in All, nay, even in Infants too: for our Wills were in the Will of <hi>Adam,</hi> as in the Principle of Mankind; in him we willed and desired Evil.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>An Accident of one Individual is not transferred to the whole Species, but the Sin of</hi> Adam <hi>was only an Accident of one Individual.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans. Adam,</hi> inasmuch as he was the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Human Nature, was to be look'd upon here as an <hi>universal</hi> Cause.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 5. <hi>The Children of Holy Men are Holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. <hi>therefore they are not born in Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Children of Holy Men are not so Holy as to be free from Original Sin; but they are called so in regard of a Communion with the Church, by reason of that Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>I will be a God to Thee, and to thy Seed.</hi> They are therefore Holy, with a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and not with any inherent Holiness; so also they are Innocent, in respect to those Sins which are committed against Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 6. <hi>In Baptism we receive a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins, therefore Original Sin is wholly taken away, and so remains not in the Regenerate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Remission of Sin takes away Sin, as to its Imputation, not as to its Being; for Mortification is but imperfect in this Life: so in Baptism Sin is taken away; but not so much the Sin it self, as the Sting of it, that it may not hurt us.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 7. <hi>Things absolutely disagreeing do not meet in the same Subject; but Sin and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness are of that sort; therefore since there is</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61508:16"/>
                        <hi>Righteousness in the Regenerate, there can be no Sin there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Sin and Righteousness cannot be in the same Subject in the highest; but yet easily in lower degrees.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 8. <hi>Concupiscence, or a proneness to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, is distinguished from Sin, as the Cause is from the Effect,</hi> Jam. 1. 15. <hi>and therefore is not of it self to be accounted Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Concupiscence is distinguished from Actual Sin, and from an external Act already compleated; but in the mean time, it has of it self the nature of a Sin, because of it self it is not subjected to the Law of God: And it is this Rebellion of the Powers of our Souls that disposes us to all manner of Sins.</p>

                     <p>THE Condition of Man, after the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself by his own natural Strength, and Good Works to Faith, and calling upon God: Wherefore we have no Power to do Good Works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God by Christ prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that we may have a Good Will, and working with us, when we have that Good Will.</p>
                     <p>Against this Doctrine it is Objected,</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>That God commands Men</hi> to turn to him, <hi>and</hi> to believe in him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. <hi>and in many other places to perform all Works of Piety: Therefore this they</hi> can <hi>do, otherwise it would be commanded to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> From a Precept, to an Ability to perform it, we can draw no Argument: We can indeed, do Offices of Piety, and that only when we are acted and excited to them. God gives what he Commands, and helps what he has given; without <hi>Him</hi> we cannot be good, and without our selves he will not make us so.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>It is tyrannical to punish any one for not doing what he could not so much as Will or Desire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> He would be indeed a Tyrant, that should command such things to be done as are not in Mens Power: But God made Man with Abilities to fulfil his Commands; And then God requires of Man Obedience to his I aw, not by setting himself upon the exact fulfilling of it by his own feeble Strength; but, upon considering the impossibility of the thing, with respect to the Powers of Nature, to betake himself to Christ, through whom the Faithful are able to do all things.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>If Man had not a Free-Will, he would Sin necessarily, and then ought not to be punished, and so all Use of Exhortations, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, and all endeavour after Good Works would be taken away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> A Man without the help of Grace sins necessarily; whosoever is under this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, it is his Fault; for he has drawn this necessity of sinning upon himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is justly punished by God: And then as for the Use of Exhortations, that is not taken away with those that have the sufficient As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of God. The Precepts which cannot be performed by the strength of Nature, are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61508:17"/>
useful in this respect, that they put us in mind of our Weakness, invite us to an earnest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pray, and so lead us to Christ, who is wont to assist the weak: And these are the efficacious means that God (together with his Grace) makes use of in Man's Conversion; that what is impossible to Nature, may in this way become very easie.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>Men are called Labourers,</hi> Mat. 20. 8. <hi>and Labourers together with God in the business of Salvation,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Men do indeed co-operate with God by Grace, not by their own Strength; and therefore they are said to co-operate in respect of assisting, and not of preventing Grace.</p>

                     <p>WE are accounted Righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deservings; wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only, is a most whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Doctrine, and very full of Comfort, as more largely is expressed in the Homily of Justification.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>In this Article there seems to be a Contradiction, when it is said we are accounted Righteous only for the Merit of Christ; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it is said, this is done by Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is no Contradiction at all: We are only accounted Righteous by the Merit of Christ, as by an impellent Cause; yet this is done likewise by Faith, as by an instrumental Cause, whereby we obtain that Merit.</p>

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61508:18"/>
Obj. 2. <hi>By Justification we are restored to that State, from which, by the Sin of</hi> Adam, <hi>we were fallen,</hi> Rom. 5. 19. Since therefore we lost inherent Righteousness by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, we recover it again by Justification.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> We are restored by the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ, and partly by inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness too: The one as the most perfect, is imputed for perfect Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. But the other is too weak for us to be able to stand before God, <hi>Esa.</hi> 64. 6. In the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. the Word <hi>[as]</hi> does not determine the manner or the quality, but the original Author of Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>It is said,</hi> Rom. 8. 24. By Hope we are saved.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> By Hope is there meant Trust, and so it falls in with Faith: Even by Hope we are said to be saved, because we are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally possessed of Salvation, but by Hope, not that we are justified by any peculiar Vertue of Hope.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>Many Sins were forgiven</hi> Mary Magdalen, <hi>because she loved much, says the Text,</hi> Luke 7. 47. <hi>therefore by Love she was Justified.</hi>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Particle <hi>[because]</hi> does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note any forcible cause of Justification, but only a significative one; for Love is a sign of Justification, and is the fruit and companion of Faith; but yet it has not an equal share with it in the Act of Justification. Here is no Consequence, her Sins were forgiven, because she loved, therefore Love is the cause of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness: So neither does this follow: A Man lives, because he walks, therefore walking is the cause of Life.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> speaks of Justification, or the proof of Justification before Men, as is plain from Verse 18. <hi>Shew me thy Faith by thy Works,</hi> and Ver. 21. <hi>Abram was justified by the Work of Offering up his Son,</hi> i. e. he was declared Righteous, whereas before, by the righteousness of Faith he had been pronounced Just before God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>Evil Works condemn, therefore Good Ones justifie; for the same reason holds in things that are opposite.</hi>

                     <p>WOrks done before the Grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God; forasmuch as they spring not of Faith in Jesus Christ, neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace, or (as the

School Authors say) deserve Grace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity: Yea rather, for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but that they have the nature of Sin.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Unbelievers would sin in omitting what they ought to do, and the Sin of Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is sometimes greater than the Sin of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. However, Works are not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid for any accidental Fault of the Man; but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and the Unconverted are to be perswaded to do all Good Things, which they are even obliged to by Precept.

                        <hi>ART. XVII.</hi> Of Predestination and Election.</head>
                     <p>PRedestination to Life is the everlasting Purpose of God, whereby (before the Foundations of the World were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his Council, secret to us, to deliver from Curse and Damnation, those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting Salvation, as Vessels made to Honour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they which be indued with so excellent a Benefit of God, be called according to God's Purpose by his Spirit working in due Season: They through Grace obey the Calling: They be justified freely: They be made Sons of God by Adoption: They be made like the Image of his only begotten Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good Works, and at length, by God's Mercy, they attain to everlasting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>
                     <p>As the Godly Consideration of Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and our Election in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable Comfort to godly Persons, and such as feel in themselves the Working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the Works of the Flesh, and their earthly Members, and drawing up their Mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly establish and confirm their Faith of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it does servently kindle their Love towards God. So for curious and carnal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually before their Eyes the Sentence of God's Predestination is a most dangerous
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61508:23"/>
downfal, whereby the Devil does thrust them either into Desperation, or into Wretchlesness of most unclean Living, no less perillous than Desperation. Furthermore we must receive God's Promises in such wise as they be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally set forth to us in Holy Scripture: And in our Doings <hi>that</hi> Will of God is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, which we have expresly declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>Against the foregoing Article it is obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> 1. <hi>That Men are not predestinated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no other Creatures are said to be predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; whereas there is the same Reason for all God's Creatures, which are ordained to some End by his Providence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> There is not the same Reason for all Creatures; for irrational Creatures are not capable of this Supernatural End. Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore is wrongfully called an Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any End whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>He that predestinates Men, ought to prae-determine whatsoever relates to their Merits or Demerits: But God does not prae-determine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Powers; for then we should be necessarily forced either to Salvation or Destruction. But God thus compels no body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> God has not prae-determined Mens Merits or Demerits, so as to impose any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity upon them; but has given to Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall a most free Will.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>That it is not agreeable to the Nature of Angels to be predestinated to Life; and therefore neither is it to Men: The Antecedent is thus proved; because Predestination to Life is a Purpose of Compassion; but the Angels ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were in Misery: The Consequence is true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:61508:23"/>
                        <hi>Angels are capable of Happiness as well as Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Why may we not say of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that they were predestinated to Life? Since Pity is not only a Releasement from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; but every Reward above what is due is such: And the Nature of the Mercy is not to be taken from any Prior State, but from the present Condition; and therefore it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial whether any one be predestinated from a State of Misery or not.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>If God should reprobate any one, the Man that is reprobated is not to be charged with his own Ruin: For no Man must be charged with what he could not avoid: But if God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, Man could not help it; for no Man can withstand God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This Argument would hold, if God should damn a Man inevitably without any Cause; but because Man's falling into Sin proceeds from his own Degeneracy; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Destruction is deservedly imputed to himself.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 5. <hi>God has accepted a sufficient Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som for all Men, that is, the Satisfaction of Christ; therefore he ought to receive all Men into his Favour; and by consequence none are to be damned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Ransom that Christ made was sufficient, but 'twas upon the Condition of our applying it to our selves; otherwise it would not be so: But all Men do not rightly apply Christ's Merits.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 6. <hi>They, whose Salvation depends upon the secret Determinations of God, can have no true Comfort or Support; therefore the Doctrine</hi>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61508:24"/>
                        <hi>of Predestination is not so full of Comfort as we speak of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Counsel of God is a Secret to us, and brings no Comfort unless it be revealed by the Holy Spirit, and by the Signs of Election, which are Faith, Repentance, Charity, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vertues.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is asserted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>That no Man can be saved by the Law of Nature or of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>It is said, That the whole of the Law and the Prophets is comprehended in that known Law of Nature:</hi> All things that ye would that Men should do unto you, do ye also to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>Whence we may easily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it appears to all Men what is absolutely necessary to Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Love that we are to shew to our Neighbour is comprehended in that Principle; but <hi>that</hi> alone is not sufficient: for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61508:24"/>
of the Gospel, which is unknown to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is likewise requisite to Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>God does not require at our Hands things impossible; but it is impossible that they who have never heard of Christ, should relie upon or believe in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Either, according to the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. All Men have heard of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Christ: Or, All may hear of him in the utmost Parts of the World, where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is daily preached: Or if there have been, and are some, who have never heard of it, we must think, that this was and is for some very grievous Impieties, which make them unworthy of such a Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>Christ told the Pharisees,</hi> John 9. 41. If ye were blind, ye would not have Sin: <hi>And then told his Disciples concerning the Jews,</hi> John 15. 22.

                     <p>THE visible Church of Christ is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of faithful Men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ's Ordinance, in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.</p>
                     <p>As the Church of <hi>Jerusalem, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> have erred, so also the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erred, not only in their Living and manner of Ceremonies but also in Matters of Faith.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>That the Church is compared to a Fold, wherein are Sheep and Goats,</hi> i. e. <hi>good and bad: Therefore the Church is not only the Congregation of the Faithful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Wicked Men may be said to be in the Church, but not of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Very many Sects have boasted, that with them was to be sound wholsome Doctrine, and a right use of the Sacraments; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Marks do not always distinguish the true visible Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is one thing falsly to boast, and another really to have; the infallible Word of God, well considered, will show to what Assembly Men ought to joyn themselves. We find that the <hi>Beraeans</hi> (tho' not of the Priestly Order) could know how to value St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s New Doctrine, with Profit to themselves.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>That these Marks are later and more obscure than the Church; later because the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors or Teachers are before the Doctrine; more obscure, because it is the part of the Church to explain its own Doctrine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61508:25"/>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Word of God, tho' not as the written Word, yet as to its Substance, was before the Church, because by that the Church was formed: But tho' it were after the Church, yet it might be a mark of it, as the Effect may be a mark of the Cause. Even the written Doctrine was before its Teachers, who have lived in these last Ages: And then, to an Unbeliever, the Church is more plain and remarkable than the Scripture, as to its external Form; but to a Believer, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is plainer than the Church, as to its internal Form, because the Holy Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens the Minds of the Faithful. Now the Church explains the Scripture, but then it is by Scripture, because it lays down Scripture in its own simple native Light: And so far we ought to give credit to the Decisions of the Church, as far as its Determinations are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>We can assign no time wherein the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>has failed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> As to the time wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has begun to fail, the Apostle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, That in his time the foundations of that Mystery of Iniquity were already laid, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 7. And Christ tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 25. That the Enemy the Devil came and sowed Tares among the Wheat, while Men slept, that is, before they were aware: And who (I pray you) will be able to show us, when Religion began so to be corrupted by the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees as it was? It is sufficient to us, that the Doctrine of the Romanists (as we now find it) is not conformable to the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 5. <hi>We can name no visible Assembly or</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61508:26"/>
                        <hi>Church that has had a Being, since the Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is no strange thing, that the true Church should be so oppressed by the violence of Persecutions, and Errors so far prevail, as that no Publick Assembly, either very numerous or very remarkable, can be found to worship God rightly: As in the time of <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 14. The Prophet complains, that he alone was left, not only of the Prophets, but of all the Sons of <hi>Israel,</hi> with whom the publick and ordinary Worship of God was yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; and that these Words of the Prophet are to be taken in the largest Sense, and not of the Kingdom of <hi>Samaria</hi> alone, the Apostle gives us to understand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. And then the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> at that time revolted, and grew cold in their Worship, and the service of God: Now those Seven thousand that had not bowed the Knee to the Image of <hi>Baal,</hi> did not constitute any visible Church, because they lay concealed in the midst of Idolaters, and not so much as the Prophets were known. Let us withal consider, how small a Church it was, while Christ was alive, and almost all Men opposed him and his Doctrine; and when the Son of Man shall come the second time, he will hardly find Faith in the Earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 8. All this is not said, as if there were not visible Assemblies to be found agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us in Doctrine; for the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches have retained the Fundamentals of Religion uncorrupted, and would never be Subject to the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> So in other Countries, there have been always Assemblies of the Faithful, that have maintained our Cause, as very many have demonstrated.</p>

                     <p>THE Church has Power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and Authority in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of Faith: And yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God's Word written; neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, altho' the Church be a witness and keeper of Holy Writ, yet as it ought not to decree any thing against the same; so besides the same ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Against which it is Objected:</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>The Lord has said,</hi> Deut. 4. 2. <hi>Ye shall not add any thing to the Word which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you; and therefore it seems the Church has no Power of adding Rites and Ceremonies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> These Words are not to be understood of every Addition that is made, but of That only, which is contrary and repugnant to Scripture; or which is a Corruption of what God had commanded by <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>The Apostle would not have the Christians to be subject to the Ordinances of Men,</hi> Col. 2. 20. <hi>but Ecclesiastical Ceremonies are such.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle forbids the <hi>Colossians</hi> to be subject to the Decrees of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> such as, The not touching dead Bodies, lest they should be defiled; The not eating of this or that Meat, as if it were unclean; but he does not speak against such Rites and Ceremonies which tend to preserve the external Worship of God and the State of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61508:27"/>
Obj. 3. <hi>Those Doctrines which are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men, ought not to be taught, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it were in vain to worship God,</hi> Mat. 15. 4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Men would indeed worship Christ in vain, if they neglected his Commands to obey the Commandments of Men: But Christ does not blame such Precepts of the Church, as are not contrary to the Divine Laws; but only such Commandments of Men, as are purely human Conceits, invented by Men, contrary to the Will of God, Of which there are some vain and trifling; as the Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Washings, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. others Erroneous as that the Soul is polluted with Meats, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and others again absolutely contrary to the Word of God, as the defrauding of Parents, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>Scripture is the Judge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and therefore the Church has no Authority in them.</hi>

                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Princes have only Authority in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Matters, and Christian Princes are not set over Christians, as they are Christians, but as they are Men: For Princes themselves, as they are Christians, are the Sheep, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must be Subject to the Shepherds.</hi>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Princes have Authority in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Matters, not to officiate in Holy Things, but to take care that they be done. Christian Princes are set over Christians as such: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause altho' Princes are the Sheep in respect of such Actions which relate to an inward Ecclesiastical Government; such as the Preaching of the Word, and Administration of the Sacraments; yet in respect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Government of the Church, Princes are the Pastors of all their People. Kings are under Ministers in some Ecclesiastical Matters, but Ministers are subject to Kings in all Civil Concerns.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>It is said, that where two or three are gathered together in the Name of Christ, they shall always obtain what they desire: Much more then shall Bishops, praying in a Council, obtain all things necessary to determine whatsoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Church.</hi>

                     <p>Obj. 4. <hi>The whole Church cannot err in Faith,</hi> Mat. 16. 18. <hi>but a Council does represent the Church, and the whole Authority of the Church is form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Councils are but a part of the Church, and the same Privileges do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Part as to the Whole. They that are not in Councils, have sometimes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Gifts, by which Councils themselves might be mended: Neither are all the Eyes of the Church in those Bishops that are met in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, whereas there are many Bishops out of the Council that see as well as the other: Nay, all single Christians do in some measure see; And their Gifts are not to be despised neither.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle here does not dispute concerning Men of the Holy Order alone, but of all Christians in general, who should also, by the same reason, live a single Life. But alcho' Marriage has its Troubles, it has its Conveniencies too; And a pious Wife is given not for an Impediment, but for a Help, as well in Spiritual as in Family Concerns. Celibacy is therefore to be preferred to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, when the Church is under various Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, and upon condition the Person has the Gift of Continence. But from hence no general Rule can be made that Celibacy is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61508:40"/>
to be observed by any particular Order of Men. Wherefore also the Apostle says, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 28. <hi>That if thou marry, thou hast not sinned.</hi> So that the place before cited, proves nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Article.</p>

                     <p>IT is not necessary that Traditions and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies be in all places one or utterly like;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61508:41"/>
for at all times they have been divers, and may be changed according to the Diversity of Countries, Times, and Mens Manners, so that nothing be Ordained against God's Word. Whosoever, thro' his private Judgment, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and purposely doth openly break the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common Authority, ought to be rebuked openly (that others may fear to do the like) as he that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth against the common Order of the Church, and hurteth the Authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the Consciences of the weak Brethren. Every particular or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church hath Authority to Ordain, change and abolish Ceremonies or Rites of the Church, ordained only by Man's Authority; so that all things be done to Edifying.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>Christians ought to walk according to the same Rule, and to have the highest Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongst themselves; as may be gathered from</hi> Gal. 6. 16. 1 Pet. 3. 8. <hi>and therefore the same Ceremonies are alike necessary in all places.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The variety of Ceremonies does not destroy the Unity of the Church, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Faithful do but walk according to the same Rule of Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Christ has said, Reprove a Sinner betwixt him and thy self alone,</hi> Mat. 18. 15. <hi>therefore he is not publickly to be reproved by any One.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61508:41"/>
Sins, publickly committed: Such as these must be publickly reproved.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>The Apostle advises</hi> Titus <hi>to avoid Strifes and Contentions,</hi> Chap. 3. 9. <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not to be reproved, who oppose the Traditions of the Church.</hi>

Times we would suppose it to speak, there are very many Churches (for want of sufficient Encouragement, or other Reasons) which are destitute of a Learned Preacher, and which indeed is to be lamented: And besides, such is the carelesness of some in their Preachings, that it would be more profitable to hear a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, than their Sermons.</p>

                     <p>THE Book of Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops, and ordering of Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the time of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Sixth, and confirmed at the same time by Authority of Parliament, doth contain all things necessary to such Consecration and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering: Neither hath it any thing, that of it self is Superstitious and Ungodly. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whosoever are consecrated and ordered according to the Rites of that Book, since the the second Year of the asorenamed King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> unto this time, or hereafter, shall be consecrated and ordered according to the same Rites; we decree all such to be rightly, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and lawfully consecrated and ordered.</p>

                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>It is an impious thing, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop should say to every one of those that are Ordained,</hi> Receive the Holy Ghost; <hi>as if he had the Power of conferring the Holy Ghost, which is peculiar to Christ himself, and was the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Token of his Divine Power: But no mortal Man can assume this to himself, or ought to imitate it.</hi>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Bishop does not mean, when he says, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> as if he could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon them the inward Gifts of the Holy Ghost in an extraordinary manner; but he says it, because he confers upon them the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and ordinary Ministry, whereof the Holy Ghost is the Author: In which Sense al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he says, <hi>Receive thou Authority to preach the Gospel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>THE Riches and Goods of Christians are not common, as touching the Right, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and Possession of the same: as certain <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists</hi> do falsly boast: Notwithstanding every Man ought, of such things as he posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, liberally to give Alms to the Poor, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Ability.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>The more common any Good is, the better it is; and therefore it were better if the Goods of Christians were common.</hi>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It were better indeed for others, if Goods were common, but not for him whose Goods they are, and who cannot conveniently part with them. Every one, in the Order of Charity, is obliged to take care of himself first; and if after that he gives Alms ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Ability, he is in a fair way of Salvation.</p>

                     <p>Obj. 3. <hi>The Apostles and Primitive Christians had all things common,</hi> Acts 2. 44.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> That mutual imparting of Goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the first Christians, was not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apostle, but was voluntarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the richer sort; neither was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety there taken away: only the Affection of the Mind is expressed, inasmuch as in Will and Desire they had all things common: And all did not sell their Good: for there are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of some that kept their own to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, That it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and in their Power to do it, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 4.

And then the Prohibition of Christ is to be strictly understood of all those Oaths, which the Pharisees allowed, and thereby seduced the People: For they taught, that it was lawful, upon any Account, to swear, provided their Oath was but true. Nay, and they added, that it was lawful for them to swear by Heaven, the Earth, <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Creature: And that they were never guilty of Perjury, but where there was menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of the express Name of God, or of the Gifts that were consecrated to God: For that by these Interpretations the Pharisees did corrupt the Law of God concerning Oaths, no Man will deny that will but diligently consider what Christ has said against such Oaths as were allowed by the Pharisees, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Amongst other Opinions, that are built chiefly upon the Authority of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> he began to dwell much upon that of absolute Predestination; which indeed is such, as quite excludes the greater part of Men, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61508:51"/>
of God and Christ, from sufficient Grace and Christ's Redemption: And as if this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion were not perfect, if it related only to the corrupted Mass or Body of Men, he was resolved to advance and carry it further, to an uncorrupted Mass: And upon this account blamed St. <hi>Austin</hi> because he said, <hi>That the Reason of Predestination was sought for and not found; but the Reason of Reprobation was sought for and found too. But</hi> Whitaker maintained, that the Reprobation which was passed upon the Mass not yet corrupted, was not purely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, but did include an Affirmation; for, says he, this is the Decree and Will of God, whereby so many Men run into eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Peter Baron</hi> having perhaps before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered this Matter, and was now, without doubt, moved by these Paradoxes of <hi>Whitaker,</hi> to search more diligently into all the Parts of this Argument, did at last, amongst the great variety of Opinions, conclude, that none was more probable, than that which <hi>Melancthon</hi> defended in <hi>Germany, Hemmingius</hi> in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Snecanus.</hi> in <hi>Friseland,</hi> viz. They placed a foreknowledge of Faith, in order before Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination; as the ancient Fathers, before St. <hi>Austin,</hi> did understand and teach; as also did St. <hi>Austin</hi> himself, before he contended with <hi>Pelagius;</hi> and for this they bring the Testimony of the Fathers themselves, and <hi>Beza</hi> consessing the same thing.</p>
                     <p>After the Controversie of Predestination, followed two others (if yet we may call those Two, where one is the necessary consequence of the other,) 1. Concerning a Falling-off
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61508:51"/>
from Grace. 2. Of the Certainty and Security of Salvation. <hi>Baron</hi> maintained that Faith and justifying Grace may sometimes be lost; This <hi>Whitaker</hi> denied: The one allowed a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Hope, the other a Certainty of Faith, and <hi>that</hi> an absolute, and not a conditional Certainty: This Opinion <hi>Baron</hi> particularly maintained in his Lectures upon the Prophet <hi>Jonas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Dispute of the Two Professors had for a long time, as is usual, divided the Young Men into Parties, <hi>Whitaker</hi> at length takes a Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and goes strait to the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> giving him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the University was corrupted with the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Doctrine; and unless some stop was put to it in time, this would come to an open Quarrel: Neither could he see any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Remedy at present, than that the Nine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions which he had drawn up, after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal and approbation of some eminent and learned Men, should be sent immediately to <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Positions were wrote in such a manner, that one may easily discern the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Man, in that nice and exquisite turn of the Words, which for Peace sake would not be disapproved of even by such as did not a little dissent from him. A meeting of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Divines was then appointed (not a great number) in <hi>Nov.</hi> 1595. And because in such a perplext Argument as this was, the same Words and Things did not please every body there were Disputations for some time. On the last Day, it happened that one or two who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed most from <hi>Whitaker</hi>'s Opinion, were
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61508:52"/>
absent, and so the others prevailed. Now Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>

But it is easie to see what these Men aimed at; whilst they think and teach, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is done in human Affairs, be it good or bad, 'tis all bound up by the Law of an unalterable Decree; and that even the Wills of Men has <hi>this</hi> necessity imposed upon them, that they are not able to Will and Desire any otherwise than as they do always Will and Desire.

In this second Article there was added by the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Divines, 1. [moving,] 2. [to Life,] 3. <hi>The sole, absolute, and simple Will of God,</hi> is changed into, <hi>The sole Will of God that is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased,</hi> and that not without good reason: For the moving Cause of Predestination to Life is not Faith, but the Merit of Christ; since God designed Salvation for those that are to be saved, not for their Faith, but for the sake of Christ. The word [moving] agrees properly to Merit, and Merit is in the Obedience of Christ, and not in our Faith. These words [to Life] are added; because altho a foresight of Infidelity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency be the Cause of Predestination to Death, and so likewise of any thing else which is in the Persons predestinated to Death; yet there is no Cause of Predestination to Life, but the sole Good-Will and Pleasure of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of St. <hi>Austin.</hi> The Cause of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination is sought for and not found, but the Cause of Reprobation is sought for and sound too.

Faith was a Gift that was common both to the Elect and Reprobate; but Perseverance was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar only to the Elect. But <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Opinion was, That a true and justifying Faith is to be found no where but in the Elect, and those that are to be saved. The eminent Dr. <hi>Overal</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise defended both in the University, and at the Meeting at <hi>Hampton Court;</hi> That a Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed Person, if he fall into grievous Sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actual Repentance, is in a State of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And those likewise the contrary Opinion, which would bear us in Hand; That a Justified Person, tho' he fall into grievous Sins, does yet remain Justified, was condemned by the King's Majesty.

The Assembly have altered [Grace sufficient to Salvation] which was in <hi>Whitaker</hi>'s own Manuscript, and put [saving Grace] in the room; that it might plainly appear, that they spoke of that Grace, which is finally saving, or actually efficacious, or such as of it self, without the addition of any new Grace, worketh Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                        <p>The Word of God by the Prophet is most true, That <hi>in me</hi> only <hi>is thy Help; i. e.</hi> Help is to be had from none but me; and from me you can have nothing else but Help: As also that of the Apostle: <hi>Who is it, that maketh thee to differ from another? i. e.</hi> from God alone we have whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes us to differ from others.

Whether it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, or excludes Christ; <hi>i. e.</hi> whether the Act of Predestinating be an absolute or a relative Act. As to my self, I think it to be relative; and that there is no good Pleasure of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, but by his Son, <hi>in whom he is well pleased;</hi> nor that any one is predestinated, either before, or without the Direction and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Christ. But (as the Scripture has it) Christ was first fore-known, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. and then we in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, Christ was first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. and then we by him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5.

                        <p>Nor do I think there is any Inconvenience sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from hence, That God should so choose to bestow his Gifts in us, as to crown us with what he gives; Namely, What by first loving us he gave, with the same, after it was so given, he did elect us: So that Love, which is an Act of Grace, whereby God makes a difference, as well as Election, which is an Act of Judgment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he chooses those that are so distinguished, are both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>But this whole Question (as I have said) is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning the Order, in which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds according to our Capacity, <hi>who know only in part,</hi> than of the Cause of it, as to the Act it self, which is one, and that most simple, in God.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61508:64"/>
doubt! And therefore we may have peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but not secure Thoughts; because Peace it self is not secure. For we are to take care in the first place, that this Peace be true; for as the Prophet says, <hi>They have healed the Hurt of the Daughter of my People slightly, saying, Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace,</hi> Jer. 6. 14. Ezek. 13. 10. And then if <hi>that</hi> be true, we are to take care in the second place, that the Conditions of this Peace be not violated and broken by us, and so it be taken away from us again. For thus saith the Lord <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>I have taken away my Peace from this People, even Loving-kindness and Mercy.</hi> And as we ought not to be secure, because we have Peace; so neither ought we to be so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we stand in Grace, or by Faith; for such ought to consider what the Apostle saith: <hi>Take heed lest any of you sail of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>the Grace of God.</hi> And then he that stands by Faith ought to take heed of what the same Apostle saith: <hi>Thou standest in,</hi> or <hi>by Faith, be not high-minded, but fear:</hi> As also what <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 10.</note> he saith in another place: <hi>Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.</hi> Which Words of the Apostle are made use of by S. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> against Security. <note place="margin">August de Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no persever.

                     </p>
                     <p>2. The Holy Scriptures no where recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Security, but rather seem to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at the Word: VVe ought to avoid it, since such are reproved by the Apostle, who would trust to it: <hi>For when Men shall say, Peace and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then sudden Destruction cometh upon them,</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 3. Wherefore I think it ought to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a thing of an ill Omen.</p>
                     <p>Nor, 3. does the Reason and Meaning of the Word give any Countenance to this: For he that is secure, does not only banish all Doubtfulness,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61508:64"/>
but even Care too: For Security is directly opposed to Care. But we are commanded by the Holy Ghost to make use of all our Care and Watchfulness: And the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 11. desires, <hi>That every one should shew the same Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, even unto the end.</hi> 4. But the thing it self, <hi>[viz. Security]</hi> seems to be repugnant to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Christian Life, which is a Warfare; nay and to human Life too, which is a Tryal upon Earth; so that neither of these will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Security, but rather call for our utmost Care and Diligence, both to pray that we be not led into Temptation, and also to look to our selves that we be not tempted; And St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this Advice even to those that are Spiritual, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
                     <p>5. Those Words so often made use of by Christ and his Apostles <hi>[Watch, consider, take heed, try your selves, prove your selves]</hi> ought to shake off, and not to create Security: For what can these Words signifie, but a Command not to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. We have several other Expressions besides to this Purpose. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and trembling,</hi> saith <note place="margin">2 Phil. 14</note> St. <hi>Paul: Pass the time of your sojourning here in Fear,</hi> saith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 17.

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>means, without doubt, that we should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strive for this <hi>Certainty;</hi> that every one should be so solicitous and careful about his own Concerns, as that he may at length arrive thereto. As much as to say, that an <hi>Endeavour after Certainty</hi> is all we are capable of in this Life; and a great Virtue in them who have it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:61508:65"/>
But, 7. The degree of Certainty, which we have in this Life, must not stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with what we shall have in a future State; some difference there must be allowed, and there can be nothing further or greater than Security: From whence it is, that [to enjoy a Security] is peculiar to those who are already dead, and can sing that Triumph of the Apostle, <hi>Death is swallowed up in Victory.</hi> But we that still sojourn here upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>9. Altho' what is alledged concerning Carnal and Spiritual Security be of no great weight, since by equal reason it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>10. <hi>Lastly,</hi> I do not think that we ought to recede from the common and usual way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church, whose Thoughts are much the same with those of <hi>Leo</hi> afore-cited, <hi>That we neither can nor ought to be secure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61508:68"/>

But to those whom he hath chosen in Christ, out of the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he hath, out of his good Pleasure bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and granted a greater and more abundant provision of Grace; whereby they are most certainly led on to Faith, Perseverance, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation. As for the rest, they have nothing to complain of; for hereby is shown, both what the Free-will of Man left to it self, can do under the Aid of a common, yet suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grace; and also the singular Benesit of a special and prevailing Grace in those, to whom God shall please to bestow it: So that St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Opinion is true, not only of the first Man, but likewise of all his Posterity. <q>The God and Lord of all things has so disposed the Life of Men and Angels, as first to show therein what their Free-will could do; and then how far the Advantage of his Grace, and the Love of Justice would prevail.</q> Thus <hi>God is the Saviour of all Men, but especially of them that believe,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 10. which words of the Apostle, as <hi>Prosper</hi> thought, ought to determine this whole Cause.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Concerning the Death of Christ.</head>
                     <p>THE Opinion of our Church concerning the Death of Christ is so plain, and every where so consistent with it self; That Christ died for <hi>All</hi> Men, or for <hi>all</hi> the Sins of <hi>all</hi> Men; that it is to be wondered, that any of us should ever have ventured to call it in Question. It is said in the II. Article, <q>that Christ truly Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, was Crucified, Dead, and Buried, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile his Father to us, and to be a Sacrifice, not only for Original Guilt, but also for all the actual Sins of Men.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Article VII. <q>As well in the Old as New Testament, everlasting Life is offered to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by Christ, who is the only Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, being both God and Man.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Article XV. <q>Christ came to be a Lamb without Spot, who by Sacrifice of himself once made, should take away the Sins of the World. And again, Article XXXI. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Christ once made, is that perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Propitiation, and Satisfaction for <hi>All</hi> the Sins of the whole World, both Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Actual.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the same is to be met with in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Catechism, as the most plain sense of the second part of the Creed, wherein it is proposed to every one <hi>to believe in God the Son, who hath redeemed him and all Mankind;</hi> according to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, <hi>who for us Men and for our Salvation, descended,</hi> &amp;c. And in many other places of our publick Liturgy; as in the Prayer of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61508:69"/>
in the Sacrament: <q>O God! who didst give thine only Son jesus Christ to suffer death upon the Cross for o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Redemption, who made there, by his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </q> The Death of Christ therefore considered in it self must be a Price sufficient for All Men, if it was given for All. But the Scripture saith plainly, That God gave his Son for the World, and lays a Condition thereon, not the Death of Christ, but the Faith of Man; and from thence Salvation is to follow conditionally: That the Son was so given, that, whosoever believeth in him shall be saved: But whether Men believe or not, God gave his Son for them, and through him offered Salvation on the Condition of Faith. Now that Men should perform this Condition, God does both command in his Word, and by the Grace of his Holy Spirit does actually excite and co-operate: So that if they do not believe, the Fault may be in Men, and not in God: As on the contrary, if they do believe, <hi>that</hi> must be attributed to Divine Grace, and not to any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Virtue. Whence it is pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, that it was God's Will and Design that Christ should die for All; though All, through their own Unbelief and Impenitency, do not from thence receive the Fruits of Salvation. But then there are some Effects of this that do redound to All; as the Common Vocation; The Warnings and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, not only of the External VVord, but of Internal Grace too: And lastly, the General Resurrection of All. For because Christ by his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61508:69"/>
Death and Resurrection did overcome Death, and rose again, therefore shall all Men likewise rise again from the Dead; as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.</hi> For the same Reason has Christ obtained to himself a Dominion over all Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he dyed for <hi>All;</hi> As St. <hi>Paul</hi> has abundantly shown. VVhich <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 9. 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.</note> Places, as they sufficiently prove that Christ died singly for <hi>All,</hi> so they signifie to us, that both the general Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Salvation to all Believers, with whatsoever is sufficient for common Grace, and also the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of particular Election, and Grace effectually persevering; nay, and the Preparation and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of these, are all founded in the same Christ, and in his Death, fore-seen from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. So that out of the side of Christ's dying upon the Cross, not only the Sacraments of the Church, but likewise all saving Goods and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces must be understood to flow. And this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is so manifest in the Scriptures, that <hi>Calvin</hi> (who was otherwise sufficiently rigid about Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination) in explaining those very places, which others brought to take away the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality of Christ's Death (as in some 'tis said that he dyed for <hi>Many)</hi> has every where interpreted them of <hi>All.</hi> Thus upon <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 20. he says, that <hi>[Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny]</hi> is taken for <hi>[All.]</hi> So again upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>It is certain,</hi> says he, <hi>that all Men do not receive Advantage from the Death of Christ, but then this is owing to their own Infidelity that hinders them.</hi> VVhich VVords do plainly enough favour the common Opinion. Therefore it must not be said, that this which is so clear in it self <hi>[that Christ dyed for All]</hi> ought to be explained from an extravagant and rigid Conception of Secret Predestination; but we are rather to interpret that Secret by a thing which is plain in it self;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61508:70"/>
that so it may be truly consistent with what was rightly enough delivered in a common Saying of the Schools, <hi>That Christ dyed for All sufficiently; For the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE Desinition of our Church concerning Free-Will and Grace is short, being set down in the Tenth Article in these VVords: <q>The Condition of Man after the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> In which VVords both Merit and Strength to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any Spiritual Good are denied to Man in a fallen or sinful State, <hi>i. e.</hi> He cannot turn and prepare himself for Faith and Calling upon God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where notwithstanding it is supposed in the first place, that Man in Natural and Civil Matters has a Free-VVill, and does exercise his own Natural Strength, and even Good VVorks in that kind; with which yet he cannot turn and prepare himself to Faith and a Spiritual Good. 2. The necessity of Grace for the doing VVorks of Piety is shown; because without (the Grace of God, we are not at all able to do such VVorks: VVhere also we may learn by the way, that the Grace of God being supposed) we can, and are able to do something towards VVorks of Piety. 3. From thence we understand how this Grace is given, and whence it is to be had; <hi>i. e.</hi> By the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61508:70"/>
Grace of God which is by Christ. 4. We may learn likewise how Grace operates, <hi>viz.</hi> By pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting us that we may <hi>will,</hi> and by co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with us when we do <hi>will.</hi> Now Grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents us that we may <hi>will,</hi> by enlightning the Mind, inspiring the <hi>Will,</hi> injecting pious Thoughts and good Desires, and by seasoning the Heart with Zeal, and the Affections of Faith: Therefore of our selves we do not do a good VVork, either because we do not know what is Good, or the Good does not delight us. So St. <hi>Austin</hi> explains this Matter: <q>Ignorance and Infirmity, says he, are Vices which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the VVill from moving towards any good VVork, or abstaining from an ill one.</q> Now that we may come to know what we were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, and that <hi>that</hi> may be made sweet, which before did not delight, the Grace of God is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to help and assist the VVills of Men; and if they be not helped hereby, the Fault is in themselves, and not in God. And then Grace co-operates with us, not only by concurring, but also by directing and protecting, by strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and helping of us; for our Endeavours to Good are nothing, if they be not excited by preventing Grace; and they are vain, if they be not assisted by co-operating Grace; as <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>De Gratia &amp; lib. Arb.</hi> Nevertheless in both these Acts of Grace, Free-will is not taken away, but perfected. For, as the same <hi>Bernard</hi> says, <hi>Ep.</hi> 46. <hi>ad Valentinum. If there be no Free-Will, there is nothing to be saved; and if there be no Grace, there is no Salvation</hi> And so St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin: If there be no Free-Will, how shall God judge the World; and if there be no Grace how shall he save it?</hi> Add to this <hi>that</hi> of St. <hi>Prosper: If the Will be taken away, where is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 1. ca. 1. De Vocatione Gentium.</note> 
                        <hi>the very Original of true Vertues? If Grace be taken away, where is the</hi>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:61508:71"/>
                        <hi>very Cause of Good Works?</hi> In all which, there is not one Word of the Operation of irresistible Grace: For although Grace may very often work certainly and infallibly, where it operates according to the purpose of eternal Election, and though it be certain, that the Decree of attaining the End proposed stands good, supposing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preparation and Fore-knowledge: Yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it does not operate by any irresistible Force, the Liberty of the Will being preserved, even under the Aids of Grace: So likewise in many other things (preventing Grace being supposed) it has an Event suitable to its Liberty. Finally; in our Articles, and in many places of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liturgy, the necessity of Grace is <hi>so</hi> laid down, that the Will notwithstanding is left free under Grace. Without which, all Laws, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Consultations, Conditions, Exhortations, Admonitions, Promises, Threatnings, Praises and Dispraises, Rewards and Punishments would be offered and propounded to no purpose, and all reason and regard for Care, Diligence, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, Counsel, and Labour would be taken away: So that neither <hi>nothing,</hi> nor <hi>too-much</hi> ought to be attributed to Free-Will. And then on the one side, Free-Will, both before and under Grace, will not (with the Defenders of irresistible Grace) be denied, or made of no Effect; nor, on the other side, will the Efficacy of Saving-Grace be destroyed by the Strength and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Will. But so long as the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is granted to Divine Grace, the Will of Man, as a Hand-maid (tho' a free one) will joyn it self to Grace, whilst it freely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys its Dictates. Thus whilst it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by the Admonitions of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, prepared in its Affections, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and assisted with Strength, a Man may co-operate both freely and willingly with God,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61508:71"/>
that he may not receive the Grace of God n vain.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Perseverance of Believers.</head>
                     <p>OUR Church's Opinion concerning Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is set forth in the Sixteenth Article: <q>That Men, after they have received the Holy Ghost, may depart from Grace given, and fall into Sin, and by the Grace of God they may rise again, and amend their Lives: And therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they live here, or deny the Place of Forgiveness to such as truly repent.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where we may observe first, that Sin which is there spoken of, and by which Men fall from Grace given, is in the beginning of the Article, called <hi>a deadly Sin willingly committed:</hi> For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Fifteenth Article treats of common and daily Sins, such as are common to all the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and in which we offend All, though we have the Grace of God, and do not fall from it. Now this Sixteenth Article is about deadly Sin; by which, after Baptism and the Holy Ghost recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Men depart from Grace given, until they be restored by Repentance: Where also All those are condemned, who say that this Sin cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after the receiving the Holy Ghost; such as <hi>Jovinian:</hi> and those likewise who deny Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Church to such as truly repent, as <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>vatian.</hi> But here is nothing at all said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>total</hi> and <hi>final</hi> Falling off from Grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:61508:72"/>
But in the Homilies concerning the Danger of departing from God (which were set forth at the same time in our Churches in the Book of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies) it is sufficiently intimated; <hi>That after Grace received, Men may fall from it, and perish;</hi> and therefore they are there diligently warned and armed against this Defection: And again in the Administration of Baptism, it is affirmed for certain, That Original Sin is remitted to Infants baptized, and likewise that they are truly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; amongst which a great many notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do afterwards fall off and perish.</p>
                     <p>But then the next Article (Seventeenth) frees those that are elected and predestinated from this Danger; teaching us that God has constantly decreed to free and to save them, but withal tells us, That Predestination is the Purpose of Divine Counsel secret to us, until it be made plain by the Fruits which in a due and natural Order arise and spring from it; which does not presently happen in All that believe, and therefore we ought not easily to presume upon Election; whereas Predestination regards on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Godly, those only who are truly such; and (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Prosper</hi> teach) such who feel in themselves the Power of the Holy Ghost mortifying the Deeds of the Flesh. Those that are rooted and confirmed in Charity, may with true Consolation think of the Divine Election, and have a stedfast Faith of obtaining Salvation through Christ; according to that Desinition in <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Lumbard,</hi> gathered out of the Fathers; <hi>Charity b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>gun, is such as may be lost, but not a rooted and a perfect Love;</hi> according to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Perfect Love casteth out Fear.</hi> Therefore, as on one side, All Believers, and even such as are truly Regenerate, are not under a <hi>Certainty</hi> of Salvation: So neither on the other are All (whatsoever Advances they have made in Faith
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61508:72"/>
and Piety) to be left to an <hi>uncertain</hi> Salvation: But to those who are solidly rooted in Faith and Charity (as to those that are elected and predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated) we may allow a sure Confidence of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and a firm Hope of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Without doubt that Opinion, so much deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; of the certain Perseverance of All those, who did once believe and were regenerated, was never approved of by any of the Fathers of the Primitive Church; but was rejected by all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and has been too much confuted by the constant Experience of all Times. It had its Birth but in this last Age, and was then brought into the Church from a Quarrel that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and his Associates had with <hi>Luther.</hi>
