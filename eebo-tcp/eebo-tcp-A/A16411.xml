            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

notwithſtanding all his endeuour
employed therin, we finde that your

excellency, was not onely farre from
ionyng: but alſo the better to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
your ſelues to the ſame, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the ſaide Ambaſſadour with
many delayes, and in ſteede of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
dealing with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> generalty tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the ſaide treaty of peace, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by meanes therof and by indirect

a ſeperation and diſſention of the
Prouinces: So that we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
any reaſon that your excellency
hath to ſaye, that the ſame hath not
bin in any faulte to agree to a good
peace with all vprightneſſe and ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.
Neither can we ſee by what

vſed in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter. Which
are encreaſed in all truſty and diſcret
<pb facs="tcp:19778:6"/>
hartes: by reaſon that (the King of
<hi>Spaine</hi> hauing openly reuoked, diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and diſanulled the pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Gaunte,</hi> when the Countries
might and greatly deſired to obſerue
and keepe the ſame.) Your excellency
now in this time after ſo many alterations
and troubles preſenteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by the aforeſaid Letter, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the ſame peace with this
condition, that the onely exerciſe of
the Catholike Romiſh Religion and
the dutiful obedience to his Maieſty
ſhould be maintained and obſerued,
as it was in the time of the late Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Charles:</hi> the which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contrary vnto the foreſaide pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification
and a manifeſt breach ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and ſuch as al the States in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
haue found to be directly againſt
the common welth and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
For that in the time of the late
ſaide Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> the cruell
burninges, Statutes and other
<pb facs="tcp:19778:6"/>
Rigors were in ſuche force and ſo
ſharplye executed for the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and defending of the foreſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of the Ronuſh Religion, that
the fore ſaide States generally and
with one common accorde, for the
maintenance of the profitable trade
and traficke of merchandize with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries that were for theyr
benefit, were conſtrained to procure
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to be mitigated &amp; reſtrained.</p>
            <p>Whereby your excellencie may wel
perceyue, what proceedings and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
we may hope for, by meanes of
ſuch preſentations which are vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to be practiſed or put in effect.
Being moſte ſorye that a caſe of ſo
great waighte and importance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
not with more ſpeede and
diſcretion. Not withſtanding to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

to the peace, we are ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teut
according to the offer of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall

by vertue of his aucthority without

of the cuntreyes ſo greatly and
ſo long time afflicted, agreeing with

which wilbe the proſperity and reſt

for our parte (if your excellencye
through longe delaye henceſorth doo
not hinder all occaſions and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
to doo the ſame) will not faile
to harken to all reaſonable condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for the performance whereof
we may haue good aſſuraunce and
