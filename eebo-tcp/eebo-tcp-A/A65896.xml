            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Publication of this ensuing Treatise,
is from a Necessity that came upon me
for the holy Truth sake, to remove Occasions
of stumblings out of the Way of the simple, and
honest minded Inquirers after the Way of the
Lord, which is perfect, so that although, by
Reason of other weighty Concernments (the
Press being also clogged with other Books) this
hath lain by in Manuscript above a Year after it
was finished, being written at sundry Oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
when I could find some spare time, yet I
could not be clear in Conscience, that my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in it should so remain obscure, or the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
frustrated, which I hope it may be of to
such serious and unprejudiced Readers, as desire
after the Knowledge of the Truth, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Chrst Jesus, which is the Aim and End of my
Labours and Travails; I could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
only to have sent a Copy of this Treatise
unto the Author of the Book stiled <hi>The Middle
Way of Perfection,</hi> if that would have cleared
Truth from his Mistake, and removed the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
off me; but that could not be sufficient, in

regard his Book was so publick; and if he come
seriously to consider, and see wherein he hath
been mistaken, and misrepresented us, called
<hi>Quakers</hi> (especially in the latter Part of his Book)
it is to be hoped, that out of a Respect to that
Christianity, Justice and Moderation, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by him, he will as publickly do us Right,
in retracting his Mistakes, and Misconstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
put upon us, as to some Things of weight
and moment, which in this Treatise are seriously
(and from a Sense of the Foundation of God)
spoken to, and opened in Love both to this
Man's Soul, and the Souls of all who desire true

            <p>As also, that in the first Part of his Book there are divers
Truths contained, in which he hath exprest more Modesty and
Candor, then in the latter Part, and because there appears not
that universal Consistency in his Work, which the profest Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency

it is God that justifieth; now there is a Double Charge, the Charge
of the Law, that we are Sinners, and so condemnable for violating
of it, and the Charge of the Gospel, that we have not performed the
remedying Condition which God requires of us, for the escaping of
that Condemnation.</p>

against all Accusations, or the Charge of both, as we must
answer to the Charge of the Gospel by denying that Charge, and
pleading our Performance, we answer the Charge of the Law, by
confessing it and pleading Christ's Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Our Faith aud Repentance is our Righteousness, in Regard to

may go both into universal Justification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that,</hi> God justifying us by this Righteousness, that is by
Faith or Evangelical Obedience, without the Works of the Law,
and that pardoning us as the Effect of that Act, may both make up
the Compositum of Vniversal Just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

am of persisting in any Mistake, wherein I have or may prejudice
others; I do not find that the Scripture doth denominate or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
any one Righteous, or a Just Man, from one End to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
upon any-other Account then his doing Righteousness, yet
will I not quarrel with any that say, we are made Righteous also by
Forgiveness; and that the Delivery of us from Sin, from the Law
and Condemnation by it, is Justification, though really I am
apt to think that this Work is rather to be attributed with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to our Redemption: Compare <hi>Ephes. 1 &amp; 7. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 19.

                  </gap>, who shall lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Thing to the Charge of God's Elect? The Questions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is, whether God's Elect be chargeable with any Thing that
is condemnable? For against a Righteous Man there is no Law;
this answers the End of Christ's coming in the Likeness of sinful
Flesh, that he might not only condemn Sin in the Flesh, but that
the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit; and this then truly acquits
and clears such, who thus walk, both from the Charge of the
Law and of the Gospel, there being no Condemnation to them
that are in Christ Jesus, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> That we cannot deny the Charge of the Gospel, until
we have performed that Remedying Condition, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of us for the escaping the Condemnation, or rather until
that true Faith and Repentance be wrought in us by the Grace of
God, as the Condition upon, and through which God doth both
pardon and justifie.</p>
               <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> That God justifieth us by this Righteousness that is by
Faith, or Evangelical Obedience, without the Works of the
Law; it must be considered, to be without those Works of the
Law which the Apostle intended, as namely those that were flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and shaddowy (that were not essential to an Evangelical Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness)
and not that substantial and continuing Obedience of
that Love, which is the fulfilling of the Law.</p>
               <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> That Evangelical Obedience and doing Righteousness,
by which God justifies, or pronounces any one Righteous, and
in which his Elect is not chargeable or condemnable, either by
Law or Gospel, must needs therefore be a sincere Obedience,
without the Mixture of Sin or any Thing condemnable, Christ
being the Cause and Worker of that Faith, Sanctification and
Righteousness in the true Believer, from whence his Obedience
and doing of Righteousness proceeds, all which seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
doth both shut out the Opinion of the Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness to Men, while actual in their Sins, and the
pronouncing them Righteous in God's Sight, who are by his
Spirit denounced or condemned in themselves, as unrighteous
and disobedient Persons; for where real Faith and Repentance
from dead Works is wrought in the Heart, there is a real Cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58973:7"/>
from those Works, and evil Actions, although the very Nature
and Seed thereof is not immediately wrought out of the Heart,
but by Degrees.</p>
               <p>But then I see no Cause why it should be said, that Pardon or
Remission <hi>is not any Essential Part,</hi> or <hi>no Part of Justification, but
the Effect,</hi> as in Page 4. Seeing that Pardon of Sin, together
with our Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th and Repentance (as the Condition) goes both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Universal Justification, as before, though a Pardon of Sins past
upon true Faith and Repentance be not alone the absolute Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but also a Perseverance in faithful Obedience to the
Gospel is necessary to an absolute justified Estate, both being by
the Grace of God, in and through Christ, wherein he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Creature that is truly humbled, with an Eye of Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in remitting of Sins past, and with his Fatherly Love and
Goodness in preserving and keeping such in the Sense of his
Goodness, which doth obliege to Faithfulness and Continuance
in the Truth unto the End, so that in an absolute justified Estate,
there is both an Experience of true Humility, living Faith, Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and sincere Obedience, and the continuance of the same
[according to these Scriptures 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 17, 18. Ephes.</hi> 1. 7.
to the End. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25, 26, 27, &amp; 31. ver. compared
with ver. 21. see and observe also <hi>Titus</hi> chap. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7.] the
real Experience whereof is beyond Mens Thinkings and Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
and it is only the true Believers, and sanctified Ones, who
can truly say from an inward Experience of the Work of God in
their Hearts, that <hi>Christ is made unto us Wisdom, Righteousness,
Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> and he that spared not his only
Son, but delivered him up for us all, how much more shall he
not with him give us all Things?</p>

by the Way further take notice of some Truths laid down by
this Author about Perfection, as namely. It is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
               <p>1st. That there are and may be very many Scriptures, easily
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58973:7"/>
pressed by the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> for the Service of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
so that there is no doubt but thus much is proved,
that it is our Duty to be as perfect,<note place="margin">pag. 6.</note> as they would have;
every Sin is forbidden, and every Good Thing (that is to say, by the
Law of Innocency) is commanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [<hi>thus far true</hi>]</p>
               <p>2dly. <hi>He cites</hi> Augustine de Spiritu et Littera, <hi>that he saith,</hi>
Alia est Questio, utrumaesse possit Homo in hac Vita sine
Peccato,<note place="margin">pag. 7.</note> alia, utrum sit? It is one Question whether
it be possible for a Man to attain to such a Perfection as to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sin? and another, whether there be any that do? <hi>Unto which
this Author addeth,</hi> That it is possible to attain this by Grace, or the
special Assistance of God's Spirit, he thinks it best to grant; he
thinks it not fit nor safe to say, any or all of God's Commands are
Impossible—the Work is to be attributed to him, unto whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is impossible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Animad.</hi> Thus far we agree then:</p>

Sin.</p>
               <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> That it is also possible by the Grace and Assistance of
God's Spirit, so to live and to keep all God's Commandments,
though not possible to any Man, by his own free will and Strength,
but only through the Assistance of divine Grace, it being God that
worketh in us to will and to do, as also this Author freely grants.</p>
               <p>That und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Animad.</hi> And that Heart must be such a one, as will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
disobey God; and then what shall be wanting in Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
when God affords the Assistance of his Grace and good
Spirit, which is alsufficient? And further he soberly cautions,
viz.</p>
               <p>And if any in the Dispute, do carry the Matter so high against
them (viz. the <hi>Quakers</hi>) as to deny what they contend for to be
possible, they may if they please, chose more Wariness from Saint

Spirit, the Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Power, or to Christ within, all that they do:

               <p>On the contrary side, if these Friends will not be content with
what is allowed them, that our Duty reaches so far, as not to sin at

               <p>
                  <hi>Animad.</hi> I am glad that this Author hath so freely manifested
a serious and ingenious Mind in him, as to confess unto these
Truths,</p>
               <p>1<hi>st.</hi> That it is our Duty to be so perfect, as to live without sin.</p>

               <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> That they who dispute against us, should chose more
Wariness, then to deny the Perfection we contend for, to be
possible.</p>
               <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> That the <hi>Quakers</hi> ascribe not the Possibility to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but to the Spirit and Power, or Christ in them, in whom
their Sufficiency is.</p>
               <p>And I do heartily wish that he were so far consistant herewith
as by the same Spirit and Power, to acknowledge and believe on
the behalf of Christ and his sincere Followers, that they are both
willing, faithful and obedient in performance of their Duty, as
well as accomplished with the Knowledge and Power for that
End.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note.</hi> Otherwise I cannot see, but this Man will leave a secret
and hidden Charge against God's Elect and Justified Ones, which
is not, that they either want the Knowledge of their Duty, or
God's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ssistance for Performance; but that they either want

then said to be called, and chosen and faithful? or how are his

a sincere Heart hath God's Elect; therefore let us further
observe those Passages, wherein he differeth with us in this
weighty Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon</hi> Augustine'<hi>s Question</hi> whether there be any that do attain
to such a Perfection, as to live without Sin, <hi>he concludes with the
Denyal, and</hi> that if these Friends say, that every one who doth
not attain to the same Pitch, as to live without Sin, cannot be in a
State of Grace and Salvation, he shall think it Time to send them to
the same Father and Book for their Reproof and Satisfaction; <hi>but
he hath confest,</hi> the Duty of Man is, not to Sin, and that it is
possible through that Spirit, by which he hopes some of us are led,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58973:8"/>
                  <hi>citing these Scriptures, viz.</hi> Walk before me and be thou per fect.
Thou shalt love the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, with
all thy Strength. Thy Will be done in Earth as it is done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Be Followers of Christ, and as his was, so must our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
be in the World. <hi>But then this Author concludes.</hi>
There is no Man hath a sensible Knowledge of himself,<note place="margin">pag. 8.</note>
but he perceives daily, how far his Duty is above his Performances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Animad. 1st</hi> Though we do confess that such an Estate of
Grace and Salvation, as to live without Sin, is not suddenly, or
at the First Dayes Work attained unto, yet by Degrees every
one that follows Christ through the Work of Regeneration, and
so comes into an Estate of absolute Salvation, such come at length,
yea in this World, to be delivered from all Sin, and to know
that Christ's Saving Work effecteth a Salvation from Sin; he
throughly purgeth his Floor, as this Man also denyes not, but the
END of Christ's Manifestation in the Flesh, <hi>was to redeem us
from all Sin, to destroy the Works of the Devil, to restore
us out of sin and unrighteousness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and present us to God as
a Peculiar People Purified by Faith, Zealous of Good Works, Holy
and without Blame, Entire, and</hi> wanting nothing, Perfect and
Compleat in ALL the Will of God. These being seriously
considered, the Truth thereof believed, and a Living Faith, Hope
and Expectation begotten in us for the fulfilling of these and such
like Testimonies of Holy Scriptures, we think there is no Cause
to send us to <hi>Augustine</hi> for Reproof; for we must prefer Christ and
the Apostles Testimonies in the Scriptures of Truth, before any
other Man's private Opinions.</p>
               <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> Though it be the Estate of many Men who have a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of themselves to perceive how far their Duty is above their
Performances, yea of such as may have a Sincere Mind and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire
in them to see all Lets and Hindrances of Performance remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
yet neither is this Imperfection alwayes the Condition of such;
nor is this Deficiency the Estate of every Man, for, there are
Young Men and Fathers in the Truth, as well as little Children,
and whosoever is so far enlightned, as to perceive a Shortness in
Performance or Duty, yet having a <hi>sincere Desire</hi> to follow the
Lord, and be made conformable to his Image; there is a Promise
to such, and as they waite upon the Lord, he will renew-their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58973:9"/>
Strength, and grant unto them the Desire of their Souls: <hi>Blessed
are they that Hunger and Thirst after Righteousness.</hi> And farther
when God makes known his Will, and tells to thee O Man
what thou oughtest to do, namely <hi>to do justly, love Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
walk humbly with the Lord thy God;</hi> if in Submission thou yield
to him, thine Help will be in him, as also he imposeth no Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities
upon his Church, but freely affords Grace and Power to
encourage and assist in Real and Perfect Obedience; and he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sent his Son a sufficient Workman to redeem Man from all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity,
and he works in us to will and to do; what shall hinder
the sincere Soul from its Duty, if no Grace be wanting, nor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Assistance witheld on God's Part, nor a sincere Mind awant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Creature's Part? Where can there be a Place for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to remaine? Shall any charge God's Elect, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
his Chosen and Faithful Ones with Unwillingness to serve
their so Gracious Lord and Master? Let not such a Charge or
Condemnation be left upon them, who are God's Workmanship,
created in Christ unto good Works, unto whom the Promise,
both of Power, Sufficiency and of Willingness is made, and so
experimentally received in the Day of his Power; and withal let
it be considered that, as through the first Work of Grace in the
Heart, there is a sincere Mind, Desire and Willingness in the
Creature to follow the Lord, he deals gently with such, and
draws them on by Degrees, even with Loving<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no more up on them then suits their Abilities given; suffers them
not to be tempted above what they are able; and his Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sufficient for them, he exerciseth Patience, chargeth not
Temptations as Sin upon them when they consent not; he also
dealeth with them as a Shepherd, leading gently those that are
with young; in the Day when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in his New Creation were seriously minded, &amp; really experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;

that of the Gospel with that weak Estate under the Law, as also
to oppose Christ's Work in this Life, and to put off Freedom
from Sin unto that which is to come; and in this Faith many take
a Liberty all their Lives to the Hazard of their own Salvation,
which if the sad Consequence of such Doctrine were seriously

Righteousness, and cry down Sin, and excite Men to lay hold of

for at present, as namely the true Child of God, or he that is
born of God, who hath his Seed remaining in him, his Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and King is of a pure Nature, the Heavenly Birth is of a right
Seed, and that which is born of God overcomes the World; this
Birth outgrows, overcomes and works out by Degrees all that is
of a contrary Nature or Kind in man; and that there are Fathers,
Young Men and Children in Growth, as this Man moderately
states our Doctrine: And concerning his two Questions, which
he would fain be satisfied in, viz.</p>

Man, is not the Duty of every Man? <hi>pag.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is the Duty of every man to experience a Perfecting
Holiness in the Fear of God; and without Holiness no Man can
see God; every Member of Christ, and every Branch that abides
in him, is of the Heavenly Father's purging, and therefore must be

throughly purged; his Work is perfect, and it is said to him, <hi>Thy

not sin?</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>Yea,</hi> But if any Man sin we have an Advocate with the
Father, and if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have
Fellowship one with another, and the Blood of Jesus Christ his Son

                  <hi>Animad.</hi> I grant that there is <hi>that,</hi> which is born of God (as

<hi>WHATSOEVER is born of God overcomes the World; and

also to personate the Conditions of others to whom he wrote and

kept the Commands of Christ; <hi>For, if we say we have not
sinned, we make him a Lyar.</hi> To the second Part, if every Child
of God keep his Commands, as they are made the Condition of
Life in the New Covenant, then I hope it will be granted howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that the greatest and most substantial Commandments are
kept, and how he should then neglect the lesser, or remain unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the least Things I cannot understand; for, <hi>ye are my Friends
if ye do whatsoever I command you,</hi> faith Christ; and he that is
faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much: Now, this
great Commandment of Love being the Fulfilling of the Law,
must needs be therefore comprehensive of (or take in) the lesser
Commandments; and farther let it be seriously minded and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that he that is come into the New Covenant, or to be in
Covenant with God, is come into that Agreement and Union with
him, which this Covenant contains, which admits not of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of Sin, or Breach of the Law of this Covenant; and he that
abides in Christ sins not; he that dwells in Love dwells in God;
be not deceived, he that doth Righteousness is Righteous, even
as he is Righteous, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. And this may answer what is said
about the Child of God, <hi>that as he is Righteous and Perfect, he
sins not, &amp;c. and that when St.</hi> John <hi>speaks of sinning not, we
may observe, how he counterpoises committing Sin with being Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
or doing Righteousness:</hi> [to which this Author addeth] <hi>The
true Christian sins not, so as he opposeth his being Righteous; he
commits not Sin, as is contradictory to his doing Righteousness,</hi> page
15. But still he seems here to leave Room for the Child of God's
sinning, or committing Sin in some Sense or other while in this
World, about which we differ, and cannot be reconciled, unless
we both joyn in that Seed and Principle, which lives in the child
of God; if we both did meet in <hi>that which is born of God, which
overcomes the World,</hi> we should both agree about the State of <hi>him</hi>

this doth somewhat agree with what this Author drives at against

Attonement or Peace made by him, so that though the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Price, as in Christ or on his Part be universal, yet the End
thereof is not received by all, but only by those who believe and
live unto him; and so the Glory of our Redemption &amp; Salvation we
ascribe unto him, who gave himself for us that he might redeem
us from all Iniquity, which answereth the End, and manifesteth the

not to be made void through Faith, but established, yet this we
have not obtained, either by our own Strength or Imitation of
the Letter, but through the Righteousness of Faith in Christ,
bringing us up to the Word of Faith in our Hearts, to obey it and
do it, so that our Redemption by him, is not to serve in the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

brought up to meet God in his own Covenant of Life in Christ,
who is the Mediator, not to bring God down to the Tearms of
Fallen Man, but as a Mediator which is not of one, but betwixt
two, both to bring God's Love and evidence his Kindness to man,

and we are still to be pressed to go on to Perfection: The other is,
That a State of Grace will not stand with any Sin in Dominion, that
is, that whosoever doth willingly and wilfully live in any known sin,

Men in their Sins, &amp;c. For though it's true they seem to preach

and to press Men to go on to Perfection, yea, and that a State
of Grace will not stand with any Sin in Dominion: What Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
