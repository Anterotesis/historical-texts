            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I can thanke no body for my hard bargaine: for in the time of my youth (the most perilous point of mans age) fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into such acquaintance as were finally to my commoditie, as well of the Masculine, as of the Feminine Gender, who so long fed mine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with folly, that I fell almost into a Consumption, before I found the nature of the disease: at length, (though some what late, yet better la<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

If I should tell you how I haue béene vsed among them, you would say, I had good cause <hi>to be Angry</hi> with my selfe, or some body else.</p>

And, <hi>to bee Angry</hi> with any other, if yee cannot reuenge it, it is a folly: if you doe, it is vncharitably; for you must forgiue. For, if I should tell you of some trickes that were put vpon me, when I was as wise as my Goose on Bedlame Gréene, I should make you beléeue that, al-though I preach <hi>Patience</hi> to you, I should haue cause to haue little acquaintance with her my selfe: But spight of the Deuill, I hope to goe to Heauen, and though I carry more Crosses in my Heart, then in my Purse, yet I hope (with my fellow Begger) to be in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, when a rich Churle shall daunce with <hi>Diues</hi> in a worse place: And therefore as a friend, let me say to you, knowing what is good for you; Whatsoeuer fortune befall you, <hi>I pray you be not Angry.</hi>

               <p>I must confesse, it is good counsell to haue <hi>Patience</hi>; for <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is a pretty Uertue, but that it waites vpon a number of Uillanies: But let me tell you, if a man spend all the money in his Purse vpon a company of vnthankfull Uillaines, and when he commeth to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of his Purse, and there finding nothing, intreateth with his friends (as he hath held them) but for an Ordinary or two; and scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingly put off, cannot get a Penny among them: What can ye haue in all the rule of <hi>Patience</hi>?

But leauing loue toyes, let me tell you, that if a man finding by some old writings in his mothers chest, that his father had title to a péece of Land, which for want of a good purse, he durst neuer make challenge to it: and say that I were the man, and I by the witnesse of my honest auncient neighbours, can approue it in good conscience to be mine owne in right of law; and thereupon as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king counsell, and paying for words by waight, and by my learned coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell perswaded that it is mine past all plea: And thus playing with my Nose, or rather with my purse, till all be spent: with <hi>Demurrs</hi> and tricks he driues me to beggerie, with suing for mine owne right, while he goes gay with my money, and I starue with his words: a vengeance vpon his craftie conueyance.
