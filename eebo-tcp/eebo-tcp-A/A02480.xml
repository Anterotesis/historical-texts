         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T VVERE TO BE vvished (my deere friend) that euen the vvhole course of this our frayle and mortall life, vvere bestovved vpon the seruice and continual vvorship of God: and that vve coulde commit our vvhole vvill and dealings vnto the vvill and pleasure of God, both for that our ovvne thoughtes doe little preuayle about them, &amp; also for that the general felicity of man doth depend only vpon the obedience vnto Gods vvill and prouidence.</p>
            <p>It vvere also to be vvished that vve vvere not carefull for the chaunces to come, but that vve could submitte our selues vvithout staye to Gods deuine vvill and ordinaunce.</p>
            <p>But (alas) suche and so greeuous vvas the fall of our first father in Paradice, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the fragilitie of our state, and the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of our life, vvhich of all thinges is most vncertaine, <hi>(Nam homo quasi bulla)</hi> there is also by the same his fall infused into oure fleshly hearts, a friuolous care, and as it vvere
<pb facs="tcp:6276:3"/>
acurious meditation of temporal and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible thinges: VVhich care as it is vnto the godly a very decrease of zeale, and hinderance to perfection, I meane to perfection vvrought by Gods spirite: so vndoubtedly the same vnto the reprobate, is an vtter extinguishment of pietie and vertue: For no man of vvhat estate soeuer he be, of himselfe hath anye habilitie at all, eyther to contemplate the goodnesse of God or to stande in avve of the terrour of iustice. No vve are not able I say to tast the benefyts of christ his death &amp; passion, except vve haue by the (instinct of grace) mortifyed vvithin vs the corrupt motions and naturall cares of the flesh: vvhich altogither vvitholde vs from the true contemplation of diuine and spirituall things, according as it is vvritten: <hi>Animalis homo non percipit ea quae sunt Dei:</hi> The fleshlye manne hath no feeling of those things vvhich belong vnto God.</p>
            <p>And although there be a certaine care com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs in the holye Scripturs, as the care vvhich Jzaacke had for the barrennesse of his vvife: the care vvhich Jacob had for the losse of Ioseph his sonne: the care vvhich the poore vviddovve of <hi>Sarepta</hi> hadde, fyrst for hir ovvne pouertie, and then for the death of hir onlye sonne: the care also
<pb facs="tcp:6276:3"/>
vvhich the Gospel declareth to be in <hi>Martha:</hi> vnto vvhome our sauiour Christ sayde, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, Martha, thou carest and art troubled about many things</hi>: Although (I say) suche kinde of care is set foorth vnto vs in the booke of our saluation: Yet deere friende vvee must not thinke but that there is another, and that a principall kinde of care, vvhich only and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by the vvorde of God, to all suche as are regenerate, is commaunded and commended: euen a zealous and a feruent care to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Gods house: besides the vvhich care, al other cares (in vvhat respect so euer they be) are but corrupt and vaine: Yea, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but dregges of the fyrst fylth and corruption that fell vnto man by the sinne of Adam, and of vvhich our sauiour Christ in the Gospell forbiddeth vs, euen so many of vs as by him desire to be righteous, saying: <hi>Take no thought for your lyfe, vvhat you shall eate, neyther for your bodye vvhat you shall put on: The lyfe is more than meate, and the bodye is more than the rayment. Consider that the Rauens neyther sovve nor reape.</hi> And againe: <hi>vvhich of you by taking thought, can adde one cubit to his stature?</hi> And againe in the same Chapter <hi>Therefore, aske not what you shall eate,
<pb facs="tcp:6276:4"/>
nor vvhat you shall drinke, neyther lette your mindes vvander about these specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For after all such things, the heathen people of the world seeke: and your father knovveth that you haue neede of these thinges.</hi> The Apostle also willeth vs to bee carefull for nothing but in all prayer and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to make our petitions manifest vnto God with giuing of thankes: To conclude, euen of this care our sauiour Christ in saint Iohns Gospel saith: <hi>Are there not tvvelue houres in the day? If a man walcke in the daye, he stumbleth not, but if hee vvalke in the night, he stumbleth bicause there is no light in him.</hi> Truelye, this care I saye is nothing else but dregges of infydelitie, and the verye frailtye of olde rebellious Adam, vvhich except it be mortified vvithin vs, vvill vndoubtedlye dryue vs from the true feele of saluation.</p>
            <p>Contrarivvise of the true christian care, which as it is sayd is the perfytte badge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation: the kinglye Prophet Dauid spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the Psame vvhen he sayth: <hi>The zeale of Gods house hath deuoured me:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>I had rather be a doore keper in the house of God</hi> This care vvas vvonderfully to be seene in <hi>Moyses</hi> the princelike Propht of Gods people, vvhen he desired rather to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb facs="tcp:6276:4"/>
out of the booke of lyfe, than that God should forsake his people the Israelites: Yea, this care doth Christ himselfe commende vnto his seruaunts in this maner: <hi>Sell that you haue, and giue almes, and make you bags that vvaxe not olde, and treasure that can neuer fayle:</hi> and againe in the same chapter, <hi>Let your loynes be gyrt about you, and your lightes burning:</hi> and againe: <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, for they shall be fylled.</hi> To bee short euen this and none other is that same care of the vvhich the Lord sayde to <hi>Martha: Thou carest for manye thinges: but one thing is needefull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVherefore (beloued in the Lorde) seeing that this is the verye true care that vve ought to haue: and contrarivvise, the other care but a fleshly care, a vaine care, yea a care procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of infydelitie, and altogither a lette and stop vnto such as desire truly to be illumined: Alas vvhat and hovve muche haue vve to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in this our vvretched time, so small remaine of that same christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> care, so streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye prescribed and left vnto vs in the sacred Scriptures appeareth amongst vs: euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs that vsurpinglye take vpon vs the name of true christians? that neyther care of
<pb facs="tcp:6276:5"/>
Pastors tovvardes their flocke: of maiestrates tovvardes the people, nor of parents tovvards their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is almost any vvhere to be found? And that (contrarivvise) all men are careful for themselues, all thirsting after their ovvne priuate commodities, and no man almost ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for gods glorie, no man seeking after the righteousnesse thereof.</p>
            <p>To conclude, hovve much and hovv greatlie this christian care is at this day in all men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie, and in these three estates especially contemned, hovv much it is set at naught and neglected, vvhereas notvvithstanding, it is the very erecting and repayring of Gods house and the propagation of his glorie: I haue in this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke briefely declared: being desirous in the onely respect of loue and good vvill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the dedication thereof vnto you: in vvhome I doe knovve (as by perfyt experience) to bee dvvelling a most godlie care vnto pietie and truth: and contrariwise an vtter hatred to falsehoode, and else whatsoeuer is shadowing of truth. Accept it J praye you, and be no lesse pleased with my hartie affection, than J my selfe am displeased with the basenesse of the gift, which notwithstanding, may suffice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the aboundaunce of my loue.</p>

But of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sufficientlye, though not to my selfe, yet to others of impatient hearing. Onely, I wishe that silence were the vertue to bring vice into subiection, that lenitye and mildnesse were the coraziue of sinne: that pitye had the power to put wickednesse to flight, and Pusillanimitye and tymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse were the preseruers of pietye. Then should sinne bee subdued, then should vice bée extirped: then rotten soares should bee searched: and then the militant Church of Christ should abound in all kind of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and quietnesse.

I haue heard of sundrye godly Parishioners that haue found al this to bée true: Who, by kéeping sinne secréet, haue felt the worme of theyr Conscience, besides the daunger of the lawe stil threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto them: and by laying sinne open (namely, so farre forth as manifest suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were able to leade them) haue thereby (as it were by a direct meane) brought sin to full scope, &amp; them selues to great daunger and continuall vexations: some of them, followed with threates: some, endaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through sodaine stripes that haue béene geuen them: &amp; other some, molested with
<pb facs="tcp:6276:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sutes brought vpon them, wanting all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of equitye. But, as vncertaine where to inferre this fault, whether, in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Law, or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partialitye of the Iudge for ouermuch mitigating the seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of so scle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der a law, in admitting (perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture) some féeble purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by vnseemly compurgators, I will ceasse for this time: wishing neuerthelesse, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer any party accused, shall happen by such sclender purgation, to be acquited of suche crime, as in the eyes and by the oathe of godly men shal séeme not onely detestable, but also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant: Some meanes may also bée found by the Godly and careful prouision of the Magistrate, that the accusars may be shiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the mischeuous attempts of their aduersaryes, that they may bée quit from theyr continuall quarelles, that they maye walke in safetye from theyr malyce, and maye trauaile in theyr callinges without dread or hazarde of displeasure.</p>
            <p>But to returne: Loe, heare the negligent building of the ministery and the cold erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Magistrate: Now behold wée in the middest of this <hi>Chaos,</hi> what helpe there is in Parents, or what hope in succession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6276:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>Parentes do erre, and they do not onely continue their errours, but therin also do they nourish their children.</p>
            <p>Children by nature are euyll, and being euyll, they are by example of Parentes made worse. No loue towardes God, no honour of children to their Parentes, nor feare of Parentes in their Children is sought for, had, or regarded at all· If I should speak of the educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of daughters, (wherof in this third place I should writ) the verye <hi>Pagans, Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Turckes,</hi> woulde stand vp against vs. I can not tell whether through sorrowe, I shoulde crye out and bewayle them, or for shame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to scilence: so immoderate in apparell, so lasciuious in talke, so bolde in behauiour, and so vnséemely in iesture is the vniuersall state, almost as well of wiues as of damosels. And that which most of all should be regarded: I meane the prouident care of parents ouer their daughters in their young &amp; tender years: that is altogither neglected and set a syde. No sooner is the daughter of age of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, but shée straight waye and therewithall learneth the highe path to
<pb facs="tcp:6276:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whoredome, and the principles of vanity and lewdenesse. Eyther shee is altogither kept from exercises of good learning, and knowledge of good letters, or else she is so nouseled in amorous bookes, vaine stories and fonde trifeling fancies, that shée smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of naughtinesse euen all hir lyfe after, as a vessel which being once seasoned, doth neuer forgo the sent of the first licour.</p>
            <p>In the time of infidelity, women by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning did attaine the very toppe and pricke of vertue and honesty, of which number I will recite a fewe according as they haue bene gathered, not by my selfe, but by learned wryters, which for their direct handeling of this matter I am perswaded sometimes to vse, and oftentymes to ymitate. <hi>Hortensia</hi> a Romain maide, was so profoundlye learned amongst the Romaines, that hir worthynesse was spreade throughout the whole Monarck, and she was not more famous for hir lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then loued for hir vertue, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for hir chastity. Of such woonderfull learning, was the wife of the Poet <hi>Lucane</hi> whose name as I remember, was <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentaria,</hi> that after the death of hir husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
<pb facs="tcp:6276:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shée corrected his bookes, and made perfite all his workes. <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Phisition had fiue daughters, excellent in learning and renoumed in chastity. <hi>Corynna The<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a</hi> a vertuous woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouercame y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Poet <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> fiue times in verses. What shoulde I speake of <hi>Cassa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dra</hi> &amp; <hi>Sulpitia</hi>? what should I speake of <hi>Paula</hi> the wife of <hi>Senec,</hi> which being once informed with the doctrine of hir husband, followed the same also in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous lyfe and conditions? All these were Paganish, Heathenishe and misbeléeuing people: And yet for all that, such was their excellency in learning, and their worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in vertue, that the worst of them all (for prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy) was able to gouerne a whole country, &amp; to kéepe in order a whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. If we looke backe to the first time of Christianity, there also wée shall finde many godly zealous, and learned women and virgins. <hi>Tecla</hi> was the disciple of <hi>Paule</hi> the Apostle, and very perfit in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred scryptures. In the time of saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Paula, Marcella, Eustachium,</hi> and others were greatly studied in the worde of God. And in the time of Saint <hi>Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> were <hi>Valeria, and Prob a,</hi> besides an
<pb facs="tcp:6276:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
infinite nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in all ages, which excelled as wel in learning, as in good life &amp; liuing.</p>
            <p>But euen as I doe see verye fewe, and almost none at all in this our extreme, and to too impious time, anye thing desirous to attaine eyther vnto vertue or learning: so, that same small number which haue anye knowledge at all, doe so greatlye abuse it, that much better were it they shoulde vnlearne that againe which they haue alreadie learned, then miserably to abuse it as they doe, or at the leaste wise (as we see them) to make equalle Pampheticall trifles with wholesome Doctrine and tryall of lyfe. That breade can neuer be wholsome and good breade which hath once bene spreade ouer with ratten bane or other poyson, be the venim neuer so muche scraped or pared awaye. That cloath can neuer attaine the olde hewe &amp; whitenesse, which hath once bene touched with tarre: and (no more) may those writings be good which are enterla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with toyes and villanous fancies. I woulde to God that maydes at the least wise might be brought vp, if not in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet in honest trades and occupations
<pb facs="tcp:6276:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as amongst the very infidels hath bene v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, accustomed, and most carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</p>
            <p>Nay, I would to God they did not spend their times like the women of <hi>Perse land:</hi> who after some slight and friuolous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, doe fall into more vaine and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleasures, as it were <hi>a malo, ad pe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi>: after reading of pernicious, vnchaste and godlesse bookes, or after labours of lyke importaunce (for auoyding of tediousnesse) to accompany inpleasures and banquets, young amorous Roisters, &amp; mischieuous varlettes, making the ende of one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to be the beginning of an other. Of a truth, I may saye of them now, as a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and zealous Preacher sayd of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his time: it shameth me to thinke that they are not ashamed to speake: it shameth me to speake that they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to doe: it shameth me to doe that they are not ashamed to reioyce at.</p>
            <p>On the other syde, it is to be lamented (as a case too too grieuous) such parents as doe bring vp their daughters in learning, do it to none other ende, but to make them companions of carpet knightes, &amp; giglots,
<pb facs="tcp:6276:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for amorous louers. If their intent were otherwise, how woulde they dare so ouer curiously, and carefully to maintaine and keepe them, at the least wise to wincke at them (as they almost euery where doe) in that vaine &amp; vngodly practise of daunsing? vaine and vngodly I say, only in respect of the present abuse of the same, which the very <hi>Pagans</hi> at all times and in all ages abhorred, especiallye being once growne into an occupation and trade as a practise most pernicious, wherein the sences are altogither captiuated and made subiect to vnlawfull fantasies, to vnreasonable thoughtes, and wicked deuises. O good GOD, sayth a certaine writer, what shaking, what bragging, what wringing of handes, what whisperings, what trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the toes, what vncleanly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, gropings, kissings, and a very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of lecherye, doth their assotiate that trade and occupation of daunsing? And surely, as the same in the abuses therof at this daye, is cause of muche and excéeding greate impiety: so is it not (almost) possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any one to attempt it, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of our common banquets, being so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:6276:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or in right minde, and perfite memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye: For it cannot be but that to daunce in such order, or rather in suche disorder as is now vsed, procéedeth eyther from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of drinke, or else of méere madnesse.</p>
            <p>But what maruell is it, if there be so many disordered places of daunsings and ministrelsey, sith that there are also hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of bawdry? And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this our intemperat kinde of daunsing is a meane vnto muche lewdnesse and contempt of godly life, it is plainely to be vnderstoode: there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer séene any one of our notable dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sers zealous in good life: there was neuer heard of any that could hop, skip, &amp; tourne on the toe (as they terme it) that would scarcely come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church without carying. O good God, what kind of learning is this? what education of children is this to be called?</p>
            <p>And yet this is the vertue that nowe a dayes is vsed: yea, this is the skyl that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents doo nowe a daies desire to bée in their Daughters. And whether for the learning heareof, they bestowe theyr goodes vpon them or not, all is one: For they neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them: no, they neuer forbid them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so oft as they see them of them selues to bée
<pb facs="tcp:6276:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereunto geuen: And it is a world to sée, with what demurenes, some that bée Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes doo sit in beholding the straunge Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, footing and countenaunce of theyr curious fantastical Daughters: yea, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when the selfe same skill is the cause of defiling theyr bodyes, and vtter losse of theyr honestye and good name.</p>
            <p>A certaine Emperour ordeyned that no Daughters should goo out of their mothers doores, but in the company of theyr mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that they should not daunse with Yong men in assemblies. Wée contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, doo procure our Daughters to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales, to Maskes, and to other like compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes where Daunsing is vsed: yea, and so careful are Parentes to haue their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters noted of excellencye in daunsing: that in al that they may, they adorne them with Iewels, and set them forth in costly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel: suche, as the fonde, foolishe and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable fashions doo require.</p>
            <p>And this is the learning that Parentes nowe a dayes doo wishe for in theyr daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, this is the vertue, these are the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of them so greatly desired: that if time were euer a compound, I thinke it is euen
<pb facs="tcp:6276:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nowe at this daye and in this Age: Besides this, when the Daughter is in this wise noseled and brought vp, when shée is in this kinde of learning more than suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently instructed, or rather distructed, then is shee straight waye taken foorth a newe les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, shée turneth ouer another leafe, and goeth on with euill spéede.</p>
            <p>And as before the learning thereof, shée was meete inough to receyue any kinde of Godly instructions: so, after shée hath once attayned vnto the knowledge of Daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, shée neuer afterward returneth backe to better thinges, shée quite and cleane for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh vertue, and for the most part, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth honesty adewe. Then shée must haue scope, then shée must haue her apparel after the fashion, then shée must haue paintings, Lickinges, Combings, Playtinges, Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinges, and all kinde of newe fashioned Trimminges: yea, then shée must haue walkinges, Feastinges, and watchinges, and al kinde of pleasure that maketh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the trade of a Strumpet.</p>
            <p>But as herein, I haue greatlye (and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the rest) occasion to accuse such May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, as haue beene, and are immoderately
<pb facs="tcp:6276:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
geuen to daunsing: so, (the general confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is such) that as well the vnskilful daunser, as the cunning, as wel the one, as the other, are nowe altogeather geuen ouer to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, and there withal to pride, fonde loue, and worse.</p>
            <p>Of a trueth, I can not sée that for the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Children, especiallye of Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wée may almost in any point bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with diuers, and that a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Infidelles and Pagans whiche neuer knew God nor Christ. Amongst the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians there is a custome (and I suppose at this daye inuiolable) that women shal weare no shooes, for intent onely that they shoulde abide at home, and not (so much as once) bée séene out of the doores of theyr Parentes or Husbands. The <hi>Massagetes,</hi> a people amongst the <hi>Barbariens,</hi> lyke as they doo vse none other houses saue great Tubbes and Tunnes, so doo they prouide, that theyr Wiues and Daughters bée to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather abiding in one Tunne, and them selues and theyr Sonnes (when they are of age) in another Tunne: not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying theyr Wiues after the time of theyr conception nor resorting vnto them
<pb facs="tcp:6276:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a good time after their deliueraunce. I reade also that the <hi>Bragmans</hi> a people in the vttermost bounds of this vper world, do neuer assotiate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, I meane the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the woman, nor the woman the man, after such time, as their wiues haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, nor till they haue a certaine time gone after their deliueraunce: their yssue being alwayes brought vp, the male with the father, &amp; the female with the mother. And at suche time as they sée their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of sufficient yeres, &amp; mariageble (as they call it) then if it be a man childe, the father treateth with a certaine Officer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the men (which is as it were the heade of the people) a man approoued wise and full of pietie, for the marying of his sayd sonne, and they togither immediatly doe repaire to the place, where the women haue their abiding togither. And after that the magistrate hath chosen at his discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from among the rest of the virgins, foure damosels, agreeable to the young man as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in age as otherwise: Foorthwith are called before them, the mothers of the iiij. maydens, and the mother of the sonne: and after that they all (being demaunded)
<pb facs="tcp:6276:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doe séeme to assent vnto the choyse of the young man, vpon whome so euer it shall happen the same to be made, then they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither with one voice (falling groueling on the grounde) doe beseeche the Gods to prosper him in the choyse: and after cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prayers made according to the vse of the countrey, the sonne as is aforesayde, at his owne liking, doth choose one of the foure virgins, and (taking hir foorth by the hande from the other three) they all wyth the magistrate accompanyed with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thrée wiues, who in the meane tyme doe leaue the gouernaunce of their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to some auntient matrone amongst the rest of the women, doe conduct the young couple to the father of the mayde: who after that he hath giuen his consent, which they neuer at anye time doe denye, with his wife and the other thrée women, (the magistrate going before) doth leade them to the people, which for the same purpose are called togither: whervpon the people with one voyce make a ioyfull showte and outcry to their Gods to blesse them, and to increase the fruites of their bodies. And when they are thus coupled
<pb facs="tcp:6276:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with assent of the parents, the mutuall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the persons themselues, and the good will of the people: The young mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed folke are brought home againe by the magistrate, the parents and the other iij. women aforesayde, being also accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with so many of the men, as eyther then be maried, or haue at anye time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had wiues: leauing alwayes behind them gouernours for their children, as in that behalfe, it is also prouided.</p>
            <p>And this is the order of that countrey in bringing vp and marying their children. And they vse also this selfe same order in marying their daughters, not differing in any poynt from the mariage of their sons: sauing that the mother of the daughter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompanieth the husbande, aswel when he treateth with the magistrate, as also in all other dealings. Which order in marying and bringing vp of children, I do here write to none other ende, but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I doe see (euen to the great griefe of my heart) that neyther in the education of daughters, nor yet in the honest bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in mariage, parents nowe a dayes (at the leastwise very fewe) doe in
<pb facs="tcp:6276:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any point come nighe them.</p>
            <p>If this bée Christianitye, if this bée pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, naye if this bée humanitye, that wée shalbe corrected by the Heathen, reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Infidelles, and condemned by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>: Then to what ende hath our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Sauiour denyed his moste holye word, his Diuine trueth and perfect doore of Saluation vnto his peculiar people, the Iewes, whome alwayes hée preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, whome alwayes hée defended, yea, &amp; whom alwaies from the beginning, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and Fostered: and geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same vnto vs which were outcastes and bondslaues of the Deuill, Children of wrathe, and heyres of damnation?

Mine eyes haue séene the experience, and with sorrowe haue I found out the truth thereof.</p>
            <p>O state confused, O people deformed and full of outrage? O time too too full of Iniquitie and sinne.</p>
            <p>O Englande, what hast thou imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or howe hast thou wrought, that euen the verye Turkes and Sarazens, the verye Pagans and Miscreantes, doo thus reprooue thée of iniquitye, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne thée of sinne? O Parentes, what hath your posteritye offended, that thus you conduct them to the Deuill, and make them fitte members for the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall gulye of damnation? Why restraine you not the horrible pride of your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? why reprooue you not theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable Paintinges, Lyckinges and Pranckinges of them selues? why (I saye) doo you not teache them to kéepe home, and instruct them in vertue? And O yée Daughters, what meane (I pray
<pb facs="tcp:6276:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you) those straunge kinde of disguisinges, Starchinges and Trimmings? To what ende are these fashions, and for what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente are they vsed? If you doe them to please your selfe, it is vaine: If it bee to please Christ, it is a follye: If it bée to delite men, it is whorishe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious: If it bée to gette you Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes, it is as muche, as if you would winne them with Uizars. <hi>Democritus</hi> sayth that the adornement of a Woman standeth in scarcetye of Speache and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareyle. The <hi>VVise</hi> man sayeth that the right apparell of Men and Women, is no maner of deceyptfull painting and Trimming, nor yet the Pompeous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell and Iewelles, but it is theyr good conditions and manners. Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> also sayeth that the Woman that painteth her face with material colours, doeth raze and put out the true Picture of Christ. Shée is not well appareilled (sayeth <hi>Plautus</hi>) that is not well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered: neyther loueth shée vertue that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth her apparell to bee Braue and fine. I saye, O you Daughters, why then doe you thus without al measure, and beyond
<pb facs="tcp:6276:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
al Godforbod, endeuour to tricke vp your selues and to alter your natural hewes? why séeke you for straunge attire? and why wishe you to bée séene? I woulde to God that worthy Lawe, which now bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the name of <hi>Opius</hi>: I would to God I saye that <hi>Opius</hi> Lawe were established amongst vs, which doth prescribe a meane in Womens attyre, what they maye, and what they may not weare. Neuerthelesse, I doe beléeue that albeit there were ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a measure altogeather immeasurable, and an order altogeather inordinate, yet women in this time woulde not obserue it nor kéepe them selues within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of it: such is their extreame rage and wilfulnes.</p>
            <p>And herein appeareth as wel the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Fathers, as also the pernicious example of Mothers, &amp; the general excesse of al women, as wel in apparel, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: whome as we haue with great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to lament, so must I leaue them in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, for that their liues are so generally noysome, as to heare the same, it woulde abhorre any true and honest Christian.</p>
            <p>But euen as the liues of Parents and
<pb facs="tcp:6276:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>

As into whose education in life and manners, I am muche loath to discende, the fielde being so large, and the hope of amendment so smal. Omitting therefore the first ill, handeling of them in their Infancye, the ouer great neish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and dilicacye that by Parentes is infused into their litle sonnes, euen in those yéeres when as they shoulde chieflye bée framed vnto suche constitucion of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye as the importaunce of Studye doeth looke for and requyre, and as throughe wante whereof, they become vnfit in after Age bothe for learning and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good exercises tending to the succour of a common Wealth, as falling through theyr sayde yll Education into feminine delightes and vaine Curiosityes: I come onely to that loosenesse of maners where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they are haled and sette at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, at suche time as theyr fraile youthe

ought chieflye and carefully to bée helde in and restrained, namelye, and vniuersally the contempt of Superiours and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: whervnto they are directly procured or rather enforced by two spurres of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked prouocation ministred vnto them by the meare vanitye of Parentes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I meane through excesse in their appareyl and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertye in theyr speache: whereof the first so outrageth now a daies in the heades of fantasticall Parentes, that were the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of theyr Sonnes neuer so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratelye sette, That one vanitye were of it selfe able violentlye to withdrawe them from vertuous Delites and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes to learning, vnto a very Sea of fantasies and wicked behauiours.</p>
            <p>And as for that too too malapart boldnes and libertye that they so greatly delite to haue maintained in theyr sonnes, who seeith not what number of enormityes haue ensued, and doe daily fal out through the same? who seeith not howe it encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with theyr Age, and howe many wickednesses it draweth on with theyr yeeres. Parentes them selues thereby disobeyed, all gouernment contempned,
<pb facs="tcp:6276:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
al correction resisted, al liberty sought for, and all vertue forsaken. Wherevppon followeth and instauntlye ensueth with increase of theyr age, such monstrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of horrible abuses, suche continual disturbaunce of common tranquillitye, and suche yrkesome annoyaunce of the Churches felicitye, that who soeuer is (in deede) touched with the least considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any of the same, hée can not faile but finde matter enough of vnspeakeable sorrowe.</p>
            <p>And I would to God the Magistrates coulde ones bend theyr mindes, although not to the Originall preuenting of these sayde manifolde abuses (which truelye as natural Parentes they are holden to doe) yet at the least to shred of some part of the Braunches that so aboundantlye are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased through this ill kinde of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that so mightelye ouershadowe the banckes of all honesty, good order and gouernment.</p>
            <p>Amongst the which, as one most noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the Churche of God, and most hurtfull to the common Wealth, that bloody Brauerye in quarelling and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

that sauadge practise in cutting and slashing, ought sharpelye and earnestlye to bée dealt withall: Which certainelye (if Magistrates doe not foresée and spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delye reforme) I am fullye perswaded will bring more daunger to the state, then all the Lawes of the lande wil bring saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye to the truth of mens causes. But this viperous bloody broode, this vnkinde and fierce Generation, what bloodye collours can it cast to cloake with face of manhood this more then boutcherlike kinde of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior? Forsothe (saye they) and that with fearefull Oathes, wée are Gentlemen (I speake not nowe of common Hacksters, who are ready at al times and vpon euery slight motion to bidde battaile to al hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stye and truth) and can not beare to bée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused of any man liuing: Who in déede, if they were right Gentlemen, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bée induced quietlye to put vppe the force of tenne Iniuryes, than witleslye and cruellye with rashnesse to pursue the reuengement of one, to the disturbance of the good peace of the Realme, to the shead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood, and to the ouerthrowe of all good orders and pollicye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6276:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>But to discende into the particular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of the manifolde Braunches that are daylye sprong vppe and increased from and by the meanes of this ill kinde of education of Sonnes, and not least of all from this one vayne of Saucines boldnes and libertye, wherevnto they are let loose without all respect of tyme and al regarde of Age: As I should take vppon mée a worcke infinite in it selfe, so, shoulde I conclude nothing elles in the same, but matter of sharpe and bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe vnto Parentes and Magistrates, who, of so many and great abuses so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitelye arysing and so outragiouslye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing with continuaunce, no one doe preuent, no one doe suppresse, no one at all doe restraine, or appease.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, that I maye finishe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde thou Realme of Englande, thou olde Bruitish Nation, whome sometimes Forrein Peoples haue honoured for thy pietye, beholde I saye what is thy state, bethincke thy selfe of thine impietye, sée howe thou razest the walles of Christ his true Churche, consider thy horrible sinnes and offences, perpende thy contempt of

Gods diuine trueth, that heauenly <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and glad tidinges of the Gospell: sée, see how thou heapest vp wrath against thy selfe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of thy visitacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If euer thou soughtest the meane to repentaunce, now cal for it, nowe séeke it, and with penitent prayer, craue it at the handes of thy déere Father: Now, now I say looke about thée, nowe is it high time: euen nowe (O Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande) is it most néedefull, when God as thou seeist, doeth plague for sinne euen all thy neyghbours about thée, and stayeth his angre towardes thée, deferreth his scorge, and withholdeth his indignation.</p>
            <p>If the excéeding and superabundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes of thy God will not reclame thée, if his wonderfull benefites will not moue thée: If his great loue, and more then fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindnes wyl not perswade thée, nor the extreame iudgement withdrawe thée: yet (as one of thy sinfull members). I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séeche thée, and as thou regardest thy good and quiet state, as thou desirest to auoyde thine owne desolation, thy vtter fall and ruine, I exhort thée that thou consider howe gréeuously thy brethren about thée, euen borderers on thy countrey &amp; neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors

to thy Nation, are deuoured of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, are murthered by Tirants, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, burnte, bayted, boyled, scourged, racked, paunched, pined, torne in peeces, and violently drawen vnto straunge, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and feareful kindes of death by their false brethren, Iudaical Traytours, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Papistes, cursed shauelinges and damnable sect of deuillishe Dunses. O, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the tragical and most gréeuous state of thy afflicted brethren in Fraunce, thy friends in Flaunders, and thy neyghbors in Scotland. Sée see (O England) how theyr sinnes haue heaped vp so mightelye the indignation of God against them, that the greatest reliefe whiche they finde, is spéedy death, and quicke dispatche of theyr irckesom &amp; miserable liues. Sée I say, and behold howe for contempt of Gods most holy Gospel, they are miserably afflicted &amp; plagued: how for theyr negligence in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they are tormented and punished.</p>
            <p>And (O thou Realme of England) what hast thou to pleade for thy selfe in this case? what lawful excuse canst thou make for thy selfe? Hast thou not Iesus Christ the chiefe corner stone? Hast thou not his
<pb facs="tcp:6276:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blessed worde, fro whence necessarie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maye bée ministred for the quickening of thy barren, drie and vnconstaunt faith? Hast thou not the same Fayth moystened by his long and excéeding great benefites? What wouldest thou more? His verye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, his Apostles &amp; most familiar friendes haue not enioyed so great oportunitye by the thousand part, as thou hast at this day. They had no rest in theyr blessed bodyes, nor quietnes in theyr Sacred mindes. They wanted bothe place of assemblye, where they might heare and teache, and also place of reliefe where they might bée shrowded from theyr manifold &amp; exceding great number of enemies: whiche euen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually laye in waite to spil theyr most innocent blood, and onely for the professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ and his sacred Gospel. Thou (contrarye wise) hast not onely the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell reuealed, but also hast libertye to Preache and to heare the same. Thou art not onelye defended from the enemie, but also hast the same vnto thy selfe in subiection. To conclude, thy wealth, thy goodes, and elles what so euer thou hast, is not onelye protected from ruine and
<pb facs="tcp:6276:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
spoyle, but also thy Ritches, thy substance and prosperitye is mightelye blessed, and most amplye enlarged: All whiche being so, alas what remaineth for thée to pleade in defence?</p>
            <p>O thincke therefore of thy God, or at the least wise, tremble at thy state. Feare, feare I saye, and repent: Pleasure wil not preserue thée: Ritches will not saue thée: Honour wil not shielde thée: Auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye maye not helpe thée: Renowme can not acquite thée. Awaye therefore with thy pleasure: abandon thy Ritches: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempne thine estate: Seeke not to beare rule: come downe to the lowest. It is good for thée to humble thy selfe: and most needefull it is to laye holde on the time. Though time bée infected, yet let it not passe thée. The time shall come, and is euen now come, wherin neyther time nor trade at al shalbe. And euen in this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitye of time, thou shalt desire the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to couer thée, and the Hilles to fal vpon thée, and shalt not escape. Binde not therfore one sinne too another, for one of them shal not bée vnpunished: Euerye man in his vocation shake of this <hi>Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gye,</hi>

Haue alwayes before your eyes the Touche stone of truth, which is the booke of Gods worde, and let not Bribes ouercome you, nor fauour entise you, nor
