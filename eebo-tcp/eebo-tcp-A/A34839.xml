            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the Contemplation of NATURE, we meet with nothing that affords us A more Invincible Argument of the WISDOM of the DIVINE AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHITECT, than the Structure and Composition of ANIMAL BODIES, nor are the effects of that INFINITE UNDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANDING more visible in any parts of an <hi>Animal Body,</hi> than in the INSTRUMENTS of VO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUNTARY MOTION, whose Variety and Contrivances are both Admirable.</p>
            <p>In this respect ANATOMICAL DISQUISITIONS are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:45473:5"/>
entertaining; but besides it behooves PHILOSOPHERS who inquire into the Nature of Things, and PHYSICIANS especially, whose province it is to preserve the CURIOUS FABRIC of the HUMAN BODY, to acquaint Themselves fully with the Nature and Constitution of that NOBLE SUBIECT; for that is the only way to learn what are the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Springs by which the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Operations of SENSE and MOTION are performed, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the CAUSES and SEATS of DISEASES, and their SYMPTOMS, and the proper Methods of CURING and PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENTING them.</p>
            <p>What Opinion the most Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Best of Men had of Enquiries of this Nature, even in their Infancy, we may learn from our Great Master <hi>HIPPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRATES,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45473:5"/>
who was sent for to <hi>DEMOCRITUS</hi> the <hi>Founder</hi> of the <hi>Mechanical Philosophy,</hi> to cure Him of his supposed Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and finding Him Dissect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Bodies of Animals</hi> to discover the seat of the <hi>Bile,</hi> and assign the reasons of its Effects, was so far from looking upon Him to be Mad, that He pronounced Him the <hi>Wisest Man in his Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is the Story that is told of our Modern Philosopher <hi>DES CARTES<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> less remarkable, who shew'd a Gentleman that came to see his <hi>Library,</hi> nothing but a <hi>Calf</hi> which he design'd to <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is needless at this time to Enlarge either upon the Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of ANATOMY in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or the particular Advantages of an Exact Knowledge of MYO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGY.
<pb facs="tcp:45473:6"/>
in order to the PRACTICE of CHIRURGERY, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall wave what might be said upon those Heads, and only give a short History of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements that have been made in MUSCULAR ANATOMY in several Ages, and the Reasons why I undertook to Write upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>Without doubt <hi>HIPPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRATES</hi> was well skill'd in ANATOMY, as it appears by his Books <hi>De Glandulis, De Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ARISTOTLE</hi> Dissected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Animals</hi> before He began to Compose their History, of which we have only a few Fragments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>RUFFUS EPHESIUS</hi> had also made some Progress herein, and gave the External parts their proper Names.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45473:6"/>
               <hi>GALEN</hi> and the <hi>Anatomists</hi> of his time were indefatigable in their <hi>Anatomical Labours,</hi> as appears not only from those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Books of his <hi>Of Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Administration,</hi> and <hi>Of the Use of Parts;</hi> but in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious System of the <hi>Muscles</hi> collected out of Them by <hi>ORIBA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIUS:</hi> Before and after whom we find no considerable progress made in ANATOMY, till the Rise of the Accurate <hi>Jacobus Sylvius,</hi> and <hi>Andreas Vesalius,</hi> about the middle of the last Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</p>
            <p>There have been indeed divers Others who have Written of ANA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOMY, as <hi>Alcmaeus Crotonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Diocles Carystius, Erasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus,</hi> and <hi>Herophilus,</hi> of which the two Latter are said to have Taught ANATOMY Publickly, and to have Dissected many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
<pb facs="tcp:45473:7"/>
of Human Bodies in <hi>Greece, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt: GALEN</hi> was a Disciple of the last; but we have none of their <hi>Writings</hi> now extant. Besides These there are Others mentioned by <hi>Galen,</hi> as <hi>Lycus, Quintus</hi> who was <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus's</hi> Master, and <hi>Marianus,</hi> but we shall not repeat their Names, since their Observations afford Us no occasion to mention them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Amongst the many <hi>ARABI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANS</hi> that have Written on this Subject, <hi>Avicenna</hi> is esteemed the Chief; and amongst the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>LATINES, Mundinus</hi> is reckon'd the First; whose <hi>Works</hi> are Commented on by <hi>Jacobus Berengarius Carpensis,</hi> and <hi>Curtius;</hi> but neither of these furnish Us with any discoveries in <hi>Myology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THOMAS DE ZERBIS</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:45473:7"/>
also mentioned, but his Writings are supposed to be Collected from the Observations of Others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NICOLAUS MASSA</hi> a <hi>Physician</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> is reputed A Benefactor to <hi>Anatomy,</hi> and mentioned by <note n="*" place="margin">Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pog. Lib. ii. Cap. viii.</note> 
               <hi>Riolan</hi> to have first Observ'd the <hi>Musculi Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midales</hi> described by <hi>Falloppius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>CAROLUS STEPHANUS</hi> assisted by the Industrious Hand of <hi>STEPHEN RIVERIUS</hi> a <hi>CHIRURGEON,</hi> (as <hi>Riolan</hi> Writes) was a Diligent Improver of this Art, and Illustrated it with <hi>Figures</hi> before <hi>Vesalius;</hi> but we were never so fortunate as to see either of these Three last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>JACOBUS SYLVIUS</hi> was an <hi>Accurate Anatomist</hi> of his time; He Wrote an Admirable <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on Galen's Book of the Bones,</hi> and an Answer to
<pb facs="tcp:45473:8"/>
the Calumnies of <hi>Vesalius,</hi> whom He calls <hi>Vesanus:</hi> After his Death was Published that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Piece Intituled, <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge Anatomica,</hi> wherein He digested the MUSCLES and <hi>Vessels</hi> into order, which were Treated of confusedly before by <hi>Galen, Vesalius, Columbus,</hi> and <hi>Falloppius,</hi> and gave Them their NOMENCLATURE still Used by ANATOMISTS.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Sylvius,</hi> or at the same time, <hi>FERNELIUS,</hi> and <hi>JO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HANNES GUINTERUS AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERNACUS,</hi> were Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries; but neither of Them have made any Improvements in the Knowledge of the MUSCLES.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANDREAS VESALIUS</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan very young to examine the Parts of several Animals, in which Study by a VVonderful Sagacity and peculiarity of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45473:8"/>
he made a swift but Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Progress; He was * Scholar to <hi>Guinterus,</hi> as himself confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in his <hi>Institution Anatom. ac Lib. de Veteri &amp; Nova Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina;</hi> and a Disciple to <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> as He acknowledges in the PREFACE to his first Impression, <hi>De Fabrica Humani Corporis,</hi> Printed in the year 1543, which passage is left out in the second Published in the year 1555. And here it may not be amiss to take notice by the by of another difference between these two Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to wit, that the Figures of the Former are much finer, but the Descriptions are more Correct in the Latter.</p>
            <p>Indeed much is owing to this Great Man, whose Accounts of the MUSCLES as well as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts that were known to Him, are generally very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb facs="tcp:45473:9"/>
delivered. He was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with <hi>REALDUS CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUMBUS, GABRIEL FAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOPPIUS, VALVERDA,</hi> and <hi>BARTHOLOMAEUS EU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STACHIUS,</hi> all excellent <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomists,</hi> especially the Two For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the First of which and <hi>CAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SALPINUS</hi> started early hints of Their Knowledge of the <hi>CIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CULATION of the BLOUD;</hi> which perhaps for some Reasons <hi>They</hi> afterwards concealed. <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loppius</hi> was a most Accurate Dissector of the MUSCLES, as will appear in the following <hi>Tract,</hi> and his Ingenuity in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what He took from <hi>Vesalius</hi> is very Commendable.</p>
            <p>From THESE the MYOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GY has received its greatest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements; and though there are divers others that have VVrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on this Subject, yet none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb facs="tcp:45473:9"/>
               <hi>HIERONYMUS FABRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIUS ab AQUAPENDENTE,</hi> and <hi>JULIUS CASSERIUS PLACENTINUS,</hi> have given any true Marks of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge herein.</p>
            <p>Both the <hi>RIOLAN's</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are great, but we Trace Them in <hi>Falloppius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are divers Others in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the Vulgar for their Descriptions of the <hi>Muscles,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which <hi>SPIGELIUS</hi> is the chief, but there seems to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary in his Book besides the Figures of <hi>Jul. Casse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Placentinus,</hi> some of which are very Imperfect. Since our last named <hi>Author</hi> there has been nothing discover'd in MYO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOMY except <hi>M. DU VERNY's</hi> Oblique Muscle of the Ear.</p>
            <p>The Sculptures of <hi>BIDLOO</hi> are not to be forgotten, since they
<pb facs="tcp:45473:10"/>
Express divers <hi>MUSCLES</hi> and other Parts so near the Life.</p>
            <p>The many that have lately written on this Subject have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increas'd than diminished the Errors, especially those that Write in <hi>ENGLISH,</hi> and particularly that Treatise of Mr. <hi>WILLIAM MOLINS,</hi> and that most Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous one of <hi>JOHN BROWN,</hi> are only Collections of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of others.</p>
            <p>Indeed the greatest part of Books now Extant are mere <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,</hi> or Extracts, and Useless Rhapsodies; <hi>ORIGINALS</hi> are few and Rare; MANKIND finding it much easier to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe and Steal, than to Invent and Improve, though NATURE affords an Unexhaustible and yet hidden Treasure, sufficient to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the search and Industry of all the HANDS and WITS in
<pb facs="tcp:45473:10"/>
the World. One great Mistake has much Obstructed the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of true Knowledge, and that is a general opinion the Senses are Gross and Ignoble, and that Abstracted Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the perfections of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature; and so it comes to pass that MAN is fed and pleased with Chimera's and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, instead of true substantial Knowledge, which is to be learnt by true Physical Examinations of Sense and Experiment, by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and Observation.</p>
            <p>Thus, after repeated DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SECTIONS, finding the Errors of the Latter Writers of MYO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGY to equal, if not exceed those of the more Ancient AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORS; I was induced to think that a Reformation of so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable as well as Useful a Part of ANATOMY, would not be
<pb facs="tcp:45473:11"/>
altogether Ungrateful to the Publick at this Time. Neither did I entertain such a design without foreseeing it would meet with its Enemies, some of which I am Confident will disapprove of the Undertaking meerly for the sake of the Undertaker.</p>
            <p>I did at first, I must confess, only design the Publication of my own Observations and Discoveries made in DISSECTION of the MUSCLES, but considering the Confusion Authors make, and the Multitude of Mistakes with which the Books of this kind for the most part are fill'd; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it might prove a Work of more general Use to give their entire History; VVherein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ability, I have rectified their Descriptions, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Defects, and retrenched the Errors of Others, and done
<pb facs="tcp:45473:11"/>
Iustice to every Man by whom I have been assisted.</p>
            <p>I have by way of INTRODU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTION premised my Conjectures concerning the Composition of a MUSCLE, and its Contraction for the convenience of Those who are not acquainted with the Ordinary Doctrine; which I hope the <hi>Learned Reader</hi> will excuse. For the same Reason it seem'd advisable to add the <hi>Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Dissection</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Galen, Vesalius,</hi> and Others; whereby the <hi>Learner</hi> may at once be Inform'd not only of what is in NATURE, but of the manner of discovering it. These RULES are Inserted in a different Character preceding to the Descriptions, and there more especially where any difficulty may arise to the Unacquainted OPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATOR. And to render what
<pb facs="tcp:45473:12"/>
my particular Enquiries have given me occasion to Observe more serviceable, those MUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLES here described which have escaped the Observations of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are not only Delineated, but <hi>Those</hi> also that have not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been well exprest by the Figures of <hi>Vesalius, Julius Casserius,</hi> (which are annext to the Works of <hi>Spigelius</hi>) and those of <hi>Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loo,</hi> and some others; To which Authors, References are placed in the Right hand Margin at the Beginning of the Description of each MUSCLE, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may know where to find it Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to compleat my Design, and to render this Account still more Intelligible, I have added Two Figures of the SCELETON, to which References are made in the Text by Numbers answering,
<pb facs="tcp:45473:12"/>
or subsequent to the Numbers placed upon the Figures Cited in the Left hand Margin; To the end the whole (which are my most Hearty Wishes) may be of more Use and Service to the Publick.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION: CONTAINING <hi>A Description of a Muscle.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A MULCLE is the chief and Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Instrument of Spontanious Motion: It's called by the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, either from the resemblance divers of <hi>Them</hi> have to a Flead Mouse, or to the Shell Fish called <hi>Musculus,</hi> or from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to Contract. Under this denomination of <hi>Muscles</hi> is comprehended all that which is called Flesh, which is not one continued Mass, but is distinguished into divers Portions, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contiguous to each other, in such decent Order as conduces as well to an Elegant Symmetry of the whole Body, as to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of each Muscles particular Office.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Muscle</hi> is composed of <hi>Membranes, Tendon, Arteries, Veins, Nerves,</hi> to which some add <hi>Lymphe-ducts</hi> and <hi>Fat.</hi> Of <hi>These</hi> the two first are esteemed <hi>Proper Parts</hi> of <hi>It,</hi> the rest are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45473:22"/>
counted <hi>Common:</hi> As to their Origin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of the Former are derived from the Latter, or whether by an admirable Steno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy of Nature they were all delineated in the <hi>Ovum</hi> of the Female, or <hi>Semen</hi> of the Male, or partly in both before the Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, shall not be our Task at present to consider: But we shall briefly enquire into the Intimate Structure of a <hi>Muscle,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in an Adult Body.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Muscle</hi> is commonly distinguished into three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Head, Belly, and Tail: The Head or Beginning is as it were the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of its Motion, fixt to the most Stable Part; its Middle or part most Tumid is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led its Belly; and its other Extream Implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Part moved is Denominated its Tail or Ending.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Common Integument</hi> of Muscles first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it self to view after the Skin and Adipose Membranes are removed. <hi>This</hi> is frequently Complicated with the Tendons of Muscles, especially where Stricter Inclosures are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, as on the Muscles of the <hi>Cubit,</hi> and those of the Thigh and <hi>Tibia;</hi> the Uses of Which we have Demonstrated, <hi>Chap.</hi> XXVI.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proper Membrane</hi> of a Muscle does immediately Inclose <hi>It,</hi> and is frequently conjoined with the Former, especially on those Parts last mentioned, where it's compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45473:22"/>
with Tendinous Expansions, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inseparable from it: <hi>This</hi> not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves each Muscle, but distinctly incloseth each <hi>Fasciculus</hi> of its Fleshy Fibres, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the <hi>Glutaei Maximi Deltoides, &amp;c.</hi> And these <hi>Fasciculi</hi> of Fleshy Fibres are in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner assisted by <hi>These</hi> their proper Inclosures, as the Muscles of the <hi>Cubit</hi> are by the <hi>Fascia lata, Whose</hi> Office I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where endeavoured to Explain.</p>
            <p>In the Interstices of these <hi>Fasciculi</hi> in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bust Bodies we frequently find Fat, which, by the assistance of an ordinary <hi>Microscope,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears composed of certain Transparent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous Cells distended with an Oily Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which plainly discovered it self to the Naked Eye of that Inquisitive Anatomist, Dr. <hi>Tyson,</hi> in the Dissection of a <hi>Porpess.</hi> These Adipose Cells are furnished with Bloud Vessels, as was sufficiently demonstrated in an Experiment I lately made by Injecting of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> into the Artery of the Arm. The Use of the Fat, according to the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> in his <hi>Osteologia Nova, pag.</hi> 209. is to be join'd with the Muscilage separated from the Neighbouring Glandules, and help to make up a Composition to preserve the Tendinous and Fleshy Fibres from growing Dry and Rigid, and to Lubricate them, and render them fit for Action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45473:23"/>The <hi>Tendon</hi> of each Muscle is eithe partly united, or partly divided, or totally divided; if united it's meerly Tendinous, if divided it's esteem'd Fleshy, wherefore it's said to consist of Tendinous and Fleshy Fibres, or Fleshy Fibres only: Those parts of Them entirely Tendinous are a Compages of Filaments compactly joined without the apparent Interposition of other Parts, as Bloud Vessels, Nerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Fleshy Fibres are continuous with the Former, and are furnished with Bloud Vessels, Nerves, and Lymphe-ducts: <hi>These</hi> are divided into divers <hi>Fasciculi</hi> of a <hi>Prismatical</hi> form, <hi>Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Square,</hi> or <hi>Triangular;</hi> each <hi>Fasciculus</hi> is composed of divers Tendinous Filaments which lie Parallel to each other. Though by the disruption of these <hi>Prismes</hi> divers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <hi>Interfibrillae</hi> appear (which not unlikely gave occasion to <hi>Steno</hi> to imagine them of a Rhomboidal Constructure) yet by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Microscope</hi> They also appear no otherwise than parts of the divided <hi>Fascicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> that appearance of <hi>Them</hi> being partly caused by their agglutination to each other, and partly by the distribution of the Bloud Vessels and Nerves passing to each <hi>Fibrilla;</hi> which Intersecting each other, I am apt to think, might impose on <hi>Borellus,</hi> and make Him conceive these <hi>Fibrillae</hi> to be Composed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45473:23"/>
of many Links of a <hi>Rhomboidal</hi> or Lozenge Figure. Each of these <hi>Fibrillae</hi> are much smaller than the finest Hair, Their Figure is Cylindrical, their Internal substance is porous like a Hair, with this difference, to wit, the Pores of That are more numerous and less, and in This the Pores are larger and fewer; which we shall have occasion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in examining the Distribution of the Bloud Vessels.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nerves</hi> accompany the Bloud Vessels at their Ingress into <hi>Muscles,</hi> and are distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to all their Carnous Fibres: some have thought the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Muscle</hi> to be the place of their Insertions, but that opinion has been long since exploded, it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that divers <hi>Muscles</hi> receive two or three Branches of <hi>Nerves</hi> in differing parts of <hi>Them.</hi> How the Extremities of <hi>Nerves</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in These and other Parts, is still like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a secret in Nature, since neither the Naked Eye, or any <hi>Microscopes</hi> yet known, are capable of rendering it a matter of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topsie. The examination of <hi>Nerves</hi> by the <hi>Microscope</hi> doth sufficiently inform us, that nothing that has been said of them hitherto is less probable, than that They are employed in conveying any Part of the <hi>Succus Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> to other parts, which some have so grosly dream't of. 'Tis true that an <hi>Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phea</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45473:24"/>
of Parts will follow upon the abscission or relaxation of their <hi>Nerves;</hi> but if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what alteration must inevitably happen in the <hi>Tone</hi> of those Parts, whose <hi>Nerves</hi> are divided or relaxed, we should not be much at a loss in assigning a Cause for that <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon.</hi> That the Trunks of <hi>Nerves</hi> are composed of divers <hi>Fasciculi</hi> of <hi>Fibrillae</hi> lying parallel to each other, is what ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration evinceth; but by the help of our Glasses those <hi>Fibrillae,</hi> which before scarcely appeared to Us, will discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be still made up of divers <hi>Others;</hi> and all of <hi>Them</hi> full of Pores; And if by chance you discover a single <hi>Fibrilla,</hi> as I have sometimes done, you will find its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance porous; but (if I may be allowed to calculate its dimensions by the same <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope</hi>) it does not seem to exceed the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part of a Hair: Its contents in those curious fine Cells or Pores must necessarily be very subtil; nor will I contend with those who will call them <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> or an Aerial Body, such as the <hi>Materia Primi,</hi> or <hi>Secundi Elementi,</hi> of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> nor shall I concern my self with an account of the Transmission or derivation of this subtile matter from the Great Fountains, whether of the Brain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Bloud Vessels, passing immediately between the <hi>Nervous Fasciculi,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45473:24"/>
since I hear my Ingenious Friend Dr. <hi>Ridly,</hi> will Publish his Accurate <hi>Anatomical Lectures</hi> lately Read in the <hi>Amphitheatre of the Colledge of P<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ians,</hi> wherein He has touched on this particular.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bloud Vessels</hi> of each <hi>Muscle,</hi> like those of other Parts, are <hi>Arteries</hi> and <hi>Veins,</hi> of which the former import Bloud into it, and the latter convey it back again to the Heart. How <hi>These</hi> transmit their contents to each other, has been a Controversie among Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomists, till the Industrious <hi>Leewenhock,</hi> by the Assistance of his <hi>Microscope,</hi> discovered those Vessels in the Transparent <hi>Fimbriae</hi> of the Tail of an Eele, or <hi>Lacerta aquatica,</hi> to be continued Channels, without the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of any Spongious Body, which Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomists had so long imagined, which pleasing <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> is commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by those Improv'd <hi>Microscopes</hi> made by Mr. <note n="*" place="margin">Living in <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church lane.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lang,</hi> that 'tis needless to say more of it in this place: Wherefore I shall proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late what offer'd it self in an Experiment I lately made, by Injecting <hi>Mercury</hi> into the great Artery of the Arm, which not only prov'd what <hi>Borellus</hi> had observ'd, that even the Fleshy Fibres of <hi>Muscles</hi> are in themselves white, and that their red Tincture is from Bloud, but was an Intimation of a peculiar
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45473:25"/>
Conformation of the Extremities of the Bloud Vessels, which were filled as full with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> as they could be before with Bloud; and afterwards, in examining the <hi>Fibrillae,</hi> I found their Cells before-mention'd fill'd with the <hi>Mercury.</hi> These Cells, by what I have as yet observ'd, do not communicate with each other, but as I have some reasons to conceive, there are certain <hi>Foramina</hi> in the sides of the Arteries that open into <hi>Them.</hi> Each Globule of <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>Fibrillae</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to be almost as big as two or three Globules of the Bloud: Hence it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted how the Intumescence of these Parts happens by often injecting Water by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries in dead Animals; That being a Body whose parts are very apt to insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>qua da tur Porta,</hi> these Cells become distended by it. Hence also an account may be given how <hi>Muscles</hi> are excited to act by such Injections made soon after the Death of the Animal; but of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>These Contemplations compared with some Experiments I afterwards made, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most tempt me to form an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the <hi>Contraction of a Muscle;</hi> but reflecting on the various Conjectures of so many Learned Writers, who had already employ'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on this Subject, I found it would prove a Work of more time to refute what
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45473:25"/>
has already been proposed, and corroborate my Conjectures with repeated Experiments, than I had allotted my self for that purpose.</p>
            <p>The former Anatomists being unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Intimate structure of a <hi>Muscle,</hi> and Use of the Parts which compose it, placed the power of Contraction in its Nerves, or in its carnous Fibres only.</p>
            <p>The Accurate <hi>Steno</hi> conceiving the Fleshy Fibres, and opposite Tendons of Muscles, to bear an Analogy in their Constructure to <hi>Parallelograms,</hi> imagines that an alteration of the Angles of their <hi>Areae</hi> may be made by extension only of its Fleshy Fibres; and this He supposed may be done without the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of new Matter.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> pretends that the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> brought by the <hi>Nerves,</hi> are lodged in the <hi>Tendons</hi> of <hi>Muscles,</hi> which joining with other Particles of an Active Nature, supply'd from the Bloud, make an effervescence, by which the Carnous Fibres are exagitated, which being Lax and Porous, are stuft, and become Corrugated; hence he supposes the whole Muscle is also Contracted.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Mayow</hi> imagines the Contraction of a Muscle may be made by an effervescence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the Commixture of <hi>Sulphureo-salinë</hi> Particles, secreated from the Mass of Bloud, and Nitro-aerious ones transmitted by the Nerves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45473:26"/>
               <hi>M. Du Verny</hi> Conjectures an Intumescence may be made in the Carnous Fibres of Muscles without a Ferment, supposing (like Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>) that the Tendons are Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses of Spirits which are excited by new ones from the Brain, and those, together with a Juice supplied by the Arteries, Extend the Fleshy Fibres, like a Fiddle-string ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in a Moist Air.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Croon</hi> supposes each distinct Carnous Fibres to consist of an Infinite number of small Globules or little Bladders opening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one another, and that the Nourishing Juice conveyed at large among the Carnous Fibres through the Artery, by the constant pulse of the Heart is driven on, and after mixing with another Liquor between those Fibres, passes into the Cavity of each Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bule or Bladder, where it mixes with a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sort of Matter more Active than the Former, and by These constant agitations, ebullition, and effervescence, with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat; He imagines is partly the cause, and partly the constant assister of the Motion of a Muscle. <hi>Vid. Hook's Philosophical Collect. N.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioh. Alphonsus Borellus</hi> enlightened with Mechanical Demonstrations, after an enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the intimate Structure of a Muscle, conceives its Fibres to be composed of a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45473:26"/>
Chain of divers <hi>Rhombi</hi> or <hi>Lozenges,</hi> whose <hi>Areae</hi> may be enlarged or diminished by the Accession or Retrocession of Bodies, insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating themselves like so many Wedges into it; and these He thinks are a Nervous Juice instill'd <hi>ad Imperium Animae,</hi> joining with the Bloud or Lymphe, whence an Ebullition or Fermentation does Arise.</p>
            <p>The Experiments I have made, compar'd with that above mentioned (by Injecting Mercury) seem to intimate, that the Bloud, barely as a Fluid, is an Assistant in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of a <hi>Muscle:</hi> and this did not only appear by making a Ligature on the Descending Trunck of the <hi>Aorta</hi> of a living Animal, whereby all the Inferior Parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Destitute of Motion, which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain recovered by loosing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Ligature, and admitting the Bloud to flow again into the Muscles; But even after the cessation of motion in the same Animal it was surpris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Observe the Muscles of the Legs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Contractions, upon the injection of Water only into the Crural Artery; which Experiment I have frequently repeated with the like success.</p>
            <p>Hence I began to suspect, that the Bloud is the <hi>Pondus</hi> by which the <hi>Action</hi> of a <hi>Muscle</hi> is perform'd; and that either by a Turgescence began in the <hi>Parietes</hi> of the Cells
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45473:27"/>
of the Fleshy Fibres caused by the contents of the <hi>Nerves</hi> Agitated <hi>ad Imperium Animae,</hi> or by Constriction of the Venous Duct, may be the immediate cause of Replietion of the Cells, whereby the length of their <hi>Fibrilla</hi> is lessened: And this Opinion I could rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain, because it seems to Quadrate with that of <note n="a" place="margin">De Motu Animal.</note>

                  <p>These two Oblique Muscles are by some called <hi>Circumagentes,</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torii</hi> from their Actions in Winding and Rolling the Eye about, which Motions we call Ogling. Anatomists differ in assigning the Proper Offices of these Muscles, some asserting when the Superior Acts, the Eye is Rolled from the Nose, when the Inferior, to it: Others on the contrary, suppose that the Former Draws it to the Nose, and the Latter Directs it towards the Lesser <hi>Canthus</hi> of the Eye. But if we rightly consider the Position of the <hi>Trochlea (o</hi>), which determines<note place="margin">Fig. iii.</note> the Motion made by the Superior Oblique Muscle, and the Origination of the Inferior (<hi>e</hi>), and that the Tendon of the Former, and the whole <hi>Ductus</hi> of the Latter pass Obliquely from the External edge of the <hi>Orbit</hi> to their Insertions at the Back part of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45473:47"/>
the Bulb of the Eye, as exprest <hi>Fig.</hi> ii. We must necessarily conceive, that the Vulgar Doctrines of their Motions are Erroneous: wherefore if the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquus Superior</hi> Acts, the Posteriour Part of the Bulb of the Eye must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards the <hi>Trochlea,</hi> whereby its Globe is not only drawn some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Forwards, but its <hi>Pupil</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected downwards; so on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when the <hi>Obliquus Inferior</hi> Acts, the Posterior part of the Bulb of the Eye approaches towards the External edge of the Inferior part of the <hi>Orbit;</hi> and its <hi>Pupil</hi> is directed Upwards, and its whole Globe Pulled somewhat out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Hence it is that the Bulb of the Eye is more Protuberant in those Actions, which Contrivance in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seems very necessary, since the Projections of the Eyebrows and Cheeks would be liable to hinder our Prospect, whether directly Upwards or Downwards: Besides the Uses of these Oblique Muscles now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they have still a more notable one, not only in pulling the whole Eye directly Forwards, but they hold it from being Retracted, when any of the Four Streight Muscles Act, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45473:47"/>
otherwise would rather draw it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, then turn it either Sideways, or Upwards, or Downwards. But these Muscles, one of them Descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly from the Uppermost, and the other Ascending from the Lowermost edge of the <hi>Orbit</hi> to their Insertions, in effect not unlike an <hi>Axis,</hi> prevent its being Retracted. Hence it is when they cease to Act, the whole Globe of the Eye sinks, which may give Occasion for that Vulgar Tradition, that the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings break in Dying Persons.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the Muscles of the Eye are called <hi>Recti</hi> from their Streight Progress and Use.</p>

               </head>
               <p>TO this Part Two Movements may be ascribed. The First of the Whole Chest with its Contents on the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back. The other of the Parts which circumscribe its Cavity (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Ribs, by whose successive Elevation and Depression the included space is inlarged or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisht. This Constant Vicissitude is necessary for the great Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, without which no Animal Body can subsist The Muscles or Instruments of its Motion are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht into <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Common.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Proper</hi> are such as are peculiar to it, and have their Rise and Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation confined within the Limits of the <hi>Thorax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Common,</hi> are such, which tho' they regard the adjacent Parts, yet chiefly respect This; of These, some are Principal Inserted here, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately moving This, together with Those Parts from which they are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45473:72"/>
derived; Others are Auxiliary, and only move the Contiguous Bodies, whose subordinate Actions Contribute to the better performing the Grand Motion. Thus the Elevation of the <hi>Scapulae</hi> is required in Ordinary Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, without which, the <hi>Serrati</hi> could not Act. Thus in Asmatic Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Peripneumonies, Pleurisies, or other Cases, where these Parts are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed or Obstructed in the due Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Office; the Extension of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck becomes necessary for the Introsusception of Air through the <hi>Aspera Arteria</hi> and Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Vesiculae</hi> of the Lungs.</p>

                  <p>Anatomists not taking Notice of the true Insertion of this Muscle, have generally erred in their conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures concerning its Use, supposing, that if both Act, the Head is bended Forewards, which Action, if rightly considered, cannot be performed by these Muscles, except the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck are also inclined Forward

The Latter Ariseth with a somewhat Broad, Flat and Long Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at the Extremity of the <hi>Processus Caracoides Scapulae</hi> (16); in its descent it strictly adheres to the <hi>Coracobrachia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> (wherefore some Authors not rightly describing that Muscle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those of the Arm, have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken it for a Fleshy Beginning of this) But then parting from it, both these Heads compose a Large Fleshy Belly, which becoming Tendinous

near the <hi>Cubit,</hi> is commonly said to be Inserted by a Strong, Round Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the Tubercle at the Upper Head of the <hi>Radius,</hi> (25.) But we<note place="margin">Fi. xvii.</note> have observed this Tendon to be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the External of which being Thin passeth obliquely over the <hi>Musculus Pronator Radii Teres,</hi> and Membrane like expanding it self, joyns with the <hi>Membrana Communis Musculorum,</hi> which Embraceth all the External Muscles of the <hi>Carpus</hi> and Fingers.</p>
                  <p>When this Muscle Acteth the <hi>Cubit</hi> is Bended.</p>
                  <p>The double Tendinous Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Muscle, (tho' not taken Notice of by any Author that we know) is very evident, and was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served first by us, some years since in Dissecting these Muscles, in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with our very good Friend, that most Indefatigable and Curious Bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist Mr. <hi>Samuel Doody.</hi> It appeareth immediately under the Skin and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana Adiposa</hi> of the <hi>Cubit.</hi>

                  <p>As for the use of this External Tendon which we call <hi>Fascia Tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosa,</hi> it seems designed not only for the more advantagious Elevation, or

Bending of the <hi>Cubit,</hi> which it more easily moves, by how much the more it recedes from the Centre of its Motion or <hi>Fulcimen</hi> at the Lower part of the Arm-Bone, (23) and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Fig. xvii.</note> to its other Extream; But like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise strictly including all the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Muscles, whether belonging to the <hi>Radius, Carpus,</hi> or Fingers, it thereby Corroborates them in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming those strenuous Actions they are necessarily employ'd in. This Latter Use was first suggested to us by observing those Artificial Banda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made of Leather which some La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious <hi>Mechanicks</hi> make Use of (by Adapting them to the Belly'd part of the Muscles of the <hi>Cubit</hi>) amongst which Turners and especially those that use the Rasp in making the Frames for Cane-Chairs (as they are commonly called) like a double Screw, are frequently obliged to this Artifice.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> the <hi>ductus</hi> of these External Tendinous Fibres ought to be respected by directing the Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet according to their Length, to avoid too great a division of them which is frequently the Occasion of

                  <p>An extraordinary Case relating to this Muscle once happened in our <hi>Practice.</hi> A Woman, three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she consulted us, had, (as she suspected) Dislocated her Shoulder-Bone by wringing of Linnen Cloaths after washing (which is commonly done to express the Water) adding, that in straining her Arm, in that Action, she sensibly felt something (as she thought) slip out of its place on her Shoulder. After examining the part, we were well satisfied that there was no Dislocation: But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving a Depressure on the External part of the Deltoide Muscle, and finding the two Inferior Tendons of this Biciptal Rigid, and the <hi>Cubit</hi> thereby denied its due Extention, we suspected that the External Tendinous Beginning, (before taken notice of) was slipt out of its Channel in the <hi>Os Humeri;</hi> but finding the part at that time somewhat Inflamed, she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not long before made use of it. We advised her to an Emollient Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and to give it rest till the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45473:101"/>
next morning, at which time we found our Conjecture true, and by turning the whole Arm to and fro, it readily slipt into its place, she recovering the use of the Part immediately.</p>

This done, proceed to divest the rest of the Muscles of their Common Teguments the Skin, Fat, and Membranes: Taking care that the</hi> Fascia Membranosa <hi>of the Thigh and Leg be not wounded, and that you likewise take off all the Fat in the</hi> Planta Pedis, <hi>and avoid Cutting the Long Tendon of the</hi> Musculus Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris <hi>as it descends internally by the great Tendon of the</hi> Gasterocnemii <hi>near the</hi> Os Calcis.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45473:115"/>
had observed it in a Monkey to equal the Great <hi>Psoas.</hi> That mentioned by <hi>Riolan</hi> we have frequently observed, Which, notwithstanding is absent in some Bodies, as he has well remarkt. But the Latter of <hi>Bartholin</hi> I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet discover.

The like <hi>Lusus Naturae</hi> we frequently find in other Cases, of which the <hi>Rhomboides Scapulae</hi> and <hi>Triceps Femoris</hi> afford us Examples.</p>

                  <p>These Four Muscles last treated of, <hi>viz. Rectus Vastus Externus, Vastus Internus,</hi> and <hi>Crureus,</hi> may be esteemed <hi>One,</hi> in regard they make but one Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at their Insertion, and serve for the same Use in Extending the <hi>Tibia,</hi> or Leg, however they are divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several Bodies, and one of them is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:45473:127"/>
Inclosed on all sides by the <hi>Fascia Lata,</hi> namely the <hi>Rectus,</hi> and in themselves have a Multiform <hi>Series</hi> of Fleshy Fibres, whereby they are rendred capable of Performing their Office with greater strength, which is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary not only in Running, Walking, Leaping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep the Body Erect, by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that Flexure at the Knee, which must otherwise necessarily happen through the superincumbent Pressure. For this reason likewise we find these Extending Muscles in so great a proportion Larger than their Antagonists the Benders, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by their Weight, when at the Request of my very good Friend Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> (now Reader on the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Dissections at Chyrurgeons-Hall) these Extending Muscles were weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their Antagonists the Benders in the same Body, whereby we found the Former exceeded the Latter, two Pounds wanting an Ounce; The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, namely the <hi>Extensores,</hi> weighing Three Pounds six Ounces, and their Antagonists the Latter but One Pound seven Ounces. Should it be inquired, (since it is so Apparently necessary in

most, if not All Motions of the whole Body that the Leg ought to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with great Force, it being Bended to support its own weight only) Why the Muscles employed in that Action should all Terminate in one Tendon, when their Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists the Benders have Divers Inserted on both sides the Bones of the Leg; whereby <hi>They</hi> have a greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in doing their office than that one single Insertion of the Extenders? It may be Answered, that such a Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is not only for the Beauty of the Part, but it is necessary that the Tendons of the Former should be United into One near their Insertions, and that a Bony Body, such as is the <hi>Patella,</hi> should be placed on the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Thigh-bone with the Leg to defend it from being prest on, in going down steep places, which could not have been done, had <hi>They</hi> been divided and Inserted on each side of the Bones of the Leg like the Flexors, which is a Stupendious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in Nature.</p>

               <hi>REgnerus De Graaf</hi> in his Elaborate Treatise of the Organs of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, has Accurately Described this Part; and <hi>Fredericus Ruysch</hi> in his late <hi>Anatomical</hi> and <hi>Chyrurgical Observations</hi> Demonstrated the Structure of its <hi>Glans,</hi> which the Former has not so well Observed; to which I shall add what upon a strict Enquiry on this Subject has given me occasion to discover.</p>
            <p>I shall not here repeat those many Synonimous Appellations which Lascivious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wits, or over sedulous Authors have Invented. The <hi>Penis</hi> is an Organ Contrived by the Author of Nature for the Ejection of the Seed, and Emission of Urine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of certain Spongy or <hi>Cavernous Bodies</hi> with their <hi>Vessels</hi> and <hi>Integu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> of which in their order.

                  <hi>The</hi> Glandulae Odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferae.</note> contiguous to the <hi>Balanus,</hi> my very good Friend that Judicious Anatomist, Dr. <hi>Tyson,</hi> has Discovered certain small <hi>Glands (a a</hi>); which he calls from the<note place="margin">Fig. x.</note> great scent their separated Liquor emits, <hi>Glandulae Odoriferae:</hi> their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is uncertain; in those that have the <hi>Praeputium</hi> longer than ordinary, they are not only more, but also larger, and separate a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of their Juice, which being lodged there, often grows Acrid and corrodes the <hi>Glans.</hi> They are very conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:45473:145"/>

First, lest its Erection into that necessary Stiffness should be thereby hindered; Secondly, lest it should be too Bulky; and lastly, it would have dull'd the Pleasure the Male is affected with in Venery. But whether these considerations induced the Author of Nature to Frame this Part without a <hi>Membrana Adiposa</hi> does not appear, since its want of Fat may not unlikely depend on its great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, from that Flaccidity when it is not <hi>Erected</hi> to that Extension of it when it <hi>is.</hi> In the Former, though we can conceive no great obstacle why its <hi>Adipose Cells</hi> should not be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with their Oyl, except its too great laxity should retard the Influent Bloud in its passage through its <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary</hi>

               <hi>Arteries;</hi> yet in the Latter its great Extension may not unlikely Compress them to void their contain'd Oyl; which may be the cause why the Interstices of the Muscles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts most quiescent are subject to be fill'd with Fat. And in the <hi>Penis</hi> it self in Children before <hi>Erection</hi> has been frequent, I have observed its <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana Adiposa</hi> to be extended with fat; but afterwards though the Membrane remains, yet the Increase of Fat is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and therefore we find it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly without; yet in some Subjects, and those Adult too, I have found it almost cover'd with Fat; But what inconvenience the Party suffer'd when Living, was not my Fortune to be acquainted with.</p>

               <hi>Galen</hi> and the Former Anatomists not knowing the <hi>Circulation of the Bloud,</hi> or that it past from the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the Veins, were extreamly deceived in their Ideas of the <hi>Erection</hi>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:45473:150"/>
this Part in great plenty, and being fill'd like a Gut with Wind, it begins to swell, and grows hard, which he imagines is done by a <hi>Sphincter</hi> Muscle Constringing the Neck of the Bladder and roots of its Cavernous Bodies. <hi>De Graaf</hi> assigns two kinds of Vessels with its Muscles for the performance of this Office; The <hi>Nerves</hi> by which the Animal Spirits flow into its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous Parts, and render them more Rigid and Tumid; and the <hi>Arteries</hi> carrying Bloud to distend the <hi>Corpora Cavernosa,</hi> for, as <q>"he Reasons, we are firmly perswaded the chief Extension of the <hi>Penis</hi> is from Bloud, first by Injecting Water into its <hi>Corpora Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernosa,</hi> by its <hi>Arteries,</hi> in a Dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we see it Extended to the same dimensions as when the Animal was living: Secondly, in firmly tying a Dogs <hi>Penis in Coitu,</hi> and afterwards examining it, we find nothing but Bloud to Distend it."</q> To which may be added, that in Criminals which Hang long after Death, this Part becomes Erected, the Bloud in that Position of the Body falling to the Inferiour Parts: And by Inflateing the Bloud Vessels of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:45473:151"/>
a Dead Animal It will also <hi>Erect;</hi> which we first practised in a Human Body by inserting a Blow-pipe into the <hi>Saphena Vein;</hi> whereby it was not only Erected, but afforded a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the External disposition of its Bloud Vessels, particularly its <hi>Veins,</hi> which suggested to us a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance in Nature in this Action which has hitherto escaped the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of Anatomists. <hi>De Graaf</hi> not considering the Use of the Adjacent Parts, assigns its Erection to its Muscles; Imagining, that by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumescence of their Bellies they not only compress the <hi>Corpora Cavernosa,</hi> and drive the contained Bloud to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Glans,</hi> but likewise the Passages through which it ordinarily Flowes back; which latter, we can by no means admit in the <hi>Cavernous Bodies</hi> of the <hi>Penis</hi> it self, since the <hi>Musculi Erigentes</hi> are so remote from their Great Vein. Our <hi>Hypothesis</hi> founded upon the Observation above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and compared with the Structure and Situation of its Parts is as follows. The <hi>Penis</hi> is approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to the <hi>Ossa Pubis</hi> when those
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:45473:151"/>
Muscles Act by means of the <hi>Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Suspensorium,</hi> whereby the Bloud is not only driven Forwards towards the <hi>Glans</hi> in greater plenty, and its Veins distended, but their great Trunks running over the <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum Penis,</hi> are Comprest as they march close under the <hi>Ligamentum Transver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi> of the <hi>Ossa Pubis.</hi> The like can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not happen in the <hi>Cavernous Body</hi> of the <hi>Urethra</hi> since there is no Bone whose Position can have that effect upon its Veins, as the <hi>Ossa Pubis</hi> hath upon those of the <hi>Penis</hi> itself; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Musculi Acceler atores</hi> Compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Those of its Bulb do that Office: hence it happens in an imperfect <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> the <hi>Glans</hi> is not equally Extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Penis</hi> it self, and at other times is soonest Relaxt; But when those Muscles Act, the Bloud contained in the <hi>Bulb</hi> is driven forwards towards the <hi>Glans,</hi> whereby it becomes more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; so in a piece of Gut, which if fill'd with Wind or Water, and either end Comprest the opposite being ty'd, we shall see it strut out and be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stended, as <hi>De Graaf</hi> instances after <hi>Caspar Bauhin.</hi> The Bloud thus hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in its return, Distends the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernous Bodies</hi> which are thereby E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; the <hi>Arteries</hi> which before
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:45473:152"/>
were flaccid, having then their Trunks also extended, do more plentifully Import Bloud into this Part. But since it is absolutely necessary some part of the detained Bloud should be still passing off, lest it become Grumous and unfit for a Reflux; to this end the <hi>Venae Praeputii</hi> are joined to those of the <hi>Penis</hi> it self, as above noted, and are placed under the Skin only, and running over the <hi>Ossa Pubis</hi> carry off part of the Impell'd Bloud, to give way to a fresh supply from the <hi>Arteries,</hi> and preserve the <hi>Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> uninterrupted. I remember once in an obstinate <hi>Priapisma</hi> which would not yield to ordinary repeated <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> I opened the <hi>Vein</hi> of the <hi>Penis</hi> it self, not without the expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed success, it immediately loosing its troublesom Rigidity, by which I was confirmed in my Conjecture.</p>
            <p>This elegant contrivance in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing these <hi>Exporting Sanguiferous Ducts,</hi> that some are liable to be Comprest whilst others remain alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Free, is not only observable in the <hi>Penis</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Clytoris</hi> of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> but in that of all Animals which have hitherto fell under our Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as in the <hi>Pudenda</hi> of all Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males; and is indeed an Artifice that deserves our Admiration.</p>
