            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Business in this ensuing Work, is to render a faithful account of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Traverses of State, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and of the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Passages in debate, between the respective Advocates for <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>: the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Dispute was ominous and fatal, as being the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and that which gave the Alarm to a <hi>Civil War;</hi> a War, fierce, unnatural, and full of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful coincidences, both in the Causes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of it, <hi>Humanum est humanis casibus inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscere.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Therefore if I studied to please my self, and gratifie the inclination of my own temper and affection, you might peradventure hear from me, of the Courage, Exploits, and Success of my Countrey-men in Forein Expeditions, but not of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their Animosities in Domestick Encounters: Yet certainly of some use it may be to us, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment also to those that may come after us, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fandum renovare dolorem,</hi> to consider indifferently how we came to fall out among our selves, and so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to learn the true causes, the rises and growths of our late <hi>Miseries,</hi> the strange Alterations and Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; with the <hi>Characters</hi> of divers eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Mutability of <hi>Councils,</hi> the Remarkable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <pb facs="tcp:35668:8"/>
of <hi>Actions,</hi> the Subtilty of <hi>Pretentions,</hi> the Drifts of <hi>Interests,</hi> the Secrets of <hi>State,</hi> and (which are the words of an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi>) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of a Prince, <hi>wisely dissimulating with his People.</hi> From such premisses, the best Deduction which can be made, is, to look up to, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>God,</hi> who onely is unchangeable, and to admire his Wisdom and Providence even in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Miscarriages: For <hi>Empires,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>Commonwealths</hi> every where in the World have their <hi>Periods,</hi> but the <hi>Histories</hi> thereof remain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and live, for the Instruction of Men, and Glory of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I finde an Expression in Sir <hi>Walter Raleighs</hi> Preface to his <hi>History of the World,</hi> which seems to suit well with these <hi>Collections.</hi> I shall make so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> far bold with that Memorable Person, whose death bears a sad part in this Story, as to borrow his own words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not the least debt</hi> (saith he) <hi>which we ow unto History, that it hath made us acquainted with our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dead Ancestors, and delivered us their Memory and Fame: Besides, we gather out of it a Policy no less<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then Eternal, by the Comparison and Application of other Mens fore-passed Miseries, with our own-like Errors, and ill-deservings; but it is neither of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Examples the most lively Instructions, nor the Words of the wisest Men, nor the Terror of future Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that hath yet so wrought in our blinde and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified Mindes, as to make us remember, That the infinite Eye and Wisdom of God doth so pierce through all our pretences, as to make us remember, That the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Iustice of God doth require no other accuser then our own</hi> Consciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35668:8"/>
               <hi>And though it hath pleased God to reserve the art of reading mens thoughts to himself; yet as the Fruit tells the name of the Tree, so do the outward Works of men, so far as their Cogitations are acted, give us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whereof to ghess at the rest: No man can long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue masqued in a counterfeit behaviour; The things that are forced for pretences, having no ground of truth cannot long dissemble their own natures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And although Religion</hi> (saith he) <hi>and the truth thereof be in every mans mouth, what is it other then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> an universal dissimulation? We profess that we know God, but by works we deny him:</hi> Beatitudo non est divinorum cognitio, sed vita divina. <hi>There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to be admired, nothing more to be lamented, then the private contention, the passionate dispute, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> personal hatred, &amp;c. about Religion amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, insomuch as it hath well near driven the practice thereof out of the world: So that we are in effect</hi> (saith he) <hi>become Comedians in Religion; For,</hi> Charity, Justice, <hi>and</hi> Truth, <hi>have but their being in Terms <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> amongst us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the close of his Preface, he adviseth the Reader to take heed how he follows Truth too close at the heels, lest it strike out his teeth. I hope this Story begins with a distance of time, not so far <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> off, as the footsteps of Truth are worne out; nor yet so near, as the heels of it need to be feared. But this I am sure, That had I not gone so far back as I do, I had not reached the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> to the <hi>History of these Times.</hi> It hath been observed by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> some, That most Historians speak too much, and say too little: I doubt others will think, I speak too little, and say too much. So it will be difficult to please all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35668:9"/>I know very well, the <hi>Collections</hi> which I publish will receive no advantage nor commendation from the <hi>Collector:</hi> And that it may likewise receive no prejudice, I am as ready to confess, as any man in the world is to object, my wants and inabilities; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which indeed to men of sober discourse, may render me unfit to be entertained in the Council, but not unqualified to be impanelled of the Jury: For I began early to take in <hi>Characters,</hi> Speeches and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages at Conferences in Parliament, and from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Kings own mouth, when he spake to both the Houses; and have been upon the Stage continually, and an Eye and Ear-witness of the greatest Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions; imployed as an Agent in, and intrusted with Affairs of weightiest concernment; Privy also both to the Debates in Parliament, and to the most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> secret Results of Councils of War, in times of Action. Which I mention without ostentation; only to qualifie me to report to Posterity, what will rather be their wonder at first, then their belief: It is pity they should altogether be deprived of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Advantages which they may reap from our Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Hereafter they will hear, that every man almost in this Generation durst fight for what either was, or pretended to be Truth: They should also know that some durst write the Truth; whilst other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mens Fancies were more busie then their hands, forging Relations, building and battering Castles in the Air; publishing Speeches as spoken in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which were never spoken there; printing Declarations, which were never passed; relating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Battels which were never fought, and Victories which were never obtained; dispersing Letters, which were never writ by the Authors; together
<pb facs="tcp:35668:9"/>
with many such Contrivances, to abet a Party or Interest. <hi>Pudet haec opprobria.</hi> Such practices, and the experience I had thereof, and the impossibility for any man in After-ages to ground a true History, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by relying on the printed Pamphlets in our days, which passed the Press whilst it was without control, obliged me to all the pains and charge I have been at for many years together, to make a Great <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection;</hi> and whilst things were fresh in memory, to separate Truth from Falshood, things real from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> things fictitious or imaginary. Whereof I shall not at all repent, if I may but prove an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Instrument to undeceive those that come after us.</p>
            <p>If you demand why my <hi>Collections</hi> commence so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> early, and start at such a distance of time so remote, I must answer, That it was at first in my purpose to begin with the Parliament which met <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. 1640. But after I had perused, ordered, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared my Printed and Manuscript-Relations of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> First Year of that Parliament, I found they pointed at, and were bottomed upon some Actions of the late King, in dissolving four preceding Parliaments: And thereupon, the zeal I had to clear the truth of the Differences between the King and Parliament, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> forced me to a longer Adventure; especially seeing the Essay had been very imperfect, and but a meer fragment, if I had only writ the Death, and not the Life of a Prince, who, in the first Speech that ever he made in his first Parliament, did reflect upon some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> passages in a former Parliament, that advised his Father to break off the two Treaties with <hi>Spain,</hi> touching a Marriage, and Restitution of the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate</hi>; and so engaged the Father in a War, which
<pb facs="tcp:35668:10"/>
the Son was by him left to prosecute. And this Consideration put me upon a further enquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the aforesaid Treaties, the causes and grounds of the War in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and how far the same concerned <hi>England,</hi> and the oppressed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Protestants in <hi>Germany:</hi> And finding those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to have their rise in the Year 1618. (in which Year the <hi>Blazing-Star</hi> appeared) I resolved that very Instant should be the <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> of my Retrospect.</p>
            <p>I allow and accept it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a good <hi>Memento,</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> I meet with in a late Author; <hi>That most Writers now adays appear in Publique, not crook-backed,</hi> (as it is reported of the <hi>Iews</hi>) <hi>but crook-sided, warped, and bowed to the right, or to the left.</hi> For I have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> heartily studied to declare my self unbiassed, and to give an instance, That it is possible for an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous man to be of a <hi>Party,</hi> and yet not <hi>partial.</hi> If any one engaged on the <hi>King's</hi> side, come forth in Print with the like moderation, fairness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie, without heat and personal reflections,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> our Posterity may be confident of a full discovery of Truth, which is every honest mans desire and expectation. And besides, the Vertues and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of men concerned, may shine and give satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction even to those who are not of the same Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>I pretend onely in this Work to a bare Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of matter of Fact, digested in order of time; not interposing my own Opinion, or interpretation of Actions. I infuse neither vinegar nor gall into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> my Ink: If I mention a Charge or Impeachment, it relates also to the Defence that was made by the Accused. And though in these latter times, Titles
<pb facs="tcp:35668:10"/>
Names and Dignities are altered, yet I use the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of that Time of which I write, speaking as the then Parliaments spake, and not robbing any man of the Honor or Epithite which they then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> pleased to give him. If I speak of any transactions which I my self did not see or hear, I do so with all the caution imaginable, having first consulted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, conferred with Persons of unquestionable esteem, interessed in the very actions, or perused their known hand-writings of those times; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> where I make mention of any Letters or Passages scattered in print, I first well weighed the same, and out of whose Closets they came, and found many of them concredited before I inserted them.</p>
            <p>And lastly, where I doubted, I perfected my Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by Forein correspondencies, fetching my satisfaction in divers particulars, out of <hi>Germany, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you will have an intermixture of Secrets of State useful for States-men, and of matters of Law, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which may be of some use, not only to the Professors of it, but to every Englishman; for though few profess the Law, yet all live by it; for it hedges in, and upholds the Rights, Liberties, and Properties: The matters of Law are not all bound up in one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> bundle, but you will finde them dispersed in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutory Speeches and Discourses; some of them in Historical Narrations; and lastly, in Polemical Debates and Arguments, taken by a Gentleman, then a young Student of the Law, which you will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> finde in an Appendix placed at the end of the Book; and I hope the Reader will not think his minutes ill bestowed in reading of them though out of place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35668:11"/>A great part of the Work is filled up with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Transactions in Parliament, and the Course and Proceedings thereof, wherein you will finde, not onely great wit and wisdom, but choice Eloquence, and excellent Orators, <hi>Diggs, Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Phillips, Elliot, Glanvile,</hi> and others not much inferior to the Roman <hi>Demagogue.</hi> I durst not presume to contract them to an Epitomie or Abridgement, lest by essaying that, I might trespass too much upon the Soil of other mens Inventions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and Judgements, or prejudice Truth, or the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whose natural Off-springs they are. Here you have Debates, Siftings, and Consultations of each House apart; and also by Conferences each with other (<hi>Alterius sic Altera poscit opem Domus &amp; consultat amicè</hi>) and Resolutions of Parliaments,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and some Laws which were the ultimate producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these Councels and Debates.</p>
            <p>I have but a word to say to my good and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friends of the Army, and it must be by way of Apology, that this Treatise contains not what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> may be expected by them from me, the Relation of the Motions, Actions, and Atchievements of the Army, which I acknowledge was the first thing in my thoughts and intentions: But upon further consideration I thought it necessary to look somewhat backwards, that we may the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> better understand the Causes and Grounds which brought the late War upon us, before we set forth the Actions of the War. In the former we may see the vigilancy and care of our Ancestors to secure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and uphold our Liberties and Properties, and to transmit the same, in as much purity as might be, to their Posterity, in the latter, which are the Actions of
<pb facs="tcp:35668:11"/>
the War, you shall see their Courage and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, setting a higher value upon the Rights and Liberties of the Nation, then upon their own Lives.</p>
            <p>Whom therefore, when I come in order of time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to mention, and shall also have occasion to magnifie for their perseverance in maintaining and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Laws and Liberties (so redeemed with the price of their blood) against Arbitrary wayes and courses; how joyfull shall I be to employ my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Pen to Chronicle such of their Names to Posterity, who justly merit that Character, as worthy of <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Honor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the second Part of my Collections (which is to follow, according to the entertainment which this findes abroad) I shall write with the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> because I did personally attend and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all Occurrences of moment during the Eleven years Interval of Parliament, in the <hi>Star-Chamber, Court of Honor,</hi> and <hi>Exchequer-Chamber,</hi> when all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> met there upon extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Cases; at the Council Table, when great Causes were heard before the King and Council: And when matters were agitated at a greater distance, I was there also, and went on purpose out of a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to see and observe the passages at the Camp at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>Berwick,</hi> at the Fight at <hi>Newborn,</hi> at the Treaty at <hi>Rippon,</hi> at the great Council at <hi>York,</hi> and at the meeting of the Long Parliament.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He grand business of State in the latter times of King <hi>Iames,</hi>
               <note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> much desired to match his Son <hi>Henry</hi> with a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> was the Spanish Match, which had the Kings heart in it, over-ruled all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and had a mighty influence upon the Universal State of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom</hi>: This King affecting the name of a King of Peace, and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as his chief glory, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, what in him lay, the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a general Peace in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the reconciling of all Parties; and professed, that if the Papists would leave their <hi>King-killing,</hi> and some other grosser Errors, he was willing to meet them half way; moreover, he was ever zealous for the honor and height of regal Majesty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and to maintain the glory of it in his Successors; 'twas his chief desire and care to match his Son with some Princess of most high descent, though of a different Religion.</p>
            <p>There had been a Treaty of Marriage between the late Prince <hi>Henry</hi> and a Daughter of <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">After Prince <hi>Henry</hi>'s death the King propounded a match with <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> which on the Spaniards part was found a meer Complement, carried on by the accustomed gravity and formality of that Nation. For <hi>Cecil</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the great States-man of that time, pursued and drove the matter to that point, that the Duke of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Lerma,</hi> finding no evasion, disclaimed the being of a Marriage Treaty. Nevertheless the Spanish Ambassador, to acquit himself to this State, and to clear his own honesty, at a full Council produced his Commission, together with his Letters of Instruction given under the Duke's hand: Such manner of dealing might have been sufficient Cause of just Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against any future motion of this Alliance.</p>
            <p>After death of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> the King set his thoughts upon a Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, late King of <hi>France,</hi> as the fittest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Match for Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and by Sir <hi>Thomas Edmonds</hi> his Legier Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, endeavored to know the minde of that State, but could not discern their affections, and was not willing to discover his own: At length taking occasion to send the Lord <hi>Hayes</hi> Extraordinary Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to the French King, to Congratulate his Marriage with <hi>Anne</hi> the Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> he resolved to make a thorow Trial: The matter was put forth, and in appearance well taken, but proved of no effect. For the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was before-hand, and prevailed for his Son the Prince <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this Negotiation of Alliance with <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In this interim the Spaniard gives the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a match.</note> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma</hi> frequently intimated unto Sir <hi>Iohn Digby</hi> Ambassador, Resident in <hi>Spain,</hi> an extraordinary desire in the King his Master, not onely to maintain Peace and Amity with the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> but to lay hold on all means that might be offered for the nearer uniting of their Majesties, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35668:15"/>
their Crowns; as also a disposition in this regard, to match his second Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>: The Ambassador replyed, that His Majesty had little reason to give ear to this overture, having not long since, in the Treaty for the late Prince, received such an unexpected An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and Demands so improper and unworthy; and that there needed more then ordinary assurance, to induce him to believe that there was now so great a change, and the match desired in good earnest, and not propounded meerly to divert the match with <hi>France</hi>: wherefore he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the proposal of such terms of advantage and certainty, as might gain a belief of their sincere Intentions: <hi>Lerma</hi> promised a further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. But by reason of a strong report that the Match with <hi>France</hi> was absolutely concluded, and within few dayes to be published, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness lay asleep, until Sir <hi>Iohn Digby,</hi> going for <hi>England,</hi> was desired by the Duke to give him notice of the state of this Affair: From hence <hi>Digby</hi> gives him to understand, that there was no cause of dispair concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this new overture, unless the difficulty of the Conditions should make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it desperate; but if the Demands in point of Religion were no more then what would satisfie another Catholick Prince, and to which his Majesty might yeild with Honor, he knows that divers persons, not of the meanest power, were well inclined, and ready to give their helping hand: He said further, that it were much better not to revive this motion, then by impossible and unfitting Propositions from either side, to give distaste, and lessen the Friendship between the two Crowns. The Duke returned answer, that all assurance and satisfaction shall be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> given concerning this Alliance: And after Sir <hi>Iohn Digby</hi>'s arrival at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> he protested to him solemnly, that the King desired it, and swore for himself, that he desired nothing more: Hereupon <hi>Digby</hi> debated with him, That the remembrance of their former Demands was yet unpleasing in <hi>England</hi>; the difference of Religion, the Opinions of Divines, and the Cases of Conscience were still the same; insomuch, that his Majesty and his Servants had just cause to cease for ever from all thoughts this way. Nevertheless, they did not slight nor disrelish an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Alliance with <hi>Spain</hi>; for many of the greatest eminency in <hi>England</hi> judge it equally valuable with any other of <hi>Christendom,</hi> though it be esteemed a matter of infinite difficulty. Here the subtil Spaniard might perceive our forwardness, though our Ambassador seemed to speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof off, and with reservation. The debate had this result, that the difficulties should be digested into certain Heads, and select Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons appointed for Conference; but the Intent thereof was, that the Kings on either side should not be interessed, nor their names <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> therein used, till by the clearing of particulars, there should be great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances that the business would take effect: Now because the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Religion, was supposed the onely difficulty of moment, it was thought fit to break the matter to the Cardinal of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and the Kings Confessor, and one Father <hi>Frederick</hi> a learned Jesuite, having the repute of a Moderate man.</p>
            <p>Upon the review of these proceedings, Sir <hi>Iohn Digby</hi> advised the King not to suffer his other resolutions to be interrupted by this Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s advice to the King in that matter.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which might be set on foot as a meer device to stagger the French Treaty, and to keep his Majesty from declaring himself opposite to <hi>Spain</hi> in the business of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers,</hi> which still remained uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; nevertheless, he might be pleased for a while to suspend the conclusion of the Match with <hi>France,</hi> and entertain this motion; and to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35668:15"/>
this end he desired from him not a formal Commission to treat, but onely a private Instruction for his Direction and Warrant.</p>
            <p>Such remote Conferences made way for that solemn slow-paced Treaty of the many years following,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gondomar</hi> mannages the Treaty on the Spaniards part.</note> wherein the advantage lay on the Spaniards side, who were indeed very formal and specious in it, but no way vehement and vigorous, if we might suppose them in any sort real: But the King of <hi>England</hi> having a prevalent inclination this way, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he was once drawn in and elevated with hope, was so set upon it, that he would grant all things possible, rather then break it off, and was impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of dissembling his own eagerness: The business was mainly carried on by <hi>Conde Gondomar,</hi> who was exquisitely framed for it, and by facetious wayes, taking the King in his own humor, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mightily.</p>
            <p>The King removes all blocks that lie in the way of this Darling Design, and studies all the wayes of rendring himself acceptable to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Wall of this Island the English Navy,<note place="margin">The English Navie neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</note> once the strongest of all Christendome, now lyes at road unarmed, and fit for ruine: <hi>Gondomar</hi> [as was the common voice] bearing the King in hand, that the furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it would breed suspition in the King his Master, and avert his minde from this alliance: Moreover the Town of <hi>Flushing,</hi> the Castle of <hi>Ramakins</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Brill</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> which were held by way of caution from the united Provinces, to insure their dependency upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the King resolved to render up,<note place="margin">The Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Towns rendred to the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> as being meerly cautionary, and none of his Propriety: He rid his hands of those places to prevent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests and Propositions from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who claimed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in them, and <hi>Gondomar</hi> put hard for them, being accounted the Keys of the Low Countries: Such was the Kings care and contrivance to keep faith with those Confederates, and not offend <hi>Spain</hi>: And to render this a politick action, it was urged that the advantage of those Holds was countervailed by the vast expence in keeping them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the power of the English Interest in that State was by this means cut off, and taken away; and the alienation between King <hi>Iames</hi> and the United Provinces, which appeared in latter times, and was nourished by <hi>Bernevelt</hi> the head of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Faction, and a Pensioner of <hi>Spain,</hi> is now increased by the discovery and observation of these late Spanish compliances.</p>
            <p>But the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Ministers had given but slender proof of any great affection,<note place="margin">The Spaniard proceeds not sincerely in the Treaty.</note> yea or of sincere intention and upright deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in this great affair. For Sir <hi>Iohn Digby</hi> received certain Articles in matter of Religion after a Consultation had with their Divines, which appeared very unworthy, and were utterly rejected by him: Yet afterwards upon a private Conference between him, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to whom the cause had been committed, a Qualification was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conceived, though not delivered as a matter there approved. And the same Speeches after his return into <hi>England,</hi> proceeded between him and <hi>Gondomar,</hi> and were brought to that Issue, that the King thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> fit to acquaint a select number of his Council therewith, who having heard the report of the former proceeding, delivered their opinion, That they found very probable ground for him to enter into a publike Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with as much assurance of good success as in such a case might be expected; whereupon Sir <hi>Iohn Digby</hi> by Commission under the Great Seal, was authorized to treat and conclude the Marriage; and because
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35668:16"/>
the matter of Religion was in chief debate, those qualified Articles that were brought out of <hi>Spain</hi> were sent back signed with the Kings hand, who added something to them by way of clearer explanation: They were to this effect:

                  </p>
                  <p>That the Children of this Marriage be not constrained in matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nor their Title prejudiced in case they prove Catholikes.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Infanta's</hi> Family being Strangers may be Catholikes, and shall have a decent place appointed for all Divine Service according to the use of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Ecclesiasticks and Religious persons may wear their proper Habits.</p>
                  <p>That the Marriage shall be celebrated in <hi>Spain</hi> by a Procurator accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Instructions of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> and after the <hi>Infanta's</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in <hi>England,</hi> such a solemnization shall be used, as may make the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage valid, according to the Laws of this Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>That she shall have a competent number of Chaplains, and a Confessor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Strangers, one whereof shall have power to govern the Family in Religious matters.</p>
               </q>

All this was done, and came so timely to <hi>Gondomars</hi>

Hereupon the storm of Passion ceased, and <hi>Rawleigh</hi> knowing nothing but that he might appear in <hi>England</hi> with safety, put in at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and was no sooner landed, but by secret intimation, understanding his danger, sought to escape beyond Sea, but was taken in the attempt, brought to <hi>London,</hi> and recommitted to the <hi>Tower</hi>; and at length his life was offered up a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for <hi>Spain,</hi> but not upon such grounds as the Ambassador had designed; for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a Judgment upon the pretended breach of Peace, that by this occasion he might slily gain from the <hi>English</hi> an acknowledgment of his Masters right in those places, and hereafter both stop their mouths, and quench their heat and valor. But the late voyage was not brought in question, onely his former Condemnation was revived; his Araignment at <hi>Winchester</hi> many years before was now laid open, and he at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> demanded, why Execution should not be done upon him according to the Sentence therein pronounced. <hi>Rawleigh</hi> answered,
<q>That the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Kings late Commission gave him a new life and vigor: For he that hath power over the lives of others, ought to be Master of his own.</q>

him; <hi>yet to give them content, he hath not spared him,</hi> when by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving him, he might have given great satisfaction to his Subjects, and had at command, upon all occasions as useful a man as served any Prince in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and on the contrary, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is not pleased to do any thing which may be so inconvenient unto him, as to lessen the affections of his people, or to procure so much as murmuring or distractions amongst them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be expected, that on his part, they answer his Majesty at least with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sincere and real proceeding, since that is all they are put to, the difficulties and hazards being indeed on his Majesties side. And truly, I should think it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it, that not by way of commination, but as it were out of zeal to the Peace and Amity betwixt these two Crowns, you did intimate to the Duke and the other Ministers, how impossible you held it to have peace long continued betwixt their Majesties; if in this business wherein so much hath been professed, there should be found any indirectness. But herein you must be cautious and temperate; for as on the one side, you and I well know, that this stile most perswades with them, so on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> other side, the decency and <hi>buen termine</hi> that is to be observed betwixt great Princes, will hardly admit of Threats or Revenge for a <hi>Wooing Language</hi>; but this I know falleth into so discreet a hand, that I little fear the handsome carriage of it. And I hope, that before these Letters arive with you, we shall hear from you, in such a stile, that this advice of mine shall be of no use. I pray you be very earnest with the <hi>Conde Gondomar,</hi> that he will not forget to negotiate the liberty of Mr. <hi>Mole,</hi> for whom I hope (now my Lord <hi>Ross</hi> is dead) for that which you and I know, it will not be so difficult to prevail. You <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> may put him in minde how when Father <hi>Baldwills</hi> liberty was granted unto him, although he could not absolutely promise Mr. <hi>Moles</hi> release, yet he then faithfully protested he would use the mediation of the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and of the Kings Confessor, and of that King if need were; and that he would try the best friends he had for the procurement of his enlargement, wherein you may desire him to deal effectually, for that there is great expectance that he should proceed honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and really therein. I my self likewise will use all the means I can for his relief; for it is a thing which is very much desired here, and would give a great deal of satisfaction.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>As touching <hi>Osulivare,</hi> it is very fit that you let them know, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the honor they did him, hath come unto his Majesties ears, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they will alleage, that in the time of Hostility betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> it may be he did them many services, and may then have deserved well at their hands; for which they have just cause to reward him: Yet since by his Majesties happy coming to these Crowns, those differences have had an end, and that there is a perfect League and Amity betwixt them, his Majesty cannot chuse but dislike that they should bestow upon him any <hi>title</hi> or <hi>dignity,</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> onely or properly belongeth unto him towards his own Subjects; that therefore he would be glad that they would forbear to confer any such titulary Honors upon any of his Subjects without his Privity. This you shall do well to insist upon, so that they may understand that his Majesty is very sensible, that they should endeavor to make the <hi>Irish</hi> have any kinde of dependence on that State.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35668:21"/>
two more were promised: When <hi>Spinola</hi> had his Rendevouz where he mustered Six and twenty thousand Foot, and Four thousand Horse, he opened his Commission, which required him to make War against all those which should be confederate with the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Rebels; and he communicated the same to the Ambassador of Great <hi>Brittain.</hi> At the same time the English began their march; as brave a Regiment as hath appeared in any age, consisting most of Gentlemen under a most worthy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Leader, who was accompanied with the Earls of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons innobled as well by their own vertues, as by their Progenitors.

            <p>This handful of men reached the <hi>Palatinate</hi> with some difficulty, by the aid and conduct of <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Nassau.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The Imperial forces became exceeding numerous by large supplies from several Countreys and Provinces.<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant States of <hi>Austria</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the confederacy of the <hi>Bohemians.</hi>
               </note> The States Protestant of the Upper and Lower <hi>Austria,</hi> upon the approach of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Army, seeing nothing but manifest ruine, renounce their Confederacy with the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and submit to the Emperor, saving to themselves their Rights and Priviledges in Religion: Whereupon the <hi>Bohemians</hi> and their King being but Twenty thousand strong, besides an addition of Ten thousand <hi>Hungarians</hi> from <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> and fearing least <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Buquoy</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their forces, should fall into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> thought it best to fortifie the Frontiers, and to defend their Country, which they conceived they might well do, if the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> would continue in his Neutrality. The Emperor sent to the said Elector to execute his Ban or Declaration of Treason against the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Rebels. The <hi>Bohemians</hi> by their Ambassadors requested him, if he would not own their Cause,<note place="margin">The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes the Ban against the <hi>Palatine.</hi>
               </note> yet at least to remain Neutral. The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to King <hi>Frederick,</hi> That he had often represented to him what ruine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was like to follow him by taking an others Crown; and for his own part, being called upon by the Emperor, to execute his Ban, and chastise the Rebels, he could not disobey that just command: The Protestant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sent to him again, and gave him notice of <hi>Spinola</hi>'s advance to subdue the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> but this did nothing move him. He entred <hi>Lusatia</hi> with some forces, and quickly reduced a part of that Province.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Palatinate, Spinola</hi> having got the start of the English, by means of a far shorter march, had no sooner arived, but he took in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Towns,<note place="margin">

               </note> and prevailed greatly over a spiritless people; yet he warily declined the hazard of Battel with the Princes of the Union: Neither was the Marquess <hi>Ansbach</hi> very forward to engage, or to seek or take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. The Dutch slowness was not excusable, howbeit the great access of strength to the Emperors party, and this slender aid from the King of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> to preserve his Childrens Patrimony, must needs dishearten the <hi>German</hi> Princes,<note place="margin">The Armies take up their Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> and help to dissolve the Union. After a while, the season of the year drew them into their Winter Quarters; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Princes retired into their several Countreys, and the English Regiment was disposed into three principal Garisons: Sir <hi>Horatio Vere</hi> commanded in <hi>Manheim,</hi> Sir <hi>Gerard Herbert</hi> in <hi>Heidelborough,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Burroughs</hi> in <hi>Frankendale,</hi> having onely power to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within those Walls, whilest the enemy ranged round about them.</p>

               <p>It is well known, that I have desired and endeavored to favor the Cause of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> of that Kingdom, and to further it to their best advantage, as well in the time of the Queen deceased who did so much prosecute and oppress them, as since the time that the present King hath succeeded; yet that calamity still continues upon them, by reason of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35668:23"/>
ill offices done unto them by the <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> (of whom the greater part of that Kings Council doth consist:) Howbeit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a thing that I could not well urge or press, without breeding jealousies, and so cause thereby a greater harm to the Catholicks, I have proceeded on my part with that wariness and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation</hi> as is fit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>D.A.</hi> shall inform you of what hath passed in this matter, as also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in what estate things are at this present, and how you shall govern your self for the time to come, according to the orders given unto him, whose example we wish you to follow. And of this take special heed: That although it be believed that we may be very confident of the trustiness of those <hi>Catholicks</hi> by whose means the business of the rest is undertaken, that they will be secret; notwithstanding lest any <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> shall come in the name or shew of a Catholick only to make some discovery; It shall be fit, that in all speeches you shall have with them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> concerning that which shall touch the Catholicks, that you tell them how much I desire to see them freed from those pressures under which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> put them, and that God would inspire the Kings heart that he may reduce himself to the obedience of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church: And advise them to endeavor to win the King unto them, by shewing themselves good and loyal and obedient Subjects, in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral duties, and not to meddle any thing against his <hi>State</hi>; that by their deeds he may see what security may be expected from them, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> may also bind himself to favor them; these being things that do no way contradict the observing the Catholick Religion, and are due from them to the dignity of their King and Natural Lord: And for the same reason they ought to abstain from all ill practices, or unfitting speech or actions against his Person, as is said some heretofore have used; especially seeing no good hath, or can come thereof, and thereby they shall justly provoke him against themselves; and by holding this course they shall win the Kings good will, and the Peace shall be preserved, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and by the Peace by little and little be won and attained that which is desired. By this manner of proceeding it is certain there can come no inconvenience: But in case that this your manner of dealing shall come to the Kings knowledge (as possibly it may) it will breed a great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of brotherhood and friendship between us, when he shall see that I carry my self in this sort in his affairs, and consequently will be the more confident of our amity, and will thereby be induced the better to subdue all malice in them that shall endeavor to perswade the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> contrary.

               <p>You shall understand from the said <hi>D.A.</hi> what <hi>Pensions</hi> are allotted to certain <hi>Ministers</hi> of that King, and to other persons: It will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to inform your self throughly of all that concerns this point, and that you know both the <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Pensions</hi> to serve your self of them, and to make the best use of them in all occasions that shall be most behoveful for your better direction in the Businesses given you in charge, and all others that may be offered of consequence, seeing the said Pensions were appointed to that end.</p>

Whatsoever of the said Pensions you shall find unpaid for the time past, <hi>D.

               <p>Above all, You must take great care to dive into the estate of the affairs of that King: What his Treasure is; In what Estimation he is with his Subjects, and what Correspondeneie and good meaning there is betwixt them; How the <hi>English, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> stand affected among themselves and one towards another, and towards their Neighbors, and how they are bent against me and my Common Estates, or any of my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> particular Kingdoms; whence they draw their Intelligences, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly what amity and correspondencie that King entertaineth with <hi>France,</hi> and with the <hi>Neutrals</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> and with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and upon what causes it is founded, what matters they treat of, what designs they have in hand.

               <hi>Buckingham</hi> and his Dependants followed the Kings inclinations: The Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> Marquis <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> disliking the Kings course, did not contest with him, but only intimated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their dissent.</p>
            <p>It was said of <hi>Gondomar,</hi> That when he returned into <hi>Spain,</hi> he gave in his Account of Disbursments for Pensions given in <hi>England,</hi> (amongst others) To Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> 1000<hi>l.</hi> a person of great Integrity, and one who was ever averse to the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> Which Sir <hi>Robert</hi> getting notice of by the English Agent then in <hi>Spain,</hi> demanded reparation, which was obtained, but with a <hi>salvo</hi> to the Ambassadors honor, the error being said to be committed by a Dependent upon the Ambassador, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by himself.</p>
            <p>The King being jealous of uncomptrolled Soveraignty, and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of his Peoples intermedling with the Mysteries of State, had fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great dislike of Parliaments, and for many years before had given way to Projects and Monopolies: And many of his Ministers perhaps fearing an enquiry into their own actions, might suggest to him, that he might better furnish himself by those ways, and the Match now in treaty, then by Subsidies, usually accompanied with the redress of Grievances.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Nevertheless,<note place="margin">The King calls a Parliament.</note> he was now minded to call a Parliament, conceiving it might be of special use: For he observed the affections of the People to be raised for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; and then concluded, that those affections would open their purses to the supply of his wants; and the Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> would effect the business without the expence and

troubles of War, and the good accord between him and his people would quicken the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to conclude the Match. And accordingly Writs were issued forth to assemble them the 30. of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> In the calling of this Parliament he recommended to his Subjects the choice of such Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as were of the wisest, gravest, and best affected people, neither superstitious, nor turbulent, but obedient Children to this their Mother-Church.</p>

                        <p>MY Lords Spiritual and Temporal,<note place="margin">The Kings Speech to the Parliament.</note> and you the Commons! <hi>Cui multiloquio non deest peccatum.</hi> In the last Parliament I made long discourses, especially to them of the Lower House: I did open the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> true thoughts of my heart; but I may say with our Saviour, <hi>I have piped to you, and you have not danced; I have mourned, and you have not lamented.</hi> Yet as no mans actions can be free, so in me God found some spices of vanity, and so all my sayings turned to me again without any success. And now to tell the reasons of your calling, and this meeting, apply it to your selves, and spend not the time in long Speeches. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the <hi>Parliament</hi> is a thing composed of a Head and a Body, The <hi>Monarch</hi> and the Two <hi>Estates</hi>; It was first a Monarchy, then after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> a Parliament. There are no Parliaments but in Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; For in <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and other Free Governments there are none. The Head is to call the Body together: And for the Clergy, the Bishops are chief; for Shires, their Knights; and for Towns and Cities, their Burgesses and Citizens. These are to treat of difficult matters, and to counsel their King with their best advice to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35668:25"/>
make Laws for the Commonweal. And the Lower House is also to petition their King, and acquaint him with their Grievances, and not to meddle with their Kings <hi>Prerogative.</hi> They are to offer supply for his Necessity, and he to distribute in recompence thereof Justice and Mercy. As in all Parliaments it is the Kings office to make good Laws, (whose fundamental cause is the Peoples ill manners) so at this time, that we may meet with the new Abuses and the incroaching Craft of the times: Particulars shall be read hereafter.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

                        <p>As touching <hi>Religion,</hi> Laws enough are made already. It stands in two points, Perswasion and Compulsion: Men may perswade, but God must give the blessing. <hi>Iesuites, Priests, Puritans</hi> and <hi>Sectaries,</hi> erring both on the right hand and left hand, are forward to perswade unto their own ends; and so ought you the <hi>Bishops,</hi> in your example and preaching: But Compulsion to obey, is to bind the Conscience.</p>
                        <p>There is talk of the <hi>Match</hi> with <hi>Spain:</hi> But if it shall not prove a Furtherance to Religion, I am not worthy to be your King: I will never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> proceed but to the glory of God, and content of my Subjects.</p>
                        <p>For a <hi>Supply</hi> to my Necessities: I have reigned Eighteen years, in which time you have had Peace, and I have received far less supply than hath been given to any King since the Conquest: The last Queen of famous memory, had one year with another above a Hundred thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> in Subsidies; And in all my time I have had but Four Subsidies and Six Fifteens. It is Ten years since I had a Subsidy; in all which time I have been sparing to trouble you: I have turned my self <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as nearly to save expences as I may; I have abated much in my House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold expences, in my Navies, in the charge of my Munition; I made not choice of an old beaten Soldier for my Admiral, but rather chose a <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>Touching the miserable dissentions in Christendom, I was not the cause thereof; For the appeasing whereof I sent my Lord of <hi>Doncaster,</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> whose journey cost me Three thousand five hundred pounds. My Son in law sent to me for Advice, but within three days after accepted of the Crown; which I did never approve of, for three Reasons.</p>
                        <p>First for Religion's sake, as not holding with the Jesuites disposing of Kingdoms; rather learning of our Saviour to uphold, not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I was not Iudge between them, neither acquainted with the Laws of <hi>Bohemia. Quis me Judicem fecit?</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I have treated a Peace, and therefore will not be a Party; Yet I left not to preserve my Childrens Patrimony: For I had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of my Lords and Subjects, which amounted to a great sum; I borrowed of my Brother of <hi>Denmark</hi> Seven thousand five hundred pounds to help him, and sent as much to him as made it up Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; and Thirty thousand I sent to the Princes of the Union, to hearten them. I have lost no time: Had the Princes of the Union done their parts, that handful of men I sent had done theirs. I intend to send by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> way of Perswasion, which in this Age will little avail unless a strong hand assist: Wherefore I purpose to provide an Army the next Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and desire you to consider of my Necessities, as you have done to my Predecessors. <hi>Qui cito dat, bis dat. I will engage my Crown, my Blood, and my Soul in that Recovery.</hi>

You may be informed of me in things in course of Justice; but I never sent to any of my Iudges to give sentence contrary to Law. Consider the Trade, for the making thereof better; and shew me the reason why my Mint for these eight or nine years hath not gone.

This Delinquent was committed to prison, but he escaped thence and got beyond sea, and was pursued by the Kings Proclamation.</p>
            <p>The Commons at a Conference with the Lords offered to prove, That the Patents of Gold and Silver-Thread, of Inns and Alehouses, and of power to Compound for obsolete Laws, of the Price of Horse-meat, Starch, Cords, Tobacco-pipes, Salt, Train-oil, and the rest, were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all illegal: Howbeit they touch'd not the tender point of Prerogative; but in restoring the Subjects liberty, were careful to preserve the Kings honor.

                           <note place="margin">The Kings Speech to the Lords.</note>
MY Lords, The last time I came hither, my errand was to inform <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> you (as well as my memory could serve me of things so long past) of the verity of my proceedings, and the caution used by me in passing those Letters-Patents which are now in question before you, to the effect that they might not be abused in the execution. And this I did by way of Declaration. But now I am come (understanding the time of your Censure at hand) to express my readiness to put in Execution (which is the life of the Law) those things which ye are to sentence; (For even the Law it self is a dead letter without Execution) For which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> office God hath appointed me in these Kingdoms. And though I assure my self, that my former behaviour in all the course of my life hath made me well known for a just King; yet in this special case I thought fit to express my own intentions out of my own mouth, for punishment of things complained of: The first proof whereof I have given by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent search I caused to be made after the person of Sir <hi>Giles Mompesson,</hi> who though he were fled, yet my Proclamation pursued him instantly: And as I was earnest in that, so will I be to see your Sentence against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> him put in execution.</p>
                        <p>Two reasons move me to be earnest in the execution of what ye are no sentence at this time.</p>
                        <p>First, That duty I owe to God who hath made me a King, and tied me to the care of Government by that Politique Marriage betwixt me and my People: For I do assure you in the heart of an honest man, and by the faith of a Christian King, (which both ye and all the world know me to be) had these things been complained of to me before the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Parliament, I would have done the office of a just King, and out of Parliament have punished them as severely, and peradventure more, then ye now intend to do. But now that they are discovered to me in Parliament, I shall be as ready in this way, as I should have been in the other: For I confess I am ashamed (these things proving so as they are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35668:26"/>
generally reported to be) that it was not my good fortune to be the onely Author of the Reformation, and punishment of them by some Ordinary Courts of Justice. Nevertheless, since these things are new discovered by <hi>Parliament,</hi> which before I knew not of, nor could so well have discovered otherwise, in regard of that Representative Body of the Kingdom which comes from all parts of the Countrey, I will be never a whit the slower to do my part for the execution: For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>(as many of you that are here, have heard me often say, and so I will still say) so pretious unto me is the Publick Good, that no private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whatsoever, (were he never so dear unto me) shall be respected by me, by many degrees, as the Publick Good; not onely of the whole Commonwealth, but even of a particular Corporation that is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it. And I hope that ye, my Lords, will do me that right to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to my people this my Heart and purpose.</p>
                        <p>The second Reason is, That I intend not to derogate or infringe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> any of the Liberties or Priviledges of this House, but rather to fortifie and strengthen them: For never any King hath done so much for the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> as I have done, and will ever be ready to do. And whatsoever I shall say, and deliver unto you as my thought; yet when I have said what I think, I will afterwards freely leave the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wholly to your House. I know you will do nothing but what the like hath been done before: And I pray you be not jealous that I will abridge you of any thing that hath been used; For whatsoever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Precedents (in times of good Government) can warrant, I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; For I acknowledge this to be the Supream Court of Justice, wherein I am ever present by Representation. And in this ye may be the better satisfied by my own presence coming divers times among you. Neither can I give you any greater Assurance, or better Pledge of this my purpose, then that I have done you the honor to set my onely Son among you; and hope that ye with him shall have the means to make this the happiest <hi>Parliament</hi> that ever was in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
This I Profess, and take comfort in, That the <hi>House of Commons</hi> at this time, have shewed greater love, and used me with more respect in all their proceedings, then ever any <hi>House of Commons</hi> have hitherto done to me, or I think to any of my <hi>Predecessors.</hi> As for this House of yours, I have always found it respective to me, and accordingly do I, and ever did favor you, as you well deserved. And I hope it will be accounted a happiness for you, that my <hi>Son</hi> doth now sit among you, who when it shall please God to set him in my place, will then remember <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that he was once a <hi>Member</hi> of your House, and so be bound to maintain all your lawful Priviledges, and like the better of you all the days of his life. But because the World at this time talks so much of <hi>Bribes,</hi> I have just cause to fear the whole Body of this House hath bribed him to be a good Instrument for you upon all occasions: He doth so good Offices in all his Reports to me, both for the House in general, and every one of you in particular. And the like I may say of one that sits there, <hi>Buckingham,</hi> he hath been so ready upon all occasions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> good Offices, both for the House in general, and every Member in particular. One proof thereof, I hope my Lord of <hi>Arundel</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready witnessed unto you, in his Report made unto you of my Answer touching the Priviledges of the Nobility, how earnestly he spake unto me of that matter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:35668:27"/>
Now, my Lords, the time draws near of your <hi>Recess</hi>; whither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality will leave you time for proceeding now to Sentence against all, or any of the persons now in question, I know not; but for my part, since both Houses have dealt so lovingly and freely with me, in giving me a free gift, Two Subsidies, in a more loving manner than hath been given to any King before, and so accepted by me: And since I cannot yet retribute by a General Pardon (which hath by Form usually been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to the end of a Parliament) the least I can do, (which I can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> forbear no longer) is to do something in present, for the ease and good of my people. Three Patents at this time have been complained of, and thought great Grievances.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. <hi>That of the Inns and Hosteries.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. <hi>That of Ale-houses.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>3. <hi>That of Gold and Silver Thred.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>My purpose is to strike them all dead; and that time may not be lost, I will have it done presently: That concerning Ale-houses I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> would have to be left to the Managing of Justices of the Peace as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. That of Gold and Silver Thred was most vilely executed, both for wrong done to mens persons, as also for abuse in the Stuff; for it was a kinde of false Coyn. I have already freed the persons that were in prison, I will now also damn the Patent, and this may seem instead of a Pardon. All these three I will have recalled by Proclamation, and wish you to advise of the fittest Form to that purpose.</p>
                        <p>I hear also there is another Bill among you against Informers. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> desire you, my Lords, that as you tender my Honor, and the good of my People, ye will put that Bill to an end as soon as you can; and at your next meeting to make it one of your first works. For I have already shewed my dislike of that kinde of people openly in <hi>Star-Chamber</hi>; and it will be the greatest ease to me, and all those that are near about me at Court, that may be: For I remember that since the beginning of this Parliament, <hi>Buckingham</hi> hath told me, he never found such quiet and rest, as in this time of Parliament, from Projectors and Informers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> who at other times miserably vexed him at all hours.</p>
                        <p>And now I confess, that when I looked before upon the face of the Government, I thought (as every man would have done) that the people were never so happy as in my time: For even as at divers times I have looked upon many of my Coppices, riding about them, and they appeared on the outside very thick and well-grown, unto me; but when I turned into the midst of them, I found them all bitten within, and full of Plains, and bare spots; like an Apple or Pear, fair and smooth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but when ye cleave it asunder, you finde it rotten at the Heart. Even so this Kingdom, the <hi>External Government</hi> being as good as ever it was, and I am sure as Learned Judges as ever it had, and I hope as honest Administring Justice within it; and for Peace, both at home and abroad, I may truly say, more setled and longer lasting then ever any before; together with as great plenty as ever. So as it was to be thought that every man might sit in safety under his own Vine and Fig-Tree: Yet I am ashamed (and it makes my hair stand upright) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> How in this time my people have been vexed and polled by the vile execution of Projects, Patents, Bills of Conformity, and such like; which besides the trouble of my people, have more exhausted their Purses, then Subsidies would have done.</p>
                        <p>Now, my Lords, before I go hence, since God hath made me the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35668:27"/>
                           <hi>Great Judge</hi> of this Land under him, and that I must answer for the Justice of the same: I will therefore according to my place, remember you of some things, though I would not teach you; For no mans Knowledge can be so good, but their Memories will be the better to be refreshed. And now because you are coming to give Judgment, (all which moves from the King) that you may the better proceed, take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your care two things, 1. To do <hi>Bonum.</hi> 2. To do it <hi>Bene.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
I call <hi>Bonum,</hi> when all is well proved whereupon ye Judge; for then ye build upon a sure Foundation. And by <hi>Bene,</hi> I understand, that ye proceed with all Formality and Legality, wherein you have fit occasion to advise with the Judges, who are to assist you with their Opinions in cases of that nature; and wo be to them, if they advise you not well. So the ground being good, and the form orderly, it will prove a course fitting this High Court of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>In Sentence ye are to observe two parts: First, To recollect that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which is worthy of judging and censuring; and secondly, To proceed against these as against such-like crimes properly. We doubt there will be many matters before you; some complained of out of Passion, and some out of just cause of Grievance: Weigh both, but be not carried away with the impertinent discourses of them that name as well Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent men as guilty. Proceed judicially, and spare none where ye finde just cause to punish: But let your proceedings be according to Law, and remember that Laws have not their Eyes in their Necks, but in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Foreheads. For the Moral Reason for the punishment of Vices in all Kingdoms and Commonwealths, is, because of the Breach of Laws standing in force: For none can be punished for Breach of Laws by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, before they be made.</p>
                        <p>There is yet one particular that I am to remember you of. I hear that Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> (who is now in the Tower upon a Sentence given in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> against him, for deceiving my trust) is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning a Warrant Dormant which he made while he was my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Attorney. I protest I never heard of this Warrant Dormant before; and I hold it as odious a matter, as any is before you. And if for respect to me ye have forborne to meddle with him in Examination, because he is my Prisoner, I do here freely remit him unto you, and put him into your hands.</p>
                        <p>And this is all I have to say unto you at this time, wishing you to proceed justly and nobly, according to the Orders of your House; and I pray God to bless you, and you may assure your selves of my assistance. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Wishing that what I have said this day among you, may be entred into the Records of this House.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> into <hi>London</hi> with his face to the Horse-tail.

            <p>To these Reformations the King gave encouragement by his Third Speech in Parliament, wherein he declared much against Corruption and Bribery in Judicatures; professing, That no person should be preferred before the publick good, and that no offender should go unpunished. In <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the same Speech he gave them thanks for the Subsidies given in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Parliament, and for the Title of the Grant, and proceeded to open his present state in relation to his Son in Law, the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi>; how the sums granted by the Act of Subsidy were taken up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand for the defence of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and the maintenance of his Children expelled out of their Countrey, and for the raising of an Army for that recovery: That he had procured a short Truce, and did hope to obtain a general peace. But the charges of sending Ambassadors over Christendom, or an Army into the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in case a peace were not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> setled, could not be borne, but by the Grant of more Subsidies.

                        <p>The next, That after this example, it is like that Iudges will flie from any thing in the likeness of Corruption (though it were at a great distance) as from a Serpent; which tends to the purging of the Courts of Iustice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to their true honor and splendor.

Neither will I represent to your Lordships, how far a Defence might in divers things extenuate the Offence, in respect of the time and manner of the guilt, or the like circumstances; but onely leave these things to spring out of your more noble thoughts, and observations of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and examinations themselves, and charitably to winde about the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35668:29"/>
of the Charge, here and there, as God shall put into your minde, and so submit my self wholly to your Piety and Grace.</p>
                        <p>And now I have spoken to your Lordships as Iudges, I shall say a few words unto you as Peers and Prelates, humbly commending my Cause to your noble mindes, and magnanimous affections.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordships are not simply Iudges, but Parliamentary Iudges; you have a further extent of Arbitrary power then other Courts; and if you be not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> tyed by ordinary course of Courts, or Precedents, in points of strictness and severity, much less in points of Mercy and Mitigation: And yet if any thing which I shall move, might be contrary to your honorable and worthy End (the introducing a Reformation) I should not seek it. But herein I beseech your Lordships to give me leave to tell you a story.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> took his Sons life for giving battel against the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his General: Not many years after the like severity was pursued by <hi>Papitius Cursor,</hi> the Dictator, against <hi>Quintus Maximus</hi>; who being upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the point to be sentenced, was by the intercession of some particular persons of the Senate spared: Whereupon <hi>Livie</hi> maketh this grave and gratious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Neque minus firmata est Disciplinae Militaris periculo</hi> Quinti Maximi, <hi>quàm miserabili supplicio</hi> Titi Manlii. The Discipline of War was no less established by the questioning of <hi>Quintus Maximus,</hi> then by the punishment of <hi>Titus Manlius</hi>; and the same reason is in the Reformation of Iustice. For the questioning of men in eminent places, hath the same terror, though not the same rigor with the punishment. But my Cause stays not there; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for my humble desire is, That his Majesty would take the Seal into his hands, which is a great downfal, and may serve I hope in it self for an expiation of my faults.</p>
                        <p>Therefore if Mercy and Mitigation be in your Lordships power, and no way cross your ends, Why should I not hope of your favor and commiseration? Your Lordships will be pleased to behold your cheif pattern, the King our Soveraign, a King of incomparable Clemency, and whose heart is instructable for Wisdom and Goodness; And your Lordships will remember there sate not these Hundred years before, a Prince in your House, and never such a Prince, whose presence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> deserveth to be made memorable by Records, and Acts mixt of Mercy and Iustice. Your selves are either Nobles (and compassion ever beateth in the Veins of Noble Blood) or Reverend Prelates, who are the Servants of him that would not break the bruised Reed, or quench the smoaking Flax. You all sit upon a high stage, and therefore cannot but be sensible of the change of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conditions, and of the fall of any from high place.</p>
                        <p>Neither will your Lordships forget, that there are <hi>Vitia temporis,</hi> as well as <hi>Vitia hominis</hi>; and the beginning of Reformation hath the contrary power <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to the Pool of <hi>Bethesda</hi>; for that had strength to cure him onely that was first cast in, and this hath strength to hurt him onely that is first cast in; and for my part I wish it may stay there, and go no further.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I assure my self, your Lordships have a noble feeling of me, as a member of your own Body, and one that in this very Session had some taste of your loving affections, which I hope was not a lightning before the death of them, but rather a spark of that grace which now in the conclusion will more appear: And therefore my humble suit to your Lordships, is, That my penitent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Submission may be my Sentence, the loss of my Seal my punishment, and that your Lordships would recommend me to his Majesties Grace and Pardon for all that is past. Gods holy Spirit be among you.</p>

            <p>The Parliament not satisfied with this general Acknowledgment, do
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35668:29"/>
require the Chancellor either to confess the particulars of the Charge, or they would descend to proof against him. Hereupon he came to an express and plain Acknowledgment, even to confess his Servants receipt of a dozen of Buttons, as a gift in a Cause depending before him; and put himself upon their Lordships Mercy. And he further said,
<q>That he was never noted for an avaritious man; and the Apostle saith, <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is the root of all evil</hi>; and hoped their Lordships did finde him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in a state of Grace, for, that in all particular charges against him, there were few or none that were not almost two years old: Whereas those that have the habit of corruption, do commonly wax worse and worse; and for his estate it was so mean and poor, That his care was now cheifly to satisfie his Debts.</q>
The Lords afterwards pronounced him guilty of the Charge exhibited against him, and in the presence of the Commons gave Sentence, <hi>That he should undergo Fine and Ransome, and be made incapable to bear office, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> This Learned Peer, eminent over the Christian World for his many Writings extant in Print, was known to be no admirer of Money, yet had the unhappiness to be defiled therewith: He treasured up nothing either for himself or his family, for he both lived and died in debt; he was over indulgent to his Servants, and connived at their takings, and their ways betrayed him to that error; they were profuse and expensive, and had at command what ever he was master of. The gifts taken were for the most part for interlocutory Orders; his Decrees were generally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> made with so much Equity, that though gifts rendred him suspected for injustice, yet never any Decree made by him was reversed as unjust, as it hath been observed by some knowing in our Laws.</p>
            <p>About the same time Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> was accused by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Henry</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused by the Commons.</note> who by charging him, rendred him the less offender; and he thereby had the opportunity to speak that at the Bar, which he durst not say in the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he was yet a prisoner upon a late Sentence in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> for passing some Clauses in the City Charter, when he was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Attorney General, not agreeable to His Majesties Warrant. The matter charged against him by the Commons, was for committing divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for not entring into Bonds to restrain their own Trades: That he signed Dormant Warrants, having no Authority for the same: That he advised the Patents of Gold and Silver Thred, to be resumed into the Kings hands, conceiving the same to be a Monopoly, and advised the Patentces to proceed by Contract with the King: That Four thousand <hi>Quo Warranto's</hi> were granted by him touching the Patents of Inns, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but two to come to trial: That he commenced divers Suits in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> touching the Gold and Silver Thred, but did not prosecute the same.</p>
            <p>Which Charge being read unto him, he said, He thought himself happy in the midst of His Majesties disfavor, that His Majesty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to cast the Grace upon him, as to send him to this Honorable House; That <hi>Innocence</hi> hath her present Answer, but <hi>Wisdom</hi> requires time. Therefore he made it his humble suit, for time to give his further Answer; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> adding withal, That the cheif Complaint against him was concerning the two Patents of Gold and Silver Thred, Inns and Osteries. He said, That if he deserved well of His Majesty, it was in that matter; That the King and Subjects were more abused by that Patent, then by any other; and that he suffered at that day for opposing that Patent as he took it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:35668:30"/>The King being informed of this passage in his Speech, came in person to the House of Peers, took notice thereof, saying, It seemed strange unto him, that Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> should be questioned here upon any thing, save the Patent of Gold and Silver Thred: For His Majesty did not conceive that any matter was complained of against him touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inns and Osteries, whereof he was also examined: Touching which Patent <hi>Mompesson</hi> had made complaint to His Majesty, that <hi>Yelver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> refused to send any Proces of <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> against a multitude of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Innkeepers; and His Majesty accepted <hi>Yelvertons</hi> modest Answer, That he misliked those proceedings against his Subjects. His Majesty to clear himself, did lay open the many former just mislikes which he had against Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> and his gentle proceedings against him for the same. And when His Majesty intended to question him, <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Lord Admiral, besought him not to think of any private wrongs done to his Lordship; His Majesty added, That in the Examination of the business touching the Charter of <hi>London, Yelverton</hi> had first justified himself by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Warrant; and that by that Warrant, he might have given away all <hi>London</hi> from him; yet at length he made a good Submission in the beginning, but in the end he said he had not wronged His Majesty in his Prerogative. And sith that now <hi>Yelverton</hi> doth tax His Majesty, that he suffered for his good service done His Majesty, requires the Lords who are able to do him Justice, to punish <hi>Yelverton</hi> for his slander.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> coming shortly after before the Lords, gave his particular Answer to each particular charge <hi>in serie temporis,</hi> and spake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> moreover as followeth.</p>

                        <p>I Cannot but present my self this day before Your Highness, and my Lords, with much fear, with more grief; for I am compassed with so many terrors from His Majesty, as I might well hide my head with <hi>Adam.</hi> His Lordships (meaning <hi>Buckingham</hi>) displeasure wounds me more, then the conscience of any these facts; yet had I rather die, then the Commonwealth should so much as receive a scrach from me. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that in none of my actions feared that great man, on whom they (<hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Villers</hi> and Sir <hi>Giles Mompesson</hi>) did depend, much less would I fear them who were but his shadow. But my most Noble Lords know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was ever at His Majesties hand, ready upon every occasion to hew me down, out of the honest fear of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant not to offend so gracious a Master as His Majesty hath ever been to me, I did commit them (<hi>videlicet</hi>) the Silkmen.</p>
                        <p>And speaking concerning the Patent of Inns, he said,
I cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> herein but bemoan my unhappiness, that in the last cause laboring by all lawful means to advance the honest profit of His Majesty; and in this (with the sight almost of my own ruine) to preserve His Majesties honor, and the quiet of the people, I am yet drawn in question, as if I had equally dishonored His Majesty in both.</p>
                        <p>When Sir <hi>Giles</hi> saw I would not be wooed to offend His Majesty in his direction, I received a Message by Mr. <hi>Emmerson,</hi> sent me from Sir <hi>Giles,</hi> That I would run my self upon the Rocks, and that I should not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> hold my place long, if I did thus withstand the Patent of Inns, or to this effect. Soon after came Sir <hi>Giles</hi> himself, and like an Herauld at Arms, told me to this effect, He had a Message to tell me from the Lord of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that I should not hold my place a moneth, if I did not conform my self in better measure to the Patent of Inns; for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35668:30"/>
my Lord had obtained it by his Favor, and would maintain it by his Power: How could I but startle at this Message, for I saw here was a great assuming of power to himself, to place, and displace an Officer; I saw my self cast upon two main Rocks, either treacherously to forsake the standing His Majesty had set me in, or else to indanger my self by a by blow, and so hazard my Fortune.</p>
                        <p>I humbly beseech your Lordships: Nature will struggle when she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sees her place and means of living thus assaulted; for now it was come to this, Whither I would obey His Majesty, or my Lord, if Sir <hi>Giles</hi> spake true. Yet I resolved in this to be as stubborn as <hi>Mordecai,</hi> not to stoop or pass those gracious Bounds His Majesty had prescribed me.</p>
                        <p>Soon after I found the Message in part made good; for all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits almost of my place were diverted from me, and turned into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Channel, to one of my Lords Worthies, That I retained little <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> more then the name of Attorney. It became so fatal and so penal, that it became almost the loss of a Suit to come to me. My place was but as the seat of Winds and Tempests.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit, I dare say if my Lord of <hi>Buchingham</hi> had but read the Articles exhibited in this place against <hi>Hugh Spencer,</hi> and had known the danger of placing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>The King hearing of this Speech, commanded the Lord Treasurer to acquaint the House of Lords, That he understood that <hi>Yelverton</hi> being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> called before them the other day as a Delinquent, answered not as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, but as a Judge, or accuser of a Member of that House the Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; saying, He suffered for the Patent of Inns, or to that effect: That he was so far from excusing or extenuating of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence the last day here, that he hath aggravated the same. Wherefore His Majesties pleasure is, That himself will be judge of what concerns His Majesty; for that which concerns the Lord of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath besought His Majesty that that might be left to the House, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> so His Majesty leaves that wholly to their Lordships.</p>
            <p>The Lords made an humble Return to His Majesty, That forasmuch as he was once pleased to make their House Judge of those words former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoken by Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton,</hi> which touched His Majesties Honor, that His Majesty will be pleased not to resume the same out of their hands, but so far to tender the Priviledges of their House, as to continue his first resolution, which afterwards the King condescended unto.</p>
            <p>The Lords first examining <hi>Emerson</hi> (who varied in the matter he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> was examined about) proceeded to Sentence Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton,</hi> not upon the Charge exhibited against him by the Commons, but for the words spoken by the by; and declared, That the said Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> for his Speeches uttered here in the Court, which do touch the Kings Majesty his Honor, shall be fined to the King in Ten thousand Marks, be imprisoned during the Kings pleasure, and make a Submission unto His Majesty. And
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35668:31"/>
for the scandal committed in these words of his against the Lord Marquess of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> That he should pay him Five thousand Marks, and make his Submission.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Judgment was pronounced against him, the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Buckingham</hi> stood up, and did freely remit him the said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Five thousand marks; for which Sir <hi>Henry</hi> humbly thanked his Lordship, and the House of Peers agreed to move His Majesty to mitigate Sir <hi>Henry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Yelvertons</hi> Fine, and the Prince his Highness offered to move His Majesty therein; which accordingly was done, and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was set at liberty, the Duke reconciled to him; he afterwards preferred to be a Judge, and was esteemed a man <hi>Valde eruditus in Lege.</hi>

And forasmuch as His Majesty was informed that there was a fellow already apprehended, though not for casting stones or threatning the Ambassadors person, as some are said to have done; yet for using railing speeches against him, calling him <hi>Divel</hi> or words to that purpose, it was His Majesties pleasure that that fellow without any further delay, on the morrow in the forenoon, be publickly and sharply whipt thorow <hi>London,</hi> beginning at <hi>Algate,</hi> and so through the streets, along by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> place where the affront was offered, towards Fleetstreet, and so to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Bar, without any manner of favor.</p>

After this the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror began both in <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Hungaria</hi> to imprison divers that assisted the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and caused Proces to be made against them.

            <p>The Emperor put forth an Answer, and said, That the Marquess pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished those things maliciously; forasmuch as in <hi>Bohemia</hi> was the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

sedition, and the head that infected the members: That some few persons, Authors of the troubles, not in hatred of their Religion, but for their Rebellion, have been punished by the hand of Justice. And he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared further, That the like exemplary Justice should not be done in other places, but that the Articles of the Peace should be observed.</p>
            <p>By this time the Parliament having sate about four moneths,<note place="margin">The King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ the Parliament.</note> King <hi>Iames</hi> was desirous to give them a time of vacancie. The Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by the Kings command declared unto the Houses, That his Majesty by the advice of his Privy Council thought fit to adjourn the Parliament, lest the season of the year, by the continual concourse of people, should cause Infection. Also, that the Lieutenans and Justices might be in the Country; And the Adjournment keeping the Parliament still in being, was better then Proroguing. That his Majesty had already redressed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in Courts of Justice, and by his Proclamation called in the Patents of Inns, of Osteries, and of Gold and Silver-Thread, and cherished the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Bill against Informers and Monopolies.</p>
            <p>The Commons were troubled at this Message,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons take it not well.</note> and desired a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Lords, and moved them to petition the King to forbear the Adjournment. The King takes notice of it; and the Treasurer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Lords, that a Petition of this nature could not be pleasing to his Majesty, it seeming to derogate from his Prerogative, who alone hath power to call, adjourn, and determine Parliaments. The Commons, at a further Conference, declared their hearty sorrow and passionate grief <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> at the Kings resolution; which they said cut off the performance of what they had consulted, and promised for the Publique weal.</p>
            <p>The Lords sitting in their Robes, the King came and made a Speech, takes notice of his Message to both Houses, and gave their Lordships thanks for obeying the same, and acknowledging his power to call, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ, and dissolve Parliaments, and for refusing to join with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the Petition for Non-adjournment. And whereas some had given out, that no good had been done this Parliament; He put them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in mind, that the two Patents grievous to the Commonwealth were called in, and that the Parliament had censured the Offenders for an example to all ages. And if they desired it, he offered them eight or ten days longer sitting to expedite Bills; but said, that at the request of the Commons he would not grant it. The Lords had a Conference with the Commons; after which they moved the King to continue their sitting for fourteen days, which was granted, and the Commons were satisfied with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of Adjournment.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> A Committee of both Houses afterwards attending the King,<note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it.</note> he told them how ill he took it, that the Commons should dispute his reasons of Adjournment; all power being in him alone to call, adjourn, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue, and dissolve Parliaments. And on <hi>Iune</hi> 4. he declared for an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment till <hi>November</hi> following; And that he will in the mean time of his own authority redress Grievances.

            <p>In the first place he acquainted the Two Houses with His Majesties indisposition of health,<note place="margin">The Substance of the Lord Keepers Speech.</note> which was the occasion of his absence at the opening of the Parliament, yet he could not say he was absent, so long as he was represented by a Son, who was as dear to the Kingdom as to His Majesty.

We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of our zeal to your Maiesty and your Posterity, with more ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and celerity than ever was presidented in Parliament, did Address our selves to the service commended unto us. And although we cannot conceive, That the honor and safety of your Maiesty and your Posterity, the Patrimony of your Children invaded, and possessed by their enemies, the welfare of Religion, and State of your Kingdom, are matters at any time unfit for our déepest consideration in time of Parliament; And though before this time we were in some of these points silent, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now invited thereunto, and led on by so iust an occasion, we thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it our duties to provide for the present supply thereof, and not onely to turn our eyes on a War abroad, but to take care for the securing of our peace at home, which the dangerous increase and insolency of Popish Recusants apparently, visibly, and sensibly, did lead us unto. The consideration whereof did necessarily draw us truly to represent unto your Maiesty, what we conceive to be the causes, what we feared would be the effects, and what we hoped might be the remedies of these growing Evils; among which, as incident and unavoidable, we fell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> upon some things which séem to touch upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as they have relation to Popish Recusants at home, to the Wars by him main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> against your Maiesties Children, and to his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Armies now on foot, yet as we conceived without touch of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to that King, or any other Prince your Maiesties Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
                        <p>In the Discourse whereof, we did not assume to our selves any power to determine of any part thereof, nor intend to incroach or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> upon the Sacred Bounds of Your Royal Authority, to whom, and to whom onely, we acknowledge it doth belong to resolve of Peace, and War, and of the Marriage of the most Noble Prince your Son: But as your most loyal and humble Subjects and Servants, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the whole Commons of your Kingdom (who have a large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the happy and prosperous estate of your Majesty, and your
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35668:37"/>
Royal Posterity, and of the flourishing estate of our Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth) did resolve out of our Cares and Fears, truly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to demonstrate these things to your Majesty, which we were not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured could otherwise come so fully and clearly to your knowledge; and that being done, to lay the same down at your Majesties féet, without expectation of any other Answer of your Majesty touching these higher points, then what at your good pleasure, and in your own time should be held fit.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>This being the effect of that we had formerly resolved upon, and these the Occasions and Reasons inducing the same, Our humble suit to your Majesty and confidence is, That your Majesty will be gratiously pleased to receive at the hands of these our Messengers, our former humble <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Petition,</hi> and vouchsafe to read and favorably to interpret the same; and that to so much thereof as containeth our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Petition</hi> concerning Iesuits, Priests, and Popish Recusants, the Passage of Bills, and Granting your Royal Pardon, you will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> an Answer unto us.</p>
                        <p>And whereas your Majesty by the general words of your Letter, séemeth to restrain us from intermedling with Matters of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Particulars which have their motion in the Courts of Iustice, the generality of which words in the largeness of the extent thereof, (as we hope beyond your Majesties intention) might involve those things which are the proper Subjects of Parliamentary occasions and discourse.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>And whereas your Majesty doth séem to abridge us of the Antient Liberty of Parliament for Fréedom of Spéech, Iurisdiction, and Iust Censure of the House, and other procéedings there (wherein we trust in God we shall never transgress the bounds of Loyal and Dutiful Subjects) a Liberty which we assure our selves, so Wise and so Iust a King will not infringe, the same being our antient and undoubted Right, and an Inheritance received from our Ancestors; without which we cannot fréely debate, nor clearly discern of things in question <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> before us, nor truly inform your Majesty: In which we have béen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by your Maiesties most gratious former Spéeches and Mess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. We are therefore now again inforced in all humbleness to pray your Maiesty to allow the same, and thereby to take away the Doubts and Scruples your Maiesties late Letter to our <hi>Speaker</hi> hath wrought upon us.</p>
                        <p>So shall we your loyal and loving Subiects ever acknowledge your Maiesties Iustice, Grace, and Goodness, and be ready to perform that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> service to your Maiesty, which in the true affection of our hearts we profess, and pour out our daily and devout Prayers to the Almighty for your Maiesties long life, happy and religious Reign, and prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Estate, and for your Royal Posterity after you for ever.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35668:37"/>
Proposition made by a <hi>Polonian</hi> Ambassador unto her; that is, <hi>Legatum expectabamus, Heraldum accipimus.</hi> For we had great reason to expect that the first Message from your House should have been a Message of Thanksgiving for our continued gratious behavior to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our people, since your last Recess; not onely by our Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace, wherein were contained Six or seven and thirty Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, all of several points of Grace to the people; but also by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> labor we took for the satisfaction of both Houses in those three Articles recommended unto us in both their names, by the Right Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God, the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and likewise for the good Government of <hi>Ireland,</hi> we are now in hand with, at your request; but not onely have we heard no news of all this, but contrary, great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the danger of Religion within this Kingdom, tacitely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying our ill Government in this point. And we leave you to judge, whether it be your duties that are the Representative Body of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> so to distaste them with our Government; whereas by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it is your duty, with all your endeavors, to kindle more and more a dutiful and thankful love in the peoples hearts towards us, for our just and gratious Government.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas in the very beginning of this your Apology you tax us in fair terms of trusting uncertain Reports, and partial Informations concerning your proceedings, we wish you to remember that we are an old and experienced King, needing no such Lessons, being in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> freest of any King alive from hearing or trusting idle Reports, which so many of your House as are nearest us, can bear witness unto you, if you would give as good ear to them, as you do to some Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitial Orators among you: And for proof in this particular, we have made your own Messengers confer your other Petitions sent by you, with the Copy thereof, which was sent us before: Between which, there is no difference at all; but that since our receiving the first Copy, you added a conclusion unto it, which could not come to our hands, till it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was done by you, and your Messengers sent, which was all at one time. And if we had had no Copy of it before-hand, we must have received your first Petition to our great dishonor, before we had known what it contained, which would have enforced us to return you a far worse An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, then now we do; for then your Messengers had returned with nothing, but that we have judged your Petition unlawful, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of an Answer: For as to your conclusion thereof, it is nothing but <hi>Protestatio contraria facto</hi>; for in the Body of your Petition, you usurpe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> upon our Prerogative Royal, and meddle with things far above your reach, and then in the conclusion you protest the contrary; As if a Robber would take a mans purse, and then protest he meant not to rob him.

                           </gap> War with that King; and yet in the conclusion, forsooth, ye protest ye intend not to press upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> our most undoubted and Regal Prerogative; as if the Petitioning of us in matters that your selves confess ye ought not to meddle with, were not a meddling with them.</p>
                        <p>And whereas ye pretend, That ye were invited to this course by the Speeches of Three honorable Lords; yet by so much as your selves repeat of the Speeches, nothing can be concluded, but that we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35668:38"/>
were resolved by War to regain the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> if otherwise we could not attain unto it. And you were invited to advise forthwith upon a Supply for keeping the forces in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> from disbanding, and to foresee the means for the raising, and maintenance of the Body of an Army for that War against the Spring. Now what inference can be made upon this, that therefore we must presently denounce War against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> break our dearest Sons match, and match him to one of our Religion, let the World judge: The difference is no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> greater, than if we would tell a Merchant that we had great need to borrow Money from him for raising an Army; that thereupon it should follow that we were bound to follow his advice in the direction of the War, and all things depending thereupon: But yet not contenting your selves with this excuse of yours, which indeed cannot hold water, ye come after to a direct contradiction to the conclusion of your former Petition, saying, That the honor and safety of us and our Posterity, and the Patrimony of Our Children invaded and possessed by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Welfare of Religion, and State of our Kingdom, are matters at any time not unfit for your deepest considerations in Parliament. To this generality, we answer with the Logicians, That where all things are contained, nothing is omitted. So as this Plenipotency of yours, invests you in all power upon Earth, lacking nothing but the Popes to have the Keys also both of Heaven and Purgatory: And to this vast generality of yours, we can give no other answer; for it will trouble all the best Lawyers in the House to make a good Commentary upon it:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> For so did the Puritan Ministers in <hi>Scotland</hi> bring all kinde of causes within the compass of their jurisdiction, saying, That it was the Churches office to judge of slander; and there could no kinde of crime or fault be committed, but there was a slander in it, either against God, the King, or their Neighbor, and by this means they hooked into themselves the cognisance of all causes: Or like <hi>Bellarmines</hi> distinction of the Popes power over Kings, in <hi>Ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> whereby he gives them all Temporal Jurisdiction over them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to give you a direct Answer to the matter of War, for which you are so earnest. We confess we rather expected you should have given us thanks for the so long maintaining a setled Peace in all our Dominions, when as all our Neighbors about are in miserable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion of War; but <hi>dulce bellum inexpertis.</hi> And we indeed finde by experience, that a number of our Subjects are so pampered with Peace, as they are desirous of change, though they knew not what.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that we have ever professed (and in that minde with Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> grace we will live and die) that we will labor by all means possible, either by Treaty or by force, to restore our Children to their ancient Dignity and Inheritance: And whatsoever Christian Princes or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates will set themselves against it, we will not spare any lawful means to bring our so just and honorable purpose to a good end; neither shall the match of our Son, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ny other worldly respect be preferred to this our resolution. For by our credit and intervention with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Arch-Dutches, and her Husband now with God, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> preserved the Lower <hi>Palatinate</hi> one whole year from any further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering in it, which in eight days space, in that time might have easily been swallowed up by <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Army without any resistance. And in no better case was it now at our Ambassador the Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> coming through <hi>Heidelburgh,</hi> if he had not extraordinarily succored it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:35668:38"/>
But because we conceive that ye couple this War of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> with the Cause of Religion, we must a little unfold your eyes herein.</p>
                        <p>The beginning of this miserable War, which hath set all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom on fire, was not for Religion, but only caused by our Son-in-law his hasty and harsh resolution, following evil Counsel, to take to himself the Crown of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And that this is true, himself wrote Letters unto us at that time, desiring to give assurance both to the French King and State of <hi>Venice,</hi> that his accepting of the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Cause of Religion, but only by reason of his right of Election (as he called it.) And we would be sorry that that aspersion should come upon our Religion, as to make it a good pretext for dethroning of Kings, and usurping their Crowns; And we would be loth that our people here should be taught <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that strange doctrine: No, let us not so far wrong the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>esuites, as to rob them of their sweet Positions and practice in that very point.</p>
                        <p>And upon the other part, We assure our self so far of your charitable thoughts of us, that we would never have constantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied our Son in law both the Title and assistance in that point, if we had been well perswaded of the justice of his quarrel. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; This unjust usurpation of the Crowns of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from the Emperor, hath given the Pope and all that party too fair a ground, and opened them too wide a gate for curbing and oppressing of many thousands of our Religion in divers parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.</p>
                        <p>And whereas you excuse your touching upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon occasion of the incidents by you repeated in that place, and yet affirm that it is without any touch to his honor; We cannot wonder enough that ye are so forgetful both of your words and writs: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> For in your former Petition ye plainly affirm, That he affects the Temporal Monarchy of the whole Earth; then which there can be no more malice uttered against any great King, to make all other Princes and Potentates both envy and hate him: But if ye list, it may easily be tryed whether that speech touched him in honor, or not, if ye shall ask him the question whether he means to assume to himself that title, or no: For every King can best judge of his own honor. We omit the particular ejaculations of some foul-mouthed Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in your House, against the Honor of that Kings Crown and State.</p>
                        <p>And touching your excuse of not determining any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Match of our dearest Son, but only to tell your Opinion, and lay it down at our feet: First we desire to know how you could have presumed to determine in that point, without committing of High Treason? And next you cannot deny but your talking of his his Match after that manner, was a direct breach of our command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and declaration out of our own mouth at the first sitting down of this Parliament, where we plainly professed that we were in Treaty of this Match with <hi>Spain</hi>; and wished you to have that confidence in our Religion and Wisdom, that we would so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it, as our Religion should receive no prejudice by it: And the same we now repeat unto you, professing that we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35668:39"/>
are so far engaged in that Match, as we cannot in honor go back, except the King of <hi>Spain</hi> perform not such things as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at his hands. And therefore we are sorry that ye should shew to have so great distrust in us, as to conceive that we should be cold in our Religion; Otherwise we cannot imagine how our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer publique Declaration should not have stopt your mouths in this point.</p>
                        <p>And as to your request, That we would now receive your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> former Petition; We wonder what could make you presume that we would receive it, whereas in our former Letter we plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the contrary unto you. And therefore we have justly rejected that suit of yours: For what have you left unattempted in the highest points of Soveraignty, in that Petition of yours, except the striking of Coin? For it contains the violation of Leagues, the particular way how to govern a War, and the Marriage of our dearest Son, both Negative with <hi>Spain,</hi> nay with any other Popish Princess, and also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Affirmatively as to the matching with one of our Religion; which we confess is a strain beyond any providence or wisdom God hath given us, as things now stand.</p>
                        <p>These are unfit things to be handled in Parliament, except your King should require it of you: For who can have wisdom to judge of things of that nature, but such as are daily acquainted with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of Treaties, and of the variable and fixed connexion of affairs of State, together with the knowledge of the secret ways, ends and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> intentions of Princes in their several Negotiations? otherwise a small mistaking of matters of this nature, may produce more effects then can be imagined: And therefore <hi>Ne Sutor ultra crepidam.</hi> And besides, the intermedling in Parliament with matters of Peace or War, and Marriage of our dearest Son, would be such a Diminution to us and to our Crown in Foreign Countries, as would make any Prince neglect to treat with us either in matters of Peace or Marriage, except they might be assured by the assent of Parliament. And so it proved long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ago with a King of <hi>France,</hi> who upon a Trick procuring his States to dissent from some Treaty which before he had made, was after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Treating with any other Princes to his great reproach, unless he would first procure the assent of his Estates to their Proposition. And will you cast your eyes upon the late times, you shall find that the late Queen of famous memory was humbly petitioned by a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to be pleased to marry: But her Answer was, That she liked their Petition well, because it was simple, not limiting her to place or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> person, as not befitting her liking to their fancies; And if they had done otherwise, she would have thought it a high presumption in them. Judge then what we may do in such a case, having made our publique declaration already (as we said before) directly contrary to that which you have now petitioned.</p>
                        <p>Now to the points in your Petition whereof you desire an Answer, as properly belonging to the Parliament; The first and the greatest point is, that of Religion: Concerning which at this time we can give you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> no other Answer then in the general; which is, That you may rest secure that we will never be weary to do all we can for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of our Religion, and repressing of Popery: But the manner and form you must remit to our care and providence, who can best consider of times and seasons, not by undertaking a Publique War
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35668:39"/>
of Religion through all the World at once, (which how hard and dangerous a task it may prove, you may judge.) But this puts us in mind, how all the World complained the last year of plenty of Corn; and God sent us a Cooling-card this year for that heat: And so we pray God, that this desire among you of kindling Wars (shewing your weariness of peace and plenty) may not make God permit us to fall into the miseries of both. But as we already said, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> our care of Religion must be such, as on the one part we must not by the hot persecution of our Recusants at home irritate Foreign Princes of contrary Religion, and teach them the way to plague the Protestants in their Dominions, with whom we daily intercede, and at this time principally, for ease to them of our profession that live under them; Yet upon the other part, we never mean to spare from due and severe punishment any Papist that will grow insolent for living under our so mild Government. And you may also be assured, we will leave no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> care untaken, as well for the good Education of the Youth at home, especially the children of Papists, as also for preserving at all times hereafter the Youth that are or shall be abroad, from being bred in dangerous places, and so poisoned in Popish Seminaries. And as in this point, namely the good education of Popish youth at home, we have already given some good proofs both in this Kingdom and in <hi>Ireland,</hi> so will we be well pleased to pass any good Laws that shall be made either now, or at any time hereafter to this purpose.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And as to your request of making this a Session, and granting a General Pardon; It shall be in your defaults, if we make nor this a Session before Christmas.</p>
                        <p>But for the Pardon, ye crave such particulars in it, as we must be well advised upon, lest otherwise we give you back the double or treble of that we are to receive by your entire Subsidy, without Fifteens. But the ordinary course we hold fittest to be used still in this case is, That we should of our free grace send you down a Pardon from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Higher House, containing such points as we shall think fittest, wherein we hope ye shall receive good satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>But we cannot omit to shew you how strange we think it, that ye should make so bad and unjust a Commentary upon some words of our former Letter, as if we meant to restrain you thereby of your antient priviledges and liberties in Parliament. Truly, a Scholar would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd so to misplace and misjudge any sentences in another mans book.

And therefore it had well became him, especially being our Servant, and one of our Council, to have complained unto us, which he never did, though he was ordinarily at Court since, and never had access refused unto him.</p>

And although we cannot allow of the stile, calling it <hi>Your antient and undoubted Right and Inheritance</hi>; but could rather have wished that ye had said, That your Priviledges were derived from the grace and permission of our Ancestors and Us, (For most of them grow from Precedents, which shews rather a Toleration then Inheritance:) Yet we are pleased to give you our Royal assurance, that as long as you contain your selves within the limits of your duty, we will be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to maintain and preserve your lawful Liberties and Priviledges, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ever any of our Predecessors were, nay as to preserve our own Royal Prerogative. So as your House shall only have need to beware to trench upon the Prerogative of the Crown; which would enforce us, or any just King, to retrench them of their Priviledges, that would pare his Prerogative, and Flowers of the Crown: But of this we hope there shall be never cause given.

            <p>These Priviledges were originally the favor of Princes; neither doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his Majesty go about to impair or diminish them.

                        <p>HIs most Excellent Majesty coming this day to the Council, the Prince his Highness, and all the Lords and others of His Majesties Privy Council sitting about him, and all the Iudges then in <hi>London,</hi> which were six in number, there attending upon His Majesty; the Clerk of the Commons House of Parliament was called <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for, and commanded to produce his Iournal-book, wherein was noted, and Entries made of most passages that were in the Commons House of Parliament; and amongst other things there was written down the form of a <hi>Protestation</hi> concerning sundry Liberties, Priviledges, and Franchises of Parliament; with which form of <hi>Protestation</hi> His Majesty was justly offended. Nevertheless His Majesty in a most gracious manner there expressed, That he never meant to deny that House of Commons any lawful Priviledges that ever they had enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> but whatsoever Priviledges or Liberties they had by any Law or Statute, the same should be inviolably preserved unto them; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Priviledges they enjoyed by Custom, or uncontrolled and lawful president, His Majesty would be careful to preserve. But this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi> of the Commons House so contrived and carried as it was, His Majesty thought fit to be razed out of all Memorials, and utterly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35668:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be annihilated, both in respect of the manner by which it was gained, and the matter therein contained. For the manner of getting it, First in respect of the time: For after such time as His Majesty out of his Princely grace, and to take away all mistakings, had directed his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Secretary <hi>Calvert</hi> dated at <hi>Royston</hi> 16 <hi>Decembris,</hi> and therein had so explained himself in the point of maintaining the priviledges of the House of Commons, as that most of the said House rested fully satisfied, and freed from any scruple of having their liberties impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And after that by His Majesties Letters directed to the Speaker dated 18 <hi>December,</hi> being Tuesday, His Majesty at the humble suit of the House of Commons, condescended to make this Méeting a Session before Christmas, and for that purpose had assigned Saturday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now upon this very Tuesday, and while the Messengers from the House of Commons were with His Majesty at <hi>Theobalds</hi> to return thanks unto His Majesty, and therewith an excuse from them not to make it a Session in respect of the strait of time whereunto they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> driven; which deferment His Majesty admitted of at their desires, and thereupon gave order for the adjournment of the Parliament until the Eight of <hi>February</hi> next, which was the first day formerly appointed by His Majesty for the méeting together of the Parliament: And whilst their messengers were with His Majesty, and had received a gracious Answer to return unto their House; even that afternoon, a Committee was procured to be made for taking their Liberties into consideration: And this afternoon a <hi>Protestation</hi> was made (to whom appears not)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> concerning their Liberties; and at six a clock at night, by candle-light, the same <hi>Protestation</hi> was brought into the House by the Committee, and at that time of night it was called upon to be put to the Question, there not being the third part of the House then present; whereas in all matters of weight, their usual custom is to put nothing of importance to the Question, till the House be full; And at this time many of them that were present expected the Question would have been deferred to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day, and a fuller House, and some then present stood up to have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> spoken to it, but could not be seen nor heard in that darkness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. Now for the matter of the <hi>Protestation,</hi> it is penned in such ambiguous and general words, as may serve for future Times to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade most of Rights and Prerogatives annexed to the Imperial Crown; the claim of some priviledges being grounded upon the words of the Writ for assembling the Parliament, wherein some words, <hi>viz. Arduis Regni,</hi> are cunningly mentioned; but the word <hi>quibusdam,</hi> which restraineth the generality to such particular Cases as His Majesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> pleaseth to consult with them upon, is purposely omitted.</p>

Dissolution he had the advice and uniform consent of his whole Council. And that some particular Members of the House of Commons took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate liberty not only to treat of his high Prerogatives, and sundry things not fitting to be argued in Parliament, but also to speak with less respect to Foreign Princes: That they spent the time in disputing Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, descanting upon the words and syllables of his Letters and Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: And that these Evil-tempered spirits sowed tares among the corn, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and by their cunning devices have imposed upon him a necessity of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuing this present Parliament, without putting unto it the name or period of a Session. And lastly he declared, That though the Parliament be broken off, yet he intended to govern well, and shall be glad to lay hold on the first occasion to call a Parliament again at convenient time.</p>
            <p>The King was highly displeased with some of the Commons House,<note place="margin">Some Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Members of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.</note> whom he called <hi>Ill-tempered spirits.</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Philips</hi>

            <p>Proclamations had formerly issued out against the Peoples too liberal speaking of matters above their reach:<note place="margin">The Council write to Judges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such as speak of State Affairs.</note> Which at this time occasioned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Letters from the Council to the Judges of the next Assises, taking notice of licentious and undutiful speeches touching State and Government, notwithstanding several Proclamations prohibiting the same, which the King was resolved no longer to let pass without severest punishment; and thereupon required the Judges to give this in Charge in their several Circuits, and to do exemplary Justice where they find any such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
            <p>The King still walked in his beaten path of Sollicitations and Treaties, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> after the constant bad success of his former Mediations: For at the very time when he treated of Peace,<note place="margin">The Palatine spoiled of his hereditary dominions.</note> his Son in law was despoiled of his Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary patrimony by the Emperors commandment; who after the suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Ban or Proscription, commanded the taking up of Arms again in the <hi>Lower Palatinate,</hi> the <hi>Upper Palatinate</hi> being already subdued. Which misery King <hi>Iames</hi> acknowledged to be the fruit of his own patience, delays, and doubtfulness. Nevertheless he ceaseth not to pursue the favor of an implacable Enemy: He wrote to the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> declaring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> his earnest endeavors to appease the Bohemian War,<note place="margin">The terms which King <hi>Iames</hi> desires the Emperor to accept in behalf of the Palatine.</note> and his ardent zeal for Peace from the beginning; and expressed the Terms which he had prescribed to his Son in law: As, That he shall for himself and his Son renounce all pretence of Right and Claim to the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; That he shall from henceforth yield all constant due devotion to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majesty, as do other obedient Princes Electors of the Empire;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35668:42"/>
That he shall crave pardon of the Imperial Majesty; That he shall not hereafter any manner of way demean himself unfittingly toward the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majesty, nor disturb his Kingdoms and Countries; And that he shall upon reasonable Conditions reconcile himself to other Princes and States of the Empire, and hold all good correspondence with them; And he shall really do whatsoever like things shall be judged reasonable and necessary.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> requested of the Emperor the acceptance of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as a notable testimony of his Imperial Majesties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goodness and grace, which he said should be by himself acknowledged in all willing service and unfeigned friendship to the Emperor himself, and the most renowned House of <hi>Austria.</hi> But if these his just Demands and well-willed Presentations shall not find acceptance, or be slightly waved by some new tergiversation, or a pretence of that long and tedious way of Consultation with the Princes of the Empire, he is resolved to try his utmost power for his Childrens relief, judging it a foul stain to his Honor,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if he shall leave them and their Partizans without counsel, aid and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>

No Oblivion shall ever blot out of our minde, the acknowledgment of so great a favor, and we will endeavor to transmit to our Posterity, that Hereditary good will wherewith we have ever affected your Serenity, and your Royal Father of most worthy memory, and shall ever affect you.

That this Preaching against the Puritans was but the practice of <hi>Parsons</hi> and <hi>Campions</hi> counsel, when they came into <hi>England</hi> to seduce yong Students: And when many of them were afraid to lose their places, if they should professedly be thus, the counsel they then gave them was, That they should speak freely against the Puritans, and that should suffice. And they cannot intend that they are accounted Papists, because they speak against the Puritans. But because they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are Papists, they speak nothing against them. If they do at any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> time speak against the Papists, they do beat a little upon the Bush, and that softly too, for fear of troubling or disquieting the Birds that are in it.</q>

                  <p>Our Viperous Countrymen, the English Iesuites in <hi>France,</hi> had many moneths before this favor granted, invited the French King, by writing a malicious Book, to put all the Statutes in execution against the Protestants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in those parts, which were Enacted in <hi>England</hi> against the Papists, and (as they falsly informed) severely executed.

            <p>When the Ambassador at <hi>Bruxels</hi> complained of these proceedings, he received frivolous Answers mixed with Recriminations.

            <p>For this cause Sir <hi>Richard Weston</hi> acquainted the Marquess of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that he could not discern how the weak Hopes given him at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> could agree with those strong Assurances given by the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> from the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi>

            <p>To another Demand, That the Superior Minister having Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Authority, be in <hi>Ordine Episcopali</hi>; he answered, That he would leave it to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to appoint as he shall judge expedient.</p>
            <p>But whereas the Pope required, That the Ecclesiasticks be subject to no Laws but of their own Ecclesiastical Superiors; his answer was, That exemption seemed strange, as not allowed in all States and Countreys that were of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion.</p>

And further then we have already assented in general, to leave the Children under the Mothers tuition for a longer or shorter time, according to their constitution and health, (which may possibly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> reach unto the time required by the Pope) We can by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend, unless the King of <hi>Spain</hi> think it fit to limit the time to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Pope expected some larger offers for the general good of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; the King shewed, That the Articles of Religion agreed upon between himself, and the late King of <hi>Spain,</hi> were accounted so satisfactory in the judgment of the Learnedst, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Clergy of <hi>Spain,</hi> That they declared their opinion, that upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> offer of such Conditions, the Pope ought not to withhold the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
            <p>And he said further, That the Pope was satisfied, that he of his own Authority could not grant a general Liberty of exercising the <hi>Roman</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; And what is it that they would have? For setting that aside, he had in a manner done already all that was desired, as all the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks have found, out of his gratious Clemency towards them, and will no doubt acknowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> This Resolution the King sent into <hi>Spain</hi> (for he would not seem to Treat with <hi>Rome</hi>) and therewith this Letter to the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> now made Earl of <hi>Bristol.</hi>

                        <hi>The King sends his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to</hi> Digby <hi>in</hi> Spain, <hi>now made Earl of</hi> Bristol.</note>OUr pleasure is, that immediately you crave Audience of that King, and represent unto him the merit that we may justly chalenge to our self, for our sincere proceedings with the Emperor and him: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the many Invitations and Temptations, we have had to engage our self on our Son in Laws part. That we have both from the Emperor, and from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him, hopes given us from time to time of extraordinary respect, (howsoever our Son in Law had deserved) which we have attended and expected, even to the last with much patience, and in despight as it were of all opposition, which might shake our Resolution in that behalf: If now, when all impediments are removed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the way is so prepared, as that the Emperor may give an end unto the War, and make some present Demonstration of his respect towards us, in leaving us the honor of holding those poor places which yet remain quietly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and peaceably, until the general Accommodation, the same shall nevertheless be violently taken from us; What can we look for, if the whole shall be in his hands and possession? who amuzing us with a Treaty of Cessation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it industriously (as we have reason to believe) doth in the mean time seize himself of the whole Countrey. Which being done, our Ambassador shall return with scorn, and we remain in dishonor: And therefore as we have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore sundry times promised in testimony of the sincerity of our proceedings, and of our great desire to preserve the Amity inviolable between us, and the whole House of <hi>Austria;</hi> that in case our Son in Law would not be governed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by us, that then we would not onely forsake him, but take part and joyn our forces with the Emperors against him. So you may fairly represent unto that King, That in like manner we have reason to expect the same measure from him: That upon the Emperors aversness to a Cessation, and Accommodation, he will likewise actually assist us for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dignity to our Son in Law, as it hath been often times intimated from <hi>Spain.</hi> Yet our meaning is to carry all things fair with that King, and not to give him any cause of distrust or jealousie, if you perceive that they intend to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> go really and roundly on with the Match: Wherein nevertheless we must tell you, That we have no great cause to be well-pleased with the diligencies used on that part, when we observe that after so long an expectance of the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon which the whole business, as they will have it, depends, there is nothing yet returned but Queres and Objections.</p>
                  <p>We have thought fit to let you know, how far we are pleased to enlarge our self concerning those points demanded by the Pope: And further then that, since we cannot go without much prejudice, inconvenience, and dishonor to our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> self, and our Son; we hope and expect that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> will bring it instantly to an issue without further delay, which you are to press with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and earnestness: But if respite of time be earnestly demanded, and that you perceive it not possible for them to resolve until an answer come from <hi>Rome,</hi> We then think it fit, that you give them two moneths time after your Audience, that we may understand that Kings final Resolutions before <hi>Christmas</hi> next at the furthest.</p>

                  <p>His Majesty never looked to the rising or falling hopes of his Son in Laws fortunes, but kept in the same course that seems most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Honor and Justice, and the Peace of Christendom.

                  <p>And whereas the Pope would know what <hi>Bonum Publicum</hi> will be granted, We remit it to your Conscience, whither the favors daily granted to Catholicks, which the King resolves to continue, if not to increase, be not a real publick good, considering if the Match break off, his Majesty will be importunately urged by his people, to whose assistance he must needs have recourse, to give life and execution to all Penal Laws, now hanging over the heads of Catholicks.</p>

            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> provoked by the continual progress of these Indignities, was impatient of staying for a Reply from <hi>Spain</hi> to his former Letters,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35668:49"/>
but seconded those Resolutions with a vehement new dispatch, the Third of <hi>October,</hi> in a peremptory stile, as it well became him; Commanding the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> to let that King understand how sensible he was of the Emperors proceedings towards him; and withal, not a little troubled to see that the <hi>Infanta</hi> at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> having an absolute Commission from the Emperor, to conclude a Cessation and Suspension of Arms, should now at last, when all Objections were answered, and the former solely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Obstacles removed, not onely delay the Conclusion of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but refuse to lay her Commands upon the Emperors Generals for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> abstaining from the Garisons, during the Treaty, upon a pretext of want of Authority: So as for the avoiding of further dishonor, he hath been forced to recal both his Ambassadors, as well the Chancellor of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer from <hi>Bruxels,</hi> as also the Lord <hi>Chichester,</hi> whom he intended to have sent unto the Emperor to the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He further enjoyned his Ambassador, That having delivered his sense of things, he should demand of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> a promise under his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Hand and Seal, that the Town and Castle of <hi>Heidelburgh</hi> shall be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Palatine</hi> within seventy days after the Audience, and the like for <hi>Manheim</hi> and <hi>Frankendale,</hi> if they be taken. That within the said term of seventy days a Suspension of Arms in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> be concluded upon the Conditions last propounded by Sir <hi>Richard Weston</hi> at <hi>Bruxels</hi>; and that a general Treaty shall be again set on foot upon such honorable terms as were tendered to the Emperor in <hi>November</hi> last. But if these particulars be refused or delayed by the Emperor, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> shall joyn forces with the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> for the recovery of his Childrens Honors and Patrimony. And if he cannot give assistance, that he will at least allow him a free and friendly passage through his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories for the forces to be employed in that service.</p>
            <p>Of these points distinctly, if the Ambassador should not receive a direct assurance, he was to take his leave of that King, and to return into his Masters presence. But the King annexed this private Instruction, That in case a Rupture happened, it might be managed to the best advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Wherefore he should not instantly come away, but send him secret <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> intelligence, and in publick give out the contrary.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon these Demands, an Order was sent from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Bruxels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In the mean time <hi>Manheim</hi> is taken.</note> for the relief of <hi>Manheim,</hi> but it came too late; for before the arival thereof, the Town was yielded into the hands of <hi>Tilly:</hi> But had it come in season, the effect thereof might be guessed by <hi>Tilly</hi>'s Reasons presented to the Arch-Dutchess against raising the siege of <hi>Manheim,</hi> and the restoring of <hi>Heidelburgh,</hi> to this purpose.</p>

                  <p>The King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> doth finde himself at this time equally engaged in two businesses; the one is this Marriage, to which he is moved by the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies he findes in your Majesties friendship, by making an Agreement with those Catholicks that he thinks are secretly in his Kingdom; and by this to assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of them, as likewise to marry his Son to one of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the <hi>Infanta Donna Maria</hi> is the best born Lady in the World. The other business is, the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in which he is more engaged; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for beside that his Reputation is at stake, there is added the love and interest of his Grand-children, Sons of his onely Daughter: So that both by the Law of Nature and Reason of State, he ought to put that forward, whatever inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies might follow by dissembling what they suffer.</p>
                  <p>I do not dispute whither the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> be governed in this business of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> by Act or Friendship; I think a man might say he used both, but as a thing not precisely necessary to this Discourse, I omit it. I hold it for a Maxim, that these two Engagements in which he findes himself, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> are inseparable; for although the Marriage be made, we must fail of that which in my way of understanding is most necessary, the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being supposed, Having made this Marriage in that form as it is Treated, your Majesty shall finde your self, together with the King of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> engaged in a War against the Emperor and the Catholick League: A thing which to hear, will offend your godly ears, or declaring your self for the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35668:50"/>
Emperor, and the Catholick League, as certainly your Majesty will do, then you will finde your self engaged in a War against the King of <hi>England,</hi> and your Sister married with his Son; with the which, all whatsoever reasons of Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency that were thought upon in this Marriage, do cease. If your Majesty shall shew your self Neutral, as it may be some will propound; That, first, will cause very great scandal, and with just reason, since in matters of less opposition, then of Catholicks against Hereticks, the Arms of this Crown have taken the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part, against the contrary party; and at this time the Frenchmen fomenting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Hollanders against your Majesty, your Piety hath been such, that you have sent your Arms against the Rebels of that Crown, leaving all the great considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of State, onely because these men are Enemies to the Faith, and the Church.</p>
                  <p>It will oblige your Majesty, and give occasion to those of the League to make use of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and of other Catholick Princes ill-affected to this Crown; for it will be a thing necessary for them to do so: And those even against their own Religion, will foment and assist the Hereticks for hatred to us. Without doubt they will follow the other party, onely to leave your Majesty with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that blemish, which never hath be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King of <hi>England</hi> will remain offended and enraged, seeing that neither interest, nor helps do follow the Alliance with this Crown, as likewise with Pretext of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular resentment, for having suffered his Daughter and Grand-children to be ruined for respect of the said Alliance.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor though he be well-affected and obliged to us in making the Translation at this time, as businesses now stands, (the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being possessed of all the Dominions) although he would dispose all according to our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Conveniencies, it will not be in his power to do it, as your Majesty and every body may judge; and the Memorial that the Emperors Ambassador gave your Majesty yesterday, makes it certain; since in the List of the Soldiers, that every one of our League is to pay, he sheweth your Majesty, that <hi>Bavaria</hi> for himself alone, will pay more then all the rest joyned together; the which doth shew his power and intention, which is not to accommodate matters, but to keep to himself the Superiority of all in this broken time, the Emperor is now in the Dyet, and the Translation is to be made in it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Proposition in this estate, is by considering the means for a Conference, which your Majesties Ministers will do with their Capacities, Zeal, and Wisdom; and it is certain they will herein have enough to do. For the difficulty consists to finde a way to make the present estate of affairs straight again, which with lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring, as it is said, Both the power and time will be lost. I suppose the Emperor, as your Majesty knoweth by his Ambassador, desires to marry his Daughter with the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Son. I do not doubt but he will be likewise glad to marry his Second Daughter with the <hi>Palatines</hi> Son: Then I propound that these two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Marriages be made, and that they be set on foot presently, giving the King of <hi>England</hi> full satisfaction in all his Propositions for the more strict Union and Correspondency, that he may agree to it. I hold for certain, that all the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that would have followed the Alliance with us, will be as full in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Conveniencies in the great Engagement are more by this; for it doth accommodate the matter of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and Succession of his Grand-children with Honor, and without drawing a Sword, and wasting Treasure.

                     <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the onely means in my way of understanding to hinder those great dangers that do threaten, may accommodate the business, and not sever himself from the Conveniencies and Engagements of <hi>Bavaria</hi>; and after I would reduce the Prince Elector, that was an enemy, to the obedience of the Church, by breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sons in the Emperors Court with Catholick Doctrine.</p>

            <p>Such Consultations had the Catholick King in his Cabinet-Council, whilst he pretended so much zeal to a Closure with <hi>England:</hi> Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that King <hi>Iames</hi> professed to have taken great contentment in the Dispatches of the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> as full and satisfactory. And though the Order sent to the Archduchess for the Relief of <hi>Anheim</hi> arrived too late, yet he acknowledged it to be an argument of that Kings sincere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> intentions.</p>
            <p>But the Kings hopes were still deferred, and these Delays were palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the stop of the Dispensation, till the Pope were further satisfied in the time of the Childrens education under the Mothers government, and the exemption of Ecclesiastical persons from all Secular jurisdiction. And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not spare to stretch the Kings ductile spirit: For he was willing to stand obliged by a private Letter, that the Children should be kept under the Mothers wing till the age of Nine years; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he desired for Honors sake, that no more then Seven might be exprest in the Publique Articles.</p>
            <p>But this Enlargement would not satisfie; He must come up to the allowance of Ten years, which was the lowest of all to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; and so he was brought at length to wave his Honor, and to insure this Concession by a Publique Ratification. And for the Exemption of Ecclesiasticks from the Secular power; thus far he yielded, That the Ecclesiastical Superior do take notice of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that shall be committed, and according to the merit thereof, either by Degradation deliver him to Secular Justice, or banish him the Kingdom.</p>

Wherefore at the instance and perswasion of his Council, he was moved to urge the matter so, as to bring it to a sudden period: Not but that the precisest of them were always of opinion, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> if the Match were once concluded, the other business would be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to his satisfaction. Then was the Ambassador required to stir up that King to use all effectual means for diverting the Translation of the Electorate in the present Diet: Likewise to make him an offer of <hi>Frankendale</hi> by way of sequestration, upon condition of restoring it in the case as now it stands, whether the Peace succeed or not.</p>

were necessary in the first place ro remove the Obstacles, those extreme Executions in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which may make that people desperate, and which the Lutheran States following the Augustane Confession have their eyes upon. And though it be given out, that the severity there exercised is merely for private Justice, yet it is so linked with the Publique Cause, that unless it be speedily ended, and the two Churches in <hi>Prague</hi> again opened, and the free exercise of Religion permitted, they can see no sure Peace, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> desolation and ruine like to follow. And for the Prince Palatine, seeing he is already sufficiently punished, it were commendable in his Imperial Majesty to restore him, upon submission, to his Lands and Dignities; otherwise there is no likelihood of restoring Peace. And in transferring the Electorate, if it must be so, this main thing were to be considered, Whether the exclusion of the <hi>Palsgrave's</hi> person doth exclude his Children, who by the providence of their Ancestors, before this act of their Father, had an hereditary right thereunto: Or whether that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Prince's Brother, or other of the Kindred who have no way offended, should be in this case neglected? This will be ill resented by the other Electors and Princes allied to the <hi>Palatine,</hi> who have been quiet hitherto upon confidence of the Emperors clemencie; But perceiving all hopes of recovering the Electoral Dignity to their Family taken away, must needs have recourse to Arms.

                        <hi>The Pope's Letter to the Prince of</hi> Wales.</note>MOst Noble Prince, We wish you the health and light of Gods grace. Forasmuch as <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath always been fruitful in vertues, and in men of great worth, having filled the one and the other World with the glory of her renown, She doth also very often draw the thoughts of the Holy Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Chair to the consideration of her praises. And indeed, the Church was but then in her infancie, when the King of Kings did choose her for his inheritance, and so affectionately, that 'tis believed the <hi>Roman Eagles</hi> were hardly there before the Banner of the <hi>Cross.</hi> Besides that, many of her Kings instructed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in the knowledge of the true salvation, have preferred the Cross before the Royal Scepter, and the Discipline of Religion before Covetousness, leaving examples of piety to other Nations, and to the Ages yet to come: So that having merited the Principalities and first places of blessedness in Heaven, they have obtained on Earth the triumphant ornaments of Holiness. And although now the state of the English Church is altered, We see nevertheless the Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> adorned and furnished with Moral vertues which might serve to support the charity we bear unto her, and be an ornament to the name of Christianity, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> withall she could have for her defence and protection the Orthodox and Catholick truth. Therefore by how much the more the glory of your most Noble Father, and the apprehension of your Royal inclination delights us, with so much more zeal we desire that the gates of the Kingdom of Heaven might be opened unto you, and that you might purchase to your self the love of the Universal Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:35668:53"/>Moreover, it being certain that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great of most blessed memory hath introduced to the people of <hi>England,</hi> and taught to their Kings the law of the Gospel, and the respect of Apostolical authority; We, as inferior to him in holiness and vertue, but equal in name and degree of dignity, think it very reasonable, that we following his blessed footsteps, should endeavor the salvation of those Provinces, especially at this time when you design (most Noble Prince) elevates us to the hope of an extraordinary advantage. Therefore as you have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> directed your journey to <hi>Spain</hi> towards the Catholick King, with desire to ally your self to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> We do commend your design, and indeed do testifie openly in this present business, that you are he that takes principal care of our Prelacy: For seeing that you desire to take in marriage the Daughter of <hi>Spain,</hi> from thence we may easily conjecture, that the antient seeds of Christian piety which have so happily flourished in the hearts of the Kings of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> may (God prospering them) revive again in your soul. And indeed it is not to be believed, that the same man should love such an Alliance, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hates the Catholick Religion, and should take delight to oppress the Holy Chair. To that purpose we have commanded that most humble prayers be made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to the Father of lights, that he would be pleased to put you as a fair Flower of Christendom, and the onely Hope of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in possession of that most noble Heritage which your Ancestors purchased for you, to defend the authority of the Soveraign High-Priest, and to fight against the Monsters of Heresie. Remember the days of old, enquire of your Fathers, and they will tell you the way that leads to Heaven, and what way the Temporal Princes have taken to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> attain to the everlasting Kingdom. Behold the gates of Heaven opened! The most holy Kings of <hi>England,</hi> who came from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> accompanied with Angels, did come to honor and do homage to the Lord of Lords, and to the Prince of the Apostles in the Apostolical Chair; their actions and their examples being as so many voices of God, speaking and exhorting you to follow the course of the lives of those, to whose Empire you shall one day attain.</p>
                  <p>Is it possible that you can suffer that the Hereticks should hold them for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> impious, and condemn those whom the faith of the Church testifies to reign in the Heavens with Iesus Christ, and have command and authority over all Principalities and Empires of the Earth? Behold how they tender you the hand of this truly happy Inheritance, to conduct you safe and sound to the Court of the Catholick King, and who desire to bring you back again into the lap of the Roman Church; beseeching with unspeakable sighs and groans the God of all mercy for your salvation, and do stretch out to you the arms of the Apostolical charity to embrace you with all Christian affection, even you that are her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Son, in shewing you the happy hope of the Kingdom of Heaven. And indeed, you cannot give a greater consolation to all the people of the Christian world, then to put the Prince of the Apostles in possession of your most noble Island, whose authority hath been held so long in the Kingdom of <hi>Britain</hi> for the defence of Kingdoms, and for a Divine Oracle. The which will easily come to pass, and that without difficulty, if you open your heart to the Lord that knocks; upon which depends all the happiness of that Kingdom. It is from this our great charity, that we cherish the praises of the Royal Name, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which makes us desire that you and your Royal Father may be stiled with the names of Deliverers and Restorers of the antient and paternal Religion of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is it we hope for, trusting in the goodness of God, in whose hands are the hearts of Kings, and who causeth the people of the earth to receive healing, to whom we will always labour with all our power to render you gracious and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35668:54"/>
favorable. In the interim take notice by these Letters of the care of our charity, which is none other then to procure your happiness: And it will never grieve us to have written them, if the reading of them stir but the least spark of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith in the heart of so great a Prince; whom we wish to be filled with long continuance of joy, and flourishing in the glory of all Vertues.</p>

                        <p>RIght honorable, we wish you health and the light of Gods grace.

                        <p>WE have received your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with no less thankfulness and respect, then is due to the singular good will and godly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherewith we know it was written.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> It was most acceptable unto us, that the never enough Renowned Examples of our Ancestors were proposed to us by your Holiness for our inspection and imitation; who though they often hazarded their lives and fortunes to propagate the Christian Faith, yet did they never more chearfully display the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Banners of the Cross of Christ against his most bitter enemies, then we will endeavor to the utmost, that the Peace and Union which so long triumphed, may be reduced into the Christian World, after a kinde of Elimination or Exile. For since the malice of the Father of Discords hath sowed such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Divisions amongst those who profess the Christian Religion, We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this most necessary thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote with better success, the glory of God and Christ our Saviour; nor shall we esteem it less honor to tread in their footsteps, and to have been their Rivals and Imitators in holy undertakings,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then to have been discended of them. And we are very much encouraged to this, as well by the known inclination of our Lord and Father, and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent desire to lend a helping hand to so pious a work, as by the anguish that gnaws his Royal brest, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders what cruel destructions, what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> deplorable calamities arise out of the dissentions of Christian Princes. Your Holiness conjecture of our desire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract an Alliance and Marriage with a Catholick Family and Princess, is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35668:55"/>
agreeable both to your Wisdom and Charity; for we would never desire so vehemently to be joyned in a strict and indissoluble Bond with any Mortal whatsoever, whose Religion we hated. Therefore your Holiness may be assured, That we are, and always will be of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Moderation, as to abstain from such actions which may testifie our hatred against the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we will rather embrace all occasions whereby through a gentle and fair procedure all sinister suspitions may be taken away; That as we all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess one Individual Trinity, and one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Christ Crucified, we may unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously grow up into one Faith. Which that we may compass, we little value all Labor and Watchings, yea, the very hazard of our lives. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that we render thanks to your Holiness for your Letter, which we esteem as a singular present, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wish your Holiness all prosperity and eternal happiness.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, he assured the King, That such difficulties as were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spent, and were yet to come, have been laid hold on by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals; neither to frustrate, nor prolong this Treaty, but ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes clogged.</note>So the long solicited Dispensation came from Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, to the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi> But whereas it was expected full and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, it came with a Clog, a Clause thrust in of purpose to retard the proceedings.</p>
            <p>That whereas there were certain Articles condiscended unto by the King of <hi>England,</hi> in favor of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in his Dominions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Caution should be given for the performance of those Concessions. The King answered, That he could give no other Caution, then his own and the Princes Oath, exemplified under the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But this would not satisfie, unless some Sovereign Catholick Prince would stand engaged for them. Hereupon the frame of things was like to fall a sunder, and a rumor went, that the Prince intended to get away covertly.</p>

                  <hi>Olivares</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses ways of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Amidst the heats of this dispute, <hi>Olivares</hi> (whither in a humor or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> good earnest) propounded three ways of accomodation: The first was, That Prince <hi>Charls</hi> should become Catholick. The second, That the <hi>Infanta</hi> should be delivered to him upon the former security, without further condition. The third was, to binde him as fast as they could, and not trust him with any thing. And of these three ways, he said, The two former were good, but the last was a bad one.</p>

               <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Spain</hi> proffers to engage himself on the behalf of the King of <hi>England</hi> and the Prince.</note>At length the King of <hi>Spain</hi> proffered to engage himself by Oath on the behalf of the King and Prince for the performance of the Articles.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Provided, That he first consult with his Ghostly Fathers, whither he might do it with a safe Conscience. This was a fair contrivance, whereby that King might not onely oblige our King and Prince, but lay the ground-plot of a fair pretence of War against <hi>England,</hi> if the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks received not satisfaction in the enjoyment of the Freedom promised. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides he would form a party in these Dominions to a Dependance upon his Protection.</p>

And in case the King of <hi>England</hi> fail to execute what was stipulated, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was to vindicate his Oath, and right himself by the Sword.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:35668:56"/>Then was the Match declared publickly, and the Prince had frequent access to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> yet always in a publick manner, and in the Kings presence.<note place="margin">The Match is declared pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.</note>

            <p>Whilest these things were forging in <hi>Spain,</hi> there were not wanting such as warned the King, and tendred safer Counsels. The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was bold to press him close in this serious Letter.</p>

                  <p>To address this poor discourse to your Lordships more particular: Kings have almost ever used to have their Favorites: <hi>Alexander</hi> had long since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his <hi>Ephestion,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France</hi> of late his <hi>Espernon,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> had since his <hi>Lermas.</hi> Yea, the best Princes have not wanted them: For after the reckoning of <hi>David's</hi> great Officers, <hi>Hushai</hi> the Archyte is called the Kings <hi>Friend,</hi> and <hi>Ira</hi> the Iarite is set down to have been <hi>Chief</hi> about <hi>David.</hi> Which stands to Reason, and agrees with Nature: For every private man is left to affect as he likes; neither can Affection be forced. Now to disallow or confine that in a King, which is left at liberty in the meanest Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, were preposterous and injurious: For though they command Nations as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they are Kings, yet they are subject to their Passions as they are men. And if I may alleadge it without misinterpretation of others, as I am free from ill meaning my self, Who knows but <hi>Christ,</hi> the rather to shew himself a Natural man, expressed so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is Gods blessing, and your happiness, if you account it so, to be the Kings Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. As <hi>Peter</hi> therefore not presuming to ask Christ who it was he spake of, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> beckoned to the Disciple whom Iesus loved, on whose breast he leaned, to ask for him; so since most men neither may, or ought to be so bold to ask or advise the King in this business so much spoken of, yet they point at you, who the higher you are in the Kings favor, the more you are in the Peoples eye and observation, and they expect you will not be wanting in the duty of a Subject, a Councellor, and a Favorite. We do not read of any servant almost better respected of his Lord and Master, then <hi>Eliezar</hi> of <hi>Damascus,</hi> whom <hi>Abraham</hi> had meant, had he died childless, to have made his heir; and we read not of any service he did <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> more, at least greater, then in choice of a Wife for his son <hi>Isaac.</hi> Among the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of our Patriarch, the Defender of our Faith, we observe none better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected then your self; For the King hath manifested, he loves not your person only, but takes care for your soul, and labors to make you as good as great, and as happy in another world, as high in this: Yet we know not wherein you can do him better service, then with <hi>Eliezar</hi> to help to choose a <hi>Rebeccah</hi> for our hopeful Prince.</p>

                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:35668:60"/>We have not heard <hi>(said he)</hi> of any Protestant King that ever married with a contrary Religion, save the last <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Navar</hi> with the last <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> of <hi>France</hi>: which Marriage so unfortunate to the parties (having never Issue) and being afterwards divorced, was also so fatal to our Religion, that there was more Blood spilt at those Nuptials, then Wine spent: For while the Protestants dreamed of the glory and security they should have by the Match, they were most miserably massacred. And who doubts but what the <hi>French</hi> Papists committed in their own Country upon that colour and occasion, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>Spanish</hi> Papists would be glad to see done in this Kingdom upon the like? For without breach of charity we may doubt of their sincere meaning, though there be a Treaty of a Match: since in <hi>Eighty Eight,</hi> even while there was a Treaty of Peace, their <hi>Armado</hi> came upon us.</p>
                  <p>Again, we shall find it was forbidden in the best people in the world, to marry with a differing Religion. The injunction, the reason, and the effect are laid down in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if we descend to our own Books and Chronicles, we shall find that God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hath crossed (if not cursed) our alliance and association particularly with the Spanish Nation; the position of that Country, and the disposition of that People being as it were so malignant and ill-agreeing with us. The Prince of the greatest performance that ever this Kingdom or Christendom had, was the <hi>Black Prince:</hi> Yet our Chronicle records, that going into <hi>Spain</hi> to settle <hi>Don Pedro</hi> in that Kingdom, besides the monstrous ingratitude and peafidiousness of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who failed in the performance of those Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had promised, which caused the miserable Revolt in <hi>France</hi> to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> loss of our inheritance, the Prince was so poisoned in that Country, that he never had his health after.</p>
                  <p>Moreover he beseeched his Lordship to observe, that all the Marriages which the Heirs and Princes of this Crown have made in <hi>England</hi> for these last six-score years, except the several second Matches of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, have been onely and no-where else but with <hi>Spain</hi>; which how little God hath blest, the success shews. Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> married the Spanish Kings daughter: We know God took him away suddenly within a very small time, and without any issue.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> In a Politick respect, we would yet make a second Match; so Prince <hi>Henry</hi> (afterwards King) married the same daughter: But doubtless God was less pleased with that Match, which was less lawful; and therefore God took away all the male-children of it, and left only a daughter, in whose short Reign was shed more blood for the true Religion in six years, then for the false in these succeeding sixty years. We made then a third Adventure and Marriage with <hi>Spain,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> with King <hi>Philip:</hi> which was so discontenting to the People, that it caused <hi>Wyats</hi> Rebellion; so discomfortable to the Queen, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> brake her heart, being left and neglected of her Husband; and so dishonorable and prejudicial to the Kingdom, that merely for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> sake, we having no difference at all with <hi>France,</hi> we lost <hi>Calis</hi> in six days, which had been above two hundred years in our possession.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He added lastly,</hi> Though I have not so much judgment, nor so little wit as to presume to advise where to match; yet I assume so much, as to think, a Match at home cannot be held any ways inconvenient. We find the first and the last of our Kings that ever matched with their Subjects, were <hi>Ed. 4.</hi> and <hi>Hen. 8.</hi> From which two Matches, God (as it were to shew, the less we rely upon others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> abroad, the more he will help us himself at home) gave two daughters, two <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths,</hi> two such Queens, then which there were never two more blessed Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods glory and this Kingdoms good, by establishing Peace in the Land, and Religion in the Church, until his Majesties happy coming who brought both with him.</p>

               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:35668:60"/>The <hi>French</hi> were very jealous of the Conjunction between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and thought it the safest way to make peace at home, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their strength to bound the Incroachments of <hi>Spain</hi> and the House of <hi>Austria:</hi>

This benefit did the Kings closing with <hi>Spain</hi> procure to a people almost ruined.</p>
            <p>But after all the Kings concessions, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> contrived new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and proposed harder terms. The Pope had obliged the Catholick King to see the Conditions performed, and to protract the Marriage, till matters in <hi>England</hi> were in perfect execution. Whereupon the Divines advise that King, that the Promises of Marriage be made presently, but the Consummation thereof and the delivering of the <hi>Infanta</hi> be deferred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> till <hi>May</hi> the year following. And the death of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> did strengthen this contrivance: For the Spanish Ministers pretended, that in regard there was no Contract, but a Treaty only on foot, the Dispensation which lay in the Nuncio's hands was by the Popes death suspended, and a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from the new Pope was requisite before any further progress could be made.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Barberine</hi> was chosen Successor to <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fifteenth, and took the name of <hi>Urban</hi> the Eight. Soon after his election, he wrote these ensuing Letters, the one to King <hi>Iames,</hi> the other to Prince <hi>Charls.</hi>

When the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> which hath brought forth famous Kings to earth, and most holy Citizens to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was under our protection whilst we were yet Cardinal, it afforded us plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matter of joy and sorrow. We were exceeding joyful when we considered, that the faith of the Roman Church hath happily triumphed in that Country which the Roman Armies could never conquer; and that there was never yet King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who died an Enemy to the Popes authority. But our harp was turned into mourning, when we cast our eyes flowing with tears upon the miseries of the present times; For you seem (while the Father of discords is active) to have forgotten him who nourished you, and to have made sad your nurse Ierusalem. Wherefore the Apostles seat which brought forth that people to Christ, is pierced with sorrow, while it beholds so famous an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35668:61"/>
to be given away to strangers, and measure the greatness of its loss by the praises of the British Kings, and the glory of those Dominions. But this above all ought most to be lamented by the Christian world, that King <hi>James,</hi> the offspring of Catholick Kings, and the Son of a most holy Mother, should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dissent from the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and from his own Ancestors in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worship. For if those eminent parts which you a most famous Prince have polished with Learning and Arts of Prudence, would assent to the Father of lights illuminating the Christian world, We easily apprehend how much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it would conduce to the Publick peace, that being King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> you should join in one Kingdom those Nations and Islands divided either by the bars of the Mountains, or by the depths of the Ocean. For your Majesty seems for that very reason to be made Lord of so many Provinces, that they might more easily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and quickly receive healing and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from him whom they obey. Wherefore we even then besought God by continual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and joy to the Church. A blessed hope from above not long ago shined upon us, when we understood that you were desirous of a Catholick alliance, and that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We can scarcely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> how much joy <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of blessed memory, our Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, brought us, when he made us one of the Congregation of those Cardinals whom he would have to take cognisance of the <hi>English Match:</hi> While we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of a matter of so great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we expressed a singular propension <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of mind towards your Majesty, and were both tender of your praises, and desirous to provide for your happiness. And now being by the consent of the Apostolical Senate advanced to this station, where
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35668:61"/>
we are to watch and ward for all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monarchs, we cannot sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what a care and desire we have of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the honor of so great a King. It seems to have been a special providence of God, that the first Letters which we received reigning in the seat of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> were those which the most noble <hi>Charls</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> wrote to our Predecessor, as a testimony of his affection to the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> And since we now desire that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Marriage should by the blessing of God be perfected, we resolved to write unto you, without expecting Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters first from you; for Charity is the honor of the Papal Empire; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though most powerful Kings do homage to us in this seat, yet we account it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious (charity so perswading) to descend to humble prayers, so that we may gain souls to Christ. First therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to perswade your self, that there is no Prince in the Christian world, from whom you can expect more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of fatherly affection then from the Pope, who desires to embrace you a most desired Son with the arms of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical charity. We know with what a Letter <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fifteenth excited you to obtain so great a glory; And since we have succeeded him, we will not only imitate his inclinations towards you, but will exceed them. We hope we shall shortly have news out of <hi>England,</hi> that your Majesty is favorable to the Catholick interest; and that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks who live there, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies hath vindicated into the liberty of the sons of God, being freed from the fear of punishment, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy your Royal protection. He who is rich in mercy, will reward such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with some signal happiness: The Kingdoms of the Earth will applaud your Majesty, and the Host of Heaven will wage war for you: Though sinners gnash their teeth, and Impiety powerful to raise sedition threaten, yet <hi>Europe</hi> hopes she shall see King <hi>James</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in the Roman Church, and increasing the example of his Ancestors by new works of Piety. We do not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35668:62"/>
distrust that the time of Gods good pleasure is now at hand, when they who recommend to History the praises of the British Religion, shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways speak of the deeds of another Age, but may be able to propose the present Government as a pattern of imitation to the Ages following. Your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Ancestors call upon you, who have left you so powerful and so famous an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; who believed that the gates of the kingdom of Heaven were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mankind with the Popes keyes. Certainly it cannot be, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty should dare either to contemn or condemn the belief of so many Ages,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and the judgment of so many Kings, who have deserved well of you. Do you not see, that by your Majesties opinion they are deprived of Heaven, who left you a Kingdom, while you contend that they erred in the worship of their Religion? By this means it would be, that whom the Universal Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be Citizens of Heaven, and to reign as Coheirs with Christ in that everlasting Country, you who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended of them should snatch them out of Heaven, and thrust them into the bottomless pit of Error, and the prison of hellish torments. Do you not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your bowels yearn at the thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of so ungrateful an offence? Are not such deliberations repugnant to your Royal temper? which nevertheless so many Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> are forced to reprehend, while it dissents from the Seat of the Apostles. Let the splendor of so great glory allure your eyes, which looks out of Heaven upon you, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> reaches you out a hand ready to reduce by your means the Kingdom of <hi>Britain</hi> into the Sanctuary of God, with the conduct of Angels and acclamations of men. A long time ago, Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion lay all along in the world squalid and deformed with anguish, affrighted with the threats of Tyrants: But that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Emperor whom we owe to <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Constantine</hi> the Great, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Popes authority, and the Avoucher of the Roman Faith, did not only bring her out of her lurking places,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35668:62"/>
but called her to an Empire. He is a fit pattern of imitation for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; not those Kings who have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed and dissipated the Everlasting Covenant. We call you, O most wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Son, from this Watch-Tower of the World, into the Society of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Glory: Adde one day to your past years, which all posterity may celebrate with a grateful memory.

                        <p>MOst Noble Prince, we wish you health and the light of Gods Grace. The first Letters which were delivered to us after we were preferred to the Throne of the Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, were those which you sent out of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fifteenth of famous memory, our Predecessor. We <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> listed up our hands to Heaven, and gave thanks to the Father of Mercies, when in the very entry of our Reign, a British Prince began to perform this kinde of obeissance to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> We have been a long time fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to <hi>England</hi> by a natural bent and inclination, whence it came to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> pass that your Scotchmen recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to our especial Trust and Patronage in this Assembly of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and Country of all Nations, while we were yet Cardinal. When we undertook the protection of so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Kingdom, we did often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Exploits of your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the Elogies of the British Islands; and by how much former ages did represent them more glorious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>y: And seeing the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> your Father, loveth no less the glory of Learning, then that of Might and Power; we have always heartily wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above what we are able to express, that God would be pleased to put into his hand some eminent occasion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to oblige mankinde, and obtain an eternal Inheritance. And now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the time is come to enjoy our wishes, since you seem at present to open the way for so great a fame to your most Noble Father, a Son begotten un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hope of the greatest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35668:63"/>
for we are of opinion, that your so vehement desire of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick marriage, is a certain voice of God calling you, and disposing all things sweetly. For it is not necessary that the Omnipotent should always thunder with the voice of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> because secret counsels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, directing men into the way of Salvation, are words by which the Eternal Wisdom speaks and declares the command of a Deity. Wherefore we have ever endeavored to the utmost of our power, that this Honorable Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, by the blessing of God, might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be finished. From hence you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that none could have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to this heighth of humane Affairs, from whom you may expect more expressions of good will or fruits of bounty. For your Ancestors which tamed Heretical Impieties, and not onely revered, but vindicated the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                           <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, do recommend you a most Noble Prince to the Papal Charity: For when Monsters of new Opinions broke into the Bulwarks of the Northern Ocean, they bridled the endeavors of the wicked with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some arms, and did not change the truth of God into a lye. And if you, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as you write, shall in good earnest glory more in the imitation of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, then that you are descended of Kings, we easily foresee how great joy to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and how great felicity to the British Kingdoms these words do promise, which deserve to be written in the Book of Life. Such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good turns, O most desired Son, the venerable Assembly of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Kings exacts and expects from you; whose actions without doubt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, who revolts from their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Catholick Kings of all <hi>Europe</hi> require this of you; for how can their Concord be the Vow of your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> care, as long as you dissent from them in a matter of the greatest import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that is, in the veneration of holy Rites? The <hi>Roman</hi> Church which <hi>England</hi> reverenced long ago, as the Mistress of Truth, whose belief
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35668:64"/>
you confess you hate not, desires forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to open unto you the Gates of the Heavenly Kingdom, and to bring you back into the possession of your Ancestors. Think that now in <hi>Spain</hi> you are become a spectacle to God and Men, and that you shall always be the desire and care of our Reign. Take heed most Noble Prince,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that the Counsels of those who prefer worldly interests before heavenly, do not obdure your heart. Make glad the Host of Heaven which will fight in your Camps; and return, O most wished for Son, into the embraces of the Church which desires you with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause and favor of Men and Angels; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that so rejoycing in your Marriage, we may sing with joy, The Lord hath reigned and put on comeliness. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you who desire the Marriage of a Catholick Virgin, ought to espouse the heavenly Bride, with whose beauty <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> the wisest of Kings, boasts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to have been enamored. For this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is the Wisdom by which Kings reign, whose Dowry is the splendor of Glory, and an eternal Principality, and your Ancestors sought her in the Sanctuary of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, severed from the contagion of the World, and reposing in the Wisdom of God. We who write to you this Exhortation, and testifie our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Papal Charity, desire to have your name renowned in the Histories of all Ages, and that you may be recorded amongst those Princes, who deserving well on Earth of the Kingdom of Heaven, are become the example of Vertue to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, and the measure of wishes. We beseech the Father of Lights, that this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> blessed hope by which he promiseth us the return of so great a Prince, by the conduct of the Holy Ghost, may forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fructifie and bring Salvation to Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and joy to all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World.</p>

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:35668:64"/>Notwithstanding this great business of State began to look with an ill aspect, by the concurrence of various Passages tending to a Rupture of the Treaty.<note place="margin">The Treaty begins to tend to a rupture.</note> In <hi>England</hi> the Spanish Ambassadors demands grew high and peremptory; yet the King to give them content, directed the Lord Keeper and other Commissioners to draw up a Pardon of all Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces past, with a Dispensation for those to come, to be granted to all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks obnoxious to any Laws against Recusants; and then to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> issue forth two General Commands under the Great Seal of <hi>England:</hi> The one to all Judges and Justices of Peace; and the other to all Bishops, Chancellors, and Commissaries, not to execute any Statute against them.</p>
            <p>The General Pardon was passed in as full and ample manner as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves could desire,<note place="margin">The Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Judges and Bishops, in behalf of the Catholicks suspended.</note> or pen it: But to that vast Prohibition to the Judges and Bishops, some stop was made by the Advice of the Lord Keeper, for these Reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> First, Because the publishing of this General Indulgence at one push, might beget a General Discontent, if not a Mutiny; but the instilling thereof into the peoples knowledge by little and little, by the favors done to particular Catholicks, might indeed loosen the Tongues of a few particular persons, who might hear of their Neighbors Pardon, and having vented their dislikes, would afterwards cool again; and so his Majesty might with more conveniency by degrees inlarge his favors.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because to forbid the Judges against their Oaths, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Justices of Peace, who are likewise sworn to execute the Law of the Land, is a thing unpresidented in this Kingdom, and would be a harsh and bitter Pill to be digested without some preparative.</p>
            <p>The two Ambassadors with much ado consented, That the matter should rest till the end of Six Moneths, or the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s arival; yet they did it with a shew of discontent, as if the King performed nothing. The disaffection of these Ministers was supposed to be one rub in the way of this Alliance.<note place="margin">Some of the English in <hi>Spain,</hi> dislike the Match and Religion.</note> And on the other side, some of the Princes followers in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Spain,</hi> being zealous of the Protestant Religion, disliked the Match, and shewed their aversness to it. Sir <hi>Edmund Verney</hi> struck an English man, a <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctor, a blow under the Ear, for visiting and laboring to pervert one of the Princes Pages, who was sick of a mortal Feaver. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers derided the Popish Ceremonies, and Spanish Garb, and slighted the Country, and some committed irreverent actions in the Kings own Chappel. Hereupon they began to disgust the English, and to rail at <hi>Gondomar</hi> for informing the King and State, That the Prince might be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> made a Catholick. Moreover those many Irish that subsisted by Pensions from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> did no good offices; and the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Ambassadors in that Court, were conceived not to be idle: But there were greater things then these.<note place="margin">The Duke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusted in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Princes Companion and Guardian, was much disrelished by the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi> His French garb, the height of his spirit, and his over-great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with the Prince, were things opposite to the way, and temper of that grave, sober, and wary people. And the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> took <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> exceptions, that he should come with such a superintendent power in that great affair, among so many grave Statesmen, to the prejudice of so able a Minister as the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> who had laid the first stone in that build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Whereupon his power was called in question, and found imperfect, in regard it was not confirmed by the Council of <hi>England:</hi> Moreover, the Duke lay open to some affront, which inraged him sore against the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35668:65"/>
               <hi>Conde Olivares</hi>; and things grew to that extremity between the Duke and that Kings Ministers, that they did not stick to say, That they would rather put the <hi>Infanta</hi> headlong into a Well, then into his hands. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, in the Prince himself they observed an extraordinary well staid temper and grave comportment.</p>

For in all occurrences the Prince closed with him, and seemed to give him a large room in his heart.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Immediately the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> sent dispatches into <hi>England,</hi>

                  <hi>Bristol</hi> in a Letter gives the Prince a good account of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to satisfie the King and Prince in all things touching the Marriage: And shewing, that he had exactly set down the Case, how a Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed, may before the consummation of Marriage, betake her self to a Religious life, and all the sorts of Security for the preventing of such a course; and that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Sister, and all his Ministers do offer all security that may stand with decency and honor, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the whole agreement. And though the point of portion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> were a tough and knotty peece, yet when by the original Papers and <hi>Consulto</hi>'s of the last King, the <hi>Iuncto</hi> found it to be no less then Two Millions, they resolved to make it good; notwithstanding they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged that this sum was four times as much as ever was given in Money with any Daughter of <hi>Spain.</hi> Moreover he did woo the Prince by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That as the King his Father, so himself had thought this to be the fittest Match in all the World: And though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many Errors, yet he had already passed them by, and overcome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the main difficulties: That by his Journey he had satisfied himself of the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s person, who for her birth and portion, was no where to be matched; and for her vertue and setled affection to his Highnesses per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, deserved him better then any Woman in the World: That the Match was sure, the Portion and Temporal Articles now setled, but the delay of the <hi>Desponsorios</hi> will grieve the Princess, and bring a cloud of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust and jealousie upon the whole business. The personal distastes of Ministers indiscreet and passionate carriages should not hazard that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which hath been brought to the present State with so much cost, and pains, and patience; and which being well accomplished, will procure so much good to the Christian World, and contrariwise so much trouble and mischeif, if it should miscarry, and break to peeces. Now upon these Grounds and Motives he made intreaty, That with all speed a Post might be sent unto him, bringing Authority to deliver the Powers upon the arival of the Dispensation.</p>
            <p>But the Prince and <hi>Buckingham</hi> made haste to engage the King,<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> falls off, and for a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
               </note> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> making a plausible Narration of their own proceedings, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> delays, and <hi>Bristols</hi> miscarriages, drew him to alter the whole state of the Treaty. Hereupon the King sends an express command to <hi>Bristol,</hi> to deliver his thanks to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for the high entertainment, personal kindness, respect, and favor, received by his Son the Prince, who was returned so well satisfied, as that he was not able to magnifie it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently. And further to let him know, That to make a firm and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble union between their Families, Nations, and Crowns, and withal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> not to abandon his own Honor, nor at the same time to give joy to his only Son, and to give his onely Daughter her Portion in Tears, he had by the advice of that Kings Ambassadors entred into a Treaty for the Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; that he always understood and expected that upon the effecting of this Marriage, he should obtain the restoring of his Son-in-law, both to his Countrey and Dignity; and that the Emperor,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35668:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
either by sinding out some great Title, or by increasing the number of the Electoral Stiles, might satisfie the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> And for these Reasons the King commanded <hi>Bristol</hi> instantly to procure from that King, a punctual Answer touching the course he resolves to take, for the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and Electorate, and what assurance shall be given for his contentment, if the Emperor or Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> should oppose any part of the expected restitution. Moreover, he gave directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and signified his special desire, that the Espousals should be made in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> one of the <hi>Christmas</hi> Holidays, because that holy and joyful time would best become an action so notable and blessed.</p>

And the suspending of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the execution of the powers, till the validity of them be expired, is an effectual revoking of them: Besides, the pretexts of this delay are no new, but old matters, which were often under debate, but never insisted on to retard the main business. And it will be thought, that they should rather have hindered the Grant of these powers, then the execution of them being granted. Surely, a staggering in the former resolutions will be suspected, and the clearing thereof between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> will cost much time. As concerning the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> it was the care of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Spanish Ministers, that that business might be well compounded before the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s coming into <hi>England:</hi> For they say, that otherwise they might give a Daughter, and a War presently follow. Besides, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions given under his Majesties hand, were indeed to insist upon the restoring of the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> yet not so to annex it to the Treaty, as thereby to hazard the Match: For he seemed to be confident, that the one would never grow to a conclusion, without a setled resolution to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the other: And the Prince and Duke during their being in <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> observed the same course. Moreover the <hi>Palatinate</hi> affairs have relation to many great Princes interessed therein, and cannot be ended but by a formal Treaty, which will require a great length of time; and if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the Match should depend thereon, the Prince may be long enough unmarried, for the advancement of their interest who desire he should so continue, or not match with <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preparations for the Marriage go on chearfully, the Popes Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation is hourly expected, with an intention to demand the powers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and upon what pretext shall they be detained? Shall we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Majesties pleasure, that the solemnity be performed in the <hi>Christmas</hi> Holidays? But that is impossible, for the powers are then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. Shall we urge the restoring of the <hi>Palatine?</hi> This was not made a condition, but was treated as a business a part. The delay of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsario's</hi> will put a scorn upon the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who hath called himself the <hi>Infanta's Desponsado.</hi> And this cannot stand with that exact and honorable dealing which his Majesty hath hitherto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> used. Now upon these Inducements, in the result and close of all, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador humbly advised the King to return to the former state of the Treaty, and to nominate a day for the delivery of the Proxies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved somewhat to protract the time for the receiving of his Majesties further direction.</p>

For the most prosperous War hath misfortune enough to make the Author of it unhappy; and how innocent soever his Grace might be, yet the occasions which have been given him, will make him liable to such an aspersion. But if the Match proceed, and take effect, he will have the honor thereof, and the <hi>Infanta</hi> being duly informed, must needs acknowledge him to be the person unto whom, in that behalf, she is most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> obliged.</p>
            <p>But these Motions incensed <hi>Buckingham:</hi> And now having the Prince linked to him, he could over-rule the King, and bear down all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. The Prince and the Duke began to take a popular way, and to close with those of the Privy Council and the Nobility that were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to <hi>Spain,</hi> and best liked of by the Puritan party: They projected also the calling of a Parliament to consult the Nation, and to clear the Kings integrity, and to gain to themselves a great esteem in the hearts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the people.</p>
            <p>And some there were that suggested to the King,<note place="margin">Advice to the King touching the Duke.</note> that the Dukes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was to prevent the Princes Marriage, not onely with <hi>Spain,</hi> but any where else, that his own greatness might still be absolute. For, say they, were it love to his Countrey that led him to a breach and War with <hi>Spain,</hi> there was as much reason for a breach of the Match and Peace, when the Parliament urged it, as now there is. And they said, That the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliament was to marry the Duke to the Commonwealth, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> might stand not onely by the King, but by the people and popular humor, which of late he hath courted earnestly; and so they warned the King to have more special care of his own preservation.</p>
            <p>But the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> was straightly commanded to follow the new Instructions;<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the King to follow the new Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> namely, before he deliver the Powers, or move to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, to procure from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> either by Publick Act, or by Answer, under his Hand and Seal, a direct Engagement for the Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and the Electoral Dignity; by Mediation, or by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the assistance of Arms, if Mediation fail, together with a limitation of the time, when the way of Mediation shall determine, and the assistance of Arms begin. And the King declared, That he had reason infinitely to think it requisite to deal plainly and clearly with his Brother of <hi>Spain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Berkstrot</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the prime flower of his Son-in-laws Revenue, was taken by the Arms of <hi>Spain,</hi> and put into the possession of a Spanish Garison, or under their command; and the Countrey or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue thereof, was contrary to the Contract with the <hi>Infanta</hi> at <hi>Bruxels</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and upon an old pretence, freshly delivered into the hands of the Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> being none of those to whom Interest or Mediation had been formerly used, or thought of; who were onely the Emperor, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And concerning the Marriage Portion, he absolutely rejected both Jewels and yearly Revenue, as contrary to the first Agreement, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35668:68"/>
the Total sum in <hi>specie,</hi> at reasonable times of payment. As touching the Espousals, he commanded the Suspension of the Powers left, and sent the Powers renewed by the Prince, for a larger time, that no blame might light on him, or his Son, in case that King could not give satisfaction in so short a time, as that where in the former powers would become invalid. In the mean while he said he was ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound good ways to satisfie the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> in point of Title and Honor, and to continue the Negotiation for Matching the <hi>Palatines</hi> El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Son with the Emperors Daughter.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> had a difficult part to act in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> the Duke set all his strength to crush him. The Surrender of the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate</hi> to the Kings contentment was not probable, after it was ransacked and alienated, and as a common Booty shared in parcels to several Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> puts the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> in hope, by Proposal of new terms.</note>Nevertheless as yet the King hoped by Treaty to compose the whole business, and to satisfie the several Interests. And having by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> patience and industry reduced Matters to a Circle of lesser extent then the former generalities, tendered to the <hi>Palatine</hi> these terms of hope. In the first place, That he make a due submission to the Emperor under convenient Limitations, which shall first be granted in Conformity to that which is Noble, with Assurance requisite for the free and safe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and return of his Person and Train. And that this being done, a Present and full Restitution of all the <hi>Palatinate</hi> shall be made to the person of his Son, and that he himself shall be his Administrator during <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> life; and that after the death of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> his Son shall be established in the Electoral Dignity. Moreover, if the Marriage between his eldest Son, and one of the Emperors Daughters should take effect, it would ensure the enjoyment of all according to the present Contract, and make way for the bettering of the Conditions to his own person. In Contemplation of which Mariage, the other party have approached a degree nearer, to wit, That the Electorate shall return to his own person after the death of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> And as touching the many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> difficulties in the Treaty of this Mariage, to wit, The Education of his Son, he had devised a way for the satisfaction of parties, which was, That he should be brought up, neither at the <hi>Hague,</hi> nor in the Emperors Court, but with his own Son, the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and in the presence of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> after her arival in <hi>England.</hi> Upon these Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the King adviseth his Son-in-law to have recourse to his own Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and after mature deliberation, to make a choice agreeable to the honor and safety of his estates. And he delivered his own opinion, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a ready entrance into the possession of his own estate, with a kinde of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent liberty, and an assurance in time to recover more, was to be chosen rather then his present bare condition and hazardous expectation upon other uncertain means.</p>
            <p>Upon the tender of these Proposals, Letters of Consultation were sent to the King from his Son-in-law, and from Sir <hi>Dudley Carlton</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; who, for the greatness of his power, was to be courted and made a friend in all transactions.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Palatines</hi> Answer to those Terms proposed by the King.</note>To the submission in the first place required, reply was made, That in natural order, the Restitution which was material and substantial, ought to precede the same, which was but a point of Ceremony, or at least, it is necessary that all things be resolved, and setled in such assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances as shall be held convenient, otherwise a submission might be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35668:68"/>
yielded, and the Restitution never follow. Besides, if the Emperors intentions be sincere, and real, and without any aims to take advantage upon the <hi>Palsgraves</hi> person (as the Emperor, <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, did upon the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen,</hi> under the subtile distinction of a syllable in the safe conduct) the Submission might as well be made by a Deputy; by which means he might be freed from those apprehensions, which the Executions at <hi>Prague,</hi> and other cruelties used by the Imperialists, might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> impress in his minde. Moreover, a Submission under the specified Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of yielding the Electorate to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice his cause for ever: For the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who have always protested against the Translation, and the other Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> who have like-feeling, will disavow their own Protestations in regard of him who shall abandon his own pretensions; and instead of favoring him, may be made his enemies. The experience of things may shew what issue is like to follow a consent to the like Conditions; for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Emperor had manifestly abused him in two Overtures already.</p>
            <p>First, The Instrument signed for the Conditional Resignation of the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in the year One thousand six hundred twenty and one, serued the Emperor to accelerate the Treaty then on foot with <hi>Bethlem Gaber.</hi> Secondly, The Ratification of the Suspension of Arms the last Summer, served to intimidate the Electors of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> that they may not undertake any thing against the Emperor. For both the one, and the other, were for these very ends divulged by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> before any thing was therein concluded: And so will the Emperor make his advantage of the present Proposition, both to hinder the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of <hi>Gaber,</hi> and to continue the intimidation of the Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> Furthermore, in this Submission it were necessary to take care that his undue Proscription and Banishment, being to the prejudice of the Constitutions of the Empire, and held by the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> of no validity, may not be approved, and a mark of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy set upon the <hi>Palatine</hi> and his posterity. And lastly, shame and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> will be the end of this Submission, there being assurance of no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dealing then was used to the deposed House of <hi>Saxony</hi> by <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, an Emperor not worse then this; the heir of which House, being one of the worthiest Princes in <hi>Germany,</hi> is now in hard conditions before the eyes of the exiled <hi>Palatine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto the second point, the exclusion of the <hi>Palsgraves</hi> person, and the setling upon his Son, it was thus replied, That <hi>Spain</hi> had always gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hope, and the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> great assurance, even when the Marriage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was not so far advanced as now it is: That in case of the Emperors refusal, they would assist his Majesty, and compel the Emperor to an intire Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Besides, there is little ground of hope from these Treaties as they are managed, and wire-drawn by the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> from whom we have ever new Overtures in Winter, and new Ruptures in Summer: For the Emperor wanteth but two or three years leisure, which he will easily gain by a Treaty of Marriage to establish in <hi>Germany</hi> the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Electorate and <hi>Palatinate</hi> without any hope of Recovery: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Therefore sufficient Assurances should ever precede the Treaties: For the present Season did offer a very fair opportunity of recovering the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and Dignity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Palatines</hi> pretentions were not prejudiced by a long interposition of time, the memory of the undue proceedings in the Ban, and the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the seisure of his Inheritance are fresh in the mindes of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35668:69"/>
Princes, who by their own Interests are moved to a greater compassion. As for the hope of Restitution from the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> there is little reason to put a difference between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Imperialists, who have with joynt consent conspired the ruine of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> with the same Forces, Counsels, and Designs: And whilest things have been some times upon terms, and always in talk of an Accommodation, the Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is given to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and avowed by a Congratulatory Message from the Arch-Dutchess; the Upper <hi>Palatinate</hi> is setled in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>Bavarians</hi> possession, and a Portion allowed the Duke of <hi>Newburgh</hi> for his contentment. A principal part of the Lower <hi>Palatinate</hi> is given to the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> by the consent of those at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and the rest is promised to be parcelled among other Princes.</p>
            <p>Now for the hopes of a surer way to regain an happy settlement, by the Concurrence of the King, his Allies and Confederates, and the whole Protestant party in <hi>Europe</hi>; let these Matters be weighed in the Ballance of Common Judgment. The Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all the Princes save those of the Catholick League, have declared, That the Peace of <hi>Germany</hi> depends upon the restoring of the <hi>Palatine</hi>: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Levies which they made in the beginning of the last Summer, though by the unfortunate accident of Duke <hi>Christian</hi> of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> they were soon dismissed, do testifie the same affections still remaining in them, and the same Resolutions to embrace any good occasion for recovering the liberty of <hi>Germany.</hi> The number of those that have this conjoyned Interest, is great and mighty, yea, the greater part of the people, both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Horse and Foot, which marched under the Catholick Banner, were of a contrary Religion and Affection, and more inclined to the ruine, then preservation of the Catholick League. All that is wanting is the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and conduct of some great Prince that may support them against the House of <hi>Austria:</hi> The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> being a Prince full of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection, and being unwilling to enter into play alone, made answer to all instances, That as other Princes have their eyes on him, so he hath his eyes on the King of Great <hi>Britain.</hi> Wherefore, although for these two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or three years past Affairs on this side have gone in a continual decadence, and a final ruine be now threatned, unless it be withstood by some Princely resolution, not of petty but of great Princes; yet there is no such despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in the good party, but sufficient vigor yet remaining not onely to subsist, but to rise, and flourish again. And one of those Kingdoms which are in his Majesties possession having wrought great effects in the affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> even when counter-ballanced by the other two, doth demonstrate what may be done by the joynt forces of all three together, especially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> when the peoples affections are raised to the enterprise. Thus did the <hi>Palsgraves</hi> Counsels dissent from our Kings Proposals.</p>
            <p>And there were not wanting, both of the Kings Counsel at home, and of his Agents in Foreign parts, such as frequently warned him of the disappointment and dishonor that would follow those ways of Treating with implacable, though flattering Enemies; and shewed him the sure and honorable way of reestablishing his Children in their Patrimony; not by their Enemies curtesie, but by the united strength of the Protestant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Arms in all parts of Christendom, of which party, the King might have made himself the Head and great Commander.<note place="margin">The <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> appear ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Union with <hi>England.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>In the languishing, and almost expiring Condition of the Spanish Treaty, the United Provinces in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> appeared ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the opportunity of renewing the antient Union with <hi>England,</hi> in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35668:69"/>
all mutual confidence, and strong assurance. And the King was moved to return to those old Confederates, the surest supports of his Crowns and Family: For it hapned that in latter times, a distrust and strangeness had grown betwixt them. <hi>Bernevelt</hi> and the <hi>Arminian</hi> Faction had drawn the States to new Alliances, and commonly procured Answers to be given to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his Ministers, in a harsh and peremptory stile. In like manner the King did not care to own them fully, esteeming them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> an evil example for a Monarch to cherish. Nevertheless, he did them many good turns worthy of acknowledgment, and particularly in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Faction of <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Vorstius,</hi> and the rest of that sort, who caused great distractions in the Belgick Church and State: Nay, he was thought to have done more then requisite, in rendring the Cautionary Towns, and in conniving with too much patience at the insolencies and misdemeanors of their Mariners. But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> expressed good will to an intire friendship with <hi>England,</hi> and assured the English <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Resident at the <hi>Hague,</hi> That whensoever the King would be to those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was in her time, they would be the same to him, as they had been to Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> But as yet they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves reserved, because they suspect that the Introductions, and Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to a Union with them, have been to no other end, but to indear the English Merchandize, and to inhaunce its price to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> For they conclude, that <hi>Spain</hi> will never Match with <hi>England,</hi> but for hope, or fear; hope of reducing those Provinces by the Match, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fear, if the Match proceed not, that the King will joyn with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in opposition to <hi>Spain</hi>; and in either of these cases they hold the Match as made: As for themselves, they represent this assurance of a firm Conjunction; for that instead of giving an ear to Overtures and Concessions, which from day to day were presented to them, they have put themselves to the Offensive, by preparing a strong Fleet, which is ready to set sail to the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> to the end they may at least inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the peaceable Annual return of the Gold and Silver of those parts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by which the House of <hi>Austria</hi> do continually advance their greatness. And this preparation, together with their Voyages into the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> will make them irreconcileable to <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These enterprises were commended to the King, as approved by all good men, to be a principal means to cast down the fearful power of <hi>Spain:</hi> Onely it was too vaste a design for that little Countrey; but if the King were pleased thoroughly to close with them, their Affections and constant interest would so binde them to him, that he might abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dispose of them, and by their forces by Sea and Land, conjoyned with his own, be able to give the Law to <hi>Europe.</hi> And the present state of the Provinces might incite the King to this Conjunction. For the last Summer, if the Imperialists had joyned with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they had undoubtedly made an irruption into the borders of that State; and they are like to break in this next year, except some notable Turn shall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene; and then our best Link for a Bond of Friendship is broken, and those Provinces of a strong Staff will become a broken Reed.<note place="margin">The Ratifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Oath made to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> prepared for the Espousals, and a day was prefixed, and all things appointed for the Solemnity, according to the Magnificence of that Court. The <hi>Infanta</hi>'s Family was setled, her Officers distinguished, and the beginning of <hi>March</hi> was the time for her journey into <hi>England.</hi> From the Princes departure, she had applied her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the learning of the English Tongue. The English Ambassadors carried themselves like Subjects towards her, as being their Masters Wife, or Spouse. Many rich presents had she prepared for her future <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Lord and Husband. And the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> had provided many costly Liveries for his Attendants in the Solemnity of the Espousals. But all things were instantly discomposed by the opening of the new commands from <hi>England</hi> to the Earl, which were to procure an intire surrender of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and Electorate, before he move one step further towards the Contract.</p>
            <p>In the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> there was great resentment of these new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and they discerned a breach towards: The <hi>Infanta</hi> gave over the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> study of English, and was no more stiled the Princess of <hi>England</hi>; but to the Demands from <hi>England,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> replied, That if a Treaty be set on foot, and the Emperor, and Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> will not come to Terms of Conformity, he will joyn Arms with <hi>England,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>Palatinate:</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> confessing the Demand just, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable, professed, the <hi>Desponsorio</hi>'s past, the <hi>Infanta</hi> on her knees should have been a Suiter to the King to restore the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> making it thereby her act, and drawing the Obligation wholly to her. These <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> offers did not satisfie, <hi>Bristol</hi> was called home, and all was dashed to peeces.</p>
            <p>It was an amazement to the Christian World, that when the Match was brought to such perfection, the motion should be rejected by that side which pursued it with so much eagerness, and patience, as being the master-peece of all their designs.</p>

                  <hi>Olivares</hi> offers <hi>Bristol</hi> large Preferments in the Kings name, when he was to take his leave.</note> and the <hi>Conde Gondomar:</hi> That the King had received large advertisements with what malice and rancor his Enemies did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute him, and how powerful they are in <hi>England</hi>; And in regard that the Envy which was drawn upon him proceeded from his earnest endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to accomplish the Match, and that the particular fault laid to his charge was in point of delivering the Proxies deposited in his hands, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his Majesty takes it to heart, and judgeth himself touched in his honor, if for this cause his Enemies shall prevail so far as to work his ruine or disgrace; And therefore he will write to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and send a particular Ambassador, if it be needful, to mediate for him; for that he had served his Master with that exactness and fidelity, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served not only to be assisted by all good offices, but to be rewarded and published: And his Majesty, for the example of his own Subjects, and for the encouragement of all such as should serve their Princes with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> like loyalty, had sent him a Blank signed by himself, wherein he might set down his own Conditions both in point of Title and Fortune. And this he did in no wise to oblige another Princes Subject, but only to give encouragement to honest and faithful proceedings: And therefore he would not make these offers in private, but open and justifiable to all the world; and would accompany all that he should do with a Declaration or Patent, That what he had done for the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> was for the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity wherewith he had served his own Master.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Hereunto the Earl made answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bristols</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to those Profers.</note> That he was sorry and much afflicted to hear such language; And desired that they should understand, that neither this King nor <hi>Spain</hi> were beholding to him; For whatsoever he had done, he thought the same to be fittest for his Masters service and his own honor, having no relation to <hi>Spain</hi>; and that he served a Master, from whom he was assured both of justice and due reward; And nothing doubted but his own Innocencie would prevail against the wrong intended by his powerful Adversaries: And were he sure to run into imminent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> danger, he had rather go home and cast himself at his Masters feet and mercy, and therein comply with the duty and honor of a faithful Subject, though it should cost him his head, then be Duke or Infantado of <hi>Spain:</hi> And that with this resolution he would imploy the utmost of his power to maintain the Amity between the two Kings and their Crowns, and to serve his Catholick Majesty.</p>
            <p>After he had taken his leave and was ready to come away, he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Profer made unto him in private of Ten thousand Crowns to take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> with him in his purse, to make his way and go through with his troubles, if haply his own monies might be seised upon: And it was told him, no body should know it. Yes, said he, one would know it, who he was assured would reveal it to his Majesty, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> himself, and it would make him not so clear in his own heart as now he was; and so he refused the offer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:35668:71"/>The Match was now truly broken, but as yet the breach was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, nor the Treaty quite fallen to the ground, but continued after a languishing manner in the hands of Sir <hi>Walter Aston.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniards</hi> prepare for a War with <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> by all Advertisements from <hi>England</hi> were advised to expect a War, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they went seriously to work, and prepared themselves for what might happen; And <hi>Aston</hi> being there upon the place, conceived it high time that King <hi>Iames</hi> should resolve upon some course to allay the storm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising, or to go hand in hand with them in equal preparations. All that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was left alive of the Marriage-business, was no more, then that those Jewels which the Prince had left at his Farewel were not yet returned: But if the Letter then expected from <hi>England</hi> brought no better Answer to their last Offer concerning the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> then such as they had hither to received, they will return the Jewels, and declare the Marriage broken. For by this time they had received intelligence of the Princes treating a Marriage with a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> the Lady <hi>Henrietta Maria.</hi> And so it was, that King <hi>Iames</hi> had lately sent the Lord <hi>Kensington,</hi> afterwards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> to enquire covertly whether the Match were feasible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would enter into a Publick Treaty.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The L. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sington</hi> sent Ambassador into <hi>France</hi> to feel the pulse of that Court touching a Match, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his acceptance.</note>The Lord <hi>Kensington</hi> returned this Accompt of his Negotiation: That there appeared in the face of that Court an extraordinary sweetness, smoothness and clearness towards an Alliance with <hi>England</hi>; The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess herself was observed seldom to have put on a more cheerful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then she had done the first night of his appearance in that Court; The Queen, though a Daughter of <hi>Spain,</hi> wished this Match more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that intended with her own Sister; And the Queen-mother who will have the chief stroke in the business, expressed her good will and favor, as much as might stand with her Daughters honor. For the <hi>French</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the aspiring of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Monarchy of Christendom, and his approaches to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and his encompassing it on all sides; And they discern that an Alliance with <hi>England</hi> is the surest way to oppose the mightiness of that King: And upon the same accompt they promised brave assistance to the United Provinces, gave great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> and Duke <hi>Christian</hi> of <hi>Brunswick</hi>; A Gentleman of the Religion was sent to <hi>Liege</hi> to offer them the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, if that Town will seek it. Nevertheless they have not directly embraced this Overture of Marriage, because we have not as yet wholly abandoned the Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi>; lest they should lose the Friendship of a Brother-in-law, to gain another which may possibly fail them. But they say that their hearts are not capable of more content, then to see this Motion upon a Publick Commission, and all that may touch upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> way of <hi>Spain</hi> dissolved. Neither are they like to strain us to unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Conditions in favor of the Roman Catholicks in his Majesties Dominions: For in that matter their Pulse beats so temperately, as to promise a good <hi>Crisis</hi> therein: And in case his Majesty be drawn to banish the Priests and Jesuites, and to quicken the Laws against other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, to keep a good Intelligence with his Parliament, yet they say, they hope he will not tie his hands from some moderate favor to flow hereafter from the mediation of that State, which is all they pretend unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> for the saving of their honor, who otherwise would hardly be reputed Catholicks.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord <hi>Kensington</hi> having rendred an accompt of his diligence, advised to go on roundly with the Match, lest otherwise, though never so well affected, they be altered with the Arts of <hi>Spain:</hi> For (saith he)
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35668:71"/>
undoubtedly the King of <hi>Spain</hi> will resolve, if possible, to oblige one side; And as the <hi>French</hi> do think he may please <hi>England</hi> with the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> so we may think he will please the <hi>French</hi> with rendring of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to call a Parliament.</note> But without the assistance of Parliament, and compliance with the people, the King could not go through with those weighty works which he was now to take in hand. Now the things which troubled the People, were set forth to the King in three particulars: As, <hi>That for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> granted in the two last Parliaments, they received no retributions by Bils of Grace: That some of their Burgesses were proceeded against after the Parliament was dissolved: And that when they have satisfied the Kings demands, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless proceed to the conclusion of the Spanish Match.</hi> Hereupon some of his nearest Council perswaded him to begin the work by removing the peoples Jealousies; and to <hi>cast away some crums of his Crown amongst them, and those crums would work miracles and satisfie many thousands.</hi> And whereas the aim of the former Treaties was the setling of an universal peace in Christendom, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and since the malice of deceitful men hath crost those fair ways, abusing his Majesties trust &amp; goodness, he must cast about and sail by another point of the Compass, whereby he might securely and easily attain to his noble and pious ends. The means whereunto were these: First, that his Enemies know the <hi>Lyon</hi> hath teeth &amp; claws; Next, that he imbrace and invite a strict asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation and friendship with those, whom neighborhood, alliance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interest of State and Religion had joined to him. <hi>Feb.</hi> 19. the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment began at <hi>Westminster:</hi> The King being set in the Throne, spake thus.</p>

At the earnest instance of my Son, I was contented (although it was of an extraordinary nature) to send him to prosecute his desires in <hi>Spain,</hi> and for his more safety sent <hi>Buckingham</hi> (in whom I ever reposed most trust of my person) with him, with this command, <hi>continually to be present with him, and never to leave him till he returned again fafely unto me.</hi> Which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, though not with that effect in the busines that I expected, yet not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> altogether without profit; For it taught me this point of wisdom, <hi>Qui versatur in generalibus,</hi> is easily deceived, and that Generality brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to good issue; but that before any matter can be fully finished, it must be brought to particulars: For when as I thought the affair had been before their going, produced to a narrow point, relying upon their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propositions, I found when they came there the matter proved to be
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35668:72"/>
so raw, as if it had never been treated of; the generals giving them easie way to evade, and affording them means to avoid the effecting of any thing.</p>
                        <p>The particulars that passed in the Treaty, I mean not now to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to you, the time being too short; I refer you to <hi>Charls</hi> &amp; <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Secretaries Reports, who shall relate unto you all the particulars.

                        <p>It hath been talked of my remisness in maintenance of Religion, and suspition of a Toleration: But as God shall judge me, I never thought nor meant, nor ever in word expressed any thing that savored of it. It is true, that at times, for reasons best known to my self, I did not so fully put those Laws in execution, but did wink and connive at some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> things which might have hindred more weighty affairs; But I never in all my Treaties ever agreed to any thing to the overthrow and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing of those Laws, but had in all a chief preservation of that Truth which I have ever professed: And as in that respect I have a charitable conceit of you, I would have you have the like of me also. In which I did not transgress: For it is a good Horse-mans part, not always to use his spurs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and keep strait the rein, but sometimes to use the spurs and suffer the reins more remiss; so it is the part of a wise King, and my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> age and experience in Government hath informed me sometimes to quicken the Laws with strait executions, and at other times upon just occasion to be more remiss. And I would also remove from your thoughts all jealousies, that I might, or ever did question or infringe any of your lawful Liberties or Priviledges; but I protest before God, I ever intended you should enjoy the fulness of all those that former Times give good warrant and testimony of; which, if need be, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large and amplifie.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

                        <p>Your Majesty is <hi>Princeps Haereditarius,</hi> descended from both the Roses, and hath united both the Kingdoms: At your first entrance you wrought a wonder in the Tumult of our Cares, and Cloud of our Fears happening upon the death of the late Queen, by the bright beams of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> your Sunshine; which a Poet elegantly expressed, <hi>Mira cano, sol occubuit, nox nulla secuta est.</hi> There was a <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Hebron,</hi> and no <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> to disturb your peaceable entrance, but the Acclamations of all your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Commons concurring to express their great contentment.

These things I leave <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to your Majesties Royal remembrance as a duty to be practised, and to be expressed by our thankfulness to our holy God; for it is a good thing to be thankfull: <hi>Non est dignus dandis, qui non agit gratias pro datis.</hi>

                        <p>Since my designment to this place, I called to mind these Statutes of late times, and find two of especial note: The first of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which was called <hi>Parlamentum doctum,</hi> for the many good Laws made for the setling of Possessions: The other 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which by a reverend Divine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> was called <hi>Parlamentum pium,</hi> because the Subjects thereby were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to found Hospitals without Licence of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> or <hi>Ad quod damnum</hi>; And other charitable Laws which I omit, being not perpetual. And I likewise called to mind many glorious offers made by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and other good Provisions at the two last Meetings. Now your Majesty hath stretch'd forth your Scepter to call us to you again, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35668:73"/>
hath made a Declaration, that all jealousies and distractions might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the memory of Parliament-Nullities might be buried. And my desire is, that your Majesties influence may distill upon us, and you proceed in such a sweet harmony and conjunction, that <hi>Righteousness and Peace may kiss each other,</hi> and that <hi>Mercy and Truth may meet</hi>; and the World may say, <hi>Ecce quàm bonum &amp; quàm jucundum Regem &amp; Populum convenire in unum</hi>!</p>
                        <p>And for perfecting of this work, the good Bills against Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Informers and Concealers may now pass, and receive strength with a general, liberal, and Royal Pardon, according to the bounty of the late Queen: That so this Parliament may be called <hi>Felix, Doctum, &amp; Pium</hi>; which will be good to your Subjects, and no diminution to your Revenue, or derogation to your Prerogative, which in your Majesties hands is as a Scepter of gold, but in others hands is a Rod of iron. I need not speak in the praise of the Fundamental Common-Laws: <hi>Veritas temporis filia,</hi> Time hath sufficiently justified them. Monarchy is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> best Government; and of Monarchies, those which are hereditary. The best supply of your Majesties wants is in Parliament, where the Subject is bound by his own consent; other courses of Benevolence come heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Subjects enjoy the Gospel freely by your protection, and your Majesty may be safe in their Loyalty: Other safeties are but as <hi>Ajax</hi> his Shield, a weight rather then a defence. Their desire is, that the good Laws for Religion may be confirmed; and that the generation of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs, the Jesuites and Seminary-Priests, which were wont to creep in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> corners, and do now come abroad, may be by the execution of these good Laws, as with an East-wind, blown over the Sea. Our late Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> lived and died in peace; the Pope cursed her, but God blessed her: And so shall your Majesty, having God to your Friend, find safety in the Ark of true Religion, and when you are old and full of days, land you in Heaven; And then our hopeful Prince which sprang out of your own loins, shall sway that Scepter, which you must leave, to enjoy a Crown celestial: And God in his due time will restore the distressed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Princess, her Husband and Royal Issue, to that Inheritance which is now possessed by the usurping sword of their Enemies. Whereof we are the more confident, because that Country was heretofore a Sanctuary in our distress, when Religion was here persecuted. <hi>Cato</hi> was wont to say, <hi>Hoc sentio, &amp; Carthago destruenda est:</hi> But I say, <hi>Hoc sentio, &amp; Palatinatus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuperandus est.</hi>

But my desire is, as well in the beginning, as in all other our proceedings, our words may be <hi>vera, pauca, &amp; ponderosa.</hi>

                        <p>The Duke desired the Houses to take for truth what ever he should say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> granted and attested by the Princes presence; and declared, That
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35668:74"/>
this Letter was not put home to the uttermost by <hi>Bristol.</hi> Hereupon a Dispatch was sent away to my Lord of <hi>Bristol,</hi> expresly commanding him to press his Directions more home then yet he had done, and in case he should be denied or delayed by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> then to take his leave, and come away: This was not so fully exacted by my Lord of <hi>Bristol.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Porter</hi> that carried these Letters was commanded not to stay above Ten days, who after he had been there some Four or five days, and saw <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nothing towards a Dispatch, went himself to the <hi>Conde Olivares</hi> (having been his Creature) and desired him that he would speed his Dispatch; <hi>Olivares</hi> asked him what he would have? who replied, No more then what had been formerly promised; that in case the Emperor should deny the Restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should assist our King by Arms to recover it, or else give way to our Forces to March thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through his Countrey. <hi>Olivares</hi> replied, That this was a preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous demand; What to assist with Arms against the Kings Uncle, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Catholick League? <hi>Porter</hi> speaking to him of the Marriage of our Prince with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> he told him, That he understood not a word of it.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was so reserved, because he was slie and dainty to report those Mysteries with that freedom to him, who was not qualified as a Publick Minister. The <hi>Conde</hi> was angry with <hi>Porter</hi> for communicating what he said to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol.</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> returned with a Dispatch fraught with Generalities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any one particular or certainty at all made in relation to the Prince's Highness; who thereupon took his resolution to go in person to <hi>Spain,</hi> and gave himself these Reasons for the enterprise.</p>
                        <p>He saw his Fathers Negotiation plainly deluded, Matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> gained upon, and extorted; his Sisters cause more and more desperate; and that this was the way to put things off or on; and that in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, delay was worse then a denial; and that according to the usual Proverb, <hi>A desperate disease, must have a desperate remedy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hereupon the King commanded the Duke to accompany his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his Journey.</p>

                        <p>WHen the Prince had arived at <hi>Madrid,</hi> the <hi>Conde</hi> gave him a visit, magnified exceedingly the Princes journey, amplified the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations his Highness had put upon that King; and said, That now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all peradventure it must be a Match, and we must part and divide the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whole World between us.</p>
                        <p>The next day the <hi>Conde</hi> taking the Duke into his Coach, and Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> for his Interpreter, falling into discourse of the Match, he said unto the Duke, Let us dispatch this Match out of hand, and strike <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:35668:74"/>
but desired to understand the Means. The Means, quoth the <hi>Conde,</hi> is very easie; it is but the Conversion of the Prince; which we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but his Highness intended upon his Resolution for this Journey.</p>
                        <p>The Duke answered forthwith, That with freedom they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with freedom they would return again; they were no Juglers, neither came they to <hi>Spain</hi> to make new bargains: That the Prince was setled in his Religion; his Conscience was troubled with no scruples in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that kinde: If they struck any more upon that string, they would mar all the harmony. Then said the <hi>Conde,</hi> there is no way but to send to <hi>Rome</hi> to hasten the Dispensation; to which the Duke assented. Hereupon the <hi>Conde</hi> wrote his Letter to the Cardinal <hi>Lodovisia,</hi> the Popes Nephew; which being shewed to the Duke, seemed to him to be very heavy; the Duke therefore desired to quicken it with this Postscript, <hi>That now the Prince being arived, must not be sent back without a Wife; that delay to a Suitor, is a kinde of refusal; that Clogging Instructions would amount to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> denial, and new Conditions to an absolute breach.</hi> The <hi>Conde</hi> fell into Choller, said directly it could not be done. This the Prince affirmed to be acted in his presence: But the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> made a more benign construction thereof, the Duke a right-down conclusion, That this people never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended either Match or Restitution; and so wished his Highness fairly at home again: However the Messenger was dispatched to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Four or five days after his Highness was placed to see his Mistress in her passage through the streets, as she made her visits from Church to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Church: But pressing for access, he was delayed, but at last obtained a visit: But a very strange one! He was not suffered to speak unto her, but as they had set it down in words and syllables in writing, saying, They were no Astrologers, and could not foresee the event of this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and therefore they resolved to admit him as a Prince onely, and not as a Suitor. But the <hi>Conde</hi> salved this up with a Complement, That if the Dispensation were once returned, he should lie with her even that very night; nay, have her he should upon any terms. If he could not be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> qualified to enjoy her as a Wife, yet he should have her as a Mistress.</p>
                        <p>Soon after riding in a Coach, it was urged by the <hi>Conde</hi>; That the <hi>Infanta</hi> was of a tender Conscience, and if she should come into <hi>England,</hi> and finde the Prince an enemy to her Religion, it would quite dishearten her. His Highness consented to hear her upon this subject, because he was as like to convert her, as she was to pervert him. A Conference with Divines was pressed upon his Highness, which he refused, and said, If after Disputation with them, they should not prevail against a yong man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they would remain much disgusted and ill-affected to the whole Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This kinde of importunity was still used toward the Prince, till the return of the Dispensation.</p>
                        <p>Six weeks after the Princes arival came the Dispensation; but his Highness understood from <hi>Rome</hi> by Mr. <hi>Gage,</hi> that the Dispensation was returned much clogged in Matter and Manner, especially with the annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed new Condition. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> before the receiving of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, was to take an Oath to see all the Articles performed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Faculty was issued, really performed, or else to make War in case of any failer upon the King of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>His Highness signified his Resolution unto them, that he neither could nor would adde or alter any thing of the first Articles sent to <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>Iuncto</hi> of Divines are appointed to meet and consider, whether the King might safely take the Oath. By this time the Prince had gone
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35668:75"/>
through all the Articles, sitting in person with the Committee; onely leaving three undiscussed, That of the Church, that of the Nurse, and that of the Education of the Children; which his Highness reserved till he should speak with the King. Then said the <hi>Conde,</hi> Now the business is in a better way then ever it was, a Match, and without more ado she was his Wife.</p>
                        <p>But the next day came <hi>Gondomar</hi> and spake unto the Prince of the same Match, as of a new thing, and told him plainly, That unless his Highness <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> came to all the Conditions of the Dispensation as they were sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> clearly and entirely, nothing would be done; for they had no power to remove or alter a word of false <hi>Latine.</hi> Whereupon his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was justly distasted, and offered to break. Then they pressed the Prince, that he would be pleased to stay twenty days, until the King of <hi>Spain</hi> might receive an Answer from <hi>England.</hi> The Prince resolved to stay, upon condition that Sir <hi>Francis Cottington</hi> might be dispatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way within two days, and some Messenger that might overtake him with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Articles that should be sent after, as soon as ever they could be made ready: But the two days of their hammering spun out to twenty; at the end thereof they brought them with new Additions.</p>
                        <p>The Articles being at last sent to <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Iuncto</hi> of Divines delivered their opinions, that the <hi>Infanta</hi> could not be sent over before the Spring; at which his Highness was offended, but the <hi>Conde</hi> prevailed with him to stay until their Ambassadors should certifie out of <hi>England,</hi> that the Articles were assented unto by King <hi>Iames,</hi> and put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and then the Lady should go with the Prince.</p>
                        <p>The Bishop of <hi>Segovia</hi> was pleased to say to the Duke, That he had heard something of the State of our Kingdom, and had received it from good hands; That our King could not make a Toleration without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and easily believed it; because the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is not able in his Dominions to effect the like enterprise, without incurring the like danger; therefore he concluded, it was unsafe to send the Lady thither at this time, because we having granted as much in effect as a Toleration,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it was very probable she should be welcomed with a rising and rebellion. To which the Duke replied, That if the favors which the King his Master had exhibited to his Catholicks at the Mediation of that King, and the Advice of that very Committee, of which that Bishop was one, be of so dangerous a consequence; it seems their Lordships, who gave the Advice for that Article, though they pretended Religion, intended plain and open Rebellion. But you must know quoth, the Duke, if his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had been of my Lord Bishops opinion, That these Conferences had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> amounted to a Toleration, he had never accepted of these Articles to have gained any allowance: For what was agreed unto, was but a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Suspension of Penal Laws, but no Toleration; for that could not be done, but by consent of Parliament. Then <hi>Gondomar</hi> hereupon said, That for his part, he did not hold it fit to send the <hi>Infanta</hi> thither, before the Articles be perfectly put in execution. And <hi>Gondomar</hi> private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infused to the Prince his Highness, being incensed against the Duke, That the Duke was in heart, (as he said all his Kinred were) a <hi>Roman</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Catholick; and he said to a Jesuite of great account and zeal in those parts, That the Duke was a most obstinate, perverse, and refractory Puritan.</p>
                        <p>About this time it was reported that the Prince intended to steal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, whereupon they laid in wait to intercept him: Hereupon the Duke
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:35668:75"/>
was sent to tell them, That although they had stoln thither out of love, they would never steal thence out of fear.</p>
                        <p>About this time the Prince sent a Message to his Father, That if he should receive any Advertisement, that he was detained by that State as a Prisoner, he would be pleased for his sake, never to think upon him any longer as a Son, but reflect upon the good of his Sister, and the safety of his own Kingdoms.</p>

                        <p>IT is fit to observe this passage, which is the thing whereupon all his Highness subsequent Actions are turned and moved.

                        <p>To hasten the Delivery of the Lady, the Duke presented unto the <hi>Conde,</hi> how his Master was now in years, the Prince his onely Son; and he would suffer in Honor and Reputation, to return home without his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Wife. The <hi>Conde</hi> consented hereunto, and desired the Prince would name a day for his departure.</p>
                        <p>This news came to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> who seemed to be Apprehensive of the Princes going away, and prevailed with his Highness to return this Complement unto her, That rather then he would give her <hi>Alteza</hi> any disgust, he would stay for her seven years.</p>
                        <p>By this time Sir <hi>Francis Cottington</hi> is arived with all things perfected by the King, and Letters from the Ambassadors of full satisfaction, and a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> command from the King to his Highness, to make his return within one moneth.</p>
                        <p>Now began the <hi>Conde</hi> to enter into the Treaty for the Restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> saying, The Lady should by no means go to <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that business was accommodated. And it was projected, That there should be a Restitution of the Land to the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> upon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Marriage with the Emperors Daughter, and that he should be bred in the Emperors Court. The Prince demanding of the <hi>Conde,</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whether in case the Emperor proved refractory, the King his Master would assist him with Arms to reduce him to reasonable terms? The <hi>Conde</hi> answered Negatively, because they had a Maxim of State, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> must never fight against the Emperor; for they would not employ their forces against the House of <hi>Austria.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hereupon his Highness made his Protestation to the <hi>Conde; Look to it Sir, for if you hold your self to that, there is an end of all; for without this you may not relie upon, either Marriage or Friendship.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> By this time the Prince is grown cheap and vulgar in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> so that they will scarce bestow a visit upon him, and the <hi>Conde</hi> came very seldom to him: And two Letters came to the Dukes hands, which shewed, that all that the <hi>Conde</hi> did, was nothing but slashes and lightning; notwithstanding he seemed at this time to be in a good humor, and told the Duke, That now certainly it must be a Match, and the Devil

could not break it: The Duke replied, He thought so, and the Match had need be very firm and strong, it had been seven years in Soadering. The <hi>Conde</hi> denied, and said plainly, it had not been really intended seven moneths; and said, I will fetch that out of my Desk, that shall assure you thereof; and so produced two Letters, the first was written with the King of <hi>Spains</hi> own hand, Dated the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> 1622.

                        <p>The second Direction sent to him, was by a Letter which his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness sent him, between his departure from the Escurial, and coming to the Sea side, to this effect, That for fear a Monastery should rob him of his Wife, he should stay the delivery of the Powers until the doubts were cleared; and that his Highness would send him in the Premisses some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Directions? Here because my Lord of <hi>Bristol</hi> in his Letter of the First of <hi>November,</hi> 1623. doth press so vehemently the Prince his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness concerning this Proxy, and the Prince vowed openly before both Houses, that he had never by Oath or Honor engaged himself not to revoke the Powers, more then by the clause <hi>De non revocando Procuratore</hi> inserted in the Instrument it self, and that he conceived the clause to be matter of Form; and although Essentially of no binding power, yet usually thrust into every such Instrument; and that the Civilians do hold,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> That it is lawful by the Civil and Canon Law, for any man to revoke his Proxy of Marriage, notwithstanding it hath the clause <hi>De non revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cando Procuratore</hi> inserted in it. Therefore as to this point the Duke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> in charging this matter so highly on the Prince, had much forgot himself.</p>

                        <p>THe Prince by the Mercy of God came to <hi>Royston,</hi> and made his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the King of all that had passed. His Majesty was glad, and told him, That he had acted well the part of a Son; and now the part of a Father must come upon the Stage, which was to provide with all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> That his onely Son should not be married with a Portion of Tears to his onely Daughter. And therefore his Majesty commanded by an express dispatch, the stay of the Proxy in the Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> hands, until he had some better assurance of the Restitution of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then was read his Majesties Letter to the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> dated the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35668:76"/>
Eighth of <hi>October,</hi> 1623. wherein the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> was positively requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the King, That before he deliver the Powers, or move to the Contract, to procure from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> a direct Restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and the Electoral Dignity, or to assist with Arms within a time limited.</p>
                        <p>You would perceive that by this Dispatch, <hi>Bristol</hi> would lay hold on all hints and emergent occasions to put off the <hi>Desponsorios</hi> without this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> required Assurance by Arms first obtained; but the truth is, he did not so.</p>
                        <p>For first, the Confirmation came from <hi>Rome</hi> clogged and mangled; and instead of challenging thereupon, he labors with no small strength of wit to hide and palliate the same.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, In the Temporal Articles, the Portion was altered, Six hundred thousand pounds in ready cash, to some Eighty thousand pounds in money, and a few Jewels, and a Pension of Two thousands pounds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                           <hi>per annum.</hi> Instead of quarrelling this main alteration, he seems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and applaud the payment.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, For the Assurance of Restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the main Foundation both of Match and Friendship, he is so far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for it before (which was the Method prescribed him by the King) that he leaves it to be mediated by the <hi>Infanta</hi> after the Marriage.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, Instead of putting off the Contract, as any man in the world (upon the Dispatch from <hi>Royston</hi>) would have done, he comes to prefix a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> precise day for the <hi>Desponsorios.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now from this rash fixing of the day for the <hi>Desponsorios</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> which was controlled again by an Express, from hence issued an unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary discourtesie put upon the King, and in a manner upon the <hi>Infanta</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Bristol:</hi> From that proceeded a greater affront put upon the Prince, the taking away the title <hi>La Princesa</hi> from the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and the debarring of our Ambassadors from any further Access to her person.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Then was produced an Answer of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the Ambassador, implying a Refusal to assist by Arms for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in case the Emperor consent not to a Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we have inserted in <hi>series</hi> of time:</p>

            <p>The Spanish Ambassador took great offence at the Dukes Relation, as reflecting upon his Masters Honor, and demanded his Head for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>The House of Lords by a general Vote acquitted the Duke from the Accusation of the Spanish Ambassador, and justified his Relation, and intended to signifie as much to his Majesty by a Committee of the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> House, That the Duke may be encouraged to proceed in his faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the State: Unto which, the Commons so directly and fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, as if the two Houses had been Twins; and what one had said, thought, and done, the other had thought, said, and done the same.

                        <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen all, I might have reason to speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in regard of the person whereof you spake;<note place="margin">His Majesties Answer to that Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> but in regard of your Motion, it were not civil: For if I be silent, I shall wrong neither my self, nor that Nobleman which you now spake of, because he is well known to be such a one, as stands in no need of a Prolocutor, or <hi>Fidejussor,</hi> to undertake for his fidelity, or well carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the business: And indeed to send a man upon so great an <hi>Errand,</hi> whom I was not resolved to trust for the carriage thereof, were a fault in my discretion scarce compatible to the love and trust I bear him. It is an old and true saying, <hi>That he is a happy man that serves a good M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The greatest fault (if it be a fault) or at leastwise the greatest error, I hope he shall ever commit against me, was his desiring this Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from you; as if he should have need of any Justification from others towards me, and that for these Reasons.</p>
                        <p>First, Because he being my Disciple and Schollar, he may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I will trust his own Relation.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Because he made the same Relation unto me, which he did afterward unto both Houses; so as I was formerly acquainted both with the matter and manner thereof: And if I should not trust him in the carriage, I was altogether unworth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> no interest of his own in the business; he had ill thoughts at home for his going thither with my Son, although it was my command, as I told you before. And now he hath as little thanks for his Relation on the other part: Yet he that serveth God and a good Master, cannot miscarry for all this.</p>
                        <p>I have noted in his Negotiation these three remarkable things, Faith, Diligence, and Discretion, whereof my Son hath borne record unto me; yet I cannot deny, but as he thought to do good service to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his Master, he hath given ill example to Ambassadors in time to come, because he went this long journey upon his own charges. This would prove an ill example, if many of my Ambassadors should take it for a President. He run his head into the yoke with the people here, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the journey; and when he there spent above Forty or fifty thousand pounds, never offered his accompt, nor made any demand for the same, or ever will. I hope other Ambassadors will do so no more. I am a good Master, that never doubted of him; for I know him to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be so good a Schollar of mine, that I say without van<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I am glad he hath so well satisfied you, and thank you heartily for taking it in so good part, as I finde you have done.</p>

                        <p>I also give my particular thanks to the Gentlemen of the Lower House, for that I heard when some would have cast Jealousies and Doubts between me and my people, they presently quelled those moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which otherwise might indeed have hindred the happy Agreement I hope to find in this Parliament.

                        <p>First it is true, that I who have been all the days of my life a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able King, and have had the honor in my Titles and Impresses to be stiled <hi>Rex Paci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I say, that unless it be upon such a Necessity, that I may call it, as some say merrily of Women, <hi>Malum necessarium,</hi> I should be loth to enter into it. And I must likewise acquaint you, that I have had no small hope given me of obtaining better Conditions for the Restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and that even since the sitting down of the Parliament: But be not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> jealous, or think me such a King that would under pretence of asking your Advice, put a scorn upon you by disdaining and rejecting it: For you remember, that in my first Speech unto you, for proof of my love to my People, I craved your Advice in this great and weighty affair; But in a matter of this weight, I must first consider how this Course may agree with my Conscience and Honor; and next according to the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35668:79"/>
Parable uttered by our Saviour, after I have resolved of the Necessity and justness of the Cause, to consider how I shall be enabled to raise Forces for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the <hi>Cause of my Children,</hi> I am now old; and as <hi>Moses</hi> saw the Land of Promise from an high mountain, though he had not leave to set his foot in it, so it would be a great comfort to me, that God would but so long prolong my days, as if I might not see the Restitution, yet at least I might be assured that it would be; That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then I might with old <hi>Simeon</hi> say, <hi>Nunc dimittis Servum tuum, Domine, &amp;c.</hi> Otherwise it would be a great grief unto me, and I should die with a heavy and discomforted heart. I have often said, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the last Parliament, and I shall ever be of that mind, That as I am not ambitious of any other mens Goods or Lands, so I desire not to enjoy a Furrow of Land in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Restitution of the <hi>Palatinate:</hi> And in this mind I will live and die.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>But let me acquaint you a little with the Difficulties of this Cause. He is an unhappy man, that shall advise a King to <hi>War</hi>; and it is an unhappy thing to seek that by <hi>Blood,</hi> which may be had by <hi>Peace.</hi> Besides, I think your intentions are not to engage me in War, but withal you will consider how many things are requisite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                        <p>I omit to speak of my own Necessities, (they are too well known:) Sure I am, I have had the least help in Parliament of any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> King that ever reigned over you these many years. I must let you know that my Disabilities are increased by the Charge of my Son's journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> which I was at, for his honor, and the honor of this Nation: By sending of Ambassadors, by maintaining of my Children, and by assisting of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> I have incurred a great Debt to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> which I am not able yet to pay.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> who in regard of their nearness are fittest to help for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> are at so low an ebb, that if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> I assist them not, they are scarce able to subsist. The Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> that should do me any good, are all poor, weak and disheartned, and do expect assistance from hence. For <hi>Ireland,</hi> I leave it to you, whether that be not a back-door to be secured. For the <hi>Navy,</hi> I thank God, it is in a better case then ever it was, yet more must be done; and before it can be prepared as it ought to be, it will require a new Charge as well for its own strength, as for the securing of the Coasts.</p>
                        <p>My Children, <hi>I vow to God,</hi> eat no bread but by my means; I must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> maintain them and not see them want. In the mean time, my <hi>Customs</hi> are the best part of my Revenues, and in effect the substance of all I have to live on; All which are farmed out upon that condition, That if there be War, those Bargains are to be disannulled, which will enforce a great defalcation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Subsidies</hi> ask a great time to bring them in: Now if you assist me that way, I must take them up beforehand upon credit, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> will eat up a great part of them. This being my Case, To enter into War without sufficient means to support it, were to shew my teeth, and do no more. In the mean time I heartily thank you for your Advice, and will seriously think upon it, as I pray you to consider of those other parts.</p>

My <hi>Treasurer,</hi> to whose Office it appertains, shall more at large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of those things that concern my Estate. Thus freely do I open my heart unto you: And having your <hi>hearts,</hi> I cannot want your <hi>helps</hi>; for it is the <hi>heart</hi> that openeth the <hi>purse,</hi> not the <hi>purse</hi> the <hi>heart.</hi> I will deal frankly with you: Shew me the Means how I may do what you would have me, and if I take a Resolution by your Advice to enter into a War, then your selves by your own Deputies shall have the disposing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the Money; I will not meddle with it, but you shall appoint your own Treasurers. I say not this with a purpose to invite you to open your Purses, and then to slight you so much as not to follow your Counsel, nor engage you before I be engaged my self. Give me what you will for my own means; but I protest, none of the Monies which you shall give for those uses, shall be issued but for those ends, and by men elected by your selves. If upon your offer I shall find the means to make the War honorable and safe, and that I resolve to embrace your Advice, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> then I promise you in the word of a King, That although War and Peace be the peculiar Prerogatives of Kings, yet as I have advised with you in the Treaties on which War may ensue, so I will not treat nor accept of a Peace, without first acquainting you with it, and hearing your advice; and therein go the proper way of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in conferring and consulting with you: And happily, the Conditions of Peace will be the better, when we be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for War; according to the old Proverb, That <hi>Weapons bode <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Peace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your kind carriage gives me much content; And that comforts me, which my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> said, <hi>That there was not a Contrary voice amongst you all</hi>; like the <hi>Seventy Interpreters,</hi> who were led by the breath of God. I am so desirous to forget all rents in former Parliaments, that it shall not be in my default, if I am not in love with Parliaments, and call them often, and desire to end my life in that entercourse between me and my people, for the making of good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Laws, reforming of such Abuses as I cannot be well informed of but in Parliament, and maintaining the good Government of the Commonwealth. Therefore go on cheerfully, and advise of these Points, and my Resolution shall then be declared.</p>

Sure, I do think there are very few that serve in this House (if there be any) who do not confidently believe, that the chief Motive which induced his Majesty at this time to assemble this Parliament, was a meer Necessity to be by us enabled for the Recovery of the Patrimony belonging to the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> now almost traversed from him, and in the possession of a powerful Enemy. If there be any who doubt of this truth, I hope he may easily rest satisfied, when I shall assure him (out of my own knowledge) that many days before this Session, his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Majesty commanded a select number of Noblemen and Gentlemen, the most part whereof have been Commanders in the Wars, and some yet are, to consult together of what Number of men an Army ought to be composed, which might be able to recover the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and protect it from a second Invasion. These according to his Majesties good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure divers days met together at one appointed place, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed their best endeavors: At least they have finished their task; advised the King of the Number of Soldiers; they have estimated the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> present Charge his Majesty must be at for the Relieving, Arming, Clothing, Munition and Habiliments of War; These have likewise calculated the Annual Expence for the maintenance of them.</p>
                        <p>The first I will now inform you; And for the last Point, because of a greater Charge and Consequence, I will allow more time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. Twenty five thousand Foot, and Five thousand Horse, is the portion they all agree on; and less they could not consider to be sent, considering they were to combat with an Enemy so far from hence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> already in possession of a great part of the Country, well fortified in many places, Master of an Army composed with Twenty thousand Foot and Four thousand Horse, most Veterane Soldiers, commanded by the best Captains now known in the Christian world, except the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; after whom to be esteemed second, is the highest praise: I say, all these respects duly weighed, there could not in their judgments be abated of this proportion: And this Army was framed on that mould which the Secretaries of State gave them of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> strength.</p>
                        <p>The issue of Battels is in the hands of God: The eyes of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane providence cannot see beyond its horizon; It cannot ascertain future Contingents, it can only judge of what seems fit to be done, guided by the Rules of Probability and Reason. Events happen often contrary, and never more contrary then in matters of Warfare: Yet admit a sinister success to happen, a Counsel wisely taken ought not therefore to lose the due commendations.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sirs, I have told you the Number; You now expect to know the present Charge, in which I shall deal most truly with you. Believe me, His Majesty must disburse Thirty thousand pounds for provision of Necessities to furnish such an Army to be sent; The most part of the Provisions must be made beyond the Seas, for there Arms are best, and best cheap: This Army must (if such an Army) go by the end of <hi>April.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was God that said, <hi>Let there be light, and it was so:</hi> Kings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> (though they be stiled Gods) enjoy no such power, incommunicable to any Kings. Whatever their ends or desires are, they must allow time to the consummation of them: They be Soveraigns over us, but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto Time. But what need I add spurs to a forward horse? In my conscience, there are few Members in this House, that to that <hi>Holy War</hi>
                           <pb n="133" facs="tcp:35668:80"/>
(as I may justly stile it) would not as willingly and as heartily contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the service of their persons, as the assistance of their purses. I know I speak the Language of all your Hearts, let us shew our Faith by our works: Time was to have done much better then now we can; time is that we may do well; but if we attend somewhat longer, time will be past: So as all we do then will be so out of season, as it can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce neither any great, nor any good effect. But stay, methinks I hear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> some say, Why his Majesty told us, that by way of Treaty he hoped so to prevail, as the <hi>Palatinate</hi> should be restored. I confess I heard so to; and Heaven be pleased to crown his actions with success, as the piousness of his intentions deserves. But I must be excused, if I doubt it, if I fear it, if I despair of it: For it is no article of my Faith to believe in Miracles. But suppose this might be brought to pass, what then, shall this gift of ours be lost, or cast away? No sure, it will be well bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if as a Sacrifice of our thankfulness we offer it unto his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sty, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whose Wisdom that is regained; which certainly by any other course, must needs have exposed our persons to great danger, and our purses to much more expence. And in this we shall do as he that receiveth a rich present, and returns a small reward. Perhaps this way may not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate with every mans conceipt; if not, then let this which his Majesty demands to make provision for a Foreign Army, be employed in rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Magazin here at home, since so great is the want of Munition, as I wonder we all cry out for want of Money, and never think how to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be stored of that, which of the two, is more necessary: Seeing by the one, we are onely enabled to live more plenteously and sumptuously; and by the other, our lives are preserved free from misery and slavery. In matters of moment, I know it is as laudable to use Deliberation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Resolution, as after that once taken, Celerity in execution. Council is the Compass by which all great Actions ought to be guided; it is the Stear by which wise men do shape their courses. I allow it, I commend it, I advise it; yet to be so slow, so discussive, so long in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all we then can do, will be no more worth then a Physitian after death. Sure such a dulness, must needs accuse us of much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if it admit of no worse construction, (<hi>bis dat qui cito dat</hi>) freeness in giving graceth the gift; <hi>dimidium facti qui bene coepit habet.</hi> We have a long journey to go, and to set forward is half the way. How pressing the occasion is, my Tongue faints to tell, <hi>(Vox faucibus haeret) The Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Air have Nests</hi>; but the Daughter of our King and Kingdom scarce knows where to lay her head, or if she do, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> where in safety.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, When we had no other object in our Contemplations, but the memory of her vertue (which remaineth in durable Characters in the heart of every honest man) what a forwardness and ferventness did we express in these our voluntary contributions, notwithstanding that some base, sordid, and avaritious men who adored their Mammon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred men from that noble and pious work. They were then but Panick terrors, clouds cast before the Sun which now shines out so bright, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> all those mists are vanished. His Majesty calls to us for aid, he invites us to it, and he that was born to Command, now vouchsafes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat us: Now if ever, now is the time to do our Country good. Do we desire to sweep all Grievances out of this Land? Do we desire to extinguish the care of them, that they may never more germinate in this Commonwealth? Do we desire to destroy those Spiders that spin
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35668:81"/>
this Net? Now if ever, now is the time to effect it. And to arive at this blessing, methinks I discover a plain and easie way; let us please the King first, and I speak it with Faith, He will be gratiously pleased to reward us: Prove rich Merchants, and make a brave return. Great and generous spirits are then most apt to make requests, when first they have obtained their own. In the Region of Kings, the way to conquer is to submit; and nothing more obligeth an honest heart to perform what is expected, then to believe and trust in him.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the way to make his Majesty not onely love, but fall in love with Parliaments: This is the way to recal them home from exile, and again render them frequent amongst us: This is the way to fix this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we have purchased present ease, and future happiness to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Let his Majesty have hearts ease amongst us, and we shall receive from his Royal Hand that <hi>Dictamum</hi> which must expel these Arrows that hang in the sides of the Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I delivered my opinion, which if it be not the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with every one here present, I shall beg that favorable censure which Charity commands me to afford to all. Let him believe, I have spoken my Conscience, as I shall of him, though he happen to dissent from my opinion: For from what Circumference soever the Lines be drawn, the Center is the same, which is our Countreys good; at which, the desire of every man ought to aim, and the duty of every man ought to desire.</p>
                        <p>He that would take another course, and have Grievances first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> if he wished that out of a good to his Countrey, as unwilling to innovate antient proceedings; of this man I will onely say, <hi>Optime sentit</hi> Cato, <hi>sed nocet interdum Reipublicae:</hi> But if there be any other who out of a corrupt and imposthumate heart, looking to false and foreign ends, would endeavor to put a Partition-Wall between the King and his people, this man I dare pronounce neither good Subject, nor good Englishman, nor good Christian; but the Agent of base and beggerly Promoters, needy and greedy Projectors, and a friend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to those Monsters, which I hope have no Generation; who not born to any Fortune, nor having Vertue, nor Industry, by which they might hope to obtain any, yet like Harpies greedy to devour other mens Possessions, care not what way they take to become masters of them, sleighting the latter day of Judgment, so they may rest secured from yielding any account in this World.</p>
                        <p>I have no more to say, but that God would be pleased to incline our hearts to do that which may be most for his glory, next for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Kings service, then for the Countreys happiness.</p>

Twenty five thousand Foot, and Five thousand Horse, is the portion they all agree on; and less they could not consider to be sent, considering they were to combat with an Enemy so far from hence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> already in possession of a great part of the Country, well fortified in many places, Master of an Army composed with Twenty thousand Foot and Four thousand Horse, most Veterane Soldiers, commanded by the best Captains now known in the Christian world, except the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; after whom to be esteemed second, is the highest praise: I say, all these respects duly weighed, there could not in their judgments be abated of this proportion: And this Army was framed on that mould which the Secretaries of State gave them of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> strength.</p>
                        <p>The issue of Battels is in the hands of God: The eyes of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane providence cannot see beyond its horizon; It cannot ascertain future Contingents, it can only judge of what seems fit to be done, guided by the Rules of Probability and Reason. Events happen often contrary, and never more contrary then in matters of Warfare: Yet admit a sinister success to happen, a Counsel wisely taken ought not therefore to lose the due commendations.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sirs, I have told you the Number; You now expect to know the present Charge, in which I shall deal most truly with you. Believe me, His Majesty must disburse Thirty thousand pounds for provision of Necessities to furnish such an Army to be sent; The most part of the Provisions must be made beyond the Seas, for there Arms are best, and best cheap: This Army must (if such an Army) go by the end of <hi>April.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was God that said, <hi>Let there be light, and it was so:</hi> Kings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> (though they be stiled Gods) enjoy no such power, incommunicable to any Kings. Whatever their ends or desires are, they must allow time to the consummation of them: They be Soveraigns over us, but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto Time. But what need I add spurs to a forward horse? In my conscience, there are few Members in this House, that to that <hi>Holy War</hi>
                           <pb n="133" facs="tcp:35668:80"/>
(as I may justly stile it) would not as willingly and as heartily contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the service of their persons, as the assistance of their purses. I know I speak the Language of all your Hearts, let us shew our Faith by our works: Time was to have done much better then now we can; time is that we may do well; but if we attend somewhat longer, time will be past: So as all we do then will be so out of season, as it can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce neither any great, nor any good effect. But stay, methinks I hear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> some say, Why his Majesty told us, that by way of Treaty he hoped so to prevail, as the <hi>Palatinate</hi> should be restored. I confess I heard so to; and Heaven be pleased to crown his actions with success, as the piousness of his intentions deserves. But I must be excused, if I doubt it, if I fear it, if I despair of it: For it is no article of my Faith to believe in Miracles. But suppose this might be brought to pass, what then, shall this gift of ours be lost, or cast away? No sure, it will be well bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if as a Sacrifice of our thankfulness we offer it unto his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sty, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whose Wisdom that is regained; which certainly by any other course, must needs have exposed our persons to great danger, and our purses to much more expence. And in this we shall do as he that receiveth a rich present, and returns a small reward. Perhaps this way may not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate with every mans conceipt; if not, then let this which his Majesty demands to make provision for a Foreign Army, be employed in rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Magazin here at home, since so great is the want of Munition, as I wonder we all cry out for want of Money, and never think how to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be stored of that, which of the two, is more necessary: Seeing by the one, we are onely enabled to live more plenteously and sumptuously; and by the other, our lives are preserved free from misery and slavery. In matters of moment, I know it is as laudable to use Deliberation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Resolution, as after that once taken, Celerity in execution. Council is the Compass by which all great Actions ought to be guided; it is the Stear by which wise men do shape their courses. I allow it, I commend it, I advise it; yet to be so slow, so discussive, so long in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all we then can do, will be no more worth then a Physitian after death. Sure such a dulness, must needs accuse us of much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if it admit of no worse construction, (<hi>bis dat qui cito dat</hi>) freeness in giving graceth the gift; <hi>dimidium facti qui bene coepit habet.</hi> We have a long journey to go, and to set forward is half the way. How pressing the occasion is, my Tongue faints to tell, <hi>(Vox faucibus haeret) The Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Air have Nests</hi>; but the Daughter of our King and Kingdom scarce knows where to lay her head, or if she do, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> where in safety.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, When we had no other object in our Contemplations, but the memory of her vertue (which remaineth in durable Characters in the heart of every honest man) what a forwardness and ferventness did we express in these our voluntary contributions, notwithstanding that some base, sordid, and avaritious men who adored their Mammon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred men from that noble and pious work. They were then but Panick terrors, clouds cast before the Sun which now shines out so bright, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> all those mists are vanished. His Majesty calls to us for aid, he invites us to it, and he that was born to Command, now vouchsafes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat us: Now if ever, now is the time to do our Country good. Do we desire to sweep all Grievances out of this Land? Do we desire to extinguish the care of them, that they may never more germinate in this Commonwealth? Do we desire to destroy those Spiders that spin
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35668:81"/>
this Net? Now if ever, now is the time to effect it. And to arive at this blessing, methinks I discover a plain and easie way; let us please the King first, and I speak it with Faith, He will be gratiously pleased to reward us: Prove rich Merchants, and make a brave return. Great and generous spirits are then most apt to make requests, when first they have obtained their own. In the Region of Kings, the way to conquer is to submit; and nothing more obligeth an honest heart to perform what is expected, then to believe and trust in him.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the way to make his Majesty not onely love, but fall in love with Parliaments: This is the way to recal them home from exile, and again render them frequent amongst us: This is the way to fix this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we have purchased present ease, and future happiness to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Let his Majesty have hearts ease amongst us, and we shall receive from his Royal Hand that <hi>Dictamum</hi> which must expel these Arrows that hang in the sides of the Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I delivered my opinion, which if it be not the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with every one here present, I shall beg that favorable censure which Charity commands me to afford to all. Let him believe, I have spoken my Conscience, as I shall of him, though he happen to dissent from my opinion: For from what Circumference soever the Lines be drawn, the Center is the same, which is our Countreys good; at which, the desire of every man ought to aim, and the duty of every man ought to desire.</p>
                        <p>He that would take another course, and have Grievances first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> if he wished that out of a good to his Countrey, as unwilling to innovate antient proceedings; of this man I will onely say, <hi>Optime sentit</hi> Cato, <hi>sed nocet interdum Reipublicae:</hi> But if there be any other who out of a corrupt and imposthumate heart, looking to false and foreign ends, would endeavor to put a Partition-Wall between the King and his people, this man I dare pronounce neither good Subject, nor good Englishman, nor good Christian; but the Agent of base and beggerly Promoters, needy and greedy Projectors, and a friend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to those Monsters, which I hope have no Generation; who not born to any Fortune, nor having Vertue, nor Industry, by which they might hope to obtain any, yet like Harpies greedy to devour other mens Possessions, care not what way they take to become masters of them, sleighting the latter day of Judgment, so they may rest secured from yielding any account in this World.</p>
                        <p>I have no more to say, but that God would be pleased to incline our hearts to do that which may be most for his glory, next for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Kings service, then for the Countreys happiness.</p>

                           <note place="margin">His Majesties Reply.</note>I Have nothing to say to the Preamble of my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but that he intimated something in it which I cannot allow of: For whereas he said I have shewed my self sensible of the insincerity of those with whom I had lately to deal, and of the indignity offered to my Children: In this you must give me leave to tell you, that I have not expressed my self to be either sensible or insensible of the good or bad dealing. It was <hi>Buckinghams</hi> Relation to you which touched upon it; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by it you must not bar me, nor make <hi>Iupiter</hi> speak that which <hi>Iupiter</hi> speaks not: For when I speak any such thing, I will speak it with that reason, and back it with that power which becomes a King. As for the matter of the Declaration unto my Demands, which you have couched in that Paper, which I now heard read unto me, <hi>I</hi> confess it is without example that any King hath had such an offer. And with your favor <hi>I</hi> need fear nothing in this World, having so much the hearts of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For the large offer of assistance, <hi>I</hi> hold it to be more then Millions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Subsidies; and indeed it is an ample reward for the trust and freedom which <hi>I</hi> have used with you</p>
                        <p>But my Lords and Gentlemen, you must give me leave on the one side, to consider the possibility of the action: For in this case <hi>I</hi> must do as a man that maketh a Fortification, which must have Out-works and Inworks; so <hi>I</hi> must not deal onely with mine own people, but with my Neighbors advice to assist me in so great a business for recovery of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> And in this case it is not sufficient to have the hearts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> my Subjects, without the help of my Neighbors and Allies; on the other side, unless particular means be set down, it will neither be a Bridle to our Enemies, nor a comfort to my Friends, who shall joyn with me. General words will not carry it, therefore <hi>I</hi> must resort to particular means, and follow the Counsel of our Saviour Christ in the Gospel,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35668:82"/>
before <hi>I</hi> begin a War, to see how <hi>I</hi> can maintain it. God knows it is a longsome work, yet <hi>I</hi> desire with <hi>Moses,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> said before, but to see the Land of Promise, though <hi>I</hi> live not till it be recovered. But unless particular means be discovered, it is little to the point: Therefore since you give me such fair general promises, <hi>I</hi> will deal freely with you, <hi>I</hi> will tell you in particular, the way <hi>I</hi> will propose, either by way of Subsidies or otherwise; which being done in Parliament, is a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> way. <hi>I</hi> would require you to be pleased to bestow upon me Five Subsidies and Two Fifteens to every Subsidy for the War: And for mine own necessities, my crying debts are so heavy, that no man can bear them with a greater grief of heart, and sting of Conscience, then <hi>I</hi> have done and do. And <hi>I</hi> now growing old, would be glad to see a means for the satisfying of my debts, before <hi>I</hi> go out of the World. And for this end, I desire you would give me one Subsidy and two Fifteens year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, until my debts be paid.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Here the Prince his Highness taking notice of an Objection made, that this might seem contradictory to that which his Highness had told the Committee of both Houses, That the Kings Majesty would ask no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his own particular, till the Wars were provided for:</p>
            <p>The Prince said, That the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in his absence hath moved this doubt unto the King.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Duke affirmed, That speaking with the King about it, his Majesty was pleased to say, If we would adde one Subsidy and two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Fifteens to make it up Six Subsidies and Twelve Fifteens for the War, he was well content to quit that which he hath asked for his own neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</p>
            <p>The King proceeded.
<q>If this may be done, or that I may see a fair way for it, I will follow your Advice; for I would never have asked your Advice to reject it, or to put a scorn upon you: For the levying of these Subsidies and Fifteens, I would have you consider how to clear these two difficulties. If you levy them too suddenly, it may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> heavy for the people; if you stay too long, it will not serve the turn. But this I leave to your consideration: And since I leave it to your selves to receive the Money, and expend it by your own Committees of both Houses, you may be the more secure. And yet I would not have you to be too hasty in the levying of it, that no extremity be shewed to my people by imposing too heavy a burthen upon them, which God forbid. On the other side, the business will not suffer too long lingring about it. I told you before, I had in this great business, to look to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and Honor, as well as to the Means. For the Means, I must have it from you; my Conscience and Honor is mine own, of which I have thought, and do think daily. And how I shall be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them as a King ought to do, yet not without taking help of your Advice, which I would never have moved, unless I had meant to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here again the Prince, said he, had spoken with his Father, to know of him whether he were satisfied in Honor and Conscience, that he might in this case undertake a War; and that his Majesty answered, He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> satisfied and resolved therein; but for the manner of publishing it, he would take your Advice.</p>
            <p>Then the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> said, the reason why his Majesty used these words, was, That having formerly spoken of his Honor and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, if he should now have left them out, it might have been thought
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35668:83"/>
that money onely had drawn him to it: But the King said, He was already satisfied, and resolved, yet would have your Advice for the manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of it.</p>
            <p>The King again proceeded.
<q>I told you before, that this was the way to make me in love with Parliaments, and to shew mine inclination to continue them still. My Resolution is to make this a Session for the passing of as many good Laws, as in convenient time may be prepared; and at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> or within a few days after to have a new Session, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> another at the Spring. And in the mean time, you may go down and acquaint your selves with the grievances of my people; and you shall see my care to make good Laws, and to reform abuses; that so my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may finde the good fruits of Parliaments, and rejoyce in them. And I protest, as I have asked your Advice in these Points, which I needed not to have done; so I will never enter any Agreement or Treaty of Composition for Peace, which is the end of War (else it is unjust and unchristian) without your Advice; and I will help you my self, if we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> enter into a War, to make it allowable to the World, and Honorable for me.</q>

                           <note place="margin">The King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the aid proffered him.</note>MY Nobles and Gentlemen, the last time I spake to you anent this great business, I told you what in my opinion was necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the beginning of it. The Reasons whereof you have truly set down out of my last Speech, wherein I shewed you what good it would do, and what harm it might free us from; to express particular Aids at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this time, as well as general Promises. It is true, I must confess that how far you declare your selves, is sufficient for the present entrance into the business, though a great deal short of what I told you it would require. But as God bears me Record, and <hi>I</hi> think the hearts of all my loving Subjects will testifie for me, <hi>I</hi> never did stick for Money, but onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired you to clear your selves by particulars, that <hi>I</hi> may see how <hi>I</hi> may be able to go through so great a matter, at least to make a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the War; for what the end will be, God knows.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>So on the other part, <hi>I</hi> gave you thanks for your general offer, by which you did engage your selves in your Lives and Estates, which is more then Forty Subsidies, if you had named them, and more worth then a Kingdom; for the strength of a King, next under the protection of God, stands in the hearts of his people. And <hi>I</hi> must needs say in this particular, it is without example, that ever any Parliament for a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, gave to a King so great a supply to be levied in so short a time: This may well serve for a preparation. And for my part, first, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> your general offer, (which is ten times more to me then all Subsidies) and next considering that these particulars coming from you, be as much as at once you are able to pay in so short a time, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a year, and as much as may be well expected: Therefore with as much love, and as great thanks, as a loving and kinde King can give
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35668:83"/>
to so loving and dutiful a people. <hi>I</hi> thank you for your offer, and do accept it.</p>
                        <p>I told you before, that I would never have craved your Advice to reject it, and so to put a scorn upon you: Think me not the Man.</p>
                        <p>It is true, I think no wise King can undertake so great a bargain, but he must well be-think himself before-hand: And I account it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that a King advise well before he take a Resolution, then advise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> rashly, and after repent. Therefore, my Lords and Gentlemen, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you, That as I am willing to follow your Advice in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling and breach of the two Treaties, both of the Match, and of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>: so on the other part, I assure my self, you will make good what you have said, That what you advise me unto, you will assist me with your Wisdom, and Council, and Forces, if need require.</p>
                        <p>I pray you have a charitable opinion of me, as you are to have of a King who hath so long ruled and governed over you, (and I may vaunt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> my self thus far to have done it with Justice and Peace.) But, as I told you before, all my forbearance hath been for sparing the effusion of Christian Blood, and as the most easie and probable way for recovering the <hi>Palatinate</hi> for my Children. It is true, I have been so long delayed, and paid with generals, that I dare not trust longer unto that which made me erre. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> made a particular relation unto you, of all that business; and I am sure such an accompt was never before given in Parliament, that thereby you may know what to trust <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to. I could in this case have resolved my self, but I thought it could not but be both a strength and honor to me to have the Advice of my people.</p>
                        <p>My Lords, in the late Parliament I then declared it unto you, that I was resolved without respect of Friendship, or Match, or whatsoever, to have the <hi>Palatinate</hi> one way or other: I hope you remember it.</p>
                        <p>God is my Judge and Saviour, I never had any other end, and it is pitty I should live to have any other end; and for my part, except by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> such means as God may put into my hands, I may recover the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> I could wish never to have been born. I am old, but mine onely Son is yong, and I will promise for my self and him both, that no means shall be unused for the recovery of it; and this <hi>I</hi> dare say, as old as <hi>I</hi> am, if it might do good to the business, <hi>I</hi> would go in mine own person, and think my labor and travel well bestowed, though <hi>I</hi> should end my days there. For if <hi>I</hi> should spare any means possible for the recovery of it, then let me not be thought worthy to Reign over <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> you; and in good faith, <hi>I</hi> never resolved to live with other minde; and <hi>I</hi> will say more, there was never any Enemy of my Son-in-law, with whom <hi>I</hi> talked on of the business, or any that <hi>I</hi> ever spake with of the same; which did not say, and confess <hi>I</hi> had reason to have the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> one way or other: And when they say that it is good reason, and themselves allow it, it is a good spur to me to think on it.</p>
                        <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, thus far assure your selves, <hi>I</hi> will go chearfully about it, to prepare all things possible for it; and as you have given the means, so will <hi>I</hi> employ them toward it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> In the next degree, I hope you will think of me, but that I leave to your own Counsel and Consideration. But <hi>I protest to God,</hi> a penny of this Money shall not be bestowed but upon this Work, and by your own Committees; and I assure my self, you will think of me for a double Reason. My Customs are likely to fall, by occasion of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35668:84"/>
War, and my Charges increase; but undertaking the War, I must go through with it one way or other, though I sell my Jewels and all.</p>
                        <p>In the next Session you will consider how this hath been husbanded; and according to that, think what is next to be done; and it will spur you the more to enable me for the rest, whereof I spake to you before.</p>

            <p>His Majesty further said,</p>
            <q>
               <p>I will clear you in some things; for I will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not deal with you in any thing, but fairly and clearly as a King: Though I have broken the <hi>Necks three of Parliaments,</hi> one after another, I hope that in this Parliament you shall be so resolved of the sincerity of my heart, and of your duties and affections, that this shall be a happy Parliament, and make me greater and happier then any King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ever was.</p>
               <p>In my last Speech I promised you, that if I accepted your offer, I would follow your Advice, and would not after hearken to any Treaty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Peace, without first acquainting you, and requiring your Advice; and I likewise promised nothing should be spent of your Moneys, but by your own Committees. But I desire you to understand, That I must have a faithful secret Counsel of War, that must not be ordered by a multitude, for so my designs may be discovered before hand; and one penny of this Money shall not be bestowed, but in sight of your own Committees. But whether I shall send Twenty thousand pounds, or Ten thousand pounds; whether by Sea or Land, East or West, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Diversion, or otherwise by Invasion upon the <hi>Bavarian</hi> or Emperor, you must leave that to your King.</p>
               <p>Assure your selves; my delay hitherto was upon hope to have gotten it without a War. I held it by a hair, hoping to have gotten it by a Treaty; but since I see no certainty that way, I hope that God who hath put it into your hearts thus to advise me, and into my heart to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your Advice, will so bless it, that I shall clear my Reputation from obliquy; and in despight of the Devil, and all his Instruments, shew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that I never had but an honest heart. And I desire, that God would bless our labors for the happy Restitution of my Children; and whosoever did the wrong, I deserved better at their hands.</p>

            <p>After this, the King purposing to signifie to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> That his Parliament had advised him to break off the Treaties, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>Palatinate</hi> by War: The notice of a sharp <hi>Petition</hi> against Popish Recusants framed by the House of Commons, and sent up to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Lords for their Concurrence, did a little stagger his Resolution, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the following Letter written with his own hand to Secretary <hi>Conway.</hi>

                        <p n="1">I.

                        <p n="2">II. That your Majesty would be pleased to give streight and speedy charge to the Iustices of Peace in all parts of this Kingdom, that (according to the Laws in that behalf made, and the Orders taken by your Majesties Privy-Councel heretofore for policy of State) they do take from all Popish Recusants legally convicted, or justly suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all such Armor, Gunpowder, and Munition of any kinde, as any of them have either in their own hands, or in the hands of any other for them, and to see the same safely kept, and disposed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law, leaving for the necessary defence of their house and persons, so much as by the Law is prescribed.</p>
                        <p n="3">III.

                        <p n="4">IV.

                        <p n="5">V.

                        <p>Now my Lords and Gentlemen, for your Petition, <hi>I</hi> will not onely grant the substance of what you crave, but add somewhat more of my own; for the two Treaties being already annulled (as <hi>I</hi> have declared them to be) it necessarily follows of it self, that which you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> desire, and therefore it needs no more; But that <hi>I</hi> do declare by <hi>Proclamation</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> am ready to do) that all <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> do depart by a day; but it cannot be as you desire by our Proclamation to be out of all my Dominions; for a Proclamation here extends but to this Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>I</hi> will do and more, <hi>I</hi> will Command all my <hi>Iudges</hi> when they go
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35668:86"/>
their Circuits, to keep the same courses, for putting all the Laws in Execution against <hi>Recusants,</hi> as they were wont to do before these Treaties; for the Laws are still in force, and were never <hi>dispenced</hi> with by me: <hi>God</hi> is my <hi>Iudge</hi> they were never so intended by me; but as <hi>I</hi> told you in the beginning of the Parliament, you must give me leave as a good horseman, sometimes to use the <hi>Reins,</hi> and not alwayes to use the <hi>Spurs</hi>: So now there needs nothing but my Declaration for the <hi>disarming</hi> of them, that is ready done by the Laws, and shall be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> done as you desired: and more, <hi>I</hi> will take order for the shamefull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of the resorting of my Subjects to all foreign Ambassadors; for this <hi>I</hi> will advise with my Councel how it may be best reformed. It is true, that the houses of Ambassadors are priviledged places; and <hi>Major</hi> though they cannot take them out of their houses, yet the Lord and Mr <hi>Recorder</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> may take some of them as they come from thence, and make them examples; another point <hi>I</hi> will add con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the education of their children, of which <hi>I</hi> have had a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> care, as the Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and other Lords of my Councel can bear me witness, with whom <hi>I</hi> have advised about this business; for in <hi>good faith</hi> it is a shame their Children should be bred here, as if they were at <hi>Rome.</hi> So <hi>I</hi> do grant not onely your desire, but more. <hi>I</hi> am sorry <hi>I</hi> was not the first mover of it to you, but had you not done it, <hi>I</hi> would have done it my self.</p>
                        <p>Now for the second part of your Petition, you have here given me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the best advice in the world; for it is against the rule of wisdom that a King should suffer any of his Subjects to transgress the Laws by the <hi>intercession</hi> of other <hi>Princes</hi>: and therefore assure your selves that (by the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi>) <hi>I</hi> will be carefull that no such conditions be foisted in upon any other Treaty whatsoever; for it is fit my Subjects should stand or fall to their own Laws.</p>

            <p>This Petition was furthered by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who still <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> retained the memory of his ill-usage in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Spanish Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor being netled thereat, accused him to the King, not without some reflection upon the Prince himself; with some difficulty they procured a secret entercourse with the King, and suggested unto him matters of near and high concernment to his Royal dignity and person.<note place="margin">The Spanish Ambassadors accuse <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> to the King of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of high concernment.</note> They tell him, that being besieged, and closed up by the Dukes Servants and Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, he was no more a freeman: That he was to be confined to his Countrey-house and Pastimes, the Prince having years and parts answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for publick Government. That the Duke had reconciled himself to all popular men, such as <hi>Oxford, Southampton, Essex, Say,</hi> and others, and sought to raise an opinion of his own greatness, and to make the King grow less; and that all looked towards the <hi>rising Sun.</hi> Hereupon they advise the King to free himself from this Captivity, and eminent Danger, and to cut off so ungratefull an affecter of Popularity, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and so he should shew himself to be as he was reputed, the <hi>oldest and wisest King in Europe.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
            </p>
            <p>These secrets were quickly blown abroad, and brought to the Dukes Ear. But whatsoever impression the King received from them, the thing whereupon he insisted openly, was, the demand of particular proofs. But all their Answers consisted of Arguments against declaring the names of the Conspirators; whereupon the Kings Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:35668:86"/>
and other principal Subjects were examined upon oaths, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories most pertinent to the Accusation were propounded to them; but this examination discovered nothing. The King turned again to the Ambassadors with new instances to make a clear discovery, but they still resolved to conceal the Authors.</p>
            <p>And it was alledged by their Partakers, and intimated to the King, that the things were such as could not be evidenced by Legal proofs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the persons by whose testimony they may be confirmed, do for fear of a most potent Adversary withdraw themselves, and the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors never had the freedom personally to speak to his Majesty in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; an example (say they) unusual with other Kings, and never to be taken well, except when the King is weak in judgement, and wants experience, and a man wise and circumspect sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his place. But here (said the Ambassador,) is a <hi>prudent</hi> King, and a <hi>Favorite</hi> young, rash, and heady, whose continual presence did argue guilt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and fear; and his Majesties most faithfull Servants dare not so much as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close their minds. Moreover they suggest that the business of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was by him taken out of the hands of the Kings Council, and referred to the Parliament; that he did arrogate to himself the thanks of all things acceptable, and was stiled the Redeemer of his Country; and he would have it believed, that he hath a dominion over the Kings and Princes will. And things standing thus, though many may be found that will speak against the King, yet none will appear to speak against the Duke: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> For which causes these close Informers besought his Majesty to free his Vassals from fear and diffidence, who otherwise will dare discover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his preservation.</p>
            <p>But these dark Intelligences had no other issue,<note place="margin">The issue of those Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations.</note> then the moving of King <hi>Iames</hi> to represent to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> the miscarriages of his Ambassadors, remitting the cause unto him, with a demand of Justice and reparation, for that the Information was sufficient to put impressions in him of perpetual jealousies of the Duke. Hereupon when the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were returned home, they suffered a few dayes confinement, but were afterwards rather rewarded and further imployed: For in the Court of <hi>Spain, Buckinghams</hi> name was odious, and the Princes honor of little value, and the Kings reputation at a low ebb: divers particular Enmities were already begun between the Subjects of both Crowns, the English Merchants were oppressed in the Spanish Ports.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the Dukes vast power and popularity,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests against the Dukes Narration, is imprisoned in the Tower.</note> the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> refused to bow before him. The Earl, though his charge were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> heavy, and his Cause strongly prejudiced, did not abandon his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but protested against the Dukes <hi>Narration</hi> of the Spanish Affairs, and was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> being not admitted into the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, nor to plead his Cause before him. He was to the Duke a stout and dangerous Enemy; insomuch, that he was said to violate the rules of the prudent <hi>Mariner,</hi> who in a Storm and foul weather, is accustomed rather to pull down, then to hoise up Sailes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 29 of <hi>May,</hi> the King being come to the House of <hi>Peers,</hi>

                        <p>His fourth grievance is, that Seditious Books are so frequently printed, which he will be carefull to prevent hereafter.</p>

               </note>In <hi>France,</hi> the Marriage-Treaty was not so fair, smooth and plausible in the progress, as in the entrance. King <hi>Iames,</hi> admiring the Alliance of mighty Kings, though of a Contrary Religion, as also fearing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of another Breach, desired the Match unmeasurably; which the <hi>French</hi> well perceived, and abated of their forwardness, and enlarged their Demands in favor of <hi>Papists</hi> (as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had done before them) and strained the King to the Concession of such Immunities, as he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to his Parliament, that he would never grant upon the mediation of Forein Princes.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> being in the infancie of his favor, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the managing of the Treaty, assured the Catholicks of <hi>Great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Britain,</hi> that the most Christian King remembring that he was born and raised up no less for the propagation of the Catholick Cause, then for the enlarging of his own Dominions, was resolved to obtain honorable Terms for Religion, or never to conclude the Match: And for his own part, such was his compassion towards them, that if he might work their deliverance, or better their condition, not only with Counsel, interest and authority, but with his life and blood, he would gladly do it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Match with <hi>France</hi> concluded.</note>However, this Treaty held fewer moneths, then the years that were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> spent in that of <hi>Spain.</hi> Indeed, the Motion from <hi>England</hi> had a braver ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, seeing a Wife was here considered as the only object of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whereas that of <hi>Spain</hi> was accompanied with a further expectation, to wit, the rendring of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> to King <hi>Iames</hi> his children. In <hi>August</hi> the Match was concluded, and in <hi>November</hi> the Articles were sworne unto by King <hi>Iames,</hi> Prince <hi>Charls,</hi> and the French King. The Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion were not much short of those for the Spanish Match. The Conclusion of the Treaty was seconded in <hi>France</hi> with many outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Joy, as Bonfires and the like: Whereupon the Privy-Council sent to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> requiring the like to be done here.</p>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Lord Admiral, was required to employ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> those Ships that were now in the Narrow Seas, or in the Havens ready bound for any Voyage, for the Transporting this Army from <hi>Dover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> received his Commission from King <hi>Iames,</hi> bore date the Seventh of <hi>November,</hi> One thousand six hundred twenty and four, and was to this effect, That his Majesty at the Request of the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the Kings Sister his Wife, doth impower Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> to raise an Army for the recovering of the Estate and Dignity of the Prince Elector, and appoints that the Forces so raised should be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> under the Government of the said Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> for the end afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. And his Majesty further declares, by way of Negative, That he doth not intend that the said Count shall commit any spoil upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys or Dominions of any of his Majesties Friends and Allies; and more particularly, He doth require the said Count not to make any invasion, or do any act of War against the Countrey or Dominion, which of right appertain and are in truth, the just and lawful possession of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Lady <hi>Infanta Isabella:</hi> And in case any such Hostility <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> shall be acted contrary to this his Majesties intention, all such Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which shall be granted to that purpose by the said Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> his Majesty doth declare to be void; and that all payments shall cease: That on the contrary, if Obedience be given hereunto, the King wisheth the Count all good <hi>success</hi> for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the Peace in <hi>Germany</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and those that are the troublers of the Peace.</p>
            <p>And for the performance hereof, the King caused Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> take an Oath, That he would conform according to the Contents of the said Commission and Declaration of his Majesty; which Oath was almost in <hi>Terminis</hi> of what is before expressed.</p>
            <p>This Army consisting of Twelve Regiments, was intended to Land in <hi>France</hi>; but being ready for Transport, the French notwithstanding their Promise, and the Treaty of Marriage, demurred (yet not plainly denied) their passage.<note place="margin">Scarce the third part of Count <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> Army came safe to Land.</note> Nevertheless, the whole Army was shipped, and put over to <hi>Calice</hi>; and after a tedious stay in hope yet to land and pass <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> through the Countrey, they were forced to set sail for <hi>Zealand.</hi> Neither were they suffered to land there, coming so unexpectedly upon the <hi>States,</hi> and in a hard Season for Provision of Victuals.</p>
            <p>Thus they were long pent up in the Ships, and suffered the want of all Necessaries, by which means a <hi>Pestilence</hi> came among them, and raged extreamly; so that they were thrown into the Sea by <hi>Multitudes</hi>; insomuch, that scarce a Third part of the men were landed, the which also afterward mouldred away, and the Design came to nothing.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> after he had been troubled with a <hi>Tertian Fevor</hi> four Weeks, finding himself near the end of his days, called unto him <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> his onely Son, to whom he recommended the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> advised him to love his Wife, but not her Religion; and exhorted him to take special care of his Grand-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Children of the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> by his Daughter; and to employ the power he left him, to reestablish them in the Estate and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of their Father: And lastly, he recommended to him his Officers who had faithfully served him, and on the Seven and twentieth of <hi>March</hi> gave up the ghost.</p>

In his Apparel and Civil Garb, he seemed naturally to affect a Majestick carelesness, which was so Hectick, so Habitual in him, as even in Religious Exercises, where the Extern Demeanor is a grand part of that Sacred Homage, he was somewhat too incurious and irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> He was indulgent a little to his Palate, and had a smack of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; in Pecuniary Dispensations to his Favorites, he was excessive liberal; yea though the exigence of his own wants pleaded Retension. Studious he was of Peace, somewhat overmuch for a King, which many imputed to pusillanimity; and for certain, the thought of War was very terrible unto him; whereof there needs no further demonstration, then his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of the Cause of the <hi>Palatinate:</hi> For had he had the least scintilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Animosity or Majestick Indignation, would he have so long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his Son-in-Law exterminated from his Patrimony, while the <hi>Austri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Faction (to his great dishonor) cajoled and kept him in delusory Chat with specious fallacies? would he in those several Negotiations of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisle, Bristol, Belfast,</hi> and <hi>Weston,</hi> have trifled away so vast sums, the Moity whereof, had they been disposed in Military Levies, would have Modelled an Army able (when <hi>Heidelburgh, Manheim,</hi> and <hi>Frankendale</hi> defended themselves) to have totally dissipated all the Forces of the Usurpers, to have mastered the Imperious Eagle, enforcing her to forego her Quarry, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and reestated the <hi>Palsgrave?</hi> would he so shamefully have Courted the Alliance of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the very great regret of his Subjects whom his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors had so often baffled, and whom <hi>England</hi> ever found a worse Friend then Enemy? What stronger evidence can be given in of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful defect of Courage? As this lipothymie, this faint-heartedness, lost him the reputation and respects of his people; so his heavy pressures upon them, and undue Levies by Privy Seals, and the like, alienated their Affections, especially considering how those Moneys were mis-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> indeed rather thrown away; partly in the two dishonorable Treaties of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Consequential Entertainments; and partly in Largesses upon his Minion <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Between this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection and contempt in his people, there was generated a general dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to turbulent and boisterous Darings and Expostulations, even against his Darling Prerogative: And though those dismal calamities
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35668:93"/>
which befel his Son, were doubtless ampliated by a superfetation of Causes; yet was their first and main existency derivative from those semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalities. Let Court-Pens extol the calmness of his <hi>Halcyonian</hi> Reign with all artifice of Rhetorick, yet can they never deny but that admired Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity had its set in a Cloud; and that he left to his Successor, both an empty Purse and a Crown of Thorns.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> when King <hi>Iames</hi> was living, gave this Character <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of him.</p>
            <p>WHerefore representing Your Majesty many times unto my minde, and beholding you not with the eye of Presumption to discover that which the Scripture tells me, is inscrutable; but with the observant eye of Duty and Admiration, leaving aside the other parts of your Virtue and Fortune, I have been touched, yea, and possessed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with an extream wonder at these your Virtues and Faculties which the <hi>Philosophers</hi> call Intellectuals, [The largeness of your Capacity, the faithfulness of your Memory, the swiftness of your Apprehension, the penetration of your Judgment, and the facility and order of your Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.] And I have then thought, that of all the persons living that I have known, Your Majesty were the best instance to make a man of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s opinion, <hi>That all Knowledge is but Remembrance, and that the Minde of Man by Nature knoweth all things, and hath but her own Native and Original <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Notions (which by the strangeness and darkness of the Tabernacles of the Body, are sequestred) again revived and restored.</hi> Such a Light of Nature I have observed in your Majesty, and such a readiness to take flame and blaze from the least occasion presented; or the least spark of anothers Knowledge delivered. And as the Scripture saith of the wisest King, <hi>That his heart was as the Sand of the Sea,</hi> which though it be one of the largest Bodies, yet it consisteth of the smallest and finest Portions: So hath God given your Majesty a composition of Understanding admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> being able to compass and comprehend the greatest Matters, and nevertheless to touch and apprehend the least; wherein it should seem an impossibility in Nature for the same Instrument to make it self fit for great and small Works. And for your gift of Speech, I call to minde what <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> saith of <hi>Augustus Caesar, Augusto pros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uens &amp; quae Principem deceret Eloquentia fuit:</hi> For if we mark it well, Speech that is uttered with labor and difficulty; or Speech that savoreth of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of Arts and Precepts; or Speech that is framed after the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of some pattern of Eloquence, though never so excellent; all this hath somewhat servile and holding of the Subject. But your Majesties manner of Speech is indeed Prince-like, flowing as from a Fountain, and yet streaming and branching it self into Natures order, full of Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and Felicity, <hi>Imitating none, and inimitable by any, &amp;c.</hi> And there seemeth to be no little contention between the excellency of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties gifts of Nature, and the universality and perfection of your Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for I am well assured of this, that what I shall say is no amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> at all, but a positive and measured truth, which is, <hi>That there hath not been since Christs time, any King or Temporal Monarch, which hath been so learned in all Literature and Erudition, Divine and Humane</hi>: For let a man seriously and diligently revolve and peruse the Succession of the Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which <hi>Caesar</hi> the Dictator, who lived some years
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35668:93"/>
before Christ, and <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> were the best learned; and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to the Emperors of <hi>Graecia,</hi> or of the West, and then to the Lines of <hi>France, Spain, England, Scotland,</hi> and the rest, and he shall finde this Judgment truly made: For it seemeth much in a King, if by the compendious extractions of other Mens Wits and Learning, he can take hold of any superficial Ornaments and shews of Learning; or if he countenance or prefer Learning and Learned Men. But to drink indeed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the true Fountain of Learning, nay, to have such a Fountain of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in himself, in a King, and in a King born, is almost a miracle; and the more, because there is met in your Majesty a rare conjunction as well of Divine and Sacred Literature, as of Prophane and Humane. So as your Majesty stands invested of that Triplicity which in great veneration was ascribed to the Antient <hi>Hermes,</hi> The Power and Fortune of a King, the Knowledge and Illumination of a Priest, and the Learning and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of a Philosopher. This Propriety inherent and individual Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in your Majesty, deserveth to be expressed not onely in the Fame and Admiration of the present time, nor in the History or Tradition of the Ages succeeding, but also in some solid Work, fixed Memorial, and Immortal Monument, bearing a Character or Signature, both of the Power of a King, and the Difference and Perfection of such a King.</p>
            <q>Memoria Iusti cum laudibus, &amp; impiorum nomen putrescit.</q>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> He that hath lately writ the History of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> thus expresseth himself concerning King <hi>Iames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE was a King in understanding, and was content to have his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ignorant in many things; as in Curing the <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> which he knew a device to ingrandize the vertue of Kings when Miracles were in fashion; but he let the World believe it, though he smiled at it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in his own Reason, finding the strength of imagination a more powerful agent in the Cure, then the Plaisters his Surgeons prescribed for the Sore. It was a hard question, whither his Wisdom and Knowledge exceeded his Choler and Fear; certainly the last couple drew him with most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, because they were not acquisitious, but natural; if he had not had that allay, his high towering and mastering Reason had been of a rare and sublimed excellency; but these Earthly dregs kept it down, making his Passions extend him as far as Prophaneness (that I may not say Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and Policy superintendent of all his Actions, which will not last long, (like the violence of that humor) for it often makes those that know well, to do ill, and not be able to prevent it.</p>
            <p>He had pure Notions in Conception, but could bring few of them into action, though they tended to his own preservation; for this was one of his Apothegms which he made no timely use of, [<hi>Let that Prince that would beware of Conspiracies, be rather jealous of such whom his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary favors have advanced, then of those whom his displeasure hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> These want means to execute their pleasures, but they have means at pleasure to execute their desires.</hi>] Ambition to rule is more vehement then Malice to revenge: Though the last part of this Aphorism he was thought to practise too soon, where there were no causes for prevention and neglect too late when time was full ripe to produce the Effect.</p>
            <p>Some paralleld him to <hi>Tiberius</hi> for Dissimulation, yet Peace was
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:35668:94"/>
maintained by him, as in the time of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and Peace begot Plenty, and Plenty begot Ease and Wantonness, and Ease and Wantonness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got Poetry, and Poetry swelled to that bulk in his time, that it begot strange monstrons Satyrs against the Kings own person, that hanted both Court and Countrey; which expressed, would be too bitter to leave a sweet perfume behinde him. And though bitter ingredients are good to imbalm and preserve dead Bodies, yet these were such as might endanger to kill a living Name, if Malice be not brought in with an Antidote.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And the Tongues at those times more fluent then my Pen, made every little miscarriage (being notable to discover their true operations, like small Seeds hid in Earthy darkness) grow up and spred into such exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Branches, that evil report did often pearch upon them. So danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it is for Princes by a remiss comportment, to give growth to the least Error; for it often proves as fruitful as Malice can make it.</p>
            <p>But alass good King! Here was an end of his Earthly Empire, and little did he imagine that the last period to <hi>Great Britains</hi> Monarchy, should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not much exceed the time of his own Reign, and in the true extent come short of it.</p>
            <p>There is a Book said to be writ by a Knight of <hi>Kent,</hi> and intituled <hi>King James Court,</hi> which renders a further Character of that King; we forbear to particularize any thing thereof (no name being put to the Book) but leave the Reader to his freedom.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> then Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in his Sermon at King <hi>Iames</hi> Funeral, speaking of <hi>Solomon</hi> and King <hi>Iames,</hi> (his Text being 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.41, 42, 43.) hath these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</p>
            <p>I Dare presume to say, you never read in your lives, of two Kings more fully parallel'd amongst themselves, and better distinguished from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all other Kings besides themselves. King <hi>Solomon</hi> is said to be <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitus coram Matre sua,</hi> the onely Son of his Mother, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.3. So was King <hi>Iames. Solomon</hi> was of Complexion white and ruddy, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. So was King <hi>Iames. Solomon</hi> was an Infant-King, <hi>puer parvulus,</hi> a little Childe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.5. So was King <hi>Iames</hi> a King at the Age of Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Moneths. <hi>Solomon</hi> began his Reign in the life of his Predecessor, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.32. So, by the force and compulsion of that State, did our late Soveraign King <hi>Iames. Solomon</hi> was twice crowned and anointed a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> King, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.22. So was King <hi>Iames. Solomons</hi> Minority was rough through the quarrels of the former Soveraign; so was that of King <hi>Iames. Solomon</hi> was learned above all the Princes of the East, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.30. So was King <hi>Iames</hi> above all Princes in the Universal World. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was a Writer in Prose and Verse, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.32. So in a very pure and exquisite manner was our sweet Soveraign King <hi>Iames. Solomon</hi> was the greatest Patron we ever read of to Church and Churchmen; and yet no greater (<hi>let the House of</hi> Aaron <hi>now confess</hi>) then King <hi>Iames. Solomon</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> was honored with Ambassadors from all the Kings of the Earth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> And so you know was King <hi>Iames. Solomon</hi> was a main improver of his home Commodities, as you may see in his trading with <hi>Hiram,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.9. And God knows it was the daily study of King <hi>Iames. Solomon</hi> was a great maintainer of Shipping and Navigation, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.14.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:35668:94"/>
A most proper Attribute to King <hi>Iames. Solomon</hi> beautified very much his Capital City with Buildings and Water-works, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.15. So did King <hi>Iames.</hi> Every man lived in peace under his Vine and his Fig-Tree, in the days of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.25. And so they did in the blessed days of King <hi>Iames.</hi> And yet towards his end, King <hi>Solomon</hi> had secret enemies, <hi>Razan, Hadad,</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and prepared for a War upon his going to his Grave, as you may see in the Verse before my Text. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> So had, and so did King <hi>Iames.</hi> Lastly, Before any Hostile Act we read of in the History, King <hi>Solomon</hi> died in peace, when he had lived about Sixty years, as <hi>Lyra</hi> and <hi>Tostatus</hi> are of opinion; and so you know did King <hi>Iames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for his words and eloquence, you know it well enough; it was rare and excellent in the highest degree. <hi>Solomon</hi> speaking of his own faculty in this kinde, divides it into two several heads; a ready <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> and an easie <hi>Discharge</hi> and <hi>Expression</hi> of the same. <hi>God hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> me to speak as I would, and to conceive as is meet, for the things spoken of, Wisd.</hi> 7.15. And this was eminent in our late Soveraign. His Invention was as quick as his first Thoughts, and his Words as ready as his Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>God had given him to conceive</hi>; the Greek word in that place is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, to make an Enthymem or a short Syllogism; and that was his manner. He would first winde up the whole substance of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course into one solid and massie Conception; and then spred it and dilate it to what compass he pleased; <hi>Prosluenti &amp; quae Principem deceret eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>(as <hi>Tacitus</hi> said of <hi>Augustus</hi>) in a flowing and a Princely kinde of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Those <hi>Speeches</hi> of his in the Parliament, Star-Chamber, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Table, and other Publick Audiences of the State (of which, as of <hi>Tullies</hi> Orations, <hi>Ea semper optima, quae maxima,</hi> the longest still was held the best) do prove him to be the most powerful Speaker that ever swayed the Scepter of this Kingdom. In his Stile you may observe the <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> in his Figures the <hi>Canticles,</hi> in his Sentences the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and in his whole Discourse <hi>Reliquum verborum Solomonis,</hi> all the rest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that was admirable in the Eloquence of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How powerfully did he charge the Prince with the care of Religion and Justice, the two Pillars (as he termed them) of his future Throne? How did he recommend unto his love, the Nobility, the Clergy, and the Communalty in the general? How did he thrust, as it were, into his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bosom, his Bishops, his Judges, his near Servants, and that <note n="*" place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Buckin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham.</hi>
               </note> Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his whom he so loved in particular? and concluded with that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Advice to his Son, concerning that great act of his future Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>To marry like himself, and marry where he would:</hi> But if he did marry the Daughter of that King, he should marry her Person, but he should not marry her Religion.</p>
            <p>Having in our <hi>Collections</hi> met with the Transcript of a Letter from King <hi>Iames</hi> to Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> dated <hi>Anno</hi> 1599. We have thought fit (though it be not placed in order of time) to conclude his Reign with it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and with the Instructions given to Mr. <hi>Drummond</hi> who was sent with the same to <hi>Rome.</hi>

                           <p>MOst Holy Father, having understood by several Reports <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> how diligent the Rivals of our Condition have been, that the Sword of your Authority should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheathed against us, and with what constancy your Prudence hath hitherto refused it; we could do no less then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks for such a good turn recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; especially upon so fair an occasion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when the Bearer of these, a Scotchman by Nation, but a <hi>Roman</hi> by Adoption, was returning unto your Dominions; we recommend him to your Holiness (to whom for his good parts you have already been beneficial) that you would attentively hear him in those things which he shall deliver in our Name:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And because we know there is no better remedy against the Calumnies of ill Willers, (who by commemorating our injuries done to Catholicks procure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to us, and thank to themselves) then that some of our Countreymen Zealous of the Truth, though differing from the Religion which we have suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ek <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> from our Infancy, should have an honorable occasion of making their abode in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whom your Holiness may be certainly informed of the state of our Affairs. In this regard we recommend unto you the Bishop of <hi>Vazion,</hi> who as he doth impute whatsoever increase of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to your Holiness alone; so we are earnest Suitors, that for our sake especially, the honor of a Cardinals Cap may be added to his former ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. By this means the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of our Enemies will cease, when such are present with you, who may be able to assert the truth of our doings.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> We do not desire any of our actions should be concealed from just Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; for though we have been bred up in the truth of that Religion which we now profess, yet we have always

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> I Thank God,<note place="margin">The Kings Speech in Parliament.</note> that the Business to be treated on at this time is of such a nature, that it needs no Eloquence to set it forth; For I am neither able to do it, neither doth it stand with my Nature to spend much time in words. It is no new business, being already happily begun by my Father of blessed memory, who is with God; therefore it needeth no Narrative: I hope in God you will go on to maintain it, as freely as you advised my Father to it. It is true, He may seem to some to have been slack to begin so just and so glorious a work; but it was his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that made him loth to begin a work, until he might find a means to maintain it: But after that he saw how much he was abused in the confidence he had with other States, and was confirmed by your Advice to run the Course we are in, with your Engagement to maintain it, I need not press to prove how willingly he took your Advice; for, the Preparations that are made are better able to declare it, then I to speak it. The assistance of those in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Fleet that is ready for action, with the rest of the Preparations which I have only followed my Father <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in, do sufficiently prove that he entred into this Action.</p>
                        <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, I hope that you do remember that you were pleased to imploy me to advise my Father to break off those two Treaties that were on foot; so that I cannot say, that I came hither a free unengaged man. It's true, I came into this business willingly and freely like a Young man, and consequently rashly; but it was by your interest, your engagement: So that though it were done like a Young man, yet I cannot repent me of it, and I think none can blame me for it, knowing the love and fidelity you have borne to your King, having <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> my self likewise some little experience of your affections. I pray you remember, that this being my first Action, and begun by your Advice and intreaty, what a great Dishonor it were to you and me, if this Action so begun should fail for that Assistance you are able to give me. Yet knowing the constancie of your love both to me and this Business,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:35668:101"/>
I needed not to have said this, but only to shew what care and sense I have of your Honors and mine own. I must intreat you likewise to consider of the Times we are in, how that I must adventure your lives (which I should be loth to do) should I continue you here long; and you must venture the Business, if you be slow in your resolutions. Wherefore I hope you will take such grave Counsel, as you will expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite what you have in hand to do: Which will do me and your selves an infinite deal of honor; You, in shewing your love to me; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> me, that I may perfect that work which my Father hath so happily begun.</p>
                        <p>Last of all, Because some malicious men may, and as I hear, have given out, that I am not so true a Keeper and Maintainer of the true true Religion that I profess; I assure you that I may with <hi>S. Paul</hi> say, that I have been trained up at <hi>Gamaliels</hi> feet; And although I shall be never so arrogant as to assume unto my self the rest, I shall so far shew the end of it, that all the World may see, that none hath been,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> nor ever shall be more desirous to maintain the Religion I profess, then I shall be.</p>
                        <p>Now because I am unfit for much speaking, I mean to bring up the fashion of my Predecessors, to have my Lord Keeper speak for me in most things: Therefore I have commanded him to speak something unto you at this time, which is more for formality, then any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath to say unto you.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Supply:</hi> If Subsidies be thought too long and backward, his Majesty desires to hear, and not to propound the way.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Issue</hi> of <hi>Action</hi>; which being the first, doth highly concern his Majesties Honor and Reputation, for which he relies upon their Loves with the greatest confidence that ever King had in his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; witness his Royal Poesie, <hi>Amor Civium Regis Munimentum:</hi> And he doubts not but as soon as he shall be known in <hi>Europe</hi> to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> their King, so soon shall they be known to be a loving and loyal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:35668:101"/>After the House of Commons had setled their General Committees, there were various Debates amongst them: Some insisted upon the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances mentioned,<note place="margin">Debates in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> but not redressed by King <hi>Iames</hi> in the last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; others pressed for an accompt of the last Subsidies granted for reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; others for the putting of Laws in execution against Priests and Jesuits, and such as resorted to Ambassadors Houses, and the questioning of Mr. <hi>Richard Montague,</hi> for his Book intituled <hi>An Appeal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to Caesar</hi>; which (as they said) was contrived and published to put a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie between the King and his well-affected Subjects, and contained many things contrary to the Articles of Religion established by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that the whole frame thereof was an encouragement to Popery.</p>
            <p>Others again declared, how the King no sooner came to the Crown, but he desired to meet his people in Parliament, it being the surest way to preserve a right understanding between him and them; that since he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> began to reign, the Grievances are few or none; and when he was Prince, he was observed to be very instrumental in procuring things for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects benefit. Wherefore it will be the wisdom of this House to take a course to sweeten all things between King and People, and to express their duty to the King by giving Supply, and therewith to offer nothing but a Petition for Religion, that Religion and Subsidies may go hand in hand. And whatsoever they did, it was needful to do it quickly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how greatly the Plague increased, and the Bell was tolling every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> minute while they were speaking.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Montague</hi> was brought to the Bar of the Commons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> House for his fore-named Book.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> brought to the Bar.</note> This Cause began in the One and twentieth of King <hi>Iames,</hi> when he had published a former Book which he named <hi>A New Gagg for an Old Goose,</hi> in answer to a Popish Book, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>A Gagg for the New Gospel.</hi> The business was then questioned in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and committed to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ended in an Admonition given to <hi>Montague.</hi>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:35668:102"/>
Ministers pretended, that the Ships should be employed onely against <hi>Genoa</hi>; but afterwards the Protestants in <hi>France</hi> intimating their suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the design for <hi>Italy</hi> was a meer pretence to make up an Army to fall upon the <hi>Rochellers</hi> and others of the Religion, King <hi>Iames</hi> willing to perform his promise, and yet to secure the Protestants, directed, that the greater number of those that served in the Ships should be English, whereby he might keep the power in his own hands.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> For the performance of this Engagement, the forenamed Ships were at this time commanded to the Coasts of <hi>France:</hi> Nevertheless there wanted a sufficient care to prevent the abusing and inslaving them to the designs of the French King. Captain <hi>Iohn Pennington,</hi> the Admiral of this Fleet, was much unsatisfied, and presented to the Duke of <hi>Buckin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham,</hi> Lord High Admiral, his Exceptions to the Contract between his Majesty and that King, and chiefly for that the Companies were bound to fight at the French Kings Command, against any Nation except their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> own; and that the French might put aboard them as many of their own people as they pleased. The Vantguard arived at <hi>Deep,</hi> but the rest lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred behinde; for, the Companies understanding that the French design was to surprise the Ships and to block up the Harbor of <hi>Rochel,</hi> resolved to sink rather, then go against those of their own Religion. Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> received Letters from the Duke, and a Warrant from Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Conway</hi> in the Kings Name, to command him to deliver up the Ships to the hands of such Frenchmen as his Christian Majesty shall appoint, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but withal directing him not to dissert his charge, by which latter passage he was willing to understand, that it was not the Dukes intention that he should dispossess himself and his Companies of them; for he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his Grace had no such unjust thought as to continue him there alone.</p>
            <p>These Orders were delivered unto him by the hands of the French Ambassador, together with a Letter from the French King, which will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to receive his Soldiers, and his Admiral, the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and joyn with his Fleet against his Rebellious Subjects. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Ambassador urged the Surrender of the Ship, and nothing would satisfie him, but a present possession, and a discharge of the English Soldiers, save a very few, in case they were willing to be entertained in the service. <hi>Pennington</hi> after much dispute, although he were promised an ample reward in Money to be given him at the Surrender, and of a Royal Pension during his life, came to this resolute Answer; That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an express and clear Warrant he would not surrender nor discharge a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> man of his Company. Whereupon the French Ambassadors Secretary came two several times to the Ship to protest against the Captain, as a Rebel to his King and Countrey; but at the making of the last Protest, which was accompanied with threatning Speeches, the Soldiers and Mariners grew into such a fury and tumult, that they got up their Anchors and set fail for <hi>England,</hi> saying, They would rather be hanged at home, then surrender the Ship or be Slaves to the French, and fight against their own Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> All which Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> did not gainsay nor oppose; but when they came to Anchor in the <hi>Downs,</hi> he advertised the Duke of all that had hapned, and craved further direction, but complained of the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of this Engagement, assuring him, That the Mariners would rather be hanged, then return again into <hi>France:</hi> So in all the rest of the Ships, the Captains and Companies utterly refused the Service, and protested
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:35668:103"/>
against it, though they were tempted with Chains of Gold, and other Rewards.</p>

Moreover in the present case, they alleage, that in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth when the Clergy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Kings Supremacy, the Submission was so resolved, That in case of any difference in the Church, the King and the Bishops were to

determine the Matter in a <hi>National Synod</hi>; and if any other Judge in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrine be now allowed, we depart from the Ordinance of Christ, and the continual practice of the Church.

They say further, That King <hi>Iames</hi> in his rare wisdom and judgment approved all the Opinions in this Book; and that most of the contrary Opinions were debated at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and ready to be published, but were suppressed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and so continued, till of late they received countenance at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> which was a Synod of another Nation; and to us no ways binding, till received by Publick Authority.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Such was the Opinion of these forenamed Bishops; but others of Eminent Learning were of a different Judgment.</p>

                        <p>THat our Soveraign Lord King <hi>Iames</hi> of Famous Memory, at the Suit of both Houses of Parliament, and by the powerful operation of his Majesty that now is, gave consent to break off the Two Treaties with <hi>Spain,</hi> touching the Match and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and to vindicate the many wrongs and scorns done unto his Majesty and his Royal Children: Besides, if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> were suffered to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in his Conquests under pretence of the Catholick Cause, he would become the Catholick Monarch which he so much affects, and aspires unto. Also amidst these Necessities, our late King considered, That he might run a hazard with his people, who being so long inured to Peace, were unapt to War; that the uniting with other Provinces in this undertaking, was a Matter of exceeding Difficulty. This drew him to new Treaties for regaining his Children right, which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed by the Friends and Agents of <hi>Spain</hi>; and wherein his Majesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> proceeded as far as the wisest Prince could go, and suffered himself to be won unto that which otherwise was impossible for his Royal Nature to endure. He considered also the many Difficulties abroad, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> by Force and Contract had the <hi>Palatinate</hi> in his own posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, most of the Electors and Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were joyned with him. The Estates of the other Princes most likely to joyn in a War of Recovery, were seized and secured, and all by a Conquering Army: Besides, the Emperor had called a Diet, in which he would take away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all possibility of recovering the Honor and Inheritance of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; thus it stood in <hi>Germany.</hi> And in <hi>France</hi> the King there chose to sheath his Sword in the Bowels of his own Subjects, rather then to declare against the Catholick Cause. In the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> the Sect of the <hi>Arminians</hi> prevailed much, who inclined to the <hi>Papists</hi> rather then to their own safety, notwithstanding that the Enemy had a great and powerful Army near them; so that his Majesty was inforced to Protect and Countenance them with an Army of Six thousand from hence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with a Caution of the like Supply from thence, if required. Moreover he sought Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> by a Match for his Royal Majesty that now is, thereby to have Interest in that King, and to make him a Party. The last consideration was his Majesties own Honor, who had labored with the two Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> Princes, from whom he received but cold Answers; they refusing to joyn, unless they first saw his Majesty in the Field. But of this he was very tender, unless the League were broken, or he first warred upon. The Forces of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> an Army were considered, and the way of proceeding, whether by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion</hi> or <hi>Diversion:</hi> The Charges thereof appeared in Parliament to be Seven hundred thousand pounds a year; besides, <hi>Ireland</hi> was to be fortified, the Forts here repaired, and a Navy prepared; he thought it feasible to enter into a League with the French King, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi>

Hereupon an Army was committed to Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> the charge whereof came to Seventy thousand pounds a Moneth for his Majesties part; also he commanded the preparing of this great Fleet: All which so heartned the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> that they sent Ambassadors to the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi>; and those two Kings offered a greater Army both of Horse and Foot, to which his Majesty was to pay a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. Count <hi>Mansfields</hi> Army (though disastrous) produced these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> happy effects; First, It prevented the Diet intended by the Emperor. Secondly, The <hi>German</hi> Princes gained new courage to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and oppose their Enemies. Thirdly, The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> hath raised an Army, with which he is marched in person as far as <hi>Minden.</hi> Moreover, the Confederates of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have prosecuted a War in <hi>Milan,</hi> and Peace is now made by the French King with his own Subjects; so that by this means breath is given to our Affairs.</p>
                        <p>This Parliament is not called in meer Formality upon his Majesties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> first coming to the Crown, but upon these Real Occasions to consult with the Lords and Commons; Two Subsidies are already given, and gratiously accepted; but the Moneys thereof, and much more are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready disbursed.

and that it is was not usual to grant Subsidies upon Subsidies in one Parliament, and no Grievances redressed. There were many Reflections upon the Dukes miscarriages; likewise they reassumed the Debate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Montague</hi>; and they resolved, That Religion should have the first place in their Debates; and next unto it, the Kingdoms Safety, and then Supplies. Other particulars were likewise insisted on, That the King be desired to Answer in full Parliament to the Petition concerning Religion, and that his Answer be Inrolled with the force of an Act of Parliament:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Also that the House consider of the new prepared Fleet and Army, and whither intended, no Enemy being yet declared; That great Sums of Money were given for places, to the value of an Hundred and forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds at least; that the King should contribute to help the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> Cause with his own Estate; that the time of the year was too far spent for the Fleet to go forth in Service; that inquiry be made, whether the Duke brake not the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> out of Spleen and Malice to Conde <hi>Olivares</hi>; whether he made not the Match with <hi>France</hi> upon harder terms; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and whether the Ships lent against <hi>Rochel</hi> were not maintained with the Subsidies given for the relief of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; that an Advised Counsel for the Government of the present Affairs, and to look into the Kings Estate, is necessary; that his Majesty be desired to give his Answer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Imposition on Wines; and Select Committees draw out these Heads at large to be presented to the King: The doing whereof, they said was no Capitulation with his Majesty, but an ordinary Parliamentary course: Without which, the Commonwealth could never supply the King,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nor indeed subsist.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Commons had a Conference with the Lords, desiring their Concurrence in presenting to the King, these Matters following.</p>

And further, That divers Copies of Letters and other Papers being found in the house of one <hi>Mary Estmonds</hi> in <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> by two Justices of Peace, who thereupon tendred her the Oath of Alleagiance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and upon her refusal committed her to the Constable, from whom she made an escape, and complained to the King. The Principal Secretary did write to those two Justices in favor of her.</p>
            <p>Upon these Passages the Commons made Observations; first, upon the date of the Pardon, which was the next day after his Majesties An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by the Lord Keeper to their Petition concerning Religion; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the Pardon dispenced with several Laws, as of the 21 and 27 of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and of the Third of King <hi>Iames,</hi> provided to keep <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Subjects in due obedience; thirdly, That the Pardon was signed by the Principal Secretary of State; and therefore the Commons declared, that these actings tended to the prejudice of true Religion, his Majesties dishonor, the discountenancing of the Ministers of Justice, the grief of the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the animating of the Popish party, who by such examples grew more

proud and insolent, and to the discouragement of the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: All which they humbly desire his Majesty to take into due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and to give effectual and speedy Redress therein.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Conway</hi> principal Secretary of State, being called to give an Accompt of this business, answered, That he ever hated the Popish Religion; That the Pardon was granted before the King answered their Petition, though it bore not date till afterwards; That the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the doing thereof, and that no Fees should be taken; That he was commanded by the King to write a Letter in favor of the Woman in <hi>Dorset-shire,</hi> and what he did therein was to take off all scandal from the King, though it lighted upon himself.</p>
            <p>This Conference no sooner ended, but both Houses were ordered to meet at <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> to receive an Answer to their Petition concerning Religion; To every Clause whereof his Majesty answered in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary way.

            <p>The Petition and Answer being read, it was further intimated to the Commons, That as his Majesty took well their minding him of the care of Religion, so he would have done and granted the same things, though they had never petitioned him; neither doth he place his Answer to this Petition, as a wheel to draw on other affairs and designs, but he leaves them to move in their own Sphere; and what he hath done in this particular comes from these two Fountains, Conscience, and Duty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to his Father, who in his last speech recommended unto him the Person, but not the Religion of his Queen.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Duke renders an account to both Houses of the Fleet.</note>At the same time the Duke signified to both Houses, that by the Kings command, he was to give an account of the Fleet, and the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations thereof; and said, that the first and last time he had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to speak in that Auditory, it was of the Spanish Treaty, and then he was so happy, as to be honored and applauded by both Houses of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; and he made no question, but speaking now with the same heart,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he should be no less acceptable to them.</p>
            <p>And he made this request to the House of Commons, to believe, that if any hath spoken, or shall speak in discharge of his conscience, his zeal of Reformation, any thing which may seem to reflect upon some particular persons, he shall be the last man that will apply this to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, because he is confidently assured of two things: first, that they are just not to fall upon him without cause; and secondly, that himself shall do nothing that unbecomes a faithfull Englishman.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:35668:108"/>Object. 1. <hi>By what Counsel those Designs and Actions of War were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and enterprised?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By the Counsel of the Parliament appointed according to the Act of both Houses, the 23. of <hi>March</hi> 1623. by those Counsels his Majesty was guided, and applied himself accordingly for the defence of the Realm, the securing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the assisting of our Neighbors and others our Friends and Allies, and for the setting forth the Navy-Royal. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> His Majesty looking into his purse, saw enough to do all the former Actions, but not this latter: For when he came to consider of the Navy, there was neither money nor preparations; yet looking upon the Affairs of <hi>Christendom,</hi> he found that of most necessity: Hereupon his Majesty of famous memory did him (<hi>viz.</hi> the Duke) the honor, as to write from <hi>Newmarket</hi> to him at <hi>London</hi> a Letter to this effect; That looking into the Affairs of <hi>Christendom,</hi> he found it necessary, that a Royal-Fleet shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d be prepared and set in readiness, but that he had no Money; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wherefore himself (meaning the Duke) and his Friends must begin to lay it out, and no doubt but others would follow; and by this means the King might lie the longer concealed and undiscovered in the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, as bearing the name of the Subject onely, and other Princes in hope to draw him on, would sooner come to the business.</p>
            <p>Upon this Letter, the Duke said, he leaped into the Action with all alacrity, and having received all he had from his Majesty, was most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous, and held it a happiness to pour it out upon his service and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and had laid out of his own purse Four and forty thousands pounds; and the Treasurer of the Navy, at his request, had laid out Fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds; that he entred not into this business upon his own head, but fortified with the Advice and Counsel of those worthy persons, the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> the Lord <hi>Chichester,</hi> Lord <hi>Grandison,</hi> Lord <hi>Carew,</hi> Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Mansel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Cook.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their last consultation was of the War, next of the means; but both one and the other was justified by more then himself; he never did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> any thing but by them; he either repairing unto them, or else they did him the honor to resort to his Chamber; afterward the business, with the Kings leave, was imparted to all the Lords of the Council, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was made unto them, and allowed by them, who said there open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Majesty being present, that if this were put in execution, it would do well, and gave some Attribute unto it.</p>
            <p>And Sir <hi>Iohn Cook</hi> justified the shewing and the approving of these Accounts at the Council Table; the Accounts consisted of long particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Souldiers to be levied, Mariners to be pressed, forwarding of Ships and provisions, and that nothing wanted but Money.</p>
            <p>He proceeded yet further, and shewed, that he was so Religious to guide these great Affairs by Council, as that at his journey into <hi>France,</hi> which fell out about this time, he desired his Majesty to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the business to a select Council, which his Majesty did, who in his absence took care of the same.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>Why did not his Majesty declare the Enemy presently upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> granting those three Susidies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> His Majesty considered the State of <hi>Christendom</hi> at that Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and found it full of danger to declare the Enemy for three Reasons: First, because the great Enemy would be more prepared; secondly, <hi>Spain</hi> being the Enemy, our Merchants goods would be imbarged which are now drawing home; thirdly, our Friends finding us so long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:35668:109"/>
after our Declaration, would never believe any reality in our intentions.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>Whether a considerable sum of money be yet required?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Forty thousand pounds is yet necessary, but our Master is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted, his Treasure anticipated, his Lands pawned, his Plate offered to be pawned, but not accepted, and yet his Majesty must be maintained.</p>
            <p>Object. 4. <hi>Why was not this want of Money foreseen, but now onely thought upon unexpectedly, and dangerously considering the sickness?</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It was foreseen before, but interrupted by unfortunate acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; the death of the late King; the Funeral, which for decency could follow no sooner; the Journey into <hi>France,</hi> and the Marriage, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured more delay then was expected, but necessary.</p>
            <p>At the opening of the Parliament his Majesty did declare this Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and told the House plainly, that this sitting must not be for Counsel, but Resolution; and when he understood the grant of two Subsidies, he conceived that money to be a matter of Custom to welcom him to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Crown.</p>
            <p>Object. 5. <hi>Who gave counsel to his Majesty so suddenly when the sickness was so dangerously spread, to convene this Parliamant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> His Majesty commanded him (the Duke) to say, that it was the business it self that gave this counsel, and the necessity of it, else his Majesty would not have hazarded the two Houses nor the rest of the Kingdom, if he had been able any way without the Parliaments Supply to set out the Navy.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>Object. 6. <hi>Is not the time of the year too far spent for the Navy to go forth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The King answered this formerly, better half the Navy perish then the going thereof should be stayed; it would argue such want of Counsel, Courage and Experience in the Design, such beggerliness in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to go through with it, that it may not be diverted, the season of the year suiting with the Design, as could be demonstrated, if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign might not be published thereby.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>Object. 7. <hi>Whether those Eight Ships lent to the French King, which were imployed against the Rochellers, were not paid with the Subsidy-money?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Those Eight Ships were imployed at the charge of the French King: Secondly, it is not alway fit for Kings to give account of their Counsels; judge the thing by the event.</p>
            <p>Object. 8. <hi>Whether the Duke, having been our Servant to break the Match with</hi> Spain, <hi>made not a worse Match with</hi> France; <hi>and upon harsher terms?</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I hope the contrary will appear by the Answer to your Petition.</p>
            <p>Object. 9. <hi>Did not the Duke serve us in breaking the two Treaties with</hi> Spain, <hi>out of spleen and malice to</hi> Conde Olivares?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There was no cause to hate <hi>Olivares,</hi> who was the means to make him happy; for out of his hands came those papers by which the Duke gained the love of this Nation, which before thought not so well of him; he was not vindicative in his Nature; he can forgive those which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> had no such natural respect to their Country, as <hi>Olivares</hi> had; neither doth the Duke love that any man should be an instrument by ill means to do a good Action, as <hi>Olivares</hi> intended to serve his Master and Kingdom by indirect means; and he could make a proof, that he was not vindicative, he can forgive one of our own Nation that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:35668:109"/>
concurred with <hi>Olivares,</hi> but he was minded to leave that business asleep, which if it should awake, would prove a Lion to devour him, who (as he said) he meant one of our <note n="*" place="margin">The Earl of Bristol.</note> Nation, who cooperated with <hi>Olivares.</hi>
            </p>

                        <p>Others were of a contrary minde, and said, It was requisite to present to his Majesty the means how he may live glorious at home, and how he may be feared abroad, by having his Designs better mannaged, and an Enemy Declared: Then may spurs be added to the Sea-horse, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> King of <hi>Spain</hi> infested at a lesser charge, and we better secured from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists at home, whose hearts are knit with the Spaniard, and whose Estates may liberally contribute to the War; and the great Sums given for Honors and Offices, would go far in setting forth a Fleet at Sea, and the Subject not be always importuned for Supply.

            <p>Others replied, that <hi>Necessity</hi> is a dangerous Counsellor, and is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Argument of Supplies in all Parliaments; that those Counsellors who have put the King and Kingdom into such a Necessity and hazard, ought to answer for it, whosoever they be; that if the State of things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> will not admit a Redress of Grievances, surely there is not so much neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity for money; to give Subsidy upon Subsidy in one Parliament is not usual; in the Eighteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, there was one punished for pressing of more Subsidies, when Subsidies had been granted before in that Parliament. In the end it was proposed, that a Report be made to the King, that they have regard to his Honor, Necessity and Safety, and the safety of the Kingdom, and that they will assist his Majesty in any honorable Action, grounded upon sound Councils; and that something <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be drawn up in writing to that purpose; accordingly the House agreed upon a short Declaration, which was assented unto without a Negative.</p>

It is wondred at, that since the King did give such great Gifts to the Duchess of <hi>Chevereux,</hi> and those that then went, how now a small Sum in the Parliament should be called for at such an unseasonable time: And let the Parliament sit when it will, begin they will where they ended. They say, the Lords of the Council knew nothing of Count <hi>Mansfield's</hi> Iourney, or this Fleet; which discontents even the best sort, if not all. They say, it is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> very great burden your Grace takes upon you, since none knows any thing but you: It is conceived, that not letting others bear part of the burden you now bear, it may ruine you, (which Heaven forbid.) Much discourse there is of your Lordship here and there, as I passed home and back; And nothing is more wondred at, then that one Grave man is not known to have your ear, except my good and Noble Lord <hi>Conway.</hi> All men say, if you go not with the Fleet, you will suffer in it: because if it prosper, it will be thought no act of yours; and if it succeed ill, they say it might have been better, had not you guided the King. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> They say, your undertakings in the Kingdom will much prejudice your Grace: And if God bless you not with goodness as to accept kindly what in duty and love I here offer, questionless my freedom in letting you know the discourse of the world, may much prejudice me. But if I must lose your favor, I had rather lose it for striving to do you good in letting you know the talk of the wicked world, then for any thing else; so much I heartily desire your prosperity, and to see you trample the ignorant multitude under foot. All I have said is the Discourse of the World; and when I am able to judge of Actions, I will freely tell your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> my mind: Which when it shall not always incline to serve you, may all Noble thoughts forsake me.</p>

            <p>The Fleet, after four days sail, was encountred with a furious storm, which so dissipated the Ships, that of Fourscore no less then Fifty were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> missing for seven days. Afterwards they all came together upon the Coasts of <hi>Spain,</hi> where they found a Conquest ready, the Spanish Shipping in the Bay of <hi>Cadez,</hi> the taking whereof was granted feasible and easie, and would have satisfied the Voyage both in point of honor and profit: This was either neglected, or attempted preposterously. Then the Army landed, and Sir <hi>Iohn Burroughs</hi> took a Fort from the <hi>Spaniard</hi>; but the Soldiers finding good store of Spanish Wines, abused themselves, and hazarded the ruine of all, (had the Enemy known in what condition they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were) notwithstanding all Commands to the contrary. So they were presently shipp'd again; and the General putting to Sea, intended to wait about Twenty days for the Plate-Fleet, which was daily expected from the <hi>West-Indies:</hi> But the evil condition of his Men, by reason of a general Contagion, enforced him to abandon the hopes of this great Prize. So the English having effected nothing, returned home with dishonor in <hi>November</hi> following.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The General examined before the Council.</note>It gave no small occasion of clamor, That a Fleet so well provided <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and manned should land their men in an Enemies Country, and return without some honorable Action. But where the fault lay, hath not been yet adjudged, neither was any ever punished for failing in that duty. The General for some time was not admitted into the Kings presence, and some of the Colonels of his Army accused him, and some Seamen ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated the Accusation: The General was examined before the Council, and laid the fault on others in the Fleet, who let the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Ships pass without fighting them according to Order: They on the other hand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> said, they had no Order from their General to fight. Thus was there fend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proving, which contributed little to salve the dishonor which the Nation sustained by this unprofitable and ill-managed Design.</p>

forth to command that no Soldiers of the Fleet should depart from their Colours, or be discharged of their Service, till the King shall signifie his pleasure, how and when he will use their further Service. So the Forces that returned from <hi>Cades</hi> were kept on foot, and dispersed into several parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>There was also a strict Commandment,<note place="margin">Trade pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited with <hi>Spain.</hi>

Moreover, in regard of the Subjects apparent danger, and the encouragement of the Enemies of this State, by putting Ships to Sea, being weakly manned and ill furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the King ordained that none should set forth any Ship or Pinnace of the burthen of Threescore Tuns or upwards, unless they furnish the same with serviceable Muskets and Bandaliers, sufficient for the arming of half <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the number of persons that sail therein, together with a quantity of Ammunition answerable to the length of their intended Voyage.</p>

The King being cloathed in White Sattin, went under a rich Canopy, supported by the Barons of the Cinque <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Ports, the King having on each hand a Bishop, and his Train of Purple-Velvet was carried up by the Master of the Robes, and the Master of the Wardrobe. At the entring into the Church, Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> delivered into the Kings hands the Staff of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, with which the King walked up to the Throne; then the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented his Majesty to the Lords and Commons there present, East, West, North, and South, who gave their consent to his Coronation, as their lawful Soveraign.

            <p>Then the King arose and was lead to the Communion Table, where he takes a Solemn Oath in sight of all the People, to observe all the Premisses, and laying his hand upon the Bible, said,</p>

            <p>After the Oath, the King was placed in the Chair of Coronation, and was Anointed by the Archbishop with a costly Ointment, and the Antient Robes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor was put upon him, and the Crown of King <hi>Edward</hi> was put upon his Head, and his Sword girt about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him; and he offered the same, and two Swords more, together with Gold and Silver at the Communion Table.

with his Privy Council, was resolved to meet his People in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And no sooner did the heavy hand of that Destroying Angel forbear those deadly strokes, which for some time did make this place inaccessible, but his Majesty presently resolved to recal it, and hath now brought you together, and in a happy time, I trust, to treat and consult with uniform Desires and united Affections, of those things that concern the general good.</p>

And it is his Majesties care and study, that his people may see with comfort and joy of heart, that this Fountain is not dry, but they and their Posterity may rest assured and confident in his time, to receive as ample benefit from this Fountain, by his Majesties Mercy and Justice, as ever Subjects did in the time of the most eminent Princes amongst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his Noble Progenitors; wherein, as his Majesty shews himself most sensible of the good of the Publick, so were it an injury to this great and honorable Assembly, if it should be but doubted, that they shall not be as sensible of any thing that may adde to his Majesties honor: which cannot but receive a high degree of Love and Affection, if his Majesty succeeding so many Religious, Wise, and Renowned Princes, should begin his Reign with some Additions unto those good Laws which their happy and glorious times have afforded. And this his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hath caused me to desire at this time, especially above others; for his Majesty having at his Royal Coronation, lately solemnized the Sacred Rites of that Blessed Marriage between his people and him; and therein by a most holy Oath, vowed the Protection of the Laws, and Maintenance of Peace both to Church and People, no time can be so fit for his Majesty to advise and consult at large with his people, as this present time, wherein so lately his Majesty hath vowed Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his People, and they have protested their Alleagiance and Service <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to him.</p>

                        <p>If we behold the frame and the face of the Government in general, we live under a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> the best of Governments, the nearest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance unto the <hi>Divine Majesty</hi> which the Earth affords, the most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> agreeable to Nature, and that in which other States and Republicks do easily fall and reverse into the Ocean, and are naturally dissolved as into their <hi>Primam Materiam.</hi> The <hi>Laws</hi> by which we are governed, are above any value my words can set upon them; time hath refined and approved them; they are equal at least to any Laws Humane, and so curiously framed and fitted, that as we live under a temperate climate, so the Laws are temperate, yielding a due observance to the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Royal, and yet preserving the Right and Liberty of the Subject; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> That which <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith of two of the best Emperors, <q>

                           </q>, and so far is this from the least diminution of Soveraigns, that in this your Majesty is truly stiled <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and the greatest King in the World, that is King of such and so many Free-born Subjects, whose persons you have not onely power over, but, which is above the greatest of Kings, to command their hearts. If time or corruption of manners breed any Mists or Grievance, or discover any defects in the Law, they are soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by Parliament, the greatest Court of Justice, and the greatest Council of the Kingdom, to which all other Courts and Councils are subordinate. Here your Royal Person sits inthroned in the Seat of Majesty, attended by a Reverend and Learned Prelacy, a great and full Nobility inthroned like Stars in the Firmament;

some of a greater, some of a lesser magnitude, full of light and beauty, and acknowledging to whom they owe their lustre; and by a choise number of worthy Knights and Gentlemen that represent the whole body of your Commons. But to leave generals; We live not under a Monarchy only the best of Goverments, and under a Government the best of Monarchies, but under a King the best of Monarchs. Your Royal Person, and those eminent graces and vertues which are inherent in your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Person, (in whom Greatness and Goodness contend for superiority) it were presumption in me to touch, though with never so good a meaning; they will not be bounded within the narrow compass of my discourse: And such Pictures of such a King are not to be made in Limning, but for Publick things and actions which the least eye may see and discern, and in them obliquely and by reflexion cheerfully and with comfort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your Person.

Fathers will tell it to their children in succession; After-ages will then think it a Fable. Your piety to the Memory of your dear Father, in following and bedew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Herse with your tears, is full in every mans memory. The <hi>Publick Humiliation</hi> when Gods hand lay heavy upon us, and the late <hi>Publick Thanksgiving</hi> to Almighty God for removing his hand, both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and performed in person by your Majesty, is a work in piety not to be forgotten, and I trust the Lord will remember them and reward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them with mercy and blessing to your Majesty and the whole Kingdom. Your love to Justice, and your care in the administration of Justice, we all behold with comfort and rejoice to see it; The great Courts of Justice from the highest to the lowest furnished with Judges of that wisdom and gravity, learning and integrity: The Thrones of Kings are established by Justice; and may it establish, and I doubt not but it will establish the Throne of your Majesty in your Person and in your Royal Line, to the end of time. But above all, and indeed it is above all as far as Heaven is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> distant from Earth, your care and zeal for the advancement of Gods true Religion and Worship, are cleerly and fully exprest and do appear both in your Person, and by your many Publick Acts and Edicts. It is true that is said of Princes, <hi>Quod faciunt, praecipiunt:</hi> Of your Majesty both are true, and a Proposition made convertible. We have received a most gracious Answer from your Majesty to all our late Petitions concerning Religion, seconded with a Publick Declaration under the Great Seal, and Inrolled in all the Courts of Justice, for your Royal pleasure and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> direction to awaken and put life into these Laws by a careful Execution, with provision that the Penalties be not converted to your Private Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, (and yet the Coffers of Kings are not Private Coffers) but by your express direction set apart to Publick uses, such as concern the immediate Defence of the Kingdom, wherein we all have our share and interest. Your Royal Proclamation hath commanded those Romish Priests and Jesuites to Banishment, those Incendiaries that infect the State of this Church and Commonwealth. Their very entrance into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this Kingdom, is by a just and provident Law made Treason; their aims being in truth (how specious soever their pretences be) nothing else but to plot and contrive Treason against the State, and to seduce your Natural born Subjects from their true obedience, nourishing in their posterities Factions and Seditions: Witness those many Treasons and Conspiracies against the person of that glorious Lady, whose

memory will never die; and that horrible matchless Conspiracie, the <hi>Powder-Treason,</hi> the Master-piece of the Devil. But God that preserved her and your Royal Father against all their treacherous Conspiracies, and hath given you a heart to honor him, will honor and preserve you: Religion will more truly keep your Kingdoms, then the Seas do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass them: It is the joy of heart to your Majesties loyal and well-affected Subjects, and will ever be the honor of your Regal Diadem, and the Crown of your Crown. The Spanish Invasion in <hi>Eighty Eight</hi> I hope <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> will ever be remembred in <hi>England,</hi> with thankful acknowledgment to God for so great a deliverance: And I assura my self it is remembred in <hi>Spain,</hi> but with another mind, a mind of Revenge; they are too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to their Counsels, to acquit their Resolutions and Purposes that drew on that Attempt.

            <p>The Reasons are,</p>
            <p>The uncheerfulness we have either to adventure our purses or persons, occasioned by a distrust we have of the success, the want of the like Courses and Councils that were formerly used.</p>

                           <hi>The Answer to the Gagg,</hi> and in his other Book, called, <hi>The Appeal,</hi> doth advisedly maintain and affirm, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is and ever was a True Church since it was a Church.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Whereas in the same Homily it is likewise declared, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles; and in the Eight and twentieth Article of the said Articles, That Transubstantiation overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in the Five and twentieth of the same Article, That five other reputed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not to be accounted Sacraments; yet contrary and repugnant hereunto, he, the said <hi>Richard Montague,</hi> doth maintain and affirm in his Book aforesaid, called, <hi>The Answer to the Gagg,</hi> That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ever remained firm upon the same Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Sacraments and Doctrine instituted by God.</p>
                        <p n="3">III.

chosen in Christ out of mankinde, and to bring them by Christ to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Salvation; wherefore they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be called according to Gods purpose, working in due season, they through Grace obey the Calling, they be justified freely, walk Religiously in good works, and at length by Gods mercy attain to everlasting felicity: He, the said <hi>Richard Montague,</hi> in the said Book, called <hi>The Appeal,</hi> doth maintain and affirm, That men justified may fall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> away, and depart from the state which once they had; they may arise Again, and become new men possibly, but not certainly nor necessarily. and the better to countenance this his opinion, he hath in the same Book wilfully added, falsified and charged divers words of the sixteenth of the Articles before mentioned, and divers other words, both in the Book of Homilies, and in the Book of Common-Prayer, and so misrecited, and changed the said places he doth alleadge in the said Book, called, <hi>The Appeal,</hi> endeavouring thereby to lay a most wicked and malicious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> scandal upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as if he did herein differ from the Reformed Churches of <hi>England,</hi> and from the Reformed Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, and did consent to those pernitious Errors, which are commonly called Arminianism, and which the late famous Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> of happy memory, did so piously and diligently labour to suppress.</p>

            <p>That the Scope and end of the said <hi>Richard Montague</hi> in the Books <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> before mentioned, is to give encouragement to Popery, and to withdraw his Majesties Subjects from the true Religion established, to the Roman Superstition, and consequently to be reconciled to the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi>; All which he laboreth by subtile and cunning ways, whereby Gods True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath been much scandalized, those Mischiefs introduced which the wisdom of many Laws hath endeavored to prevent, the Devices and Practices of his Majesties Enemies have been furthered and advanced, to the great peril and hazard of our Soveraign Lord the King, and of all his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Dominions and loving Subjects.</p>

            <p>It was declared by Sir <hi>Tho. Wentworth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Noy,</hi> and other Lawyers in the Debate, That there was a difference between Common Fame and Rumor: For the General voice <hi>(Vox populi)</hi> is Common Fame: And if Common Fame might not be admitted as an Accuser, Great men would be the onely safe men; for no Private person dare adventure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to enquire into their Actions: But the House of Commons is a House of Information and Presentment, but not a House of Definitive Judgment.</p>
            <p>So the House came to this Resolution; <hi>That Common Fame is a good ground of Proceeding for this House, either by Enquiry, or presenting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint (if the House finds cause) to the King or Lords.</hi>

                     </note>THat his Majesty had taken notice of a seditious Speech uttered in the House by Mr. <hi>Clement Cook:</hi> The words are said to be to this effect; <hi>That it were better to die by an Enemy, then to suffer at home.</hi> Yet his Majesty in his wisdom hath forborne to take any course therein, or to send to the House about it, not doubting but the House <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> would in due time correct such an Insolence. But his Majesty hath found that his patience hath wrought to an ill effect, and hath imboldened one since to do a strange act, in a strange way and unusual; that is, Doctor <hi>Turner</hi>; who on Saturday last, without any ground of knowledge in himself, or Proof tendred to the House, made an Enquiry of sundry Articles against the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> as he pretended, but indeed against the Honor and Government of the King and his late Father. This his Majesty saith is such an Example, that he can by no means <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> suffer, though it were to make Enquiry of the meanest of his Servants, much less against one so neer unto himself; and doth wonder at the foolish impudencie of any man that can think he should be drawn out of any end to offer such a Sacrifice, much unworthy the greatness of a King, and Master of such a Servant. And therefore his Majesty can no longer use his wonted patience, but desireth the Justice of the House against the Delinquents; not doubting but such course will be taken, that he shall not be constrained to use his Regal authority to right him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> against these two Persons.</p>

To accuse upon <hi>Common Fame,</hi> he finds warranted first by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Imperial Roman Laws and the Canons of the Church, which allowed Common Fame sufficient to accuse any man. And they that are learned amongst them, give two reasons: First, for Greatness; Next, for Cunning. Our Ancestors within these walls have done the like, and that to a Duke, the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> in the time of King <hi>H.</hi> 6. who was accused upon Fame.

                           <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Eliot</hi> pursues the Argument against the Duke.</note>WE have had (says he) a representation of great fear, but I hope that shall not darken our understandings. There are but two things considerable in this business: First, the Occasion of our Meeting; and secondly, the present State of our own Country. The first of these we all know, and it hath at large been made known unto us, and therefore needeth no dispute. The latter of these we ought to make known, and draw and shew it as in a Perspective in this House:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> For our wills and affections were never more clear, more ready as to his Majesty, but perhaps bauk'd and check'd in our forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by those the King intrusts with the affairs of the Kingdom. The last Action, was the Kings first Action; and the first Actions and Designs of Kings are of great observance in the eye of the World; for therein much dependeth the esteem, or disesteem of their future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: And in this Action the King and Kingdom have suffered much dishonor; We are weakned in our strength and safety, and many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of our men and ships are lost. This great Design was fixed on the person of the Lord General, who had the whole Command both by Sea and Land: And can this great General think it sufficient to put in his Deputy, and stay at home? Count <hi>Mansfield's</hi> Actions were so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, and the going out of those men so ill managed, as we are scarce able to say they went out. That handful of men sent to the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and not seconded, what a loss was it to all <hi>Germany?</hi> We know well who had then the Kings ear. I could speak of the Action of <hi>Algier,</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but I will not look so far backward. Are not Honors now sold, and made despicable? Are not Judicial Places sold? and do not they then sell Justice again? <hi>Vendere jure potest, emerat ille prius. Tully</hi> in an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against <hi>Verres</hi> notes, That the Nations were Suitors to the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Law <hi>De pecuniis repetundis</hi> might be recalled: Which seems strange, that those that were Suitors for the Law, should seek again to repeal it; but the reason was, it was perverted to their ill. So it is now with us; besides inferior and subordinate persons that must have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Gratuities, they must now feed their great Patrons.</p>
                        <p>I shall to our present Case cite two Presidents. The first is 16 <hi>H.</hi> 3. The Treasure was then much exhausted, many Disorders complained on, the King wronged by some Ministers; many Subsidies were then demanded in Parliament, but they were denied: And then the Lords and Commons joined to desire the King to reassume the Lands which were improvidently granted, and to examine his great Officers, and the Causes of those Evils which the People then suffered. This was yielded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> unto by the King, and <hi>Hugo de Burgo</hi> was found faulty and was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, and then the Commons in the same Parliament gave Supply. The second President was in the Tenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second: Then the Times were such, and Places so changeable, that any great Officer could hardly sit to be warmed in his Place: Then also Monies had been formerly given, and Supply was at that Parliament required; but the Commons denied Supply, and complained that their Monies were misimployed, That the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> then overruled all; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> so their Answer was, <hi>They could not give:</hi> And they petitioned the King, that a Commission might be granted, and that the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> might be examined. A Commission at their request was awarded, and that Commission recites all the Evil then complained of; and that the King upon the Petition of the Lords and Commons had granted that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:35668:125"/>
Examination should be taken of the Crown-Lands which were sold, of the Ordering of his Houshold, and the Disposition of the Jewels of his Grandfather, and Father. I hear nothing said in this House of our Jewels, nor will I speak of them, but I could wish they were within these walls. We are now in the same case with those former Times; we suffer alike, or worse: And therefore unless we seek redress of these great Evils, we shall find disability in the wills of the People to grant. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> I wish therefore that we may hold a dutiful pursuance in preparing and presenting our Grievances. For the Three Subsidies and Three Fifteens which are proposed, I hold the proportion will not suit with what we would give; but yet I know it is all we are able to do or can give; and yet this is not to be the stint of our affections, but to come again to give more upon just occasions.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:35668:126"/>
it should be delivered in the presence of both Houses, and both Houses make one General Council: And his Majesty is willing that the Lords should be Witnesses of the Honor and Justice of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions. And therefore the Errand which by his Majesties direction I must deliver, hath relation to the House of Commons. I must address my self therefore to you <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> and the rest of that House.</p>
                        <p>And first his Majesty would have you to understand, That there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was never any King more loving to his People, or better affectioned to the right use of Parliaments, then his Majesty hath approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be, not only by his long patience since the sitting down of this Parliament, but by those mild and calm Directions which from time to time that House hath received by Message, and Letter, and from his Royal mouth; when the irregular humors of some particular persons wrought diversions and distractions there, to the disturbance of those great and weighty Affairs, which the Necessity of the Times, the honor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and safety of the King and Kingdom, called upon. And therefore his Majesty doth assure you, that when these great Affairs are setled, and that his Majesty hath received satisfaction of his reasonable Demands, he will as a just King hear and answer your just Grievances, which in a dutiful way shall be presented unto him; and this his Majesty doth avow.</p>
                        <p>Next his Majesty would have you know of a surety, That as never any King was more loving to his People, nor better affectioned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the right use of Parliaments; so never King more jealous of his Honor, nor more sensible of the neglect and contempt of his Royal Rights, which his Majesty will by no means suffer to be violated by any pretended colour of Parliamentary Liberty; wherein his Majesty doth not forget that the Parliament is his Council, and therefore ought to have the liberty of a Council; but his Majesty understands the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt Council and Controlling, and between Liberty and the Abuse of Liberty.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>This being set down in general, his Majesty hath commanded me to relate some particular passages and proceedings whereat he finds himself agrieved.</p>
                        <p>First, Whereas a seditious speech was uttered amongst you by Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> the House did not, as they ought to do, censure and correct him. And when his Majesty understanding it, did by a Message by Mr. Chancellor of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> delivered to the House, require Justice of you, his Majesty hath since found nothing but protracting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> This his Majesty holds not agreeable to the wisdom and the duty which he expected from the House of Commons.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Whereas Doctor <hi>Turner</hi> in a strange Unparliamentary way, without any ground of knowledge in himself, or offering any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proof to the House, did take upon him to advise the House to enquire upon sundry Articles against the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> as he pretended, but in truth to wound the Honor and Government of his Majesty, and of his renowned Father; And his Majesty first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by a Message, and after by his own Royal mouth did declare, That that Course of Enquiry was an Example which by no way he could suffer, though it were against his meanest Servant, much less against one so neer him; and that his Majesty did much wonder at the foolish insolencie of any man that can think that his Majesty should be drawn
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:35668:126"/>
out of any end to offer such a Sacrifice so unworthy of a King, or a good Master: Yet for all this, you have been so far from correcting the Insolencie of <hi>Turner,</hi> that ever since that time your Committees have walked in the steps of <hi>Turner,</hi> and proceeded in an Unparliamentary Inquisition, running upon generals, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating that whereof you have made Fame the groundwork. Here his Majesty hath cause to be exceeding sensible, that upon every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> particular he finds the Honor of his Father stained and blemished, and his own no less; and withal you have manifested a great forwardness rather to pluck out of his bosom those who are neer about him, and whom his Majesty hath cause to affect, then to trust his Majesty with the future reformation of these things which you seem to aim at: And yet you cannot deny but his Majesty hath wrought a greater Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in matters of Religion, Execution of the Laws, and concerning things of great importance, then the shortness of his Reign (in which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he hath been hindred partly through sickness, and the distraction of things which we could have wished had been otherwise) could produce.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> his Majesty hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to tell you, That himself doth better know then any man living the sincerity of the Dukes proceedings; with what cautions of weight and discretion he hath been guided in his publick Imployments from his Majesty and his blessed Father; what Enemies he hath procured at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> home and abroad; what peril of his person and hazard of his estate he ran into for the service of his Majesty, and his ever blessed Father, and how forward he hath been in the service of this House many times since his return from <hi>Spain.</hi> And therefore his Majesty cannot believe that the aim is at the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> but findeth that these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings do directly wound the Honor and Judgment of himself, and of his Father. It is therefore his Majesties express and final command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That you yield obedience unto those Directions which you have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> formerly received, and cease this Unparliamentary Inquisition, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto his Majesties care, and wisdom, and justice, the future refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of these things which you suppose to be otherwise then they should be: And his Majesty is resolved, that before the end of this Session, he will set such a Course both for the amending of any thing that may be found amiss, and for the setling of his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, as he doubteth not but will give you ample satisfaction and comfort.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Next to this his Majesty taketh notice, That you have suffered the greatest Council of State to be censured and traduced in the House, by men whose Years and Education cannot attain to that depth: That Forein businesses have been entertained in the House, to the hinderance and disadvantage of his Majesties Negotiations: That the same Year, yea the first Day of his Majesties Inauguration, you suffered his Council, Government, and Servants, to be parallel'd with the Times of most Exception: That your Committees have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> presumed to examine the Letters of Secretaries of State, nay his own, and sent a general Warrant to his Signet-Office, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Officers not only to produce and shew the Records, but their Books and private Notes, which they made for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties service. This his Majesty holds as unsufferable, as it was in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times unusual.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="228" facs="tcp:35668:127"/>
Next I am to speak concerning your Supply of Three Subsidies and Three Fifteens, which you have agreed to tender to his Majesty. You have been made acquainted with the greatness of his affairs both at home and abroad, with the strong Preparation of the Enemy, with the Importance of upholding his Allies, strengthening and securing both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> besides the encountring and annoying the Enemy by a powerful Fleet at Sea; and the Charge of all: This having been calculated unto you, you have professed unto his Majesty by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> mouth of your Speaker, your carefulness to support the Cause wherein his Majesty and his Allies are justly engaged; your unanimous consent and real intention to supply his Majesty in such a measure, as should make him safe at home, and feared abroad; And that in the dispatch hereof you would use such diligence, as his Majesties pressing and present occasions did require.</p>
                        <p>And now his Majesty having erected a proceeding suitable to this engagement, he doth observe that in two days onely of twelve, this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> business was thought of, and not begun till his Majesty by a Message put you in minde of it, whilest your Inquisition against his Majesties directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceeded day by day.</p>
                        <p>And for the measure of this supply, his Majesty findeth it so far from making himself safe at home and feared abroad, as contrariwise it exposeth him both to danger and disesteem; for his Majesty cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect without better help, but that his Allies must presently disband, and leave him alone to bear the fury of a provoked and powerful Enemy:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> So as both he and you shall be unsafe at home, and ashamed and despised abroad. And for the manner of the Supply, it is in it self very disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and full of distrust; For although you have avoided the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral word of a Condition, whereof his Majesty himself did warn you when he told you of your Parenthesis, yet you have put to it the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a Condition, since the Bill is not to come into your house until your Grievances be both preferred and answered. No such thing was in that expression and engagement delivered by your Speaker, from which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his Majesty holdeth that you have receded both in matter and manner to his great disadvantage and dishonour. And therefore his Majesty commandeth that you go together, and by <hi>Saturday</hi> next return your final Answer, what further Supply you will add to this you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy agreed on, and that to be without condition, either directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly for the supply of these great and important Affairs of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, which for the reasons formerly made known unto you, can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no longer delay; and if you shall not by that time resolve on a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> more ample Supply, his Majesty cannot expect a Supply this way, nor promise you to sit longer together; otherwise, if you do it, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is well content, that you shall sit so long as the season of the year will permit; and doth assure you, that the present addition to your supply to set forward the work, shall be no hinderance to your speedy access again.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty hath commanded me to add this, That therein he doth expect your chearfull obedience, which will put a happy issue to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this Meeting, and will enable his Majesty, not onely to a Defensive War, but to imploy his Subjects in Foreign Actions, whereby will be added to them both experience, safety, and honor.</p>
                        <p>Last of all, his Majesty hath commanded me in explanation of the gracious goodness of his Royal intention, to say unto you, that he
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:35668:127"/>
doth well know, that there are amongst you many wise and well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered men, well affected to the Publick and to his Majesties service, and that those that are willingly faulty, are not many; and for the rest his Majesty doubteth not, but after his gracious Admonition, they will in due time observe and follow the better sort; which, if they shall do, his Majesty is most ready to forget whatsoever is past.</p>

Now that you have all things according to your wishes, and that I am so far ingaged, that you think there is no retreat; now you begin to set the Dice, and make your own Game; but I pray you be not deceived, it is not a Parliamentary way, nor it is not a way to deal with a King.</p>
                        <p>Mr <hi>Cook</hi> told you, <hi>It was better to be eaten up by a Foreign Enemy, then to be destroyed at home</hi>; Indeed, I think 'tis more honor for a King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be invaded, and almost destroyed by a Foreign Enemy, then to be despised by his own Subjects.</p>
                        <p>Remember that Parliaments are altogether in my power for their Calling, Sitting, and Dissolution; therefore, as I finde the fruits of them good or evil, they are to continue or not to be; And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that if in this time, instead of mending your Errors, by delay you persist in your Errors, you make them greater and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable: Whereas, on the other side, if you do go on cheerfully to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mend them, and look to the distressed State of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and the Affairs of the Kingdom as it lieth now by this great Engagement; you will do your selves honor, you shall encourage me to go on with Parliaments; and I hope all <hi>Christendom</hi> shall feel the good of it.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> WHereas it is objected by some who wish good Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency betwixt the King and People,<note place="margin">The Duke at a Conference explains the Kings late Speech and the Lord Keepers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</note> that to prefix a day to give, or to break, was an unusual thing, and might express an inclination in the King to break; to remove this, as his Majesty was free from such thoughts he hath descended to make this Explanation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="230" facs="tcp:35668:128"/>
That as his Majesty would not have you condition with him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, so he will not lye to a day, for giving further Supply; but it was the pressing occasion of <hi>Christendom</hi> that made him to pitch upon a day.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty hath here a Servant of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and another from the Duke of <hi>Weymer,</hi> and yesterday received a Letter from his Sister the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; who signified, that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> hath sent an Ambassador with Power to perfect the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which was made at the <hi>Hague</hi>; so it was not the King, but time and the things themselves that pressed a time.</p>
                        <p>Therefore his Majesty is pleased to give longer time, hoping you will not give him cause to put you in minde of it again, so that you have a greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Latitude, if the business require to think further of it.</p>
                        <p>I am commanded further to tell you, that if his Majesty should accept of a less sum then will suffice, it will deceive your expectations, disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point his Allies, and consume the Treasure of the Kingdom: whereas <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if you give largly now, the business being at the Crisis, it comes so seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, it may give a Turn to the Affairs of <hi>Christendom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But while we delay and suffer the time to pass, others abroad will take advantage of it, as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath done by concluding a Peace, as 'tis though, in <hi>Italy</hi> for the <hi>Vatoline,</hi> whereby our work is become the greater, because there can be no diversion that way.</p>
                        <p>As it was a good Rule to fear all things and nothing, and to be Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral was sometimes to be Thrifty; so in this particular, if you give largly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> you shall carry the War to the Enemies door, and keep that Peace at home that hath been: Whereas, on the contrary, if you draw the War home, it brings with it nothing but disturbance and fear, all Courses of Justice stopt, and each mans Revenues lessened, and nothing that can be profitable.</p>
                        <p>Another Explanation I am commanded to make touching the grievances, wherein his Majesty means no way to interrupt your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, but hopes you will proceed in the antient wayes of your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Predecessors; and not so much seek faults, as the means to redress them.</p>
                        <p>I am further commanded to tell you, That his Majesty intends to elect a Committee of both Houses, whom he will trust to take the view of his Estate, the Defects whereof are not so fit for the Eyes of a Multitude; and this Committee will be for your ease, and may satisfie you without casting any ill odour on his Government, or laying open any weakness that may bring shame upon us abroad. That which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is so little, that when the payment comes, it will bring him to a worse estate then now he is in; therefore wishes you to enlarge it, but leaves the augmentation to your selves; but is sorry, and touch'd in Conscience, that the burthen should lie on the poorest, who want too much already; yet he will not prescribe, but wish, that you who were the Abettors and Counsellors of this War, would take a greater part of the Burthen to your selves; and any man that can finde out that way, shall shew himself best affected, and do the best service <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to the King and State.</p>

                        <p>And however I lye under the burthen of the same, it lies in your hands to make me happy, or not; and for my part, I wish my heart and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> actions were known to you all; then I assure my self, you would resume me to your good opinions.</p>
                        <p>When I had with some hazard waited on my Master into <hi>Spain,</hi> it is well known what Testimony I gave of my Religion; and no man that comes to a true and near view of my action, can justly charge me. Let me be excused, If I give accompt of this particular when I should speak of the general; for this goes near my heart, and to dissemble with my Conscience, no ends of Fortunes in the World can make me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> do it: For if I had any ill inclination, I had such offers made to me in <hi>Spain,</hi> as might have tempted me.</p>
                        <p>If I would have been converted my self, I might have had the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> to put in my Masters Bed; and if my discontent should have risen here, I might have had an Army to have come with me: But I thought the offer foolish, ridiculous, and scornful, in that point of Religion.</p>
                        <p>I will now take the boldness to speak a little in the general busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and I call it boldness to speak after one who did so well the other day: But I had rather suffer in my own particular, then not refresh your Memories with that which is materially needful.</p>
                        <p>I shall not need to reflect so far back as to the beginning of those Counsels which engaged my Master into the War, they are well known; onely I will so far touch it, as to say, That the last years prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were not Voluntary, or out of Wantonness, but out of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> My Master had good intelligence that the King of <hi>Spains</hi> eye was malitiously bent this way, which had been pursued accordingly, if the employment of the Low-Countrymen to the Bay of <hi>Todos los San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos</hi> had not diverted it.</p>
                        <p>Now for the Counsel which was used for sending out the Fleets, I will refer you to the Relation of the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> who as well in this as other Resolutions, can tell you, That nothing was carried with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Councils: And for my self, I know that in all those actions no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> man can stand up against me, to say that I ever did go with single Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, or made breach of any; but have been an obedient Servant and Minister unto their Resolutions: The proof whereof will appear in a Journal thereof which my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> keeps.</p>
                        <p>I confess all Councils were not ever as your selves would, nor have wished they should; if you had known them as my Master did,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:35668:129"/>
in whom the former Affairs of State had bred such affections, that the business being altered, they were not to be trusted with the Change.</p>
                        <p>I will now give you an accompt of all my Negotiations, since my being at <hi>Oxford,</hi> both at home and abroad; and because there it was charged, that those things were carried with single Counsels, I was more careful to advise the King to have his Counsel with him in the Country, being to enter into War with an Active King.</p>
                        <p>And for my part I did diligently wait on the Council, left all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all personal occasions, studying to serve my Master, and to gain the good opinion of both Houses. The Council of <hi>Woodstock</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally advised the going out of the Fleet. And though it were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that the Season were not fit, yet the action shewed the contrary, for they all arived in safety. And for what was also objected, that the Provision was not good, experience tells you the contrary; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations were all good in quality and proportion.</p>
                        <p>And if the Success were not such as any honest man could wish, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hope I shall not be blamed, being not there in person, though I made the greatest suit for it to my Master, that ever I did for any thing: But his Majesty thought my Service more useful in the Low-Countreys, to comfort his Sister, and to treat with the Kings o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And though the Success (as I said) of the Fleet were not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the desires of honest men; yet it had these good effects, first, It put our Enemy to great charge in fortifying his Coasts; secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> They took so many Ships as caused many of his Merchants to break, whereby the Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> suffered much; And lastly, They could carry no Treasure out to pay their Forces in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And for Omissions of what more might have been done, I leave that to its proper place and time, and let every man bear his own burden.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Oxford</hi> the Council went to <hi>Southampton,</hi> where the States Ambassadors did wait often on the King and Council, and a League <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Offensive and Defensive betwixt us and them was thought fit to be resolved on; whereof some Reasons I will express, but not all. First, They are of our own Religion; secondly, They are our near Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, for situation so useful, as when they are in distress, it is policy in us to give them relief; therefore the King thought fit to do it in such manner, as might lay an Obligation on them; which if it had not been done, they had been pressed with a long War, and such a Faction among themselves, as if the King had not joyned, and in a manner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their Protector, they had broke among themselves. And in this the Kings care was not onely of them, but of all Christendom, and of his own particular.</p>
                        <p>For as before he onely assisted them, his Majesties care now used Arguments to draw them to Contribution; so that they bear the fourth part of the charge of the War at Sea, according to such Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as by the Lord Chamberlain you have heard.</p>
                        <p>This League being perfected betwixt the States and us, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by Advice of his Council thought fit to send me to get such a League with the other Princes as I could: The Rendezvous was in the Low-Countreys, being in a manner the Centre for repair for <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>; I had Latitude of Commission to make the League with most advantage I could.</p>

Now I had discovered from Monsieur <hi>B.</hi> The French Ambassador here, that a League Offensive and Defensive would be refused; and I found the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> shie, and loth to enter into such a League against the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; and so partly out of Necessity, and partly out of Reason of State, I was forced to conclude the League in general Terms, for the restoring of the Liberty of <hi>Germany,</hi> without naming the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Emperor, that other Princes might come in; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and this to continue till every one had satisfaction, and nothing to be treated of, debated, or concluded on, but by consent of all parties. It did appear, that the Charge was so great, that the Kingdom could not endure it; and therefore I endeavored in the Low-Countreys to lessen it, and so the Sea charge was helped, and the Land assistance given unto them, is to cease Six moneths hence, which the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> said was to end in <hi>September</hi> next.</p>
                        <p>Also by this Treaty it is conditioned with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> That when my Master shall by Diversion equal to this Contribution with his own Subjects, enter into an Action, then this Charge to cease: Or if the King of <hi>France</hi> may be drawn in, of which there is great hope (though he hath now made peace in <hi>Italy</hi>) for that the policy of <hi>France</hi> may not give way unto the greatness of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose Dominions do grasp him in on every side. And if the business be well carried, his Engagement to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> may draw him in; so there is great possibility of easing our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Charge.</p>
                        <p>But all is in the discreet taking of the time; for it not, we may think the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> will take hold of those fair Conditions which are each day offered him; and then the Enemies Army will fall upon the River of <hi>Elve,</hi> and (the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> added) upon <hi>East-Friez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from whence they would make such progress, as (in my poor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) would ruine the Low-Countreys.</p>
                        <p>And thus I think I have satisfied all of you, or at least given an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> account of my Negotiation in the Low-Countreys, with the King of <hi>Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and the rest.</p>
                        <p>I should be glad before I end, to say somewhat of my self, but I shall request your favorable construction, for I have been too long al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; but I fear I shall offend, and therefore I will restrain my self to generals.</p>
                        <p>If in any of these employments, my Errors may be shewed me, I shall take him for my best friend that will manifest them in particulars; I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> have bent all my thoughts on nothing but my Masters Honor, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the State, and safety of them both. I never had any end of mine own, and that may be perceived and proved by the expence of mine own estate. I am ashamed to speak it, and it would become an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans tongue better then mine own.</p>
                        <p>My Journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> was all at mine own charge; my Journey into <hi>France,</hi> was at my Masters charge; my Journey into the Low-Countreys, was all at mine own charge.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> I am accused by common Fame, to be the cause of the loss of the Narrow Seas, and the damage there sustained. That I can say, is this, Since the War begun with <hi>Spain,</hi> I have always had Twelve Ships on the Coasts, and allowance but for Four, the rest my own care supplied. And for the Office of Admiral, when I came first to it, I found the Navy weak, not neglected by my Noble Predecessor (for I cannot speak
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:35668:130"/>
of him, but with honor; and I shall desire to go to my Grave with the honor he carried hence) but by the not paying of moneys in time, there were such defects his care could not prevent; that if the War had then broken out, there would have been found few Ships, and those unserviceable. I was first perswaded to take this Office by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of Sir <hi>Robert Munseld,</hi> and though I objected I was yong, and unexperienced, yet he said that by my favor with my Master, I might do more good in procuring payment for that charge. And because I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was yong and unexperienced, I took advice, as I do in all things, and am not ashamed of it. I desired my Master to grant a Commission as it were over me. I have found a great Debt, the Ships defective, and few in number, the yearly charge of Fifty four thousand pounds, which was brought to Thirty thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi>; we built every year two Ships, and when so many were built as were requisite, we brought it to Two and twenty thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> which comes not to my hands, but goes into its proper streams, and issues from the Officers to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that purpose deputed.</p>
                        <p>Now if any can shew me a Project, how to maintain War against <hi>Spain, Flanders,</hi> and the Turkish Pirates, with less charge, he shall do a great work and good service: I have had sometimes Twenty, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Thirty Ships, though sometime disastred by Tempest, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Ships, and caused them to cut their Masts, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their Anchors.</p>
                        <p>There are now Twelve Ships victualled for two Moneths; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> though many Reports have been, that they do not do their duty, yet I have advertised them thereof from time to time, and finde no such fault in them.</p>
                        <p>There are Thirty Ships more at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> victualled for six Moneths, and Ten more ready, so soon as they may be victualled: I have been so frugal of making use of the old remain, that there is no need of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, or other necessaries.</p>
                        <p>Besides all these, there are Twenty Ships to come from the Low-Countreys; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so you have Twelve, Twenty, Thirty, and Ten more, which I think you have not heard of.</p>
                        <p>And therefore if any have blamed me, I do not blame him, but think he hath done well; but when you know the truth, and when all this shall appear, I hope I shall stand right in your opinions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> It is no time to pick quarrels one with another; we have enemies enough already, and therefore more necessary to be well united at home.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Follow not examples, at least not ill examples of <hi>Gondomar</hi> and <hi>Ynojosa,</hi> who would have had my head, when you thought me worthy of a salute. Now though I confess there may be some Errors, I will not justifie my self; yet they are not such gross defects, as the World would make them appear. I desire they may be admitted <hi>Cum Nota.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are no Errors of Wilfulness, nor of Corruption, nor oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the People, nor Injustice, but the contrary; and then may I say, for what good done by me, do I suffer?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now I might Answer more particulars, but I have been long, and so will forbear; and will conclude, if your Supply answer not your Promises and Engagements to my Master; you will make this place which hath been in Peace when others were in War, the Seat of War when others are in Peace.</p>

            <p>For the further vindicating of the Duke, the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> stood up and said,</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            <q>
               <p>THat whereas divers jealousies have been raised in the House,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Conway</hi> vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the Duke.</note> that the Moneys have been expended unusefully and without Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; himself who was the onely Secretary, and had the hand in guiding the business, could best give an accompt of it.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Iames</hi> of glorious Memory, at the Request of both Houses, had broken both the Treaties, he considered how to maintain the War; for he saw that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was awaked, and that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  <hi>Palatinate</hi> must be got by the Sword, and that <hi>Spain</hi> would oppose it with all the power they could; and computing the charges, found the Subsidies granted too short; for that it could not be done without an Army of Five and twenty thousand Foot, and Five thousand Horse, which would amount to Six hundred thousand pounds for the Armies yearly, and Three hundred thousand pounds for the Navy; but finding all his means short, and as the Proverb is, <hi>Not knowing of what Wood to make his Arrows to hit the Mark withal,</hi> Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> stirred up by his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> own judgment came over and made overture, That for Twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds a moneth he would raise an Army of Thirty thousand men, and draw in the French King, <hi>Denmark, Sweden, Venice, Savoy,</hi> the Cantons of the <hi>Switzers</hi> perhaps, and some other <hi>German</hi> Princes, and raise a War in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> of great consequence to make a Diversion.</p>
               <p>Now about this time the Council of <hi>Austria</hi> resolved to call a Dyet, and exclude the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and put in a Popish Elector; and for that end offered a general Peace in <hi>Germany,</hi> and so left not a crevice to look <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> into for assistance; but if any of them should aid the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> he should be out of the Peace.</p>
               <p>The King accepts <hi>Mansfields</hi> offer, conditionally that he draw in the French King: So <hi>Mansfield</hi> went over into <hi>France,</hi> and the King by Advice of his Council sent Ambassadors into <hi>France, Denmark, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, Savoy,</hi> and Cantons of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> from whom he received cold Answers; for King <hi>Iames</hi> had stood so long on terms of Peace, as they doubted he would not be brought to enter into War. But Count <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> procured the King of <hi>France</hi> to Contract to receive our Troops, with promise to enter into the War, upon condition it might be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Council of the French King and <hi>England.</hi> This favor to Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> That <hi>France</hi> agreed that his Armies should joyn with the Kings Troops, wrought the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> to believe, that the King would enter into a War. Thereupon the Imperialists left their
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:35668:131"/>
Dyet, and sent <hi>Tilly</hi> to <hi>Friezland,</hi> and to take up the River of <hi>Emb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>; which if he had obtained, they would have trampled the Low-Countreys under foot, and would have become Governors of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Upon this the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> sent to our King, and offered to raise an Army of Thirty thousand men, if our King would allow Thirty thousand pounds a Moneth, and said, He would admit no time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite; for if <hi>Tilly</hi> had not been presently met and headed, all had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> been lost. Whereupon our King called a Counsel, and appointed Commissioners; and from that time all the Warrants for the issuing of the Moneys, were all under the Kings own hand to the Council of War, and from them to the Treasurers; and the Warrants were from the Lords of the Council for the Levying of Men, and for Coats and Conduct-Money. A List whereof is hereunder specified.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the Duke asked the Question, Whether any thing was done by single Council.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>To which the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> answered,
<q>No. For the Treaty of <hi>Denmark,</hi> Project of Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> Treaties with <hi>France,</hi> and the business of the Navy, were done all by the King himself; and who can say it was done by single Council, when King <hi>Iames</hi> commanded it, whose Council every man ought to reverence, especially in matters of War, whereunto that King was not hasty?</q>

            <p>The Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> who continued under Restraint, and was debarred Access to his Majesty ever since his return out of <hi>Spain,</hi> had been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined touching his Negotiation there, by a Committee of Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the King. Certain Propositions were tendred unto him in order to his Release, and composing of that Affair, concerning which he had written to the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and about this time received the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Letter from him.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Received a Letter from your Lordship, dated the Fourth of this Moneth, written in Answer to a former Letter which I directed to your Lordship by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his Majesties Commandment. This last Letter according to my duty I have shewed unto his Majesty, who hath perused it, and hath commanded me to write back to you again, That he findes himself nothing satisfied therewith. The Question propounded to your Lordship from his Majesty, was plain and clear, Whether you did rather chuse to sit still without being questioned for any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors past in your Negotiation in <hi>Spain,</hi> and enjoy the benefit of the late gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Pardon granted in Parliament, whereof you may have the benefit: Or whether for the clearing of your Innocency (whereof your self and your friends <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and followers are so confident) you will be content to wave the advantage of that Pardon, and put your self into a legal way of Examination for the Tryal thereof? His Majesties purpose thereby, is not to prevent you of any favors the Law hath given you; but if your Assurance be such as your words and Letters import, he conceives it stands not with that Publick and resolute Profession of your Integrity to decline your Tryal. His Majesty leaves the choice to your self, and requires from you a direct Answer without circumlocution or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining with him for future Favors beforehand; but if you have a desire to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> make use of that Pardon which cannot be denied you, nor is any way desired to be taken from you, his Majesty expects you should at the least forbear to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie your Service, and out of an opinion of your Innocency, cast an asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon his Majesties Iustice, in not affording you that present fulness of Liberty and Favor which cannot be drawn from him, but in his good time and according to his good pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Thus much I have in Commandment to write to your Lordship, and to require your Answer clearly and plainly by this Messenger sent on purpose for it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and so I remain</p>

                        <hi>The Earl of</hi> Bristols <hi>Letter to the Lord</hi> Conway.</note>
                     <hi>I</hi> Have received your Letter of the Four and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eighth; and I am infinitely grieved to understand that my former Answer to yours of the Fourth of <hi>March,</hi> hath not satisfied His Majesty, which I
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:35668:132"/>
will endeavor to do by this, to the best of my understanding; and to that end shall answer to the particular points of your present Letter, with the greatest clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I am able.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Whereas you say in your Letter, that the Question propounded to me was plain and clear, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether I would chuse to sit still without being questioned for any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors past in my Negotiation in <hi>Spain,</hi> and enjoy the benefit of the late gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Pardon, whereof I may take the benefit? Or whether being contented to wave the advantage of that Pardon, I should put my self into a legal way of Examination for the Tryal thereof? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Your Lordship may be pleased to remember, that your last Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, Whether I desired to rest in the Security I was in, which you now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, Whether I will chuse to sit still?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Your Proposition was, Whether I would acknowledge the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Favor of his Majesty that now is, who had been pleased not to question <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> my actions; when it is best known to your Lordship, That by a Commission of the Lords, I was questioned upon Twenty Articles, divers involving Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony and Treason. Although it be true, That when I had so answered (as I am confident their Lordships would have cleared me) I was so unhappy as their Lordships never met more about that business.</p>
                  <p>But now your Proposition is, Whether I will now chuse to sit still without being further questioned for Errors past, whereas before it was required I should acknowledge that I had not been questioned at all, which is a different <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thing? But conferring both your Letters together, and gathering the sense and meaning by making the latter an Explanation of the former, which I could have wished your Lordship would have more clearly explained, I return unto your Lordship this plain and direct Answer.</p>
                  <p>That understanding by the Security I am in, and sitting still, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further questioned, I am restored to the bare Freedom and Liberty of a Subject and Peer (For a man being called in question by his Majesty, if after his Majesty shall be pleased out of his goodness, that he rest quiet and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> secure, and that he shall not be further questioned, I conceive that it is not apparent that his liberty naturally revolveth unto him, when by his Majesties Grace he is pleased to declare, he shall not be further questioned, but may live in further Security.) So that understanding your Letter in this sort (for no direct Answer can be made, until the sense of the Question be truly slated) I do most humbly acknowledge and accept his Majesties Grace and Favor, and shall not wave any thing that shall come to me by the Pardon of the <hi>21 Jac. Regis,</hi> nor by the Pardon of his Majesties Coronation; and am so far from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> bargaining, as you are pleased to express it for future favor (though I hope my humble and submissive courses of Petitioning his Majesty, neither hath nor shall deserve so hard an expression) that I shall not presume so much as to press for any favor, until my dutiful and loyal Behavior may move his Majesties Royal and Gratious Heart thereunto, but receive with all humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness this my Freedom and Liberty; the which I shall onely make use of in such sort, as I shall judge may be most agreeable to his Majesties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                  <p>As for the second part of your Letter, wherein you say, That if I desire to make use of that Pardon, his Majesty expects that I should at least forbear to magnifie my Services; or out of an opinion of my own Innocency cast an aspersion upon his Majesties Iustice. To this point I answer, That as I hope I shall never erre in that sort of immodesty of valuing my Services, which I
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:35668:133"/>
acknowledge to have been accompanied with infinite weaknesses and disabilities; so I trust it shall not displease, that I make use to mine own comfort, and the honor of my Posterity, of those many Written Testimonies which my late most Blessed Master hath left me, of his gratious Acceptance of my Services for the space of Twenty years. So likewise I hope the modest avowing of mine Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency will not be thought to cast any aspersion upon his Majesties Honor or Iustice. I most freely confess unto your Lordship, I am much afflicted to see Inferences of this nature made, both in your Lordships last Letter, and in this. For if it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> shall be inferred as a thing reflecting upon the Kings Honor, that a man questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, shall not endeavor to defend his own Innocency, before he be convict, it will be impossible for any man to be safe; for the Honor of his Majesty is too Sacred a thing for any Subject, how innocent soever, to contest against. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, God forbid that it should be brought into Consequences, (as in your former Letter) as a Tax upon the Government and Iustice of his late Majesty, and Majesty that now is, that I should have suffered so long time, not being guilty. For as I never have been heard so much as to repine of Injustice in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Majesties in all my sufferings, so I well know, That the long continuance of my troubles may well be attributed unto other Causes; as to my own Errors of Passion, or other Accidents: For your Lordship may well remember, That my Affairs were almost two years since upon the point of a happy Accommodation, had it not been interrupted by the unfortunate mistaking of the Speeches I used to Mr. <hi>Clark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall conclude by entreating your Lordships favor, That I may understand from you, as I hope for my comfort, that this Letter hath given his Majesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> satisfaction; or if there should yet remain any scruple, That I may have a clear and plain signification of the Kings pleasure, which I shall obey with all Humility.</p>

For the second part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of your Lordships Letter, where your Lordship saith, <hi>That his Majesties mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not thereby to discharge any former directions for restraint of your Lordships coming hither, but that you continue under the same restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as before, so that your Lordships personal attendance here is to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi>: I conceive your Lordship intendeth this touching my coming to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely; for as touching my comning to <hi>London,</hi> I never had at any time one word of prohibition, or colourable pretence of restraint; but on the contrary, having his late Majesties express leave to come to <hi>London</hi> to follow my affairs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> out of my respect to his Majesty then Prince, and to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> I forbore to come until I might know whether my coming would not be disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto them; whereunto his Majesty was pleased to answer both under the hand of the Duke, and of Mr Secretary <hi>Conway,</hi> That he took my respect unto him herein in very good part, and would wish me to make use of the leave the King had given me: since which time I never received any Letter or Message of restraint; onely his Majesty by his Letter bearing date <hi>June</hi> the last, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth me to remain as I was in the time of the King his Father, which was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with liberty to come to <hi>London</hi> to follow mine own affairs as I pleased, as will appear unto your Lordship, if you will afford me so much favor as to peruse them. I have writ this much unto your Lordship, because I would not through misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding fall into displeasure by my coming up, and to intreat your Lordship to inform his Majesty thereof: And that my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> by whose Warrant I was onely restrained in the late Kings time of famous memory, may produce any one word. that may have so much as any colourable pretence of debarring my coming up to <hi>London.</hi> I beseech your Lordship to pardon my desire to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> have things clearly understood, for the want of that formerly hath caused all my troubles; and when any thing is misinformed concerning me, I have little or no means to clear it; so that my chief labor is to avoid misunderstanding. I shall conclude with beseeching your Lordship to do me this favor, to let his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty understand that my coming up is onely rightly to understand his pleasure, whereunto I shall in all things most dutifully and humbly conform my self: And so with my humble service to your Lordship, I recommend you to Gods holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and remain,</p>

                        <p>A Warrant was made by Mr Attorney General to <hi>Iohn Tendring</hi> Marshal of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and other therein named, to search the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the <hi>Clink,</hi> and to seise all Popish and Superstitious matters there found.</p>
                        <p>A Letter also was directed to Sir <hi>George Paul</hi> a Justice of Peace in <hi>Surrey,</hi> to pray him to take some care and pains to expedite that service. On <hi>Good Friday, April</hi> 7. Sir <hi>George Paul</hi> was ready by six a clock in the morning, five or six Constables being charged, and about an hundred persons to aid and assist them. The Marshall being attended with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons named in the Warrant, and divers others of his own servants, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Aid being provided by Sir <hi>George Paul,</hi> came to the <hi>Clink,</hi> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a door open without any Porter or Door-keeper at all, entred without resistance at the first appearing: But immediately upon discovery of his purpose, the Concourse of people without, and his unexpected entrance giving occasion thereto, the Porter steps up, shuts the door, and keeps the Marshal and some few that entred together with him, within, and his Aid without, resisting them that would enter, their Warrant being shewed notwithstanding, until by force another door was broken open,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by which the other persons named in the Warrant, the Marshals men with the Constables, and others appointed for their assistance with Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts did enter also, leaving sufficient company without to guard the three several doors belonging to the House.</p>
                        <p>Being within, the Marshall gave direction to his followers to disperse themselves into several parts of the House, to the end, that whilest he did search in one part, the other parts and places might be safely guarded, and so he proceeded in his search; in the prosecution whereof he found <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> four several Priests in the house; <hi>viz. Preston, Cannon, Warrington, Prator. Preston</hi> was committed to the <hi>Clink</hi> about 16 years since, and discharged of his imprisonment about 7 years ago, yet remained there in the Prison still, attended with two women servants, and one man servant, who, as it was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, had continued with him ever since the Gunpowder Treason, 1605.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:35668:135"/>
The keeping there by himself apart from the Keeper of the Prison, and had for his Lodging three or four several Chambers, part of the Bishop of <hi>Winchesters</hi> House, into which there was a passage made through the Prison yard, no other entrance in or out of the same being discovered; and he affirmed, That he had a Warrant or Licence from the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for his residence there, with liberty freely for himself and all Company that would resort to him thither.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> There was found in his Chamber five or six Cart-loads of Books set up with Shelves, as in a Library or Book-sellers shop, supposed to be worth Two thousand pounds at least; besides which, it was affirmed by the Keeper of the Prison, that he had a far greater Library abroad; for which the Keepers Examination was taken before Sir <hi>Edm. Bower</hi> and Sir <hi>George Paul</hi> Knights, Justices of <hi>Surrey</hi>; wherein it was said, that <hi>Preston</hi> is either licenced, warranted, or protected by the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Durham</hi> or <hi>Winchester,</hi> to that effect. There were also found two Altars <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ready furnished for Masse, one more publick in an upper Chamber, the other more private in a Study; many rich Copes, Surplices, Wax-candles, Crosses, Crucifixes very rich, Beads, Jewels, Chains, Chalices of Silver and of Gold, five or six Bags of money which were not opened, and loose money to the quantity of 100 <hi>l.</hi> lay thrown up and down in his Desk; abundance of Manuscripts, and a Packet of Letters bound up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a thread.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Cannon's</hi> Chamber was found an Altar ready furnished with many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Plates, Jewels, Church-stuff, and many rich Pictures, divers Letters and Manuscripts, Wax-candles, and other such Popish materials; a great deal of his Chamber being shelved about, and full of Books; in one of his Studies also there wee Books set in order upon shelves, as in <hi>Preston's</hi> Chamber, to a great value, and a private altar furnished for Mass, his Hallowed bread ready fitted, and his Holy water, which <hi>Cannon</hi> himself cast out into the chimney. In another Study of <hi>Cannon's</hi> were found great store of curious Tools and Engines to work withal, three Swords <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or Rapiers, one Pistol and a Fowling-peece: Amongst other things were found Pictures of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and King <hi>Charls</hi>; the taking whereof, being set apart with other stuff to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, did exceedingly move the Priest to impatience. Of whom also it is to be noted, that he had in his custody all the Keepers Warrants for Commitment of his Prisoners, which were found in his Chamber, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with some store of Plate, which he said was by him kept for the Keepers wife.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> In <hi>Warrington's</hi> Chamber were found Books, Beads, Boxes of Oil for Extreme Unction, and such like trash; but the wall thereof was broken down into another house adjoining to the Prison, through which it is conceived that all the rest of <hi>Warrington's</hi> Provision was conveyed away, in the interim of the search made in the two former Chambers.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Priest named <hi>Prator,</hi> was first committed to <hi>Gloucester</hi>-Goal, being suspected to be the Archbishop of those parts, and lay there till <hi>Lent</hi>-Assizes last drew on; but for fear of the severity of the Laws (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vison</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and the Keeper did affirm) a Warrant was procured by the Papists for his remove from <hi>Gloucester</hi> to the <hi>Clink,</hi> where he was found a Prisoner. It was informed by the Keeper, that this <hi>Prator</hi> brought up from <hi>Gloucester</hi> a Gentlewoman who lies in a Chamber next adjoining to his Lodging, and that he paid Two shillings six pence a week for her Chamber, and maintained a Maid-servant to attend her: It is supposed that this Prison
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:35668:136"/>
is her protection from the lawful proceedings that might be had against her in the Country for Recusancie.</p>
                        <p>In the Porters Chamber were found seven or eight Popish Books.</p>
                        <p>In the Keepers Lodging was found a Closet or Study, wherein store of Writings, Letters, and long Catalogues of Books were found, with their several prices, one rich Picture or Crucifix, a Picture of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>; of which two the Keeper affirmed, that one of them cost thirty pounds; and also many other rich Pictures, amongst which one was a Picture of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> an old Priest named <hi>Collington,</hi> of whom <hi>Cannon</hi> affirmed in scoffing manner, that that mans beard had done King <hi>Iames</hi> more hurt then an Army of ten thousand men could have done. <hi>Prestons</hi> servants being one man, two maids, the Gentlewoman that came from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and her servant, and the Keeper himself, and <hi>Robert Davison</hi> his man, were all examined before the said Justices. During the Marshals tarrying in the <hi>Clink,</hi> it was observed, that both <hi>Preston</hi> and <hi>Cannon</hi> used all the means they could to have notice of the matter then in hand given <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and were very pensive until they perceived he had notice of it. Whereupon they expressed much joy, being assured, as they said, that then there should be nothing removed out of the house. And it came to pass accordingly: For whilest the Marshal and his servants were in the search of the third Chamber, and had locked up divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chambers, wherein as it was informed there was store of Wealth, Church-stuffe, Books, and other matters, which would have been found if the search had been prosecuted; A countermand was brought from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Archbishop, and Master Attorney, whereby the proceeding of that business was staid, and the Marshal was forbidden to remove or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any thing so much as a paper.</p>
                        <p>The Keeper and his wife, and the Priests did grievously threaten the Marshal, and all his Assistants with very high tearms, especially with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and Imprisonments for their attempt in this service; one of them saying, that they should be imprisoned, as once one <hi>Harrison</hi> a Messenger, who for performing the like service in the <hi>Clink,</hi> was committed to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                           <hi>Marshalsey,</hi> and kept there three years, until in the end he was discharged by an Order in the Parliament, as is credibly reported. Furthermore it is also humbly informed by the said Marshal, That upon the twenty second of <hi>March</hi> last by a like Warrant from the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> he did search the Bishops Prison, called the New Prison in <hi>Maiden</hi>-lane in <hi>London,</hi> where he found six several Priests Prisoners in several Chambers, an Altar with all Furniture thereto belonging; with Church-Books and stuff, which were as much as three Porters could carry away, and it is now in the hands of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Lord <hi>Conway</hi>; of which service if this Honourable House will call for a more particular Accompt, the Marshal is ready to give further satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                        <p>He humbly prayeth the Honourable favour of this House for his encouragement and further abilities to the like ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Thank you for acquainting me what was done yesterday at the <hi>Clink:</hi> But I am of opinion, that if you had curiously enquired upon the Gentleman who gave the Information, you should have found him to be a Disciple of the Iesuites; for they do nothing but put tricks on these poor men, who do live more miserable lives then if they were in the Inquisition in many parts beyond the Seas. By taking the Oath of Allegiance, and writing in defence of it, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> opening some points of high consequence, they have so displeased the Pope, that if by any cunning they could catch them, they are sure to be burnt or strangled for it. And once there was a plot to have taken <hi>Preston</hi> as he passed the <hi>Thames,</hi> and to have shipt him into a bigger Vessel, and so to have transported him into <hi>Flanders,</hi> there to have made a Martyr of him. In respect of these things, King <hi>James</hi> always gave his protection to <hi>Preston</hi> and <hi>Warrington,</hi> as may be easily shewed. <hi>Cannon</hi> is an old man well-affected to the Cause, but medleth not with any Factions or Seditions, as far as I can learn. They complain their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Books were taken from them, and a Crucifix of Gold, with some other things, which I hope are not carried out of the house, but may be restored again unto them; For it is in vain to think that Priests will be without their Beads, or Pictures, Models of their Saints; and it is not improbable that before a Crucifix they do often say their prayers.</p>
                  <p>I leave the things to your best consideration; and hope that this Deed of yours, together with my Word, will restrain them for giving offence hereafter, if so be that lately they did give any. I heartily commend me unto you, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so rest</p>

                           </note> We do first with unspeakable joy and comfort acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> your Majesties grace and favor, in that it hath pleased you to cause it to be delivered unto us by the Lord Kéeper of your Great Seal in your own Royal presence, and before both Houses of Parliament, That never King was more loving to his people, nor better affected to the right use of Parliaments; withal professing your most gracious resolution to hear and redress our just Grievances. And with like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:35668:137"/>
we acknowledge your Majesties goodness shining at the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of your glorious Reign, in commanding the Execution of the Laws established to preserve the true Religion of Almighty God, in whose service consisteth the happiness of all Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                        <p>Yet let it not displease your Majesty, that we also express some sense of just Grief intermixed with that great Ioy, to sée the careful procéedings of our sincere Intentions so misreported, as to have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> wrought effects unexpected, and we hope undeserved.</p>
                        <p>First, touching the Charge against us in the matter concerning Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> We all sincerely protest, That neither the words mentioned in your Maiesties Message, nor any other of seditious effect were spoken by him, as hath béen resolved by the House without one Negative voice. Howsoever, in a Spéech occasionally uttered, he let fall some few words which might admit an ill construction; whereat the House being displeased at the delivery of them, as was expressed by a general <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and instant Check, he forthwith so explained himself and his intention, that for the present we did forbear to take them into consideration, which since we have done: And the effect thereof had before this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, if by important businesses of your Maiesties service we had not béen interrupted.</p>
                        <p>The like interruption did also befall us in the Case of Doctor <hi>Turner</hi>; wherein the Question being formerly stated, a Resolution was ordered to have béen taken that very day, on which we received your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Maiesties command to attend you.</p>
                        <p>But for our own procéedings, We humbly beséech your Maiesty to be truly informed, That before that Overture from Doctor <hi>Turner,</hi> (out of our great and necessary care for your honor and welfare of your Realm) We had taken into serious Consideration the Evils which now afflict your people, and the Causes of them, that we might apply our selves unto the fittest remedies: In the pursuit whereof our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittées <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> (whatsoever they might have done) have in no particular proceeded otherwise, then either upon ground of knowledge in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or proof by examination of Witnesses, or other Evidence. In which course of service for the publick good, as we have not swerved from the Parliamentary ways of our Predecessors, so we conceive that the discovery and reforming of Errors is so far from laying an aspersion upon the present Time and Government, that it is rather a great honor and happiness to both, yielding matter to great Princes wherein to exercise and illustrate their noblest vertues.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>And although the grievous Complaints of the Merchants from all parts, together with the Common service of the Subiects well-affected to those who profess our Religion, gave us occasion to debate some businesses that were partly Forein, and had relation to affairs of State; yet we beseech your Maiesty to rest assured, it was exceeding far from our intention either to traduce your Counsellors, or disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage your Negotiations.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>And though some examples of great and potent Ministers of Princes heretofore questioned in Parliament have been alleadged, yet was it without paralleling your Maiesties Government, or Councils to any Times at all, much less to Times of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>

                        <p>And for the search at the Signet Office, the Copy of a Letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divulged as in your Majesties Name, with pregnant cause of suspition, both in the Body and Direction thereof to be supposititious, the Committée out of desire to be cléered therein, did by their Order <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> send some of themselves to the Signet Office, to search whither there were any Records of Letters of that nature, without Warrant to the Officer for any, much less for a general search.</p>
                        <p>But touching Publick Records, we have not forborn as often as our businesses have required, to make search into them, wherein we have done nothing unwarranted by the Laws of your Realm, and the constant usage of Parliaments. And if for the ease of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, any of our Committées have desired the help of the Officers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Repertories, or Breviats of Direction, We conceive it is no more then any Subject in his own affairs might have obtained for ordinary Fées.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning Your Majesties Servants, and namely, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> We humbly beséech Your Majesty to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us your Faithful Commons, who can have no private end but your Majesties Service, and the good of our Countrey, That it hath béen the antient, constant, and undoubted Right and Usage of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to question and complain of all persons of what degree so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, found grievous to the Commonwealth, in abusing the power and trust committed to them by their Soveraign. A course approved not onely by the examples in your Fathers days of famous memory, but by frequent presidents in the best, and most glorious Reigns of your Noble Progenitors, appearing both in Records and Histories; without which liberty in Parliament, no private man, no servant to a King, perhaps no Counsellor, without exposing himself to the hazard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of great enmity and prejudice, can be a means to call great Officers into question for their misdemeanors, but the Commonwealth might languish under their pressures without Redress: And whatsoever we shall do accordingly in this Parliament, we doubt not but it shall redound to the Honor of the Crown, and welfare of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, We most humbly beseech Your Majesty gratiously to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that though it hath been the long Custom of Parliaments to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> handle the matter of Supply with the last of their businesses, yet at this time out of extraordinary respect to your Person, and care of your Affairs, We have taken the same into more speedy consideration, and most happily on the very day of your Majesties Inauguration, with great alacrity and unanimous consent: After a short Debate, we grew to the Resolution for a present Supply well-known to your Maiesty.</p>
                        <p>To. which, if Addition may be made of other great things for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> your Service, yet in Consultation amongst us, we doubt not but it will appear, That we have not receded from the Truth of our first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, so to supply you as may make you safe at home, and feared abroad, especially if your Maiesty shall be pleased to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way intended in our promise, as well as to the measure of the gift agreed.</p>

               <note place="margin">The House<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adjourned for a week.</note>Unto this Remonstrance the King said, He could give no present an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, but desired the House to adjourn for a week as the Lords had done; and they adjourned accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Private advice given to the Duke.</note>In the interim it was intimated in Writing to the Duke, that he should procure his Majesty to signifie to a certain number of Lords, that he hath endeavored to divert the Charge against the Duke, because his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Majesty hath had sound knowledge and experience of his service and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
            <p>That his Majesty may let them know, that he is now pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal some secrets and mysteries of State. That the King his Father finding the Palatinate more then in danger to be lost, and his Majesty being in <hi>Spain,</hi> and there deluded, and his abode and return both unsafe, it was a necessity of State to sweeten and content the <hi>Spaniard</hi> with the hope of any thing which might satisfie and redeem those Engagements.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And that therefore the King willed the Duke to yield discreetly to what he should find they most desired, and this was chiefly the point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; So as in this, and all of the like kind, the Duke upon his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties knowledge was commanded, and but the Instrument trusted by the King in this Exigent, or if you will say, Extremity.</p>
            <p>Upon the same ground, though not in so high a degree, the sending of the Ships to <hi>Rochel</hi> may be excused. Touching the vast Creation of Nobility, his Majesty may declare that his Father who was born a King,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and had long experience of that Regiment, found that this State inclined much to popularity; and therefore thought fit to enlarge the number of his Nobles, that these being dispersed into several Counties, might shine as Lamps of Soveraignty in protecting their own degrees, and at their own cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e inure the people with respect and obedience to greatness. And the King may protest that this was a child of his Fathers best Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Duke the Instrument thereof. And if you say, there was money many times given for these Honors; nay, if you say, that money <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hath been given for places of Clergy and Judicature, take this of me, it is so in all other Countreys, as in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c. though I am not satisfied in this opinion. And if it be said, the King should have had the money which the Duke took to his own use, I beleeve this last (may the King say) is more then any man can prove; Neither will I deliver what I know therein, onely this I will say, I know the Dukes particular service, and affection towards me, and that he and his will lay down themselves and all they have at my feet.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
            </p>
            <p>Is it for a King to use his Servant and Instrument as he doth his Horses, and being by hard riding in his service foundred and lame, to turn them out to Grass or to the Cart? I must therefore (may the King say) in right of the King, my Fathers Honor, protect a man (though justly seeming guilty, yet) in my own knowledge innocent: Will you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:35668:138"/>
deny the King to favor whom he pleaseth, which the King never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to you that are his Subjects? Well, commend me to my Lords, and tell them that if any thing hath been formerly done amiss by others, I have power and will to redress it, and to prevent the like.</p>
            <p>At this time the King commanded all the Bishops to attend him,<note place="margin">The Bishops commanded to attend the King.</note> and when they were come before him, being fourteen in number, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> them, that in this time of Parliament they had not made known unto him what might be profitable for the Church, whose cause he was ready to promote. And he laid this Charge upon them, that in the Cause of <hi>Bristol</hi> and <hi>Buckingham,</hi> their Consciences being their Guides, they should follow onely proofs, and not rumors.</p>
            <p>The Commons sent again to the Duke by Sir <hi>Iohn Epsley,</hi> to let him know that they were passing Articles against him, and that they had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> given the Messengers leave to take Notes thereof out of the Clerks Book, whereof he might take a Copy if he pleased; and that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected his Answer that day before ten of the Clock, if he pleased to send any.</p>
            <p>This the Duke signified to the Lords, who did not think fit that he should answer, as appears by the ensuing Report made by Sir <hi>Iohn Epsley.</hi>

THat at the Princes coming into <hi>Spain,</hi> during the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> cunningly, falsly, and traiterously moved and perswaded the Prince, being then in the power of a foreign King of the Romish Religion, to change his Religion, which was done in this manner. At the Princes first coming to the said Earl, he asked the Prince for what he came thither, the Prince at first not conceiving the Earls meaning, answered, You know as well as I. The Earl replied, Sir, Servants can never serve their Master industriously, although they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> may do it faithfully, unless they know their meanings fully. Give me leave therefore to tell you what they say in the Town is the cause of your coming, That you mean to change your Religion, and to declare it here. And yet cunningly to disguise it, the Earl added further. Sir, I do not speak this, that I will perswade you to do it; or that I will promise you to follow your example, though you will do it; but as your faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, if you will trust me with so great a secret, I will endeavor to carry it the discreetest way I can. The Prince being moved at this unexpected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> motion again, said unto him, I wonder what you have ever found in me, that you should conceive I would be so base and unworthy, as for a Wife to change my Religion. The said Earl replying, desired the Prince to pardon him, if he had offended him, it was but out of his desire to serve him. Which perswasions of the said Earl was the more dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the more subtile; whereas it had been the duty of a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to God, and his Master, if he had found the Prince staggering in his Religion, to have prevented so great an error, and to have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> perswaded against it, so to have avoided the dangerous consequence thereof to the true Religion, and to the State, if such a thing should have hapned.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. That afterwards during the Princes being in <hi>Spain,</hi> the said Earl having conference with the said Prince about the Romish Religion, he endeavored falsly and traiterously to perswade the Prince to change his Religion, and to become a Romish Catholick, and to become obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the usurped Authority of the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> And to that end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and purpose, the said Earl traiterously used these words unto the said Prince, That the State of <hi>England</hi> never did any great thing, but when they were under the obedience of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they could do any thing of note otherwise.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. That during the time of the Princes being in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Prince consulting, and advising with the said Earl, and others, about a new offer made by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> touching the <hi>Palatinates</hi> Eldest Son to marry with the Emperors Daughter, but then he must be bred up in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Emperors Courts; the said Earl delivered his opinion, That the Proposition was reasonable, whereat when Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> then present, falling into some passion, said, That he durst not for his head consent to it; the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> replied, That he saw no such great inconvenience in it, for that he might be bred up in the Emperors Court in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:35668:141"/>
But when the extream danger, and in a manner the impossibility thereof, was pressed unto the said Earl, he said again, That without some great Action, the Peace of Christendom would never be had; which was so dangerous, and so desperate a Counsel, that one so near the Crown of <hi>England</hi> should be poysoned in his Religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an unfriend to our State, that the consequences thereof, both for the present and future times, were infinitely dangerous; and yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> did his disaffection to our Religion, the blindness in his Judgment misled by his sinister respects, and the too much regard he had to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> lead him.</p>

                           <p n="10">X. THat when the Prince had clearly found himself and his Father deluded in these Treaties, and hereupon resolved to return from the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>; yet because it behoved him to part fairly, he left the powers of the <hi>Desponsories</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> to be delivered upon the return of the Dispensation from <hi>Rome,</hi> which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> insisted upon; and without which, as he pretended, he would not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> conclude the Marriage. The Prince foreseeing and fearing lest after the <hi>Desponsories,</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi> that should then be his Wife, might be put into a Monastery, wrote a Letter back to the said Earl from <hi>Segovia,</hi> thereby commanding him not to make use of the said Powers, until he could give him assurance that a Monastery should not rob him of his Wife; which Letter the said Earl received, and with speed returned an Answer thereto into <hi>England,</hi> perswading against this Direction, yet promising Obedience thereunto. Shortly after which, the Prince sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> another Letter to the said Earl into <hi>Spain,</hi> discharging him of his far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther command. But his late Majesty by the same Messenger sent him a more express direction, not to dispatch the <hi>Desponsories</hi> until a full Conclusion were had of the other Treaty of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> with this of the Marriage; for his Majesty said, That he would not have one Daughter to laugh, and leave the other Daughter weeping. In which Dispatch although there were some mistaking, yet in the next <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> following the same was corrected, and the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> tyed to the same Restriction, which himself confessed in one of his Dispatches afterwards, and promised to obey punctually the Kings command therein; yet nevertheless, contrary to his Duty and Alleagiance, in another Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sent immediately after, he declared, That he had set a day for the <hi>Desponsories,</hi> without any Assurance, or so much as treating of those things which were commanded to him as Restrictions; and that so short a day, that if extraordinary diligence with good success in the Journey had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> not concurred, the Princes hands might have been bound up; and yet he neither sure of a Wife, nor any assurance given of the Temporal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. All which in his high presumption he adventured to do, being an express breach of his Instructions; and if the same had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by his late Majesties vigilancy, it might have turned to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite dishonor and prejudice of his Majesty.</p>

Then the Earl desired to know of Mr Attorney, who was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator to his Charge, and that he might understand who was his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser: Mr Attorney answered, That the King himself out of his own mouth had given him directions for his own Relation against him, and corrected many things that were added: Unto which the Earl answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he would not contest with the King, neither did it beseem him so to do; neither esteemed he his life or his fortunes so much, as to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> save them by contesting with his Soveraign; and therefore would make no reply or answer, were it not that his Religion and Honor were joyntly questioned with his life; but this being to descend to his Posterity, for their sakes he was an humble Suitor unto his Majesty, that he would not take indignation at his own just defence, yet would he be ready to make any humble submission to his Majesty; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily desired some means might be made, that he might make it perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to himself; wherein he would submit himself most willingly to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> some such act of humiliation and submission, (not wronging his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency) that never Subject did towards his Soveraign: And also, That his Majesty would be pleased to set himself in his Throne of Justice, and declare out of his Royal justice, that he would have the Duke and him upon equal terms, and that neither of their causes should be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before others.</p>
                        <p>These were his humble Petitions which he besought their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships to present unto his Majesty, and to take into their considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of how dangerous a consequence it would be, if the King should be Accuser, Judge, Witness, and should have the Confiscation. As touching the Charge against him, he said, He had once answered it all, except that of his Petition; and he doubted not but to clear himself before their Lordships of every particular of it; he said, he expected not to have heard of this again, having once answered it: He rather expected to have been charged with some practise with <hi>Spain</hi> against the State; or the receipt of Ten or Twenty thousand pounds, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the perswading and procuring of the delivery up of some Town, of which the Crown was in possession, as might be the Town of <hi>Flush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the <hi>Brill,</hi> or the like; or for being the means of lending the Kings Ships to a Forein Nation, and that against those of our own Religion; or for revealing his Majesties highest Secrets, which none above two or three dares know; or for treating the greatest affairs, as it were by his own Authority, without formal Instructions in the points; or for having taken Rewards, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> been corrupted by a Foreign Prince; or to have broken his Instructions in any Ecclesiastical point; or, as the Law cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth it, to have committed an overt Act of disloyalty, and not to be charged after seven Ambassages, with Discourses and Inferences.</p>
                        <p>Then he desired their Lordships that he might have a Copy of his Charge in writing, and time allowed him for his Answer, and Counsel assigned him to plead his Cause; and said, there was a great difference between the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> him; for the Duke was accused of Treason, and yet at large, and in the Kings favour; and he being accused but of that which he had long since answered, was a Prisoner; and therefore he moved that they might be put in equal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

And as touching the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> in as much as he had given in Articles against him, he desired his Lordship might not meddle in that particular business, nor use the Kings name against him <hi>ex officio</hi>; he also besought their Lordships to be Suitors to his Majesty on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that all the particular dispatches of his own Ambassages, and Sir <hi>Walter Ashtons</hi> might be brought thither, and that he might make use of them for his defence, as his Evidence; then he desired their Lordships not to think it tedious for him to proceed and lay open his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Case unto them; which being granted, he began as followeth.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> From <hi>Burdeaux</hi> the Earl took Post, making haste, for that he hoped to clear his Honor in Parliament before it should break up; and being arrived at <hi>Calis,</hi> he sent over to have one of the Kings Ships, for which there was publick Order given; but although both wind and weather were as fair as could be, and the Kings Ships lay at <hi>Boloign,</hi> having carried over Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and might every day within three hours have been with him, yet the Ship came not in eight days expectance; so that the Earl fearing the Parliament would be dissolved, was enforced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to pass the Sea in a Boat with six Oars, as he did, having with him Thirty or Forty thousand pounds of the Kings Jewels.</p>
                           <p>Upon his landing at <hi>Dover,</hi> hoping that if his Arrest should have been deferred until his coming to <hi>London,</hi> he might have gotten di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Kings presence, which the Duke resolved was by no means to be admitted; The Earl was there by a Letter of the Lord <hi>Conway's</hi> delivered unto him by a Servant of his, in his Majesties name, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to retire himself to his House, and not to come to the Court <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or the Kings presence, until he should have answered to certain Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions which his Majesty would appoint some of the Lords of the Council to ask him. Hereupon he sent presently to his Majesty, who sent him word, That his restraint was neither for any ill meaning unto him, nor that it should last long, but was intended for his good, to keep the Parliament from falling violently upon him. And the same reason the Duke alleadged to some of his Friends; and all those his troubles which have followed upon his first restraint, have been procured by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Dukes Art under colour of Favor. But the Earl having received his Message from the King, became a most humble Suitor unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that he would expose him to the Parliament; for that if he had not served him honestly in all things, he deserved no favor, but to be proceeded against with all severity. And in this particular he pressed the King as far as could stand with duty and good manners; but received answer from his Majesty, That there should but few more days pass before he would put an end to his affairs: And about this time the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Parliament was dissolved.</p>
                           <p>He still continued his sollicitation to be admitted to the Kings presence; Who sent him word, and confirmed it by oath, That as soon as he should have answered the Questions which the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners were to propound to him, he would both see him, and hear him, and wondred that he should so much doubt thereof. He then sollicited
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:35668:144"/>
with all earnestness to have the Questions sent unto him, which was promised should be within few days. In the interim his Majesty being desirous that the business should have been accommodated, sent secretly to him by a Gentleman (who is ready to depose it) this Message; <hi>That he should write a fair Letter to the Duke, and leave the rest to Him.</hi> Hereupon the Duke sent a Gentleman (one Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>) with fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, offering to procure him whatsoever he could reasonably pretend; only he must not be admitted to the Kings presence for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> some time; and that the Duke would have the disposing of his <hi>Vice-chamberlains</hi> Place, having been therein formerly engaged. The Earl told the Gentleman, That to condescend to any such Course, were jointly to confess himself faulty in some kind, which he would not do for any respect in the world; and let him know the great wrong that the Duke had already done him, and therefore it would be more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for him to procure him some reparation, then to press him further. Moreover, not by way of message, but by way of information of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> said Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> he let him know, how fit it were for the Duke not to press these things, who could not but be conscious of his own Faults, and knew his Innocencie; and withall shewed him a Paper that he had made ready for the King, containing the Particulars wherein the Duke had disparaged him.</p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> making the Duke acquainted herewith, the Duke wrote a Letter the next day to the Earl, bearing date 7 <hi>Iulii,</hi> telling him, That he had willingly intended the accommodation of his affairs; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by what he had now said to Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> he was disobliged, unless he should be pleased to relent it. Whereupon the Earl answered with that directness he thought befitting him in point of Honor. The Course of Mediation was interrupted, and the Duke so far incensed, that he swore he would have him questioned for his life. In the interim, (which the Earl desired might be known to the Lords) His late Majesty was so far from thinking him a Delinquent, or any way dishonest, that he was often heard to say, and swear, That he held him an honest man, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that he would answer for him, that he had neither committed Felony nor Treason. And this divers are ready to depose. The which he well confirmed, for that he gave general leave to all Gentlemen of the Court, Privy-Counsellors, and to his Secretary of State to have free access unto him; yea even so far as to admit of Visits and Entercourses with Spanish Ambassadors, and the <hi>Padre Maestre,</hi> as is best known to my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> by whose Letter he received his Majesties leave in that particular.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then he resumed the state of his business where he left it, which was in the hands of the Commissioners, and they were to frame Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories for him; the which although he had promised should be sent him within a few days, yet such art was used, that six or seven weeks were spent in the framing of them, to the end that his Majesties Progress beginning, there might be no means for the further clearing of the business: And so supposing that for the answering of the Twenty Interrogatories of so high a nature, the Earl would take some time, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> caused the said Interrogatories to be delivered unto him within a few days before the beginning of the Progress; but he used so much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that he made ready to answer <hi>in persona,</hi> though it were in the nature of a Delinquent. Unto which his Majesty answered most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, That out of his favor, and for that he would not do him wrong,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:35668:144"/>
he would not admit of it, but that he should send his Answer, and he would instantly put an end to his businesses; as will appear by Letters. Hereupon the Duke was put into a great strait how to keep him any longer from his Majesty, but desired that only a few Questions more might be asked of him; which the King upon great urging and instance condescended unto, so that the Questions might be presently sent him: But herein were such Artifices used, that the bringing of any was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> until the King had begun his Progress; and then within a day or two the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> sent him word, That he had Order indeed for the sending of him some more Questions, but out of his affection to him he forbore the sending of them, unless he should press for them. Whereupon the Earl instantly wrote unto him, that they might be sent unto him. My Lord <hi>Conway</hi> made him answer by his Letter, That he wished rather the course of Mediation might be pursued, for that would but further exasperate; but if he would needs have the Questions, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> should be sent to him. Whereupon he sent to sollicit his Lordship for them with all earnestness, insomuch as to petition his late Majesty twice that the said Questions might be sent: But when the turn was served of keeping him from the Kings presence, the said Questions were never more heard of until this day.</p>
                           <p>So likewise the Earl having sent his Answer to all the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, who most of them made not nice to declare that they were fully satisfied, and when it was perceived that the Commissioners would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> certainly clear him, and that he thereby should be restored unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties favor, they were never more permitted to meet: A proceeding which, as he conceived, their Lordships would think hardly to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd, that a Commission should be appointed to condemn, if there had been cause, but not to clear.</p>
                           <p>After the Progress was ended, he began again to sollicit his Majesty, and wrote particularly unto the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Whereupon the Duke was pleased to send four or five Propositions, which he desired <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he should acknowledge; the which Propositions contained nothing but what had been already propounded and satisfied in the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories; And if he would make his acknowledgment, he then promised to imploy his force and power with the King and Prince, that he should be admitted to kiss their hands and be received into their gracious favor; but otherwise in a menacing sort, That he should lay his hands upon his breast, and so that would be the best for him. And in the preface of the said Propositions he writeth in these words which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> follow: <hi>It is an assertion not granted, that the Earl of</hi> Bristol <hi>by his Answer had satisfied either the King, the Prince, or me of his Innocencie.</hi> A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous commination for any Subject.</p>
                           <p>But these Propositions were so unjust, that he wrote unto the Duke, that in stead of an Acknowledgment he had sent him an Answer unto them; unto which if either himself or any man living was able to reply, he would submit himself to any thing that should be demanded. But this no way satisfied the Duke, although it did his late Majesty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> who in the Dukes presence said, <hi>I were to be accounted a Tyrant, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join an Innocent man to confess faults of which he was not guilty.</hi> And thereupon sent him word, That he should make his Answer, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge nothing he was not faulty in. And although he received this Message from the Kings own mouth, as will be deposed, yet the Duke at the same time wrote unto him, That the conclusion of all that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:35668:145"/>
had been treated with his Majesty, was, That he should make the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment in such manner as was set down in this paper. And at this time likewise it was that his Majesty sent him word, That he would hear him concerning the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> as well as he had heard the Duke concerning him. And this was not long before his Majesties sickness: And in the interim, as he had heard by several ways, the King suffered much, and was infinitely pressed by the Duke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the said Earl and his affairs; and this he said was the suffering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he had spoken of to their Lordships the other day.</p>
                           <p>The Earl craved leave of their Lordships to specifie some other particulars, whereby it should appear that his Majesty was in no kind ill opinioned of him till his dying day, <hi>viz.</hi> That several persons will depose, that they have heard his Majesty say, that he esteemed him an honest man; And that he was pleased to accept of Toyes by way of Present from him graciously and in good part; and at last was likewise pleased to give him leave to come to <hi>London</hi> and to follow his own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> affairs, and that his pleasure was signified unto him by the Duke his own Letter. Whereupon he determined to come to <hi>London,</hi> intimated to the Duke his intention of going to his Lodging in <hi>Whitehall</hi>; but the Duke was therewith incensed again, and said he mistook the Kings meaning, which was, that he might privately follow his own business. And this he said was the true State and Condition, when it pleased God to take unto his mercy his late most gracious Majesty.</p>
                           <p>Upon his Majesties coming to the Crown, he said he wrote a most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> humble Letter unto his Majesty, imploring his grace and goodness, and desiring the Dukes mediation: But he was pleased to answer by his Letter of 7 <hi>Maii</hi> 1625. That the resolution was to proceed against him, without a plain and direct Confession of the Point which he had formerly required him to acknowledge; and in a Courtly manner of menace telleth him, That he would take the freedom to advise him to bethink himself in time what will be most for his good. But in the interim his Majesty was graciously pleased that his Writ of Parliament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> should be sent him; and thereupon he wrote unto the Duke of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the said Writ, but that he should do nothing but what he should understand to be most agreeable to his Majesties pleasure. Whereunto the Duke answered in his Letters of <hi>May</hi> in this manner: <hi>I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his Majesty with your requests towards him touching your Summons to the Parliament, which he taketh very well, and would have you rather make excuse for your absence notwithstanding your Writ, then to come your self in person.</hi> Whereupon he sent humbly to desire a Letter of leave under his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Majesties hand for his Warrant; but in stead thereof he received from the L. <hi>Conway</hi> an absolute Prohibition, and to restrain and confine him in such sort as he hath been in the late Kings time: And although he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed absolutely set free, he could never get cleared by the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> though he sent him all the Papers to examine; and when he could make no further reply, he said he conceived he was under restraint, and that his liberty expired with the late Kings death; when indeed Restraint may expire, but Liberty is natural. After this he continued for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> space of three quarters of a year in the Country without moving, in which time he was removed from those Places and Offices he held during his late Majesties life; and the greatest part of his Estate being laid out in their Majesties service by their particular appointment, he could never be admitted so much as to the clearing of Accompts. Yet
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:35668:145"/>
hereof he never made the least complaint: But against the time of his Majesties Coronation, he thought it fit to lay hold of that occasion, when Princes do Acts of grace and favor, to be a most humble Suitor to his Majesty for his grace and goodness; and addressed his Letters unto the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> from whom he received a Letter all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his own hand, and therein a Letter inclosed from his Majesty, so different from some gracious Message which he had received from his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Majesty since the said Earl returned into <hi>England,</hi> upon the occasion of a great sickness; and likewise from his speeches several times delivered to his Wife, to wit, That he had never offended him, and that for his faults, he no ways held them criminal, but to be expiated by any easie acknowledgment: That he confessed he knew not what judgment to make of the said Letter, neither hath presumed hitherto to make any Answer thereto; although by reducing the occasions of speeches, and circumstances to his Majesties memory, he no ways doubteth but he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> shall be able to give unto his Majesty such satisfaction to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as his Majesty would not remain with the least scruple in any one point.</p>
                           <p>After this he said, that his Writ of Parliament was detained; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he addressed himself to the Lord Keeper, that he would be a Suitor to his Majesty for him in that behalf: which diligences not taking ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by Petition he became a Suitor to their Lordships for their Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mediation to his Majesty, and thereupon his Writ of Parliament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was awarded: But the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> upon that took occasion, as he had published Copies of the said Letter over all the Kingdom, to read it likewise in that Honorable House, as was best known unto their Lordships, and the Writ was accompanied with a Prohibition from the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>d Keeper; whereupon he addressed himself for Justice to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable House, (being possessed of his Cause by his Petition) for both redress of his own wrongs, and likewise of Complaints against the Duke for many Crimes: And that Honorable House being possessed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of his Cause by his Petition, there is preferred against him a succeeding Complaint amounting as high as Treason (as it is pretended) although he for divers years hath not been questioned; yet since his Complaint against the Duke, he hath been fetcht up like a Prisoner, and brought into that House as a Delinquent; And the Duke, of whom he hath complained for his great Crimes, is admitted still to sit in the House as one of his Judges. The which with all that he hath formerly said, together with his Life, Fortunes and Honor, he did with all willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> humility and duty, submit to the Justice and Honor of that House.</p>
                           <p>Then the Lords asked him, When he would bring in his Answer? He promised to answer as soon as might be, but knew not how far he should have occasion to use his antient Dispatches. The Lord Keeper told him, that Mr. Attorney might help him by letting him know it: The Attorney said, that his Charge should in nothing look further back then to the year 1621. Which he desired might be recorded.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Whereupon the Earl thanking their Lordships for their patience, he was carried away by Mr. <hi>Maxwell</hi> the Gentleman-Usher, in whose house and custody he remained.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles against the Duke.</note>I. THat the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> did secretly combine with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Conde of <hi>Gondomar</hi> Ambassador for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> before his the said Ambassadors last return into <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Summer <hi>An.</hi> 1622. To carry his Majesty (then Prince) into <hi>Spain,</hi> to the end he might be informed and instructed in the Roman Religion, and thereby have perverted the Prince, and subverted the true Religion established in <hi>England:</hi> From which misery this Kingdom (next under Gods mercy) hath by the wise, religious, and constant carriage of his Majesty been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most miraculously delivered, considering the many bold and subtile at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the said Duke in that kind.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. That Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> was made acquainted therewith and sent into <hi>Spain</hi>; and such Messages at his return framed, as might serve for a ground to set on foot this Conspiracie; The which was done accordingly, and thereby the King and Prince highly abused, and their Consents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by first gotten to the said Journey, that is to say, after the return of the said Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> which was about the end of <hi>December,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1622. whereas the said Duke had plotted it many moneths <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> before.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. That the said Duke, at his arrival in <hi>Spain,</hi> nourished the Spanish Ministers not only in the belief of his own being Popishly affected, but did (both by absenting himself from all Exercises of Religion constantly used in the Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> house, and frequented by all other Protestant <hi>English,</hi> and by conforming himself to please the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in divers Rites of their Religion, even so far as to kneel and adore their Sacrament) from time to time give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hope of the Prince his Conversion:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> The which Conversion he endeavored to procure by all means possible; and thereby caused the Spanish Ministers to propound far worse Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Religion, then had been formerly by the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> setled and signed under their Majesties hands, with a Clause in the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Answer of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 12. 1622. That they held the Articles agreed upon sufficient, and such as ought to induce the Pope to the granting of the Dispensation.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. That the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> having several times in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> moved and pressed his late Majesty, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Conde of <hi>Gondomar,</hi> to write a Letter unto the Pope, and to that purpose having once brought a Letter ready drawn, wherewith the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> by his Majesty being made acquainted, did so strongly oppose the writing of any such Letter, that during the abode of the said Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> in <hi>England</hi> the said Duke could not obtain it; yet not long after the Earl was gone, he procured such a Letter to be written from his late Majesty unto the Pope, and to have him stiled [<hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctissime <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Pater.</hi>]</p>
                        <p n="5">V. That the Pope being informed of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham's</hi> inclination and intention in point of Religion, sent unto the said Duke a particular Bull in parchment, for to perswade and encourage him in the perversion of his Majesty then Prince.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="267" facs="tcp:35668:146"/>VI. That the said Dukes behaviour in <hi>Spain</hi> was such, that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by so incensed the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Ministers, as they would admit of no reconciliation, nor further dealing with him. Whereupon the said Duke seeing that the Match would be now to his disadvantage, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to break it, not for any service to the Kingdom, nor dislike of the Match in it self, nor for that he found (as since he hath pretended) that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not really intend the said Match, but out of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> particular ends and his indignation.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. That after he intended to cross the Marriage, he put in practice divers undue courses; as namely, making use of the Letters of his Majesty (then Prince) to his own ends, and not to what they were intended; as likewise concealing divers things of high importance from his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and thereby overthrew his Majesties purposes, and advanced his own ends.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. That the said Duke, as he had with his skill and artifices for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> abused their Majesties, so to the same end he afterwards abused both Houses of Parliament by his sinister Relation of the carriage of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as shall be made appear almost in every particular that he spake unto the said Houses.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. As for scandal given by his personal behaviour, as also the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of his power with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for the procuring of Favors and Offices, which he bestowed upon base and unworthy persons for the recompence and hire of his Lust; These things, as neither fit for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> to speak, nor indeed for the House to hear, he leaveth to your Lordships wisdom how far you will be pleased to have them exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; It having been indeed a great infamy and dishonor to this Nation, that a Person of the Dukes great quality and imployments, a Privy-Counsellor, an Ambassador, eminent in his Masters favor, and solely trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Person of the Prince, should leave behind him in a Forein Court so much scandal, as he did by his ill behaviour.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. That the Duke hath been in great part the Cause of the ruine and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> misfortune of the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> and his Estates, in as much as those Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs had relation unto this Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. That the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> hath in his Relations to both Houses of Parliament wronged the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> in point of his Honor by many sinister aspersions which he hath laid upon him, and in point of his Liberty by many undue Courses through his power and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. That the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> did reveal unto his late Majesty both by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> word and letter, in what sort the said Duke had disserved him and abused his trust: And that the King by several ways sent him word, That he should rest assured he would hear the said Earl, but that he should leave it to him to take his own time. And thereupon, few days before his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he sent the Earl word, that he would hear him against the said Duke, as well as he had heard the said Duke against him.

                           <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles against the Lord <hi>Conway.</hi>
                           </note>I. THat the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> is so great a Servant of the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham's,</hi> that he hath not stuck to send the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> plain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> word, That if businesses could not be accommodated betwixt him and the Duke, he must then adhere and declare himself for the said Duke; and therefore unfit to be a Judge in any thing that concerneth the Duke or the Earl.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. That the said Lord <hi>Conway</hi> professeth himself to be a Secretary of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham's</hi> creation, and so acknowledgeth it under his own hand: And although that he be the Kings Secretary of State, and a Privy-Counsellor, he usually beginneth his Letters to the Duke, [<hi>Most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> gracious Patron.</hi>]</p>
                        <p n="3">III. That as a Creature of the said Dukes, the said Lord <hi>Conway</hi> hath been made the Instrument of keeping the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> from the Kings presence, and of imprisoning of him by Warrants only under his own hand; for which he cannot (as the Earl conceiveth) produce any sufficient Warrant.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. That by the space of Twelve moneths last past, the said Lord <hi>Conway</hi> hath been the Cause of the Earls restraint, only by misinforming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his Majesty, and procuring a Letter of restraint upon undue grounds: And when it was made apparent unto him, that the said Earl was restored to his liberty freely to follow his own affairs by his late Majesty of blessed memory, he replied, That that liberty given him by his Majesty expired with the Kings death.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. That the Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> Mother lying sick upon her death-bed, desired for her comfort to see her Son, and to give him her last blessing: Whereupon the Earl wrote to the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> to desire him to move <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the King for his leave; which he putting off from day to day, told the person imployed, That by reason of the Dukes sickness, he could not find opportunity to get the Dukes leave to move the King; And having spoken with the Duke, he made a Negative answer in the Kings name. Wherewith the Earl acquainting the King by some of his Bedchamber, his Majesty was in a very great anger, swearing the Secretary had never moved him, and that to deny the said Earl leave, was a barbarous part; and thereupon sent him presently free leave; which the Secretary hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of, sent likewise afterwards a Letter of leave, but with divers clauses and limitations differing from the leave sent him from the Kings own mouth.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. That having the businesses of the Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> in his hands, and the Earl being commanded by the King to address himself in his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions unto his Lordship, He would never deliver any Message from the said Earl, without acquainting the said Duke and receiving his directions, and in a noble manner of freeness stuck not to send him word.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. That the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> having received from the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> Twenty Interrogatories in his late Majesties name, drawn up by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Lords appointed to search into the Proceedings and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiments of the said Earl, in which search there was more then two moneths spent, divers of the said Interrogatories involving Felony and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:35668:147"/>
Teason; And his Majesty having been pleased to assure the said Earl both by Message and Letters, that upon satisfaction given to himself, and the Commissioners by his Answers, he would presently put an end to the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi>'s Businesse: The Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> having so fully answered as would admit of no reply; and that many of the Commissioners declared themseves to be fully satisfied: The said Lord <hi>Conway</hi> (being the Secretary in the Commission, to whom it properly belonged to call the Lords to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> perceiving the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> was like to be cleared, never moved for any further meeting, neither have they ever been permitted to meet until this day, whereby the troubles of the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> have been kept on foot till this present, and the said Earls Imprisonment hath been enlarged Twenty moneths; And by the Artifices of the said Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the said Lord <hi>Conway</hi> (as shall be made appear) the said Earl hath been insensibly involved and stauked into the troubles he is now in, which he doubteth not but your Lordships will judge to be a very considerable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Case.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. That for a colour of keeping the Earl from his late Majesties presence, it being pretended after the Answer to the twenty Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, that there were some few Questions more to be added; whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to when he should have answered, his Majesty swore solemnly, that without any delay he should be admitted to his presence, and that within two or three dayes he should have the said Questions sent unto him; the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> notwithstanding he acknowledged under his hand, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> had received his Majesties directions for the sending of the said Articles, and was often thereunto sollicited on the behalf of the said Earl, would never send the said Questions, and at last answered, That he had no more to do with the Earls businesses.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. That the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> being set free by his late Majesty, to come to <hi>London</hi> to follow his own Affairs as he pleased, and thereupon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Writ of Parliament sent unto him, without any Letter of Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> out of his great desire to conform all his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> actions to that which he should understand, would best please his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, sent to know whether his going or stay would be most agreeable unto his Majesty; who was pleased to answer by a Letter from my Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> That he took in ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> good part the said Earls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto him; but wished him to make some excuse for the present: The which accordingly he did, and moved, That he might have a Letter under the Kings hand to warrant his absence; but under colour of this Letter of leave, upon the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi>'s own motion and desire, the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                           <hi>Conway</hi> sent a Letter from his Majesty absolutely forbidding his coming to Parliament; and therein likewise was inserted a Clause, That the Earl should remain restrained, as he was in the time of his late Majesty; and so thereby a colour of restraint under his Majesties hand was gotten, which could never be procured in his late Majesties time; whereby the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> hath been unduly restrained ever since, without being able to procure any redress, or to make the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his Case, although he sent him all the Papers, whereby he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> might clearly see, that the Earl was not under restraint in his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties time; but never other Answer could be procured from him, but That he judged the said Earl to be under restraint, and that his Liberty was expired by the late Kings death, as is aforesaid.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. That the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> knowing that the Match for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>'s eldest Son with the Emperors Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:35668:148"/>
and being bred in the Emperors Court, was allowed and propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his late Majesty: And that his Majesty by his Letters unto his Son-in-law, declareth, That he thinketh it the fairest and clearest way for the accommodation of his Affairs, and that he will take sufficient care for his breeding in true Religion. And notwithstanding that the said Earl received a Copy of the said Letter by the late Kings order, with other Papers, setting down all that had been done in the said business, and his Majesties assent thereunto from the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> himself; yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hath he suffered all to be charged, as a crime against the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> both in the twentieth Interrogatory, and in his Majesties last Letter, that he should consent to the breeding of the young Prince in the Emperors Court. And further in the Interogatory he alledgeth it as an aggravation against the said Earl, That the breeding of the said Prince in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Court inferred to the perversion of his Religion, when he knew that his said breeding was never thought nor spoken of by the King, nor any other, but with that express Clause and Condition, That he should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be bred in his own Religion, and have such Tutors and Servants, as his Father should appoint.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. That the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> hath been the cause of all the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi>'s Troubles, by his dubious and intrapping Dispatches, and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, That the said Earl hath failed in his Directions, when it shall be made appear, that his Dispatches contained no such Directions as he hath alledged were given.</p>

            <p>The House not being satisfied to commit the Earl to the Tower, let him remain where he was before, with the Gentleman Usher; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordered, That the Kings Charge against the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> be first heard, and then the Charge of the said Earl against the Duke; yet so that the Earls Testimony against the Duke be not prevented, prejudiced, or impeached.</p>
            <p>The day following the Lord Keeper delivered a Message from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> King to the House of Lords.</p>

            <p>At this time there was an endeavor to take the Earls Cause out of the House, and to proceed by way of Indictment in the Kings-Bench: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> To which manner of proceeding why the Lords should not give way, these ensuing Reasons were offered to consideration.</p>
            <p n="1">I. IT was ordered,<note place="margin">The Reasons.</note> That in all Causes of moment, the Defendants shall have Copies of all Depositions both <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra</hi> after publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in convenient time, before hearing, to prepare themselves; and if the Defendants will demand that of the House in due time, they shall have their learned Council to assist them in their defence: And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their Lordships declared, That they did give their assents thereto; because in all Cases, as well Civil as Criminal and Capital, they hold, That all lawfull help could not before just Judges make one that is guilty avoid Justice; and on the other side, God defend that an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent should be condemned.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> by his Petition to the House complained of his restraint, desiring to be heard here, as well in points of his wrongs, as in his accusations against the Duke; whereof his Majesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> taking consideration, signified his pleasure by the Lord Keeper <hi>April</hi> the 20, That his Majesty was resolved to put his Cause upon the honor and justice of this House; and that his pleasure was that the said Earl should be sent for as a Delinquent to answer the offences he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Negotiation before his Majesties going into <hi>Spain,</hi> whilest his Majesty was there, and since his coming thence; and that his Majesty would cause these things to be charged against him in this House; so as the House is fully possessed of the Cause, as well by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Earls Petition, as by the Kings assent, and the Earl brought up to the House as a Delinquent to answer his offences there; and Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney hath accordingly delivered the Charge against him in the House, and the Earl also his Charge against the Duke: And now if he be proceeded withal by way of Indictment in the Kings-Bench, these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous inconveniences will follow; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. He can have no Counsel.</item>
               <item>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 2. He can use no Witness against the King.</item>
               <item>3. He cannot know what the Evidences against him will be, in a convenient time to prepare for his Defence; and so the Innocent may be condemned, which may be the Case of any Peer.</item>
               <item>
                  <p n="4">4. The Liberties of the House will be thereby infrigned, the Honor and Justice thereof declined, contrary to the Kings pleasure expresly signified by the Lord Keeper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> All these things are expresly against the Order.</p>
               </item>
               <item>5. The Earl being indicted, it will not be in the power of the House to keep him from Arraignment, and so he may be disabled to make good his Charge against the Duke.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Therefore the way to proceed according to the Directions and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:35668:149"/>
true meaning of the Order, and the Kings pleasure already signified, and preserve the Liberties of the House, and protect one from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, will be</p>
            <p>First, To have the Charge delivered into the House in writing, and the Earl to set down his Answer to it in writing; and that the Witnesses may be examined, and Evidences on both sides heard, by such course and manner of proceedings as shall be thought fit by the House; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> if upon full hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the House shall finde it to be Treason, then to proceed by way of Indictment; if doubtfull in point of Law, to have the opinion of the Judges to clear it; if doutfull in matter of Fact, then to refer it to a regal Fait; And the rather for that <list>
                  <item>1. It appears that the Earl, in the space of two years (till now he complained) hath not been so much as questioned for matter of Treason.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. He hath been examined upon twenty Interrogatories, and the Commissioners satisfie that his Answer would admit of no Reply.</item>
                  <item>3. The Lord <hi>Conway</hi> by several Letters hath intimated, That there was nothing against him but what was pardoned by the Parliament. Pardon of 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> And signified his Majesties pleasure, That he might rest in that security he was, and sit still.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>His Majesty hath often declared both to the Countess of <hi>Bristol</hi> and others, That there was neither Fellony nor Treason against him, nor ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> else, but what a small acknowledgment would expiate.</p>
            <p>Some Cases happened in Parliament 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Caroli</hi>; wherein the Judges opinions were had; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THis Question was put to all the Justices; <hi>Whether a Peer impeached for Treason shall be tried in Parliament?</hi> And the chief Justice, in the name of all the Justices, delivered his opinion that the course <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by Law was Indictment, and this to be signified in Parliament before the Lord <hi>Steward; vide</hi> 10 <hi>Edward</hi> 4.6. or by Bill, and an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attaint the Party. An Order was made in the Upper-House of Parliament 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> That any Peer shall have Counsel in case Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal or Capital; and upon the Accusation of the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, he made a motion for Counsel; which matter was commended to the King by the Lords, with voucher of the said former Order: The King returned Answer that this was contrary to the Fundamental Laws <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the Realm; but inasmuch as it was for his Benefit and Prerogative, with which he may dispence; therefore out of his grace he would allow the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> to have his Counsel, with protestation that he would advise in the general; and the same Order was made without his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and without hearing the Justices or his Counsel. And upon the Trial of the Lord <hi>Middlesex,</hi> in a Case Criminal and not Capital, afterward, that is to say Friday after, upon the assembly of all the Justices, the Attorney of the King, by commandment of the King,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> demanded their opinion; and they with one voice agreed, That where the Trial is upon Indictment, no Counsel in Fellony or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is to be allowed, unless a matter of Law happen, or upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, or upon Plea of the Defendant, or upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Evidence, and in such Cases the Prisoner may have Counsel, but not otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:35668:149"/>The Lords by Order referred to the Justices this Question; <hi>Whether the King may be a Witness in case of Treason?</hi> Secondly, Admit that this be for Treason done, when he is privy: <hi>Whether in this case he may be a Witness, or not?</hi> and before the Resolution, this Message and Command came from the King to the Justices, that in this general Question they do not deliver any opinion; but if any point come in particular, they upon mature deliberation may give their advice. And this was declared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by the Cheif Justice in the Upper House of Parliament, and the said Matter surceased.</p>
            <p>Sitting this Parliament, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was deputed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator by several Peers, whose Votes on any occasion, he had power to make use of, <hi>viz.</hi> By the Earls of <hi>Bath, Exeter, Cumberland, Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> Lord <hi>Teinham, Colchester, Tunbridge, Evers, Darcy, Meynel, Noel, St. John</hi> of <hi>Basing, Mansfield,</hi> and <hi>Roberts.</hi> Whereupon the House of Peers made an Order, That after this Session, no Lord of this House <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> shall be capable of receiving above two Proxies, nor more to be numbred in any Cause voted.</p>
            <p>About a fortnight after, the Charge was given in against the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> the Earl gave in his Answer, which we have chosen to insert here for the Readers more conveniency, though a little out of time. And having the Answer in his hand, ready to deliver to their Lordships, he did crave leave, that by way of Introduction he might speak a few words, and began thus.</p>

                        <p>Therefore I crave leave of your Lordships, before I give my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Charge, that I may give you an account of these two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and I humbly beseech you, that what I shall speak in my just defence, may not be conceived to proceed of vain ostentation.</p>
                        <p>And first for Religion, I was in my Childhood bred in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, and rather after the stricter manner then otherwise. When I grew in years fit, I travelled into <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:35668:150"/>
self: In all which Travels, I can produce some that I consorted withal, who will witness with me, that I ever constantly used the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion I professed, without the least prevarication; no man being able to charge me, that so much as out of curiosity I ever was present at any of the exercises belonging to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, or did the least act of Conformity to any of their Rites or Ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, After my return home I was received into the service of his late Majesty of Blessed Memory, whom I served some years as a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Gentleman of his Privy Chamber, and Carver; in which time, none of his Majesties Servants received the Holy Sacrament, frequented Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and other exercises of our Religion, more then I.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, In that time of my youth, not to avoid idleness, but out of affection to Religion, I translated that excellent Book of our Faith, and great Points of our Religion, Written by Monsieur <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi>; which his late Majesty having sometimes after seen, approved so well, that he would needs have it Printed; which accordingly was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Printed in the name of Mr. <hi>Sampford,</hi> my Chaplain, to whom I gave the honor: But it was my own act, as Mr. <hi>Sampford</hi> will not deny, though to this hour I had never before spoken of it.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, About Seven or eight and twenty years of my age, I was employed Ambassador into <hi>Spain</hi> in that great business of the Treaty of the Marriage; and whereas others before me, carried with them but one Chaplain, I had two, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sampford</hi> and Mr. <hi>Boswel</hi>; and at my arival at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> I caused it to be published, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> such a day (God willing) I purposed to have a Communion, to the end that such English as were in the Town, might resort thither. Whereat the Duke <hi>De Lerma</hi> and other the great Ministers of <hi>Spain</hi> took offence, and told me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might well perceive I brought no good affection to the business I came about, that would so publickly and avowedly in that Court, where never the like was done, proclaim there a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and with high expression perswaded me to decline it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I answered, I came to do my Master service, which I would hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and effectually endeavor, but would not omit my service to God, no though my Master commanded. And at the Communion there were present One hundred persons, some of them Brothers, Kinsmen, and near dependence upon some of their Lordships, whom I see there in my eye. This I did in <hi>Spain</hi>; the like I did in <hi>Germany</hi> in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Courts in his Ambassage thither.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, I had in my several employments into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> above Five hundred persons of all qualities attending upon me, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> never one perverted in Religion: My Children carefully instructed and bred in the same Religion. I had constantly every Sabbath a Sermon in my House, and Sacraments, and other exercises of our Religion fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, A foul-mouthed <hi>Shimei</hi> railed against our late King and Religion in <hi>Spain</hi>; how I caused that to be revenged by a near Kinsman of my own, is well known.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, One of the English dying in the Town of <hi>Madrid,</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whose Religion there was some question made; and the Kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains telling me that they at the day of his death had been with him, and taken an accompt of his Faith, and that he died a Protestant: I caused him to be brought home to my House, and there buried accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Rites; whereat much ado was made, and it was threatned,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:35668:150"/>
that the Inquisitors and other Officers would come, and fetch him out, and bury him after their manner: I stood upon it, and that it was the King of <hi>Englands</hi> House, and openly protested, that whosoever should come thither with such intent, I would shoot at him with a Peece; and exhorted all my people, That if such an attempt should be, they should rather then suffer such a dishonor to our Religion, die with me in that quarrel, and hoped such English as were in the Town would do the like.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Eighthly, There having been a Monastery for English Jesuites, founded and setled at <hi>Madrid</hi> before my coming thither, and the English Arms set up, I labored to suppress it, and having written thereof to the late King, his Majesty advised me not to run my Head against the Rock; for it was an impossible thing for me to do: Yet I undertook it, and it pleased God so to bless my endeavors, That I absolutely dissolved and overthrew it. For which, the Bishop of <hi>Winchester, Montague</hi> (now with God) wrote unto me by his Majesties direction, a Letter of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> gratious acceptance of so great a Service, telling me, Besides the service I had done to the Church and Commonwealth, it should remain a Trophy of Honor to me and my Posterity for ever: And the King himself with his own hand wrote unto me, beginning his Letter, <hi>Good</hi> Fortune Digby, <hi>your good luck in your Service well deserves that stile.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ninethly, In all Negotiations in <hi>Spain,</hi> in point of Religion, I ever straightned my Instructions.</p>
                        <p>Tenthly, The Match with <hi>Spain</hi> was not moved by me, I ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a Protestant Match, and shewed many Reasons both of Conscience and State; but if with a Catholick, then rather with <hi>Spain</hi> then <hi>France,</hi> so as good Conditions might be made for Religion; as appears by a Letter I wrote and delivered to the Prince, at his first going upon the employment; for which I had like then to have been ruined for being a <hi>Puritan,</hi> as I am now for being a <hi>Papist,</hi> and all by one and the same hand.</p>
                        <p>Eleventhly, And I appeal to the Testimony of Dr. <hi>Mason</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wren,</hi> the Kings Chaplains with me in <hi>Spain,</hi> and to Mr. <hi>Sampford,</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Mr. <hi>Boswel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Frewen,</hi> my own Chaplains there. And that such Papists as have been my antient Acquaintance and Friends, being men of worth, well known to many of their Lordships, may be examined upon Oath, Whether I have not in all places as well in <hi>Spain</hi> as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and at all times upon fit occasions, avowed my self a Protestant, without the lest prevarication? Or whether I did ever any the least act that was not suitable to the same Profession? And that Mr. <hi>Frewen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wake,</hi> my own Chaplains, may give their Testimonies, whether in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> time of several dangerous sicknesses which I had of late years faln into, I have not in the time of such my sicknesses (when no man can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to dissemble with the World, being ready to leave it) made before them a Confession of my Faith, and made my Peace with God, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to die as besitted a Protestant, and good Christian. This I tell your Lordships, was my Religion I was bred in, have ever professed and lived in, and was resolved, by Gods Grace to die in; and yet was so unhappy by reason of employment, to be distasteful to many good men, that I have been suspected even by them, not well knowing me: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> And this hath been the rise the Duke hath now taken against me. Then for my love to <hi>Spain,</hi> I wonder from whence that opinion should grow, since I was there hated and shamed, as the man whom of all others they desired to have the least to do withal; having stood ever stricter in point of Religion, then by my Instructions I might have done; as
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:35668:151"/>
after the Capitulation concluded on, they understood by some intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which caused their hatred towards me.</p>
                        <p>Sure I am, I shewed it not by the service I did them; for divers years together there was not a Letter sent by that King to any other State, that the King my Master had not a Copy of before, or by that time it came to the place whither it was directed. There was not any great action on foot, whereof I had not the private Instructions, and sent them hither; not any expedition by Sea or Land, wherein I had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not some Ministers or Intelligencers, that gave me from time to time Advertisement of their Actions, and most private Intentions, whereof I advertised his Majesty from time to time. I used such industry as to get all the Papers of that Kings private Cabinet into my hands; took Copies and Notes of such of them as I thought useful; and upon every of them, set my private mark before they were conveyed back again, to the end, that if I should have had an occasion to have charged him with any thing mentioned in the same Papers, I might have let him see I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> knew it, by telling him in what Paper it was, and marked with such a mark.</p>
                        <p>There was not a Port in <hi>Spain</hi> that I had not caused the depth of it to be sounded, nor a Fort whereof I knew not the strength, both for the Garison, Munition, and other matters of advantage and disadvantage; insomuch as if it should please the King to appoint a Committee of the Lords to take accompt of me, I should by the stores I gathered there, and brought with me, make it appear I was as useful a Servant to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> His Majesty in a War, as in Peace. Whereas at his Majesties coming out of <hi>Spain</hi> the powers for the <hi>Desponsories</hi> were to be deposited in some mans hands; and the Duke upon pretence of doing me honor, but intending to break my Neck by it, moved, they might be left with me, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was contented; and so they were put into my hands, not as an Attorney onely for the Prince: But the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having taken the substitution of them by his Secretary of State entred in Legal form; whereby that King was then become interessed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in them by their occupation, as well as the Prince by granting of them. And becoming the <hi>Instrumentum stipulatum,</hi> wherein they were both interessed, they were deposited in my hands, as an indifferent person trusted between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Prince, with a Declaration of the Trust. And now the Duke was returned out of <hi>Spain,</hi> he plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ruine, and put it in execution in this manner. He concealed that the powers were to expire at <hi>Christmas,</hi> and procured his Majesty to write a Letter, (not a direct Commandment) but expressing a desire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that the <hi>Desponsories</hi> should not be till one of the days in <hi>Christmas,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereby to draw me into a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> That if I proceeded in the Match, this Letter should, as now it is, have been inforced against me, as a breach of Instructions: If I had not proceeded, then I had broken my trust between the Prince and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> overthrown the Marriage so long sought and labored, it being the main scope of my Ambassage, contrary to express Warrant, and that upon a Letter I must needs know to be a mistake. And when I had written into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to have a direct Warrant in the point, the Duke then seeing that Plot would not take, he dealt with divers great Lords, as was well known to some of their Lordships there present, to have me upon my arival in <hi>England,</hi> committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> before I should ever come to speak with the King; which the Spanish Ambassador here in <hi>England,</hi> having
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:35668:151"/>
gotten private notice of, gave advertisement thereof to that King: Who thereupon foreseeing my danger, and consulting with his Council, and Divines, what were fit for him in Honor and Conscience to do in that Case, they resolved, That seeing my Sufferings grew by being an honest man, and endeavoring to perform the trust reposed in me by that King as well as the Prince; That King was bound both in Honor and Conscience, not onely to preserve me from ruine, but to make me a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> reparation for any loss I should sustain by occasion of the Trust: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon at his departure, going to Court to take his leave, the <hi>Conde de Olivares</hi> told me what was plotted against me in <hi>England</hi>; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the danger, by reason of the greatness of my Adversary, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded me to stay there; and in his Masters Name made an offer, not in secret, but in the presence of Sir <hi>Walter Aston.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </div>

               </floatingText>
            </q>
            <p>Here he repeated those offers of Reward, Honor, and Preferment, which we have mentioned before in order of time, and at present pass it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by; he then proceeded and said,</p>
            <p>
               <q>Upon what grounds and hope came I to encounter with those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? Not upon hope of my greatness in Court, and strength of Friends, there to bolster out an ill Cause; no sure, my strength was too weak, and my adversaries too powerful: But I knew my Conscience was clear, and my Cause was good, and trusted in God Almighty. And to him now, and to their Lordships judgments, recommended my self, and my Cause.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And then he delivered his Answer, desiring their Lordships it might be after Recorded in Parchment, that it might remain to posterity; which being read by one of his Council, the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> asked him, Whether he desired to say any more then he had done? he answered, That he had something more to say, but knew not the order, or whether Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> would speak first; but he being desired to speak, He desired their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships he might put them in minde of what he conceived they had already promised, which was, That the Duke whom he accused in that House of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> far higher offences then any, with which he was charged, might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with as he was, and that they might be upon equal Conditions. And that such heads as he had delivered against the Duke, being of such Matters as he met withal in his Negotiation as an Ambassador; and which he had according to his duty acquainted the State withal, might by their Lordships care and order be put into Legal form, and prosecuted; for so was the use when he had the honor to sit at the Council Table. He said, He conceived he had already done his part to inform, and would be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ready to make it good, it concerning their Lordships to see it prosecuted, it not being to be expected that he should solicit it; or if he would, he could not, being under restraint. And he desired likewise, that the Judges might deliver their opinions, Whether the matter charged against him, were Treason; that if it should not so be in their opinions, he might not lie under so heavy a burthen.</p>
            <p>He put their Lordships in minde, that it was a strange manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, that upon a displeasure, a Peer of the Kingdom complaining of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> those that had practised against him, and had been the causers of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, should then, and never but then, be charged with Treason. He told them it was not his case alone, but it equally concerned them and their Posterity, and it might be some others hereafter, more then him now. For he said he thanked God he had some experience in the World, and thereby and by those things he had kept, was able to make his innocency
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:35668:152"/>
appear, which perhaps would not be every mans hereafter; and so many an honest heart in a good cause distracted with fears, and abandoned of Friends, might perish through the malice of a potent Adversary.</p>
            <p>The Lords again asked him whether he had any thing more to say; he answered No, but desired leave onely to explain himself in two things; one in his Speech now spoken, and the other when he was first brought to the House. That in his Speech this day, was, where he affirmed he had like to have been ruined in his Negotiation: First, For being a <hi>Puritan,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and now for being a <hi>Papist,</hi> and both by one hand; he explained it to be by the hand of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> And the other when he first came to the House, saying there, For Redress of former sufferings, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the sudden with Treason charged upon him, he spake in Passion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the Wrongs and Injuries done him by the Duke; and told their Lordships, he had used means to convey part of his Sufferings to the late King his Master, who in the Dukes hearing, sware he would (after he had heard the Duke against him) hear him also against the Duke; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which his Majesty suffered much, or to some such purpose. Now he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth this Speech to reflect upon what was in Agitation in the Lower House; but he said, although he could not well excuse the Dukes indiscretion in that point; yet he spake it not any ways to corroborate that opinion; For howsoever the Duke were his enemy, yet he could not think so dishonorably of him.</p>
            <p>The Answer of the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> to the Articles of several High Treasons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and other great and enormous Crimes, Offences, and Contempts, supposed to be committed by him against our late Soveraign Lord King <hi>James</hi> of Blessed Memory, deceased, and our Soveraign Lord the Kings Majesty that now is; wherewith the said Earl is charged by his Majesties <hi>Attorney-General,</hi> on his Majesties behalf, in the most High and Honorable Court of Parliament, before the King and the Lords there. And not acknowledging any the supposed Treasons, Crimes, Offences, and Contempts, wherewith he is charged in, and by the said Articles to be true; and saving to himself all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> advantages, benefit, and exception, to the Incertainty and Insufficiency of the said Articles; and of the several Charges in them contained: And hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly praying, that his Cause may not suffer for want of Legal form, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he hath not been used, but may be judged according to such real and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Grounds and Proofs, as may be accepted from an Ambassador (the ground of the Charge growing thence) and that he may have leave to explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his own meaning in any thing that may seem of a doubtful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. For Answer, saith as followeth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                     <hi>England,</hi> had since his coming hither obtained but three great Boons for his Majesties service; <hi>viz.</hi> The Loan of Money from the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Contribution in <hi>England</hi> of the City and Countries, and the sending Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors to the contrary parties, that my Lord <hi>Digby</hi> had been the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder of all those to the King my Master, before his Majesties Ambassador, or any other of his servants in <hi>England</hi>; although his Lordship were contented that others who were but set on should carry away the thanks and prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Lordship being known to be the first mover therein might possibly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> weaken the credit he hath in <hi>Spain,</hi> and to render himself the more valuable to serve both his own Master and his Majesty; in which respect I humbly prayed his Majesty to keep this to himself.</p>

            <p>By which testimony it may appear, as the said Earl conceiveth, how he the said Earl bestowed himself before his Ambassage, and in his said Ambassage with his said late Majesties approbation thereof. Now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he humbly craveth leave to give your Lordships accompt how he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after his return from the Emperors Court.</p>
            <p>Assoon as he came into <hi>England,</hi> he discovered unto his Majesty and the Lords of the Councel, in what great wants he had left the Forces in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and sollicited the present sending away of money; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Thirty thousand pound was borrowed of Sir <hi>Peter Vanlore,</hi> Sir <hi>Baptist Hicks,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Cortine,</hi> and presently sent unto the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> besides the Ten thousand pounds which he lent for which he paid the interest out of his Purse for six moneths, having also given not long before Five hundred pounds by way of benevolence to the service of the said <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the interim betwixt his return from the English Coasts, which was in <hi>November</hi> 1621, and his going into <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1622, he first
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:35668:154"/>
gave his Accompt as aforesaid of his Ambassage to both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and moved them as effectually as was possible for the supplying of his Majesty, and that the money might wholly be imployed for the Succor of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament being dissolved, he sollicited with great care and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry the setling of some Course for the supplying of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and his Majesty was perswaded to maintain Eight thousand Foot and Sixteen hundred Horse under his own Standard, and at his own purse in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to establish a certain course for due payment of the said Army: The Lord <hi>Chichester</hi> was upon the said Earls motion sent for out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the said Earl by his Majesties command took order for his Dispatch. In this estate the said Earl left his Affairs at his departure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1622, nothing doubting but that all things would have effectually constantly been pursued, according to the order which was setled and resolved on at his departure.</p>
            <p>At his arrival at the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> he presently proceeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to his Instructions, pressing the business of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as he could,<note place="margin">His arrival in <hi>Spain</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior there.</note> and faithfully labored and effected from time to time (as far as to the point of Negotiation) all particulars that were given him in charge, as it will appear by his late Majesties Letters upon every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occasion; and if by the accidents of War for that Summer, the Marquess of <hi>Baden,</hi> the Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Brunswick</hi> received each of them an overthrow, (the ordering of whose Affairs his Majesty so far complained of to his Son-in-law, as to give order for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> withdrawing of his Forces, as will appear by his Majesties Letters on the third of <hi>Iune</hi> 1622, and also by his Letters unto Sir <hi>Horace Vere,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Chichester</hi> of the same date, if there were not a speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress) if by any of those accidents those businesses have miscarried, the said Earl hopes he shall not be liable to the blame, it having no relation to him, or to his imployment, having so far and so honestly with his best affections imployed his care and utmost services in the businesses, as his Majesty was pleased by many several Letters upon several Actions to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his gracious acceptance of his service, as in his Letters of <hi>November</hi> 24. 1622. written as followeth; <hi>Viz.</hi>

            <p>And <hi>Frankendale</hi> being by the said Earls means once saved, was again the second time saved meerly by the said Earls industry; and procuring a Letter from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> dated the second of <hi>February</hi> 1623. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed the Treaty of Sequestration, which hath since continued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And when his Royal Majesty that now is, and the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> arrived at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> they found the Business of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi> in so fair a way, that the Spanish Ministers told them, the King should give his late Majesty a Blank, in which we might frame our own Conditions; and the same he confirmeth unto us now; and the like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> touching this Blank was likewise acknowledged by the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in his Speech in Parliament, after the return of his Majesty out of <hi>Spain.</hi> And it will appear by the Testimony of Sir <hi>Walter Aston,</hi> and by his and the said Earls Dispatches, that the said Earl wanted not industry, and zeal in the business; insomuch as the last Answer the said Earl pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured herein from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was fuller then he the said Earl was ordered by his late Majesties latest Letters to insist upon. So as by that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which hath been alledged, the said Earl hopeth your Lordships will be satisfied, not onely that he wanted neither will nor industry, but that he hath with all true zeal and affection, and with his own means faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully served their Majesties, and the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> in this Cause: And for assurance in that Affair, he had all that could be between Christian Princes; and if in the said Assurances there hath been any deceit, as by the said Article is intimated, which he never knew nor believed, he referred it to God to punish their wickedness: For betwixt Princes there can be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> no greater Tye then their Words, their Hands, and Seals, all which he procured in that behalf; and both the said Earl and Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> were so confident that the business would be ended to his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties satisfaction, that in a joynt Dispatch to his late Majesty of 24 <hi>November</hi> 1623. after his now Majesties return into <hi>England,</hi> they wrote as followeth; <hi>Viz.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">His carriage concerning the Match.</note>And first touching his hopes and assurances that he is charged to have given to his late Majesty and Ministers of State here in <hi>England,</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> real proceedings in the said Match, when he said he knew they never meant it: He saith, he never gave any hopes of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but such, and the very same that were first given to him, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or diminishing; neither could he have done otherwise either with honesty or safety. And he further saith, That the hopes he gave were not upon any Intelligence; but as well in that of the <hi>Match,</hi> as the other of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> his Advertisements were grounded upon all the Assurances both of Words and Writing, that could possibly pass between Christians; as will be made evidently appear by his Dispatch of 9 <hi>September</hi> 1623; which he humbly desires may be read, if the length <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of it may not displease. The substance being to shew all the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Promises of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he really intended the Match. And the causes why the <hi>Conde Olivares</hi> pretended to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that the Match was not formerly meant, was onely thereby to free himself from Treating any longer with the said Earl, to the end that he might treat for larger Conditions in point of Religion with the said Duke: The said <hi>Conde Olivares</hi> taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of having the Person of his Majesty, then Prince, in his hands.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And with this Dispatch the said Earl acquainted his Majesty that now is, in <hi>Spain</hi> before he sent it.</p>
            <p>And by this Dispatch the Earl doubteth not but that it will appear to this Honorable Court, that whilest the Treating of this business was in hand, he proceeded in that, not onely with care and industry, but with some measure of vigilancy. And for clearing an Objection that hath been alleadged, that the Match was never meant before the Dukes coming into <hi>Spain,</hi> nor after; the Earl craveth leave to set down some few Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of many,<note place="margin">Means to shew that the Match was intended by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</note> which caused him to believe that the said Match was, and had been really meant, and that it was so conceived by both their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and their Ministers on both sides.</p>
            <p>For first, The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> certified his late Majesty, that the business of the Marriage was brought to a happy Conclusion; whereupon his late Majesty was pleased to give order to the Duke and Earl to proceed in the Business, which his said Majesty would not have Treated till the said Marriage was concluded, as will appear by a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Letter of his said late Majesty joyntly to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the said Earl, of the 23 <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1623.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will appear by Letters of the said Lord <hi>Conway</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> bearing date <hi>September</hi> 4. 1623. That the said Duke had good assurance of the Conclusion of the said Match; and upon this confidence were all things put in due execution in <hi>England,</hi> as had been Capitulated; And the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> and others faithfully agreed, and setled all the Points of Immunity and Liberty for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Catholicks, for the use of their Religion, as was set down in the Declaration, <hi>August</hi> 9. 1623. hereafter mentioned in the Answers to the Fifth Article of this Charge.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the very day his now Majesty and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> departed from the <hi>Escurial</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> towards <hi>England,</hi> the said Duke
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:35668:155"/>
solemnly swore the Treaty of the said Marriage, and the furtherance of it all that should be in his power, upon the holy Evangelists, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the said Earl and Sir <hi>Walter Aston.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Treaty of the said Marriage had been formerly signed, sealed, and solemnly sworne by the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> And when his Majesty and that King took their leaves, he did solemnly in the words of a King faithfully and punctually protest to perform all that had been capitulated in the Treaty of Marriage; and thereupon imbraced his Majesty at his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> departure, and sent the very next day a Letter written all with his own hand to his Majesty, vowing and protesting to make all good that he had capitulated or promised unto his Majesty at his departure the day before. So that if there were no true meaning on the part of <hi>Spain</hi> to make the Marriage, as by Mr. Attorney is pretended, yet certainly the Earl hath not been sleightly deceived; neither can it be, as he conceiveth, any fault in him, since not only his late Majesty, but also his Majesty that now is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> being then both upon the place, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently believe, and that upon other grounds then misinformations, sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions and perswasions of the said Earl, that the Marriage was really intended: And to that effect both his late Majesty of blessed memory, and his most Excellent Majesty that now is, after his return into <hi>England,</hi> wrote unto him the said Earl several Letters, assuring him that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and pleasures were to have the said Match proceeded in, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Proxies of his Majesty then Prince were again inrolled and sent unto the said Earl. So that the said Earl having so many, and so great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> causes to be assured that the Match was really intended on both sides, he conceiveth it will be hard for Mr. Attorney to make good that part of his Charge, wherein he affirmeth that the Earl should know the contrary, or the Assurance to be upon false grounds, as in the said Article is alleadged.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To the Second Article, He directly denieth all the supposed Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wherewith he stands charged by the said Article. And for a clear declaration and manifestation of the truth and manner of his proceedings, He saith,</p>
            <p>First, as to the continuing the Treaties upon Generalities, That the Temporal Articles were by Agreements on both sides not to be treated or setled, until such time as the Articles of Religion were fully agreed on; For that it was held most proper and honorable for both sides, first to see if the Difficulty of Religion might be removed, before they passed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to any further Engagements. And the said Articles of Religion, by reason of the Popes new Demands sent into <hi>England</hi> by Mr. <hi>Gage,</hi> were not signed nor condescended unto by his late Majesty, nor his Majesty that now is, then Prince, until <hi>Ian.</hi> 5. 1622. and were then sent away in Post out of <hi>England</hi> to the said Earl by Mr. <hi>Simon Digby,</hi> who arrived with them at <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> about the 25. of the same moneth. But the Earls care was such to have no time spent in the setling of the Temporal Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; that before he would condescend so much as <hi>de bene esse</hi> unto the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Articles of Religion, that they should be sent back to <hi>Rome,</hi> he procured the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to promise, That within the time limited for procuring the <hi>Desponsories,</hi> which was by <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> following the furthest, all the Temporal Articles should be setled and agreed, to the end that the <hi>Infanta</hi> might be delivered at the Spring; as by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his Answer in writing, was declared to be the Kings intention. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:35668:156"/>
Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> and the said Earl did not deal in general, but did most industriously labor to settle all in particular, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Portion should be Two Millions, it appearing that it was so agreed by the late King of <hi>Spain:</hi> That the Dispensation coming, the <hi>Desponsories</hi> should be within Forty days after; And that <hi>Don Duarte de Portugal</hi> should be the man that should attend the <hi>Infanta</hi> in the Journey. And all other Particulars necessary for the Conclusion of the said Treaties, were by Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> and the said Earl, and the Spanish Commissioners,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> drawn up into heads in writing, and after many Debates they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with that King; and 2 <hi>Martii</hi> 1623. <hi>stilo vet.</hi> the <hi>Conde Gondomar,</hi> and the Secretary <hi>Don Andreas de Prada,</hi> were appointed to come home to the house of the said Earl, to signifie unto Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as they did, That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had declared his resolution in all the Particulars, and given them order to come to a speedy Conclusion with them in all things: And that Kings Answer to that Conclusion the Earl saw, and read all written with the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> own hand.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>On the seventh day of the said moneth of <hi>March</hi> 1623. the Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Majesty, then Prince, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> arrived at <hi>Madrid</hi>; And then the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took new laws, and the Negotiation was put into a new form. So that whereas it is objected against the Earl, that he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and continued the Treaties so long upon Generalities; He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it is not meant upon the Spiritual Articles, for they were such as were sent from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and from thence they came to the Earl:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And for the Temporal Articles, they were not to be setled and treated, till the Articles of Religion were concluded. He conceiveth it cannot be alleadged with any colour, that his Majesty was entertained with Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, since the time that the said Articles of Religion were brought unto the said Earl by Mr. <hi>Simon Digby,</hi> being about the 25. of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> There were but six weeks until <hi>March</hi> 7. following, when his Majesty then Prince arrived in <hi>Madrid</hi>; and in the interim all the above-mentioned Particulars were setled: And the time that hath been spent in this Treaty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hath not been through his the said Earls default in continuing upon Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralities without pressing to Particulars, but hath been caused as well by Difficulties which the business brought with it, as also with exterior Accidents, <hi>viz.</hi> The Wars of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the death of two Popes and of the late King of <hi>Spain,</hi> without the least fault of the said Earl, as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by his late Majesty of blessed memory, in the said Earl his Instructions on the 14. of <hi>March</hi> 1621.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Bristol</hi> not the cause of the Delays in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note>Neither could any delay herein be attributed unto him the said Earl; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> For he was imployed in those times into <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Cottington</hi> for the space of three or four years were resident in <hi>Spain</hi>; from whence the hopes they gave were upon all the discreet grounds that Ministers can expect from a State: But the Earl reassumed this business six moneths before his Majesties coming into <hi>Spain</hi>; and he was so desirous to see his Majesty then Prince bestowed, that he pressed nothing so much both to the King and Prince, as that the Prince might lose no more time, and rather to break the Match with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
               <hi>Spain</hi> then suffer any further delays; as will appear by his Dispatches from his first arrival at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> until his Majesties then Prince his coming.

            <p>All which things being considered, the Earl most humbly submitteth himself to the Judgment of that most high and honorable Court, whether the Delays which accidents have brought forth in this business can be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> attributed to his fault; since on the one side it will evidently appear to your Lordships, that be never moved his Majesty and the Prince to admit of delays, but rather to think of some other course; and it will on the other side appear by all the Dispatches, that he pressed things with the Ministers of <hi>Spain</hi> to as speedy a conclusion, as the uttermost terms of fair Negotiation and good manners would bear. And whereas it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should take occasion by entertaining the said Treaties to abuse his said late Majesty, (which he knoweth not) yet he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> saith he used all the vigilancie and industry that a careful Minister could do, and had from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> all the assurances by oaths, words and writings, which could be expected from Christians; the which, without adding or diminishing, he faithfully presented unto his said late Majesty; and his said late Majesty was pleased in those times to conceive upon those assurances, that they dealt really with him: And he conceiveth that his Majesty that now is, then Prince, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> were pleased to write as much to the late Kings Majesty at their first coming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> into <hi>Spain,</hi> and that all which the said Earl had written touching that imploiment was there avowed by the <hi>Conde Olivarez</hi> and <hi>Conde Gondomar</hi> to the said Prince and Duke, at their arrival at <hi>Madrid</hi>; and he hopeth that if that Dispatch may be perused, it will as well appear and be adjudged that he served his Majesty with some measure of vigilancie, as well as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of fidelity.</p>

               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:35668:157"/>III. To the Third Article the said Earl saith, That he did not either by words or by Letters to his late Majesty or his Ministers, extol, or magnifie the greatness and power of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to his late Majesty the supposed dangers that might ensue unto him, if a War should happen between him and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor affirmed nor insinuated the same, as in the said Article is mentioned; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but if he did at any time speak or write of the power and greatness of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or represented any danger to his said late Majesty that might ensue by entring into Hostility with the said King of <hi>Spain,</hi> it was as a faithful Counsellor and Servant to his Majesty by way of his advice and opinion, which he ever delivered sincerely, faithfully, and truly, according to the present occasion, and in no wise with such as intent as in the said Article is mentioned, nor to any other evil intent and purpose whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> But he hath been so far from disswading his late Majesty to take Arms,<note place="margin">He never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the King to take Arms.</note> that he hath upon all just occasions advised, that all fitting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for War might be made, as beginning with the year 1621. from which time he is onely charged, will appear by his Speech in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament presently after his return out of <hi>Germany</hi>; and that he hoped his Majesty would no longer relie upon single Treaties, but make all fitting preparations for War; and that the Parliament would enable his Majesty thereunto; and by the care he took before his going again upon his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> into <hi>Spain,</hi> that the establishment of an Army under his Majesties own Standard, of Horse and Foot, and under his own pay, might be setled and provided for; as likewise his advice to the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that his Majesty might have a curb upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> upon all occasions, by continuing of Sir <hi>Robert Mansfields</hi> Fleet upon the Coasts of <hi>Spain,</hi> as will appear by his Letter written from <hi>Vienna,</hi> 26 <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1621. mentioned in the Answer to the first Article. By all which it appeareth, That he labored and endeavored as much as in him lay, that his Majesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> might be well prepared for any occasions of War that should happen. And he no way remembreth to have discouraged, or to have spoken or written any thing that might have been understood to have tended to the discouraging of his said late Majesty for the taking of Arms, and entring into hostility with <hi>Spain,</hi> or for resisting of him and his Forces, from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the Invasions of his late Majesties Dominions, or the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his late Majesties Confederates, Friends, or Allies, as by the said Article is charged against him; neither remembreth that he had any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cause so to do. But if he have in any kinde spoken or written of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the power thereof, it may have been to his late Majesty, or his Majesty that now is, by way of discourse, speaking of the solidness of the Spanish proceedings, of their serious and deliberate debating of business before they resolve on them, of the constant pursuing of them when they are once resolved, wishing that <hi>England</hi> and other Nations would therein imitate them: For he supposeth the right way to impeach their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, was to grow as wise as they, and to beat them at their own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> But otherwise he is confident never to have been heard to speak or write any thing that might give any terror or discouragement, to his late Majesty or his cheif Ministers, knowing that <hi>England</hi> well-ordered, need to take little terror at the power of <hi>Spain,</hi> having almost in all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and enterprises won honor upon them. And as for the preventing of dangers that might ensue upon a War, though he knew not what is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:35668:158"/>
aimed at in that particular; yet he is most confident out of the Integrity of his own Conscience, That he neither said, nor advised any thing but what befitted a faithful Counsellor and an Ambassador, which was truly to deliver his opinion as he understood it upon the present occasion: And as for affirming that his Majesties quiet should be disturbed, and he not to be permitted to Hawk or to Hunt, he remembreth not what discourse he may have had, or written to any person, how fit it might be upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broiled in a great War, seriously to intend it, and to make it our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whole work. But as he is confident it will appear, that what discourse soever it might have been, it wanted not true zeal and affection which he hath ever borne to the Kings service. And he hopeth it will not be found to want due respect and reverence on his part, which he ought to shew to so gratious a Master. Neither can it be conceived, that the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Hunting and Fowling, should be considerations worthy so great and prudent a King, to withhold from a War for the good of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his Kingdom, if he should have been justly provoked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. To the Fourth Article the said Earl saith, That he did not any thing contrary to his duty and alleagiance, or contrary to the faith and duty of an Ambassador, as by this Article is alleaged, but did intend the service and honor of his late Majesty, and no corrupt and sinister ends of his own advancement, as by this Article is also alleaged. And as for the Conferences which is pretended he should hold concerning the Treaty,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> That being told there was little probability that the said Treaties would or could have good success, he should acknowledge as much; and yet said, he cared not what the success thereof might be, but that he would take care to have his Instructions perfect, and to pursue them punctually, and would make his Fortune thereby, or words to that effect; he doth not ever remember to have held such discourse. Though it be true, the time hath been many years since, when he thought the Match very unlike to be effected, in regard unequal Answers were given in Prince <hi>Henries</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> days, and of the unlikelihood of accommodating the differences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And saith further, That the reviving of the Treaty of the said Match for his Majesty that now is, was not by his means, for he ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his opinion clearly, both to his late Majesty and to his Majesty that now is,<note place="margin">He advised both King and Prince to a Protestant Match.</note> That in the first place he wished and advised a Protestant Match, but in the duty of a Servant understanding that both their Majesties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the Match really with <hi>Spain,</hi> he did really and faithfully intend the service and honor of their Majesties, and effectually endeavored to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their ends. And it is very likely he might say, he would get his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions perfect, and pursue them punctually, as he conceiveth was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fit for him; but the latter part of this Conference, that he should say he would make his fortune by it, or any other words to that effect; he was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1621. and ever since of that rank and quality, both in regard of his Imployments, Fortunes, and his Majesties favors, that he assureth himself he did not, and dares Answer so far for his discretion, That it was impossible for him to hold so mean and unworthy discourse.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. To the Fifth Article he saith, That what is therein alleaged, is so far from being so, that contrarily upon all occasions to the uttermost of his power, he did labor to prevent all the inconveniences in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that might come by matching with a Princess of a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:35668:158"/>
as well appeareth by the Paper of his opinion, that his Majesty should marry with a Lady of his own Religion, hereafter mentioned in his Answer to the Seventh Article. And for further proof thereof, he saith, That in the whole Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> he stood more strict in points of Religion, then by his Instructions he needed to have done, as will appear by the Testimony of Sir <hi>Walter Aston,</hi> and his Dispatches of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Twelfth of <hi>December,</hi> 1622. and other Dispatches, which he desireth may be read.<note place="margin">He never moved his Majesty to set Priests at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</note> And as for concealing or perswading to set at liberty the Priests or Jesuits, he utterly denieth to have done any such thing, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath answered. Although it be true, that the Ambassage in <hi>Spain</hi> be far different from the employment in other places, where there is a Body of our Reformed Religion, and whereby his Majesty hath Kinred and Allies; whereby his Majesties Ministers may be informed of the necessary Occurrents of State, without the helps of Priests or Jesuites. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> But in <hi>Spain</hi> there being none but <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, nor any manner of correspondency or intelligence but by them, the Ambassadors must make use of all sorts of people, especially of Jesuites and Priests, and to that end Ambassadors sent thither have a large and particular Warrant under the Kings hand, to treat, and make use of Priests and Jesuites, and all other sorts of men, unless it be such as are proclaimed Rebels: And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times the Ministers employed in <hi>Spain,</hi> to gratifie some whom there they employed for the Kings service, have as he believeth, at their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Suit moved his Majesty to extend Grace and Favor to some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Friend, and Kinsman of his, being a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned in <hi>England</hi>; and that he remembreth to have hapned to others, but doth not remember himself to have written to his late Majesty in that kinde: And as concerning his advice and counsel, to set at liberty Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites and Priests, and the granting to the Papists a Toleration, or the silencing of the Laws against them, he said, that his late Majesty was engaged by the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> 1617. in divers matters concerning Religion; likewise by promise to <hi>Conde Gondomar,</hi> and his Letters to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> 17 <hi>April,</hi> 1620. wherein he is pleased to promise some particulars in favor of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, as by the said Letters will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: And notwithstanding the said Earl had sufficient Warrant under the Kings own hand, to assure the King of <hi>Spain</hi> whatsoever was agreed in the said Article, or in the said Letters, his Majesty would sincerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; yet the said Earl was so cautious in that point, that when for the conclusion of the Match the other Articles of Religion being allowed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it was pressed by the Spanish Ministers, that a Clause of Convenience might be inserted with Protestation, That the form and way thereof should be wholly left to his Majesties wisdom and clemency, and that his Majesties <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick-Subjects should acknowledge this Grace to have come from the Kings Majesties mercy and goodness: Yet the said Earl would not condescend hereunto <hi>De bene esse,</hi> as by his Letters to Master Secretary <hi>Calvert,</hi> 8 <hi>October,</hi> 1622. will appear, hereby to give his Majesty time to have recourse unto his second Consultation, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> take it into consideration before he would engage or binde himself in this point: But his late Majesty and his Majesty that now is, were pleased to condiscend hereunto by signing the said Articles with their own hands; and likewise by writing their private Letters of the Eight of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1622. to that effect to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as by the said Letters will appear. Neither did the said Earl by Letters, or otherwise, ever counsel or perswade his late Majesty, to grant or allow unto the Papists or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:35668:159"/>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion a free Toleration, and Silencing of the Laws made and standing in force against them, but ever protested against any such Toleration; and when any such Provision hath been offered to be made in <hi>Spain,</hi> he ever refused so much as to give ear to it, or to suffer it to be propounded; although it be true, that he hath since seen a Paper touching Pardons, Suspensions, and Dispensations for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, bearing date the Seventh of <hi>August,</hi> 1623. signed by the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and others, which in effect is little less then a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Toleration; which Paper is that which followeth.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:35668:160"/>But this Declaration, the said Earl saith and affirmeth was the effect of the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> Negotiation, and treated and concluded by the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> with the Spanish Ambassador here, whilst the Prince was in <hi>Spain</hi>; neither was his privity or advice in it: For if he had known it, he should have protested against it. All which, together with the difference betwixt the Conditions of Religion agreed at the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> 12 <hi>December,</hi> 1622. by the said Earl, and the said Sir <hi>Walter Aston,</hi> being by their Lordships considered, the said Earl doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not but it will manifestly appear whose endeavor it was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Romish Religion, and the Professors thereof; and judge the said Earl most unfortunate to be charged with an Article of this kinde.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. To the Sixth Article the Earl saith, That the Assurances which he gave his late Majesty, and his Majesty that now is, concerning the Treaties, were such, That it had been dishonesty and breach of his duty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and trust, for him to have held them back, being the same that were given him by the Emperor, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and their Ministers, upon as great Assurances as can pass between Ministers of Princes in the like case. And for the Delays of <hi>Spain,</hi> they could be never so ill, and with so little colour complained of, as at the time of his Majesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither; for that a certain time was before then prefixed for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Dispensation, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> 1623. at the furthest, which was the next moneth after the Princes arival at <hi>Madrid</hi>; the <hi>Desponsories</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> were to be within four days following, and the <hi>Infanta</hi> to begin her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>England</hi> twenty days after: So as three moneths patience longer would have shewed the issue of the business without putting of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Prince, being Heir-Apparant to the Crown, in so eminent a hazard for the trying of an experiment. And it is an argument of great suspition, because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were suspected to have dealt falsly, and so the less to be trusted with the person of the Prince, to be put into their hands to try conclusions: But the truth is, though that were made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the pretended ground, and the occasion of the journey, it was neither the Assurances of the said Earl, nor the Jealousies of <hi>Spain,</hi> but other Motives that were the original cause of his Majesties said journey, as shall be sufficiently made apparent in due time. And the said Earl having got an inkling of it by something that was let fall from the <hi>Conde Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> to that purpose, instantly dispatched away Mr. <hi>Grisley</hi> to his late Majesty to have this journey prevented; who upon the Confines of <hi>France,</hi> met with his Majesty and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> towards <hi>Spain,</hi> and told them as much. So that although he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth what is laid in the Charge to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That by the said journey, the person of the Prince, the peace and safety of the Kingdom did undergo further danger (at the remembrance thereof the hearts of all good Subjects do tremble) yet the blame is due to the Authors and Advisers of the same journey, and not to the said Earl: And although it pleased God, to the exceeding great joy and comfort of the said Earl, and of all good men, to send his gratious Majesty home with safety; yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> never was the person of any Prince, upon such grounds, exposed to so great an hazard, and in such Cases; not the Success but the Counsellors, are considerable.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. To the Seventh Article the said Earl saith, That he did not
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:35668:160"/>
move or perswade his Majesty, then Prince, to change his Religion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the manner in the said Article mentioned, nor in any other manner whatsoever: Neither doth he conceive, that the charge in it self as it is laid, will in any reasonable construction bear any such inference as is made therein; so as he conceiveth he needeth not make any further or other Answer thereunto. Yet that it may appear that the manner he used to the said Prince, was not traiterously, falsly, or cunningly, nor without ground, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or to any such intent as in the said Article is supposed. And to manifest unto this most high and honorable Court, how far he was from all such intention, he saith, That he doth acknowledge that within few days after his Majesties coming into <hi>Spain,</hi> whilst he had that great honor to have his Majesty lodged in his House,<note place="margin">He perswaded not the Prince to change his Religion.</note> and to have so Royal a Guest, finding by the Spanish Ministers, That there was a general opinion, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties coming thither was with an intention to become a <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and the <hi>Conde Gondomar</hi> having that very morning pressed the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Earl not to hinder so pious a work (as he termed it) of his Majesties Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and seeming to be assured of the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> assistance therein, his Majesty being all alone in a withdrawing Room in the said Earl his House, the said Earl kneeled unto him, and told him, That he had a business to impart unto him, which highly imported his Majesty to know, so that he might be assured his boldness therein might be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which his Majesty gratiously promised. And thereupon the said Earl told his Majesty, That the general opinion of that Court was, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his Majesties coming into <hi>Spain,</hi> was with an intention to be a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, and there to declare it. And he confesseth, That at the same time in regard of those things he had heard, he humbly besought his Majesty to deal freely with him as a Servant, of whose fidelity he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, or words to that effect: But he was so far from perswading his Majesty to be a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, that without respecting his Majesties Answer, he declared himself to be a Protestant, and so should always continue; yet he said he should always serve his Majesty, and labor to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> advance his and the King his Fathers affairs, with as much fidelity and honesty, as any Catholick whatsoever: And his Majesty was pleased then to make unto the said Earl a full and clear Declaration of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of his constant resolution therein; and seemed to be much displeased, that any should have so unworthy an opinion of him, as to think he would for a Wife, or any other Earthly respect whatsoever, so much as waver in his Religion. Whereupon the said Earl besought his Majesty to pardon his boldness, and then intreated him not to suffer his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> business to be overthrown by permitting that conceit of his Conversion any longer to remain in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nor do any thing that might give them hope therein, alleaging, That it was impossible the Marriage could be without a Dispensation; and so long as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were to procure the Dispensation, should have hope of his Majesties Conversion, they would never content themselves with a part; to which they were tied by the Articles agreed upon with the said Earl and Sir <hi>Walter Aston.</hi> At which time his Majesty was pleased to approve of his opinion, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> said he would expect the Dispensation, and did thereupon afterwards send Mr. <hi>Andrews</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to hasten it; and the next day the said Earl dealt very roundly with the <hi>Conde Olivares</hi> and <hi>Gondomar,</hi> telling them it was a discourteous manner of proceeding to press his Majesty to further Conditions then were formerly agreed upon in point of Religion, and to make his Conditions the worse, for the great Obligation he had put upon
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:35668:161"/>
them by putting himself into their hands; whereat they took such great offence, that they estranged themselves from him for a long time after. And that the said Earl did thus proceed with the said <hi>Condes,</hi> and that it was not a new framed Answer to satisfie present Objections; but that which really, and indeed passed, will really appear by his Dispatches unto his late Majesty of Blessed Memory; and before his Majesty that now is came out of <hi>Spain,</hi> they were there shewed unto his Majesty, bearing date the Nineth of <hi>September,</hi> 1623. So that although it be true, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he the said Earl did not disswade his Majesty, for that there was no cause for it; yet without expecting his Majesties Answer, he first made a clear and true Profession of his own Religion: And when his Majesty had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to him his zeal and constancy, he humbly besought him, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might not for any respect be longer held in hopes of that point. And because point of Religion is that which all men of honor and honesty should cheifly desire to clear, especially having an imputation of that nature laid upon them, as the said Earl hath in the said Article, He <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> humbly beseecheth your Lordships, that he may not seem to digress from his Charge; intending your Lordships satisfaction in that particular, not by the aforesaid verbal discourse onely, which he professeth was in much zeal to Religion and dutiful care to the Prince in that kinde, but by some written Testimony of his former Opinion both of the Match and Religion. When he was first employed into <hi>Spain</hi> for the Treaty of this Marriage, 1617. his late Majesty having commanded him to give an accompt thereof unto his Majesty that now is, he at his departure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>Spain,</hi> presumed to give unto his Majesty that now is, his opinion in Writing, signed with his own hand to be kept as a testimony of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Actions, the Copy whereof is this as followeth.</p>

But in case his Majesty out of his wisdom and consideration, best known to himself, hold it fittest that your Majestie match with <hi>France,</hi> or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
                     <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other Catholick, either for that the present time affordeth no Protestant Princess, who is for years or Blood suitable for your Highness, or that can in any considerable measure by the portion, supply his Majesties present wants, I then conceive that the Match by which this State shall suffer least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency and cumbers, and whereby his Majesties necessities shall by the

                  <p>Thus much I thought sit humbly to present unto your Highness, for that I see my Imployment liable to the Censure of many worthy Persons, with whom though I concur in my Opinion, yet I seem much to differ from them many ways; For that it is more proper to me to be true to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> my Masters ends and services, then by declaring this to procure their satisfaction: Only to your Highness I thought fit to make this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and shall be a Suitor to you for your favor, as you shall see me really labor to put this in effect. And if his Majesty shall either upon motion of Parliament, or any other Proposition that can be made unto him, think it fit to proceed with a Protestant Match, as I shall wish as well unto it as any man living, so I hope in such sort to manage the present business that I have in hand, that it shall rather much further, then any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> way cross or hinder it.

And that the said Mr. <hi>Frewen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wake</hi> may be also examined, Whether in extremity of several sicknesses whereinto he hath of late years fallen, he hath not ever setled his Conscience withthem towards God, and made a Confession of his Faith, resolving as be-fitting a Protestant or good Christian.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. To the Eighth Article the Earl saith, That he did not at any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> time or in any place endeavor to perswade the Prince touching his religion to become a Roman Catholick, and to be obedient to the usurped autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Rome</hi>; Neither did the said Earl to that end and purpose, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, use unto his Majesty then Prince, the words in the Article mentioned. But the said Earl acknowledgeth, that upon occasion of a Letter that came to his Majesty then Prince, putting his Majesty in mind of the great
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:35668:162"/>
actions of his Royal Progenitors in the Holy War, that the great Kings of those times did not only imploy their Forces, but in their persons went into the Holy Land; The Earl believeth that by way of discourse only, and not otherwise, he may have said, That in regard of the difference in Religion, it was of more difficulty to undertake such great actions now, then in former Ages; and it might well be instanced in the present Treaty of the Marriage, wherein the Popes consent was to be obtained. And to this effect, and upon the like grounds, he is confident there were very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> many that have, nay few of neerness about his late Majesty that have not often heard his Majesty say, That he was the true Martyr, that suffered more for his Religion then all the Princes of Christendom besides; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancing in divers particulars, but especially in this, That he could not match his Children with Kings of his own rank, without the Popes leave.</p>
            <p>But the said Earl saith, He never alleaged any such thing to any other purpose, then to shew that only Conscience and love to Truth, (in which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> regard Protestants suffered much) not any temporal respects, made men constant and zealous to the profession of our Religion. By which discourse he ever attributed much to the honor and security of Protestant religion, but never used it as an argument to perswade to the contrary, as in the Accusation is insinuated.</p>
            <p>Besides, he conceiveth by way of Answer thereunto the said Question may be asked, which his Majesty was pleased to ask of the Earl in the Seventh Article, viz. <hi>What the said Earl saw in his Majesty, that he should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> think him so unworthy as to change his Religion for a Wife, or any earthly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect whatsoever?</hi> So why should it be thought, that being more fit to undertake great actions in the world (being a meer moral and temporal respect) should be an argument to perswade in conscience so religious and wise a Prince, and so well instructed as his Majesty is; as though the soul of a Christian Prince was to be wrought upon in point of Truth and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, by temporal and worldly respects of Conveniencies and Greatness? It were necessary for the proving that the said Earl perswaded his Majesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> touching Religion, to produce some arguments that he used out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to satisfie him in point of Conscience in some Tenents of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, or that he produced any Conference with Learned men for his satisfaction in point of Religion: Otherwise the Articles used in this against the said Earl, do (as he conceiveth) ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ry little strength to prove the Charge of perswading his Majesty, either in regard of it self, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Majesties piety.</p>

            <p n="9">IX. To the Ninth Article the said Earl saith, That there was a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in <hi>Spain</hi> of the way of accommodating the Prince Palatine his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and by way of discourse it was moved, That the Marriage of his eldest Son with a Daughter of the Emperor, and his Son to be bred in the Emperors Court, would be the fairest way for the pacifying of, and accommodating those businesses. And the Earl by way of discourse, and not otherwise, did say, That he thought his late Majesty could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse either to the said Match, or to the breeding of the Prince Palatine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> his Son with the Emperor; so as thereby the whole Patrimonial Estate of the Prince Palatine, and the Dignity Electoral might be fully restored, and that his Son might be bred in his own Religion, and have such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors, and such a Family, as his late Majesty and his Father, meaning the Prince Palatine, should appoint, and they to have free exercise of

And otherwise then so, and upon the terms afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and by that way of Conference and discourse only, he delivered not any Opinion to his Majesty at his Majesties being in <hi>Spain:</hi> For the said Earl is very confident that his Majesty was returned out of <hi>Spain,</hi> before any Proposition was made for the said Marriage, other then by way of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> discourse, as aforesaid; The same, as the said Earl believeth, being first moved and debated on by way of Proposition between Mr. Secretary <hi>Calvert</hi> and the Ambassador of the King of <hi>Spain, Octob.</hi> 2. 1628.

And it will also thereby appear, that his late Majesties opinion was of the Conveniencie thereof; which the said Earl hopeth will acquit him, if by way of discourse only he declared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> what his Majesties inclination was, which with honesty he could not have concealed. And the said Earl saith, he doth not remember what answer Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> made upon that discourse which he then delivered, nor what replies the said Earl made; but sure he is, whatsoever the said Earl said, or what answer or reply soever was made, as it was by way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and not otherwise, so it was according to that which he truly conceived to be the best and easiest way to accommodate the business, and to be his Majesties pleasure, (which the said Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be ignorant of, as he is confident that he was) and not out of any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection to our Religion, or for any sinister respect or regard to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> as by the said Article is intimated: For he did not conceive the breeding of the Prince Palatine's Son with the Emperor, having a Governor appointed by his late Majesty and his Father, and he and his Domesticks to have free use of their own Religion, to be a matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility, or such dangerous consequence in point of Religion, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Conversion, as by the Article is intimated; well knowing that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the Emperors Court all Princes there, though his Prisoners, and others his Counsellors and Servants about his person, and of great Command in his Armies, being avowed Protestants, have the free use of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And it is not to be supposed the Son of the Prince Palatine, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> should be matched, and no care taken to capitulate for the use of his Religion, being ever granted to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Prince that is bestowed.

But for direct Answer to the present Charge he saith, That he did not presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously, nor yet to his knowledge, break his Instructions, nor set any day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> at all for the <hi>Desponsories</hi>; but was therein meerly passive, in admitting the day nominated by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> according to the Capitulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made: Nor did he presumptuously, wilfully, or willingly disobey any Commandment or Direction of his Majesty that now is, then Prince, which he could understand not to be countermanded either by present or future Instructions otherwise explained.</p>
            <p>And for the better manifestation of the truth of his proceedings in and concerning the same, he saith, That on the day of the departure of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> his Majesty then Prince from the <hi>Escurial</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> his Highness delivered unto him in presence of the Commissioners his Proxies powers, with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declaration taken in writing by the Secretary to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> of the Prince his pleasure, and how the said Earl should use them, <hi>viz.</hi> That he should deliver them to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> upon the coming of

the Dispensation cleared from <hi>Rome,</hi> according to that which had been agreed, which was to be within ten dayes after the coming of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation. And he further saith, That it is true that the Prince after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by his Letters sent by one Mr <hi>Clark,</hi> commanded him the said Earl not to deliver the said Proxies till he should have received security that the <hi>Infanta</hi> after her being betrothed should not enter into any Religious Order, and that before he proceeded he should send to his Majesty, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Prince, such securities as should be offered, that he might judge whether it were sufficient or not.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the said Earl, as became a faithfull Servant, presented unto his Majesty that now is, then Prince, such Assurances as were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him for securing of that point, together with such Reasons as he conceived were fit to be offered to their considerations; which gave unto his late Majesty, and his Majesty that now is, then Prince, such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as they were pleased to dispatch a Post presently unto him, ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solutely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> discharging him of that Commandment, as by their several Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters dated <hi>October</hi> 8. 1623. will appear as followeth.</p>

For first, for his proceedings to consummate the Match, he had warrant and instruction under his late Majesties hand. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It was the main scope of his Ambassage. Thirdly, He was injoyned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by the King and Prince his Commission under the Great Seal. Fourthly, He had positive Order under his Majesties hand by Letters since. Fifthly, It was agreed by Capitulation, that it should be within so many dayes after the coming of the Dispensation. Sixthly, His late Majesty, and his Majesty that now is, then Prince, signified by their Letters unto him at the same time when they discharged him of his Commandment
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:35668:164"/>
touching the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s entring into Religion, that they intended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Marriage, as by his Majesties Letters <hi>October</hi> 8. 1623. will appear. Seventhly, The Proxies were to that end left in his hands, and after again renewed after his Majesties return into <hi>England.</hi> Eighthly, He had overthrown the Marriage without order: For although Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> and himself used all possible means for the gaining of time, and deferring the Desponsories; yet the King of <hi>Spain</hi> caused it to be protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in case he the said Earl should insist upon the deferring of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Desponsories, he would free himself from the Treaty by the said Earls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing of the Capitulations: And in truth, although the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should have condescended to have prolonged the Desponsories until one of the dayes of Christmas, as by the Letter was required; yet the Prince's Proxies had been before that time expired, and he durst not without a precise Warrant put such a scorn upon so noble a Lady, whom he then conceived was likely to have been the Prince his wife, as to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate a day of marriage when the Proxies were out of date, and he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was himself sworn to the Treaty. And lastly, he could not in honor and honesty, but endeavor to perform that publick Trust reposed in him when the Proxies were deposited in his hands, with publick and legal Declaration, with an instrument by a Secretary of State to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> leading and directing the use of them, and the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then <hi>instrumentum stipulatum,</hi> wherein as well the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was interessed by the acceptation of the substitution, as the Prince by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Proxies, he could not in honesty fail the publick Trust with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> clear and undoubted warrant; which as soon as he had, he obeyed. So as the Case standing thus, the said Earl is very confident that the supposed Countermands, Directions and Restrictions, when they should be perused and considered of, will appear to have been very slender and insufficient warrant against the aforesaid Orders and Reasons before specified: And is also as confident, That what is assured out of his the said Earls Dispatches, will also appear to be misunderstood; and that if he had proceeded to the execution of the Desponsories before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> direct and express commandment to the contrary by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Letters <hi>November</hi> 13. 1623. which he readily and punctually obeyed, he had not under favor broken his Instructions, or deserved any blame for lack of assurance of the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and Temporal Articles.</p>
            <p>And first of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> his said Majesty did not send to the said Earl express Directions not to dispatch the Desponsories until a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion were had of the other Treaty of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> together with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that of the Marriage, as by the said Article is alledged; onely his late Majesty, by the aforesaid Letters of <hi>October</hi> 8. required the said Earl so to endeavor, that his Majesty might have the joy of both at Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas. Whereas his Instructions of <hi>May</hi> 14. 1621. were express, that he should not make the business of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> a condition of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. And his late Majesties Letters of December 30. 1623. were fully to the same effect. Yet did the said Earl, according to what was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the said Letters of <hi>October</hi> 8. so carefully provide therein, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that before the Proxies were to be executed, he had an absolute answer in the business of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi>

               </note> the same should be really restored accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his late Majesties desire; and the <hi>Conde Olivarez,</hi> both in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties name, and in his own, desired the said Earl and Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> that they would assure his Majesty of the real performance of the same,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:35668:164"/>
and intreated, if need were, they should engage their honor and life for it, as by their joynt Dispatches of <hi>November</hi> 23. 1623. will appear; and so much the said Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> and the said Earl agreed should be delivered to them in writing, before they would have delivered their Proxies, and so the said Earl declared it; the which Answer in writing should have been the same which since was given them of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 8. 1623. And both Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> and the said Earl were confident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as they by their said Letters of <hi>November</hi> 23. wrote to his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty as followeth; <hi>Viz.</hi>

So as it appeareth the said Earl was so far from breaking his Instructions, or from having any intention to have proceeded to the execution of the Desponsories before his Majesty and the Prince were satisfied of this point of the <hi>Infanta</hi> entring into Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or before convenient assurance as well for the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as performance of the Temporal Articles, that he deserveth, as he conceiveth under favor, no blame, so much as in intention; but if he had erred in intention onely (as he did not) the same being never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Act, the Fault (as he conceiveth) was removed by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> before the intention was put into execution: For so it is in Cases to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. And as to the matter of aggravation against him, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed so short a time for the Desponsories, as that without extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diligence the Prince had been bound, he thereto saith, as he said before, that he set no day at all thereunto, nor could defer it after the Dispensation
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:35668:165"/>
came from <hi>Rome,</hi> without a direct breach of the <hi>Match</hi> so long labored in, and so much desired; yet he and Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> having used all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble industry to discover how the motion of deferring the Match would be taken; and finding an absolute resolution in the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed punctually, and to require the Proxies according to the Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, within ten dayes after the coming of the Dispensation; and that time also getting advertisement from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Dispensation was granted, and would presently be there; he, the said Earl, to the end in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> so great a Cause he might have a clear and undoubted understanding of his late Majesties pleasure, sent a Dispatch of <hi>November</hi> 1. with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence unto his Majesty, letting his Majesty know that it could not be possible for him to protract the Marriage above four dayes, unless he should hazard the breaking, for which he had no warrant.</p>
            <p>But that this was no new Resolution, nor the King so straitned in time, as by the said Article is pretended, will appear by the said Earls Dispatch of <hi>September</hi> 28. 1623. In which upon scruple that was then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> made of the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s entring into Religion, he wrote to the same effect; <hi>Viz. That if the Dispensation should come, he knew no means how to detain the Proxies above twenty or twenty four dayes.</hi> So that although difficulty happened until the middest of <hi>November</hi> 1623. yet it was foreseen that it must of necessity happen whensoever the Dispensation should come; and then was warning of two moneths given thereof; <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 24. until <hi>November</hi> 29. which was the time appointed for the Desponsories.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>So as he most humbly submits himself unto your Lordships which of the two wayes was the safer or dutifuller for him to take; whether upon inferences and conjectures to have overthrown so great a business; or on the otherside, first to have presented unto his Majesty the truth and sincerity as he did, the true estate of his Affairs, with his humble opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion therein, with an intimation, that if his Majesty should resolve to break the Match, that for the said Earl his honest discharge of the publick Trust reposed in him when the Proxies were deposited in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hands, and for his sufficient warrant in so great a cause, his Majesty would be graciously pleased to give him clear and express order (which he had not) and in the interim, whilest his Majesty might take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration the great inconveniences that might ensue, the said inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences might be suspended, and the business kept upon fair terms, that his Majesty might have his way and choice clear and unsoiled before him.</p>
            <p>And as to the evil Consequences which are pretended would have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> followed if the said Earl had proceeded to the consummation of the Match, before he had express order and warrant to the contrary; he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth his Majesty should speedily have seen the Marriage which he so long sought to have effected; that the Prince should have had a worthy Lady whom he loved; that the Portion was much greater then ever was given in money in <hi>Christendom</hi>; that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for restitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; for which the said Earl conceived a daughter of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Two Millions had been no ill pawn, besides <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> many other additions of advantage to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>:<note place="margin">The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the Spanish Match to <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> Whereas on the contrary side, he foresaw that the Prince would be kept a year longer unmarried, a thing that so highly concerneth these Kingdoms; he doubteth that the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> from the Emperor and Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> by force would prove a great
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:35668:165"/>
difficulty, and that Christendom was like to fall into a general Combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So that desiring that his Majesty should have obtained his ends, and have had the honor and happiness, not onely to have given peace, plenty, and increase unto his own Subjects and Crowns, but to have compounded the greatest differences that had been these many years in Christendom: And by his Piety and Wisdom, to have prevented the shedding of so much Christian Blood, as he feared would ensue, if these businesses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> were disordered. These Reasons, he confesseth, and the zeal unto his Majesties service made him so earnestly desire the effecting of this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and cannot but think himself an unfortunate man (his Majesties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs being so near setling to his Majesties content, as he conceived they were, and hoping to have been unto his Majesty not onely a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but a successful Servant) to see the whole estate of his affairs turned up-side down without any the least fault of his; and yet he the onely Minister on the English and Spanish side that remained under <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> disgrace.</p>
            <p n="11">XI.

For a plain and direct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereunto, he saith, That the said Petition is such as will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant any such inference, as by the said Article is inforced. And that he hopeth to justifie the Contents of the said Petition in such sort as shall not displease his Majesty, nor deserve that expression which is used in the Charge; but contrarily what he hath said, or shall say therein in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his defence, shall in all things tend to the Honor and Service of his Majesty, by reducing into his Memory divers Circumstances, and laying before him the passages of divers particulars, which by undue practices have been either concealed from his Majesty or mis-related to him.</p>

                        <p>The House of Commons by a fatal and universal Concurrence of Complaints, from all the Sea-bordering parts of this Kingdom, did finde a great and grievous interruption and stop of Trade and Traffick: The base Pirates of <hi>Sally</hi> ignominiously infesting our Coasts, taking our Ships and Goods, and leading away the Subjects of this Kingdom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> into Barbarous captivity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while to our shame and hindrance of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, our enemies did (as it were) besiege our Ports, and block up our best Rivers mouths. Our friends on slight pretences, made Imbargoes of our Merchants Goods, and every Nation (upon the least occasion) was ready to contemn and slights us: So great was the apparent diminution of the antient Honor of this Crown, and once strong Reputation of our Nation. Wherewith the Commons were more troubled, calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance how formerly in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> where by Sea and Land, the Valors of this Kingdom had been better valued, and even in latter times, within remembrance, when we had no Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> none in <hi>Denmark,</hi> none in <hi>Germany,</hi> no Friend in <hi>Italy; Scotland</hi> (to say no more) ununited, <hi>Ireland</hi> not setled in peace, and much less security at home; when <hi>Spain</hi> was as ambitious as it is

The Commons therefore wondring at the Evils which they suffered, debating of the Causes of them, found they were many drawn like one Line to one Circumference of decay of Trade, and strength of Honor and Reputation in this Kingdom; which as in one Centre, met in one great Man, the cause of all, whom I am here to name, <hi>The Duke of Buckingham.</hi>

                        <p>THis lofty Title of this Mighty Man, methinks doth raise my spirits to speak with a <hi>Paulò Majora Canamus</hi>; and let it not displease your Lordships, if for Foundation, I compare the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> beautiful structure and fair composition of this Monarchy wherein we live, to the great work of God, the World it self: In which, the solid Body of incorporated Earth and Sea, as I conceive, in regard of our Husbandry, Manufactures, and Commerce by Land and Sea, may well resemble us the Commons. And as it is incompassed with Air, and Fire, and Sphears Celestial, of Planets and a Firmament of fixed Stars; all which receive their heat, light, and life, from one great, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sun, even like the King our Soveraign. So that Firmament of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fixed Stars I take to be your Lordships; those Planets the great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Kingdom; that pure Element of Fire, the most Religious, Zealous, and Pious Clergy; and the Reverend Judges, Magistrates, and Ministers of Law and Justice, the Air wherein we breathe: All which encompass round with cherishing comfort, this Body of the Commons, who truly labor for them all; and though they be the Foot stool, and the lowest, yet may well be said to be the setled Centre of the State.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now (my good Lords) if that glorious Sun, by his powerful Beams of Grace and Favor, shall draw from the Bowels of this Earth, an exhalation that shall take Fire, and burn and shine out like a Star, it needs not be marvelled at, if the poor Commons gaze and wonder at the Comet; and when they feel the effects, impute all to the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible matter of it: But if such an imperfect mixture appear, like that in the last age in the Chair of <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> among the sixed Stars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, where <hi>Aristotle</hi> and the old Philosophers conceived there was no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> place for such corruption, then as the Learned Mathematicians were troubled to observe the irregular motions, the prodigious magnitude, and the ominous prognosticks of that Meteor; so the Commons when they see such a blazing Star in course so exorbitant in the Affairs of this Commonwealth, cannot but look upon it, and for want of Perspectives, commend the nearer examination to your Lordships, who may behold it at a nearer distance. Such a prodigious Comet the Commons take this Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to be; against whom, and his irregular ways,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there are by learned Gentlemen legal Articles of Charge to be delivered to your Lordships, which I am generally first commanded to lay open.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Offices of this Kingdom, that are the Eyes, the Ears, and the Hands of this Commonwealth, these have been ingrossed, bought and sold, and many of the greatest of them holden even in the Dukes own hands; which severally gave in former ages, sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to greatest Favorites, and were work enough for wisest Counsellors; by means whereof, what strange abuses, what infinite neglects have followed? The Seas have been unguarded, Trade disturbed, Merchants oppressed, their Ships, and even one of the Royal Navy, by cunning practice, delivered over into Foreign hands; and contrary to our good
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:35668:167"/>
Kings intention, employed to the prejudice (almost to the ruine) of Friends of our own Religion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Next Honors (those most pretious Jewels of the Crown) a Treasure inestimable, wherewith your Noble Ancestors (my Lords) were well rewarded for eminent and publick Service in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth at home; for brave exploits abroad, when covered all with dust and blood, they sweat in service for the honor of this Crown. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> What back-ways, what by-ways, have been by this Duke found out, is too well known to your Lordships? whereas antiently it was the honor of <hi>England</hi> (as among the <hi>Romans</hi>) the way to the Temple of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> was through the Temple of <hi>Vertue.</hi> But I am commanded to press this no further, then to let your Lordships know, one instance may (perhaps) be given of some one Lord compelled to purchase Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As divers of the Dukes poor Kinred have been raised to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> great honors, which have been and are likely to be more chargeable and burthensome to the Crown; so the Lands and Revenews, and the Treasuries of his Majesty, have been intercepted and exhausted, by this Duke and his Friends, and strangely mis-employed with strange confusion of the Accounts, and overthrow of the well established an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Orders of his Majesties Exchequer.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The last of the Charges which are prepared, will be an injury offered to the person of the late King of Blessed memory, who is with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> God, of which (as your Lordships may have heard heretofore) you shall anon have further information. Now upon this occasion, I am commanded by the Commons to take care of the honor of the King our Soveraign that lives, (long may he live to our comfort, and the good of the Christian World) and also of his Blessed Father who is dead; on whom, to the grief of the Commons, and their great distaste, the Lord Duke did (they conceive) unworthily cast some ill odor of his own foul ways; whereas Servants were antiently wont to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> bear, as in truth they ought, their Masters faults, and not cast their own on them undeservedly. It is well known the King (who is with God) had the same power, and the same wisdom, before he knew this Duke, yea, and the same affections too; through which (as a good and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Master) he advanced and raised some Stars of your Lordships Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament; in whose hands this exorbitancy of will, this transcendency of power, such placing and displacing of Officers, such irregular run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into all by-courses of the Planets, such sole and single managing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the great Affairs of State, was never heard of.</p>

               <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who was adjudged in Parliament for Treason, and among other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences it was laid to his charge, that he took to his own use goods Pirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally taken, and expresly against the Order determined by the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and the whole Council, whereunto his hand had been for the restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
            <p>Next were read the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Articles; <hi>viz.</hi>

               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:35668:171"/>VI. Whereas the honor, wealth, and strength of this Realm of <hi>England</hi> is much increased by the Traffick, chiefly of such Merchants as imploy and build great warlike Ships, a consideration that should move all Counsellors of State, especially the Lord Admiral to cherish and maintain such Merchants.</p>
            <p>The said Duke abusing the Lords of the Parliament in the One and twentieth year of the late King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory, with pretence of serving the State, did oppress the East-<hi>India</hi> Merchants and extorted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> from them Ten thousand pounds, in the subtil and unlawfull manner following.</p>
            <p>About <hi>February</hi> in the year aforesaid, he the said Duke hearing some good success that those Merchants had at <hi>Ormus,</hi> in the parts beyond the Seas, by his Agents cunningly in or about the moneth aforesaid in the year of the said late King, endeavored to draw from them some great sum of money, which their poverty, and no gain by that success at <hi>Ormus</hi> made those Merchants absolutely to deny; whereupon he the said Duke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that the said Merchants were then setting forth in the course of their Trade, four Ships, and two Pinaces laden with goods and merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of very great value, like to lose their voyage if they they should not speedily depart. The said Duke on the first of <hi>March</hi> then following, in the said year of the said late King, did move the Lords then assembled in the said Parliament, whether he should make stay of any Ships which were then in the Ports, (as being high Admiral he might) and namely, those ships prepared for the East-<hi>India</hi> voyage, which were of great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and well furnished; which motion being approved by their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, the Duke did stay those ships accordingly; but the fifth of <hi>March</hi> following, when the then Deputy of that Company, with other of those Merchants, did make suit to the said Duke for the release of those Ships and Pinaces; he the said Duke, said he had not been the occasion of their staying, but that having heard the motion with much earnestness in the Lords House of Parliament, he could do no less then give the order they had done; and therefore he willed them to set down the reasons of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> suit, which he would acquaint the House withall, yet in the mean time he gave them leave to let their said ships and Pinaces fall down as low as <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> And the tenth of <hi>March</hi> following an unusual joynt action was by his procurement entred in the chief Court of Admiralty, in the name of the said late King and of the Lord Admiral, against them for Fifteen thousand pound taken Piratically by some Captains of the said Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ships, and pretended to be in the hands of the East-<hi>India</hi> Company; and thereupon the Kings Advocate in the name of Advocate for the then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> King and the said Lord Admiral, moved and obtained one Attachment, which by the Serjeant of the said Court of Admiralty was served on the said Merchants in their Court the sixteenth day of <hi>March</hi> following; whereupon the said Merchants, though there was no cause for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestation by the Lord Admiral, yet the next day they were urged in the said Court of Admiralty to bring in the Fifteen thousand pounds, or go to prison: wherefore immediately the Company of the said Merchants did again send the Deputy aforesaid and some others to make new suit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the said Duke for the release of the said Ships and Pinaces; who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly endeavoring to extort money from the said Merchants, protested that the Ships should not go except they compounded with him; and when they urged many more reasons for the release of the said Ships and Pinaces, the Answer of the said Duke was, That the then Parliament must
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:35668:171"/>
first be moved. The said Merchants therefore being in this perplexity, and in their consultation, the three and twentieth of that moneth, even ready to give over that Trade, yet considering that they should lose more then was demanded by unlading their ships, besides their voyage, they resolved to give the said Duke Ten thousand pounds for his unjust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. And he the said Duke by the undue means aforesaid, and under colour of his Office, and upon false pretence of Rights, unjustly did exact <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and extort from the said Merchants the said Ten thousand pounds, and received the same about the 28. of <hi>April</hi> following the discharge of those Ships, which were not released by him till they the said Merchants had yielded to give him the said Duke the said Ten thousand pounds for the said Release, and for the false pretence of Rights made by the said Duke as aforesaid.</p>

               </note> and of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his Kingdoms aforesaid, are the principal strength and defence of the said Kingdoms, and ought therefore to be always preserved and safely kept under the command, and for the service of our Soveraign Lord the King, no less then any the Fortresses and Castles of the said Kingdoms; And whereas no Subject of this Realm ought to be dispossessed of any his Goods or Chattels without order of Justice, or his own consent first duly had and obtained: The said Duke being Great Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor-General and Keeper of the said Ships and Seas, and thereof ought to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> have and take a special and continual care and diligence how to preserve the same; The said Duke in or about the end of <hi>Iuly</hi> last, in the first year of our Soveraign Lord the King, did under the colour of the said Office of Great Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> and by indirect and subtile means and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, procure one of the principal Ships of his Majesties Navy-Royal called the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> then under the Command of Captain <hi>Iohn Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington,</hi> and six other Merchants Ships of great burden and value, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to several Persons inhabiting in <hi>London,</hi> the Natural Subjects of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Majesty, to be conveyed over with all their Ordnance, Munition, Tackle and Apparel, into the parts of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> to the end that being there, they might the more easily be put into the hands of the French King, his Ministers and Subjects, and taken into their possession, command and power; And accordingly the said Duke by his Ministers and Agents, with menaces and other ill means and practices, did there without order of Justice, and without the consent of the said Masters and Owners, unduly compel and inforce the said Masters and Owners of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> said six Merchants Ships, to deliver their said Ships into the said possession, command and power of the said French King, his Ministers and Subjects; and by reason of his compulsion, and under the pretext of his power as aforesaid, and by his indirect practices as aforesaid, the said Ships aforesaid, as well the said Ship Royal of his Majesty, as the others belonging to the said Merchants, were there delivered into the hands and command of the said French King, his Ministers and Subjects, without either sufficient se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity or assurance for redelivery, or other necessary caution in that behalf taken or provided either by the said Duke himself, or otherwise by his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> direction; contrary to the duty of the said Offices of Great Admiral, Governor-General, and Keeper of the said Ships and Seas, and to the faith and trust in that behalf reposed, and contrary to the duty which he oweth to our Soveraign Lord the King in his place of Privy-Counsellor, to the apparent weakening of the Naval strength of this Kingdom, to the

                        <p>The Articles allotted to my Charge are three, the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth; which I shall open with as much brevity and perspicuity as I may: The substance of several Cases concerning the same; The Evidence to make them good, together with such Observations as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally arise out of the matter; whereby your Lordships may the better discern wherein the Dukes faults do consist, and what punishment may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be answerable to such offences.</p>
                        <p>The Sixth Article is a distinct Charge different from the other two; wherefore I will handle it, with the Incidents thereof, by it self. The Seventh and Eighth Articles being of one nature and subject, are indeed several parts of one Charge, rather then several Charges, and have such a connexion in themselves, that with your Lordships leaves I will handle them both together without dividing them, which I hold will be the shortest and fittest way to do right to the Cause, and to your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Lordships.</p>
                        <p>The Sixth Article giveth me occasion (my Lords) thus to enlarge my self. In a Treaty the 18. of <hi>August</hi> 1604. between our late Soveraign King <hi>Iames</hi> of glorious memory, and <hi>Philip</hi> the Third King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                           <pb n="319" facs="tcp:35668:172"/>
It was agreed, That there should be perfect Amity and Peace to endure for ever by Land, Sea, and Fresh-waters, between these Kings, their Heirs and Successors, their Dominions, Liege-men and Subjects then being, or which should be; And that either party should then after ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from all depradations, offences and spoils, by Sea, Land, and Fresh-waters, in what Dominions or Government soever of the other, and should cause restitution to be made of all depradations which then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> after should be comitted, and the damages growing by means thereof; And that the said Kings shall take care that their Subjects should from thenceforth abstain from all force and wrong-doing, and that they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise should revoke all Commissions and Letters-Patents of Reprisal or Mart, or otherwise, containing Licence to take Prizes; All which are declared by the said Treaty it self to be void, and that whosoever should do any thing contrary should be punished not only criminally according to the merit of his offence, but should also be compelled to make resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and satisfaction for the losses to the parties damnified requiring the same. Lastly it was concluded, That between them and every of their Subjects might be free Commerce in all the Dominions by Sea, Land, and Fresh-waters, in which before the Wars there hath been Commerce, and according to the use and observance of the antient Leagues and Treaties before the Wars, the Customs as they were at that present rated according to the Ordinance of the Places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paid.</p>

This Treaty being setled and continuing, his late Majesty King <hi>Iames</hi> by his Highness Letters-Patents bearing date the 14. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, An.</hi> 13. of his Reign, did grant unto the Governors of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>London</hi> trading into the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and to their Successors, in case they be justly provoked or driven thereunto, in defence of their persons, goods or ships, by any disturbance or hinderance in their quiet Course of Trade, or for recompence or recovery of the persons, ships or goods of any of his Majesties Subjects that had been formerly in, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or neer the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> or for any other just cause of their defence, or recompence of losses sustained; That then the Captains or principal Commanders of the said Company, or any other under their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should or might attempt, surprise, or take the persons, ships and goods of any Prince or State, by whose Subjects they should sustain any wrong or loss in manner as aforesaid, as by the said Letters-Patents appeareth: Some years after the granting of these Letters-Patents, under pretext that the said Treaty was broken, there was some interruption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and violence offered by the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Subjects in the Ports of <hi>East-India</hi> to the Merchants of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company trading into those parts, whereby they were much damnified; and thereupon suspecting that it might be in vain to complain for redress in an ordinary course of Justice in the <hi>East-India,</hi> or in default thereof to return into <hi>Spain</hi> to make complaint to that purpose, where nothing was likely to be done till they had sent from thence again into the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and received an answer; And after all this, upon denial of Justice in <hi>Spain,</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to come into this Kingdom for Letters of Request, without which in ordinary course they should not use Reprisal, and many years would be spent before they could come to have an end of these suits; It is true that thereupon, partly in their defence, and partly for amends, and partly for revenge, they did by pretext of the said Letters-Patents take some goods of the <hi>Portugals</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> Subjects to the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:35668:173"/>
King of <hi>Spain</hi>; and afterwards being commanded by the King of <hi>Persia</hi> to transport certain Forces of his in <hi>Ormus</hi> an Island situate in the Country of <hi>Persia,</hi> some goods of <hi>Portugals</hi> subjects to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> were there taken by Captain <hi>Blith</hi> and Captain <hi>Wedel,</hi> and others of their Company, being servants and in pay under the <hi>East-India</hi>  Company.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Iuly</hi> 1623. Two ships called the <hi>Lyon</hi> and the <hi>Ionas,</hi> being part of a Fleet belonging to the said Company, returned from <hi>Ormus</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> aforesaid out of an East-Indian Voyage, and arrived in the <hi>Downs</hi> richly laden with goods and merchandise lawfully belonging to the said Company, and estimated to the value of One hundred thousand pounds. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> in or about <hi>October</hi> 1623. being advertised thereof, well knowing the Company to be rich, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending in himself a probable ground how he might exact and extort some great sum of money from the said Company out of the profit of these ships and their lading, by colour of his Office of Lord Admiral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of <hi>England,</hi> and out of his power and greatness, his Office being used for a groundwork of his design therein, did thereupon pretend that the lading of the said ships was for the most part with goods Pyrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally taken at Sea in the parts about <hi>Ormus</hi> aforesaid, and that a Tenth part or some other great share thereof did belong to him in the right of his said Office of Lord Great Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> and by vertue of his Letters-Patents and Grant from his late Majesty in that behalf; alleadging withall, howsoever the said Company might peradventure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> answer the matter, yet there would and might be strong opposition against them. These words were used to possess them with fear, and to make them stand in awe of his power, when he should come afterwards particularly to press them to yield to his unjust demands. Having once resolved of his ends, which was to get money, he thus proceeded to effect the same. In the moneths of <hi>November, December, January</hi> and <hi>February</hi> then next following, he had divers times Treaties by himself and his Agents with the the then Governor and others of the said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Company, for the effecting of his said designs; wherein he still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully pretended that a Tenth part, or some other great share out of the Lading of the said ships belonged unto him; albeit the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany upon right information of their Cause to their Council, both Civilians and Common-Lawyers, were advised that there did no Tenths or other such shares belong to the said Duke, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                        <p>And whereas the said Duke by this time finding that he could not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> prevail to get his Ends by any fair course, continued yet resolute to make his gain upon the Company by right or wrong, as he might; and to that purpose made use of the following opportunities and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, in such cunning and abusive manner as I shall further open to your Lordships.

                           </gap>t the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had then four Ships, called the <hi>Great James,</hi> the <hi>Ionas,</hi> the <hi>Star,</hi> and the <hi>Eagle,</hi> and two Pinaces called the <hi>Spy</hi> and the <hi>Scout,</hi> the said Ships and Pinaces, with their Victuals, Store and Ordnances, were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of the value of Fifty four thousand pounds and more, laden with Lead, Cloth, and other Merchandise in them to the value of Twenty thousand pounds and more, and having in them also about Thirty thousand pounds in Royals of Spanish money; in all, One hundred thousand pounds and more.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="321" facs="tcp:35668:173"/>
These Ships and Pinnaces were well near ready to set sail for a Voyage into the <hi>East-Indies</hi> by the first day of <hi>March,</hi> in the One and twentieth year of his said late Majesties reign; and he well-knowing how great a hinderance it would be to the said Company, if the said Ships and Pinnaces should be stayed for any long time, the rather in regard if they did not set sail about that time of the year, or within Twenty days after, they had utterly lost their voyage for that year; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the reason thereof dependeth upon a Secret of Winds, called the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounds,</hi> which are constantly six moneths Easterly, and six moneths Westerly every year at their set times in those parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> about the Cape of <hi>Bona Speranza</hi>; (for of those Winds, all Ships going from hence into the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> are to make their use in the usual and due time, which yet cannot be done, if men take not their opportunity by coming to the Cape in their proper and due season, and in so long and dangerous a voyage wherein the Equinoctial Line is twice to be passed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it is no good discretion to stay the utmost time in going from hence, in confidence of fair Winds, but rather to take time enough before-hand, for fear of the contrary: Nor can the Lord Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> who is <hi>Custos marium domini Regis,</hi> and hath jurisdiction of all Foreign parts <hi>super altum mare</hi> be admitted to pretend himself ignorant of this Secret, or of any other particulars belonging to the Seas and Voyages.) The Duke therefore apprehending and well weighing how great a hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or rather what an absolute loss it would be to the company if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> these their Ships and Pinnaces of so great value, and bound forth in so instant, and difficult a voyage, should be stayed for any long time now they were ready to set sail, and the season of going upon point to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: The said Duke upon the said First day of <hi>March,</hi> 1623. to effect his designs upon the said Company, and to get that by circumvention and surprisal, which in a legal and due course of Justice he had not hopes to obtain: Not thinking it sufficient, that the sense of his displeasure lying over the Company as an ominous cloud threatning a storm, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they did not appease him by some great sacrifice; and to cast them yet further into a farther streight, not sparing to abuse your Lordships in Parliament, by making you unwilling Instruments to give colour and advantage to his secret and unlawful practises. Upon the said First day of <hi>March,</hi> he put your Lordships sitting in Parliament in minde, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great business likely to ensue upon dissolution of the then Treaties with <hi>Spain,</hi> and that a speedy resolution thereof was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required, for that the Enemy would pretermit no time; and if we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> should lose the benefit of that Spring, he said it would be irrevok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and thereupon he took occasion to move that House, Whether he should make stay of any shipping that were then in the Ports (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing High Admiral he might) and namely, the said Ships prepared for the <hi>East-Indian</hi> Voyage, which were of great burthen, well furnished, and fit to guard our own Coasts: Which motion was generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the whole House, knowing nothing of the Dukes secret designs and private intentions. And the same day a Motion was made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> amongst the Commons in Parliament to the same effect by Sir <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> Knight, the Vice-Admiral to the Duke of the County of <hi>Devon</hi>; which, in respect of the time when, and person by whom it was propounded, is very suspitious, that it issued all from one Spirit, and that he was set on by the Duke, or some of his Agents; the truth whereof, your Lordships may be pleased to search out and examine as
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:35668:174"/>
you shall see cause. By colour of this Order of the Lords House of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Duke caused <hi>Iohn Pexal,</hi> Marshal of the Admiralty, to make stay to be made of the said Ships and Pinnaces; howbeit, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the occasion pretended for the defence of the Realm, there were not any other Ships staid at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Company perceiving by the course of things, from whence their Evils moved, upon the Fifth of <hi>March,</hi> 1623. became earnest Suitors to the said Duke for a Releasement of their said Ships and Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whereunto the said Duke replied, That he had not been the cause of their stay; but having heard the Motion in the Lords House, he could do no less then order as they had done: Yet to incline his ends, and put them in some hope of favor by his means, he told them withal, That he had something in his Pocket that might do them good, and willed them to set down what Reasons they would for their Suit, and he would acquaint the House therewith: Nevertheless about this time he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed of himself at <hi>Theobalds</hi> to give leave for the Ships and Pinnaces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to fall down as far as <hi>Tilbury,</hi> there to attend such further Directions as should be given unto them, with leave so to signifie by word of mouth to the Serjeant of the Admiralty, for that the Duke had then no Secretary with him. Thus some while by threatning of strong oppositions and terrors, and other while by intimating hopes of favor, and good assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Duke sought to accomplish his purpose, yet prevailed not; and so the Tenth of <hi>March,</hi> 1623. the Kings Advocate, Mr. Dr. <hi>Reeves.</hi> as Advocate for the King, and Lord Admiral, made Allegation in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Admiralty on the Dukes behalf; and by his procurements, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by Examinations there taken, that 150000 l. and more Pyrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically taken by the said Captain <hi>Blith,</hi> and <hi>Wedel,</hi> and their Complices upon the Sea near <hi>Ormus,</hi> and in other parts within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty, was come into the Possessions of the Treasurers of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, and remained in their hands, and prayed it might be attached; and the said Treasurers be monished to appear the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday then next following, and there to bring in the 150000 l. to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in Deposit with the Register of that Court.</p>
                        <p>The same Tenth of <hi>March</hi> a Warrant issued forth accordingly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Marshal of the said Court; and upon the said next Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday the Seventeenth of <hi>March,</hi> the same Warrant was returned by the said Marshal, That the day before he had attached the said Moneys in the hands of Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> then present in the Court, and had admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished him, and Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> the Deputy-Governor of that Company, and divers others then present, to bring in the same into Court. Upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the same Wednesday also it was prayed by the Kings Advocate, That Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> and all that had an interest in this money, might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced as in Contumacy, and therefore be arrested and detained until 150000 l. were brought into the Register. Hereupon Sentence of Contumacy was pronounced, but the payment thereof was respited until Friday following. Upon which Seventeenth of <hi>March</hi> this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence being pronounced, Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> Mr. <hi>Abdy,</hi> and others, Officers of the said Company then present, informed how the Governor was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> lately dead, and buried but the day before, and that upon Wednesday then next following, they had appointed a Court for Election of a new Governor, and until then they could resolve of nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired further respite. The Advocate nothing relenting at this reasonable excuse, and desire of the Company, did again earnestly press
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:35668:174"/>
their Imprisonment; but the Judge took time to consider of it. The Company finding by these extraordinary and extream courses, the drift of the Duke, whose greatness and power seemed unresistable, and his minde implacable without satisfaction to his own content, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al observing what a streight they were cast into by reason of the stay of their Ships; which, if it were much longer, they must needs lose their Voyage utterly for this year, and the very unloading of them would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> endamage them to the value of the sum extorted: And being told that the Eye of the State was upon this business, and that it would light heavy upon them; and hearing the Duke protest their Ships should not go, unless they compounded with him, and finding that he made difficulty of releasing their Ships, by saying, The Parliament must be moved before they could be discharged, albeit the wind were now fair for them. And making overture of some resonable grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, by offering to grant Letters of Mart to the said Company for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the future against the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> while yet the Peace and Treaty between his late Majesty, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> were not broken or dissolved.</p>
                        <p>The said Company being intangled by the Dukes subtilty, and overcome at last by the terror of his power and greatness, was drawn to make offer of Six thousand pounds to the said Duke, which was rejected as a base offer: And now the time pressing them on very hard, some consultations were had amongst them, Whether it were better <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for them to make use of a clause in their Patent, allowing them three years to draw home their Estates; and so to let their Company die, and be dissolved, or else to yeild to the Dukes desire: Yet in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were drawn in to offer him Ten thousand pounds for their peace, if it could serve, which offer was made unto him accordingly, but at first he would not accept it; howbeit, about the Three and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> 1623. they agreed to give him the said Ten thousand pounds, which he accepted; and forthwith moving the Lords of Parliament, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or acquainting them therewith, he retracted their Ships, and gave them leave to depart on their Voyage, which they accordingly did, setting sail the Seven and twentieth day of the same moneth from the <hi>Downs.</hi> And afterwards upon the Fifth of <hi>April,</hi> 1624. the <hi>Duke</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified unto the Lords House of Parliament, That his Majesty at the humble Petition of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, had commanded him to discharge the <hi>East-Indian</hi> Ships, which he had once stayed according to the order of this House, made the First day of <hi>March</hi> then last past, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and moved, That the said Order might be countermanded; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was ordered; that the Clerk of that House should cross the said Order of the First of <hi>March,</hi> out of his Book, which was done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and afterwards the said Ten thousand pounds was paid unto the said Duke; which he received and accepted accordingly. And upon the Eight and twentieth of <hi>April</hi> aforesaid, suffered a colourable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the Admiralty to be given against him for their discharge, in such sort, as by the same Sentence appeareth. And for a colour he seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and delivered unto the said Company, a Deed of Acquittance or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease of the said Ten thousand pounds, and of all his pretended rights against them, as by the Deed thereof also appeareth. And whereas it may be imagined by some misconceit, that out of this an Aspersion may be laid upon his late Majesty, in regard the Duke was pleased to say in the Conference between both Houses, 18 <hi>March</hi> last, That the said King
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:35668:175"/>
had Ten thousand pounds of the said Company by occasion of this business. The House of Commons have been very careful in their proceedings in this, as in all other things they have, and ever shall be, to do nothing which may reflect upon the Honor of their Kings: And in this particular, by that which hath been here at first declared of the manner and occasion of the said Goods and Moneys taken from the said <hi>Portugals,</hi> and receiving the same as aforesaid, while the said Peace was continuing, and the said Treaties indissolved; it appeareth, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it had not been safe for the said Company to stand out a Suit concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that business, wherein they might have need of his Majesties Mercy and Pardon, but it was both safe and good for them to give Ten thousand pounds; and it well stood with his late Majesties Honor, for that sum to grant them a Pardon, which he did to their great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and satisfaction; and yet we finde that this Ten thousand pounds also was paid into the hands of Mr. <hi>Oliver,</hi> the Dukes servant, but finde not any Record, by which it doth appear unto us, that ever it came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> unto his late Majesties use. And it is observable in this case, That the oppression fell upon the same Company shortly after the great affliction which hapned unto some of them at <hi>Amboyna</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> by means of the Dutch, which might have moved a Noble minde rather to pitty, then punish the Company after such a Distress so lately suffered.</p>
                        <p>Having now finished the Narrative part belonging to this Charge, I shall observe unto your Lordships upon the whole matter, the nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the Dukes offences by this Article complained of, and what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it may deserve. His fault consisteth in the unjust extorting and receiving the Ten thousand pounds from the <hi>East-India</hi> Company against their wills by colour of his Office. Yet as offenders in this kinde, have commonly some colour to disguise and mask their Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so had he: His colour was the Release of his pretended right to the Tenth part, or some other share of the Goods, supposed to be Piratically taken at Sea by the Captain, and their Servants of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Company: And though his Lordship may perhaps call his act therein, a lawful Composition, I must crave pardon of your Lordships to say thus, That if his supposed right had been good, this might peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have been a fair Composition: The same pretence being unsound, and falling away, it was a meer naked Bribe, and unjust extortion; For if way should be given to take money by colour of Releases of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended rights, men great in power, and in evil, would never want means to extort upon the meaner sort at their pleasures with impunity. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> therefore that I should prove unto your Lordships onely two things: First, That a pretence of right by the Duke, if he had none, will not excuse him in this case, and in the next place, to shew by reason and good warrant, That he had in Law no right at all to Release.</p>
                        <p>For the former, I will relie upon the substance of two noteable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents of Judgments in Parliament, the one antient in the 10 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. At which time the Commons preferred divers Articles unto the Lords in Parliament against <hi>Michael de la Pool,</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of <hi>England,</hi> accusing him amongst other things by the first Article of his Charge, That while he was Lord Chancellor he had refused to give Livery to the cheif Master of St. <hi>Anthonies,</hi> of the profit pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Order, till he had security from them, with Sureties by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognisance of Three thousand pounds, for the payment of One hundred
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:35668:175"/>
pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to the Earl, and to <hi>Iohn</hi> his Son, for their lives. The Earl by way of Answer, set forth a pretended Title in his Son, to the cheif Mastership of that Order, and that he took that One hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> as a Composition for his Sons right. The Commons replied, shewing amongst other things, That the taking of Money for that which should have been done freely, was a selling of the Law, and so prayed Judgment. In conclusion, the pretended right of his Son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not being just, or approved, the offence remained single by it self a sale of Law and Justice, as the Law termeth it, and not a Composition for the Release of his Interest. So the Earl for this, amongst the rest, was sentenced and greatly punished, as by the Records appeareth.</p>
                        <p>The other President of like nature, is more Modern in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> late Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> who was charged by the Commons in Parliament, and transmitted to your Lordships for taking of Five hundred pounds of the Farmers of the Great Customs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as a Bribe for allowing of that Security for payment of their Rent to the late Kings Majesty, which without such reward of Five hundred pounds, he had formerly refused to allow of. The Earl pretended for himself, That he had not onely that Five hundred pound, but Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds more, in all One thousand pounds, of those Farmers for a Release of his Claim, to Four of Two and thirty parts of that Farm: But upon the proof, it appearing to your Lordships, That he had not any such part of that Farm as he pretended, it was in the Thirteenth day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of <hi>May,</hi> in the Two and twentieth year of his late Majesties reign, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by your Lordships in Parliament (which I think is yet fresh in your Memories) That the Earl for this, amongst other things, should undergo many grievous Censures, as appeareth by the Records of your Lordships house, which I have lately seen and perused.</p>
                        <p>And now being to prove, that the said Duke had no title to any part of the Goods by him claimed against the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, I shall easily make it manifest, if his Lordships pretence by his own Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the Admiralty were true, That the Goods whereof he claims his share, were Piratically taken. From which Allegation, as he may not now recede, so is it clear by Reason and Authority, That of such Goods, no part or share whatsoever is due to the Lord Admiral in right of his Office, or otherways.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.
For that the parties from whom the same were taken, ought to have restitution, demanding it in due and reasonable time; and it were an injury to the intercourse, and Law of Nations, if the contrary should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be any way tolerated.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.
Secondly by Law; for so are the Statutes of this Kingdom, and more especially in 27 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.13. whereby it was provided, That if any Merchant, privy or stranger, be robbed of his Goods upon the Sea, and the same come afterwards into this Realm, the owner shall be received to prove such Goods to be his, and upon proof thereof, shall have the same restored to him again.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, 1, 2, 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.18. in the Act of Parliament, touching Sir <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                           <hi>Thomas Seymour,</hi> Great Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> who therein amongst divers other things is charged with this, That he had taken to his own use Goods Piratically taken against the Law, whereby he moved almost all Christian Princes to conceive a grudge and displeasure, and by open War to seek remedy by their own hands: And therefore for this, amongst other things, he was attainted of High Treason, as
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:35668:176"/>
appeareth by that Act wherein the Law is so declared to be as before is expressed.</p>
                        <p>But if it should be admitted, that the Duke had a right in this case, for which he might compound; yet the manner of his seeking to try and recover such his right, is in it self an high Offence, and clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in many respects, whereof I will touch but a few. As in making the most Honorable House of Parliament an Instrument to effect his private ends for his profit: In proceeding to arest and stay the Ships of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> men not apt to flie, but well able to answer and satisfie any just Suits which he might have against them, though their Ships had gone on in their Voyage: In prosecuting things so unseasonably, and urging them so extreamly by his Advocate, for bringing in of so great a sum of money upon the sudden, and formally under colour of Justice and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the State: In reducing that Company into that straight and necessity, that it was as good for them to compound, though the Duke had no title; as to defend their own just right against him upon these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> disadvantages, which by his power and industry he had put upon them.</p>

                        <p>In or about the Two and twentieth year of the reign of our late <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dear Soveraign Lord King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory, there being then a Treaty between our said late Soveraign and the French King, for a Marriage to be had between our then most Noble Prince (now our most gratious King) and the French Kings Sister (our now Queen) and for entring into an Active War against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and his Allies in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> Our said late Soveraign passed some promise to the French Kings Ambassador here, the Marquess <hi>D' Effiat,</hi> for procuring or lending some Ships to be employed by the French in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that Service, upon reasonable conditions; but without thought or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they should be employed against the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> or any others of our Religion in France: For it was pretended by the French Kings Ministers to our King, That the said Ships should be employed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly against <hi>Genoa,</hi> and not otherwise. But afterwards some matter of Suspition breaking forth from those of our Religion in <hi>France,</hi> that the Design for <hi>Italy</hi> was but a pretence to make the Body of an Army fall upon the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> or other of our Religion in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the King grew so cautious in his Conditions, that as he would perform his promise to lend his Ships, so to preserve those of our Religion, he contracted or gave directions, that the greater part of the Men in the same Ships should be English, whereby the power of them should be ever in his hands.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="327" facs="tcp:35668:176"/>
And the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> then and yet Lord Great Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> well knowing all this to be true, pretended he was and would be very careful, and proceed with art to keep the said Ships in the hands of our King, and upon our own Coasts; and yet nevertheless under hand he unduly intended, practised, and endeavored the contrary: For afterwards by his direction or procurement in or about the Two and twentieth year aforesaid, a Ship of his Majesties called the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> being of his Majesties Royal Navy, was allotted and appointed to be made ready for the service of the French King, and seven other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships of great burthen and strength, belonging to several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Natural Subjects of our said late Soveraign Lord, were by the Dukes direction impressed as for the service of his said late Majesty, and willed to make themselves ready accordingly.

                        <p>Also about the same time a Contract was made by and between Sir <hi>Iohn Cooke,</hi> and other the Commissioners of his Majesties Navy, as on behalf of his Majesty for his said Ship the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> and on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Captains, Masters, and Owners of the said Seven Merchants Ships, but without their privity or direction for the service of the French King, upon conditions to be safe and reasonable for our King, this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Realm, and State; as also for the said Captains, Masters, and Owners of the said seven Merchants Ships, and for the Companies. For Sir <hi>Iohn Cooke</hi> drew the Instructions for the Direction of the said Contract, which Instructions passed and were allowed by the King, and such of the Council, as were made acquainted therewith, and used in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

That there should be paid to every owner a moneths freight in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hand, after the rate agreed on; and freight for two moneths more after the same rate, within Fifteen days after the date of the Articles; the computation of the moneths to begin from the 28 of <hi>March.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. And that the Ships should be ready in a certain form prescribed at the end of the Service.</p>
                        <p>When all things were in a readiness for circumvention and surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of the Owners, Captains, and Masters of the said Ships, then and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not before, they were suddenly pressed to Seal the Countreparts of the prepared Articles; and they were about the same time released and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the Imprest of his Majesties Service, and acquainted and designed to serve the French King, the said three moneths pay being offered, and afterwards paid unto them before-hand, as a bait to draw on and intangle them in the business. Nevertheless, the Captains and Owners of the said Merchants Ships doubted upon some points (to wit) first, Against whom they should be employed? secondly, What Foreign <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> power they should be bound to take into their Ships? and thirdly, What sufficient security they should have for their freight, and redelivery of their Ships.</p>
                        <p>But there were private Instructions given to Captain <hi>Iohn Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Captain of the Kings Ship, the <hi>Vauntguard</hi>; as for him and the whole Fleet, that he should observe the first Instructions, to wit, Not to serve against those of the Religion, and to take into his Ship no more Frenchmen then they could master. The pretence for <hi>Genoa,</hi> and these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> private Instruments for <hi>Pennington,</hi> were but a further Artifice of the Dukes to draw the Ships into <hi>France,</hi> and to conceal the breaking forth of the matter here in <hi>England:</hi> And the more to endear them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in an opinion of right intention, they were commanded to conceal these private Instructions, as if the Duke and his Agents hast

trusted them more then they did the Ambassadors. By these and other like cunning and undue proceedings of the said Duke, the said Marquis <hi>d' Effiat</hi> sealed one part, and the Owners of the said Merchants ships respectively sealed the other parts of the said pretended Articles, trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they should not be bound to the strict performance thereof, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the said private Instructions to the contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

After the passing of these Articles, the said ships being formerly ready, the said Duke <hi>May</hi> 8. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 1625. made a Warrant under the Great-Seal, to call the Companies aboard which had been raised and fitted for the said French service, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former Instructions, and with first opportunity to go to such Port as the French Ambassador should direct, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there to expect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Party that should be Admiral of the said Fleet so prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with a requiry of all Officers to be assistant hereunto.</p>
                        <p>All things being now in readiness, Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> being Admiral of this whole Fleet, in <hi>May</hi> 1625. went with the Kings said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ship the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> and the seven Merchants ships aforesaid to <hi>Diep</hi> in <hi>France</hi>: There instantly the Duke of <hi>Memorancy,</hi> Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> would have put Two hundred French Souldiers aboard the ship called the <hi>Industry,</hi> being no more men then she could stow, but a far greater proportion of men then her proper Company was able to command or master; and offered also to do the like to every one of the said ships; telling the said Captain <hi>Pennington,</hi> and other the said English Captains and Owners, and their Companies in direct tearms, that they were to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> go, and should go to serve against the City and Inhabitants of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and against those of our Religion: whereunto they all shewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unwilling, there were Chains of Gold, and other Rewards offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto some of the Captains, Masters and Owners, to induce them: All which they utterly refused, protesting unanimously against the Design, and would not take in above a fit number of men, such as they might be able to command.</p>
                        <p>Also the Company of the Kings ship did there inform Captain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                           <hi>Pennington</hi> of this Overture made to go against <hi>Rochel,</hi> and exhibited a Petition to him against the same, subscribing their names to the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Circle or Compass, that it might not appear who was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the same, and then they laid it under his Prayer-Book, where he found and read it.

                        <p>The ships remained still in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>Iuly</hi> 15. 1625. there was a Treaty at <hi>Rochester</hi> between the three Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors Extraordinary of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Iames Moyer,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin</hi> for themselves and other English Captains and Masters of ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

That they should consent and agree, in consideration of the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> given them by the Ambassadors, to the Articles of <hi>March</hi> 25. 1625. whereby the French King should be made Master of the said ships by indifferent Inventory; that then they should by him be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against all hazards of Sea-fight, and if they miscarried, then the value thereof to be paid by the French King, who would also confirm this new Proposition within fifteen dayes after the ships should be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to his use by good caution in <hi>London.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3.
That if the French King would take any men out of the said ships, he might, but without any diminution of freight for or in respect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thereof.</p>
                        <p>The said <hi>Iames Moyer</hi> having gotten the French Instrument interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, answered, 1. they would not go to serve against <hi>Rochel</hi>; 2. nor send their ships, without good warrant for their going; and 3. not without suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient security to their liking for payment of their freight, and reddition of their ships, or the value thereof; for the Ambassadors security was by them taken not to be sufficient, and they protested against it, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refused this peraffetted Instrument: Here also Sir <hi>Iohn Epsley</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Sir <hi>Thomas Love</hi> disswaded the Duke from this enterprise, telling him, he could not justifie nor answer the delivery of the ships to the French.</p>
                        <p>The Lord Duke being at <hi>Rochester,</hi> and there acquainted with all these proceedings, commanded the said <hi>Moyer</hi> and the rest, before these

Ambassadors, that they should obey the Lord <hi>Conways</hi> Letter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Diep</hi> to serve the French, and that so was our Kings pleasure; howbeit herein his Majesties pleasure appeared not, but the contrary: yet privately at the same time the Duke told them, that the security offered or formerly given by the Ambassador, was insufficient, and that though they went to <hi>Diep,</hi> yet they might and should there keep their ships in their own power till they had made their own conditions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to their own liking. <hi>Iuly</hi> 16. 1625. The Duke of <hi>Chevereux</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Villocleox</hi> finding that they could not accomplish their designs at <hi>Rochester,</hi> but they must be fain to defer the getting thereof till the coming of the ships back again to <hi>Diep,</hi> where it was thought that better opportunity and more advantage for their ends would be had, did to that purpose make and ordain the Marquis <hi>d' Effiat</hi> their Deputy to contract with the Captains and Masters of the English ships for the French Kings service, as effectually as themselves might do, thereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> transferring their power in that behalf to the said <hi>d' Effiat,</hi> who intended to go over to <hi>Diep</hi> forthwith about this business. The Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> having thus the second time dealt with the Captains and Masters to go to <hi>Diep,</hi> and armed and prepared <hi>d' Effiat</hi> how and in what manner there to circumvent them, sent over to <hi>Diep</hi> privately, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, his Secretary Mr <hi>Edward Nicholas,</hi> together with <hi>d' Effiat.</hi> Mr <hi>Nicholas</hi> at and before the going over, had Instructions from the Duke by word to see the execution of the Kings pleasure signified <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by the Letter from my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and to procure the Captains and Masters of the said Merchants ships to deliver over their ships into the hands of the French, upon the security peraffetted at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> by the three French Ambassadors, and by them delivered to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who committed the same to the said Mr <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> as the security which in that behalf he was to take and accept. Mr <hi>Nicholas</hi> according to those Instructions, went to <hi>Diep</hi> with <hi>d' Effiat,</hi> and was there very urgent to get the ships delivered to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the French, according to the said Instructions at their coming over to <hi>Diep: d' Effiat</hi> entred a Suit and Protest against our Captains and Masters, and their original Articles, the better to enforce them to perform the same, without respect to the Dukes verbal preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Allegations made to the Captains and Masters at <hi>Rochester,</hi> and in other places formerly to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>The Captains and Masters came over again to <hi>Diep</hi> about <hi>Iuly</hi> 20. where they found themselves in a strait by reason of the said Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there entred against them, the Dukes instructions by word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too weak to exempt them from obtaining their Contract under their Hands and Seals; also Mr <hi>Nicholas</hi> using the Kings name with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning words, was there very earnest from day to day, and very ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently pressed them to deliver over their ships before security given to their content, contrary to the former Proposition, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Lord Dukes word to them at <hi>Rochester</hi>) which they refusing to yeild un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Advertisement thereof was speedily sent to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and to his Agents into <hi>England,</hi> and Mr <hi>Nicholas</hi> continued still at <hi>Diep</hi> about his former Negotiation.</p>

They prayed to be free of the said Protest, that they might the better treat of their affairs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.
If the the French King would have delivery of their ships in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his power and possession, that then they might have security by money deposited in <hi>London,</hi> without Revocation for satisfaction of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their ships, the former security by Merchants being insufficient, and a stop already made of their pay, which upon that security they know not how to come by.</p>
                        <p n="3">3.
Because their ships being Fortresses of this Kingdom, and the delivery of them over into the hands of a Forein Prince without good warrant, concerneth even their very lives, that they might have a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in that behalf under the Great-Seal of <hi>England</hi> before they should be bound to deliver them over.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        </p>

To be free of their bonds entred into for not selling their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and also free of punishment in that behalf, and they shewed how they were more cautious herein, for that Commissioners drew the first Articles, which were now wholly broken, and these Articles were to be done by themselves.</p>
                        <p>And this writing they sent from their ships by one Mr <hi>Basset Cole,</hi> to present on shore to the Marquis <hi>d' Effiat</hi> at <hi>Diep,</hi> appointing the said Mr <hi>Cole</hi> to treat for a speedy conclusion according to these Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> who treated accordingly: And the said Marquis, to induce him to yield to his demands, shewed a Letter in French signed by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whereby the Duke promised his endeavors to get the Marquis's turn served touching these ships.</p>
                        <p>The next day, <hi>viz.</hi> 28 <hi>Iuly</hi> 1625.

                        <p>His Majesty did thereby charge and command the said Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> without delay to put his Highness former Command in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, for consigning the <hi>Vantguard</hi> into the hands of the Marguis <hi>D'Effiat</hi> for the French, with all her Furniture, assuring her Officers his Majesty would provide for their Indemnity; And to require the seven Merchants ships in his Majesties name to put themselves into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> service of the French King, according to the promise his Majesty had made unto him; And in case of backwardness or refusal, commanding him to use all forcible means to compel them, even to sinking; with a Charge not to fail, and this Letter to be his Warrant.</p>
                        <p>This Letter was sent by Captain <hi>Thomas Wilbraham</hi> to Captain <hi>Pennington,</hi> who was yet in the <hi>Downs.</hi> In the beginning of <hi>August</hi> 1625.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:35668:180"/>
Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> went over again to <hi>Diep,</hi> carrying with him the said Letters of his Majesty, and certain Instructions in writing from the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to Mr. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> agreeable in substance to the former verbal Instructions given by the Duke to him at <hi>Rochester,</hi> as the said <hi>Nicholas</hi> alleadgeth; who also affirmeth, that in all things what he did touching that business, he did nothing but what was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Dukes Instructions to him; which if it be true, then the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> who commanded and imployed him therein <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> must needs be guilty of the matters so acted by the said Mr. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> If there be any subsequent act or assent of Council, or of some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors of State for the going of these ships to the French, or for putting them into their power, it was obtained only for a colour, and was unduly gotten by misinforming the Contents of the sealed Articles, and concealing the Truth, or by some other undue means: Neither can any such latter act of Council in any sort justifie the Dukes proceedings, which by the whole current of the matter appears <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to have been indirect in this business even from the beginning. About the time of Captain <hi>Pennington's</hi> coming over to <hi>Diep</hi> the second time, Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> did in his speeches to the Captains and Masters of the seven Merchants ships threaten and tell them, That it was as much as their lives were worth, if they delivered not their ships to the French as he required; which put them in such fear as they could hardly sleep: And thereupon two of them were once resolved to have come again away with the ships; and because the former threats had made them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> afraid to return into <hi>England,</hi> therefore to have brought and left their ships in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and themselves for safety of their lives to have gone into <hi>Holland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> being the second time come into <hi>Diep,</hi> there forthwith delivered and put the said ship the <hi>Vantguard</hi> into the absolute power and command of the French King, his Subjects and Ministers, to the said French Kings use, to be imployed in his service at his pleasure; and acquainted the rest of the Fleet with the effect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of his Majesties Letter and Command, and demanded and required them also to deliver and put their ships into the power and command of the French King accordingly. The Captains, Masters, and Owners of the seven Merchants ships refused so to do, as conceiving it was not the Kings pleasure they should so do without security for redelivery of their ships, or satisfaction for the same to their good contentment. Hereupon <hi>Pennington</hi> went on shore at <hi>Diep,</hi> and there spake with <hi>D'Effiat</hi> the Ambassador, and shortly after returned aboard, and gave <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Captains, Masters and Owners an Answer, resting upon the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and urging the performance of the former Contract made and peraffetted in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then the said Masters and Captains prepared to be gone, and weighed anchor accordingly. Whereupon Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> shot at them, and forced them to come again to anchor, as yielding themselves for fear to his mercy and disposal. Upon this, Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> and the Frenchmen that now commanded the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> came aboard the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Merchants ships, and there proposed unto them a new way for their security touching their ships, namely to accept the security of the Town of <hi>Diep:</hi> Whereupon they all went ashore except Sir <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Gorge,</hi> who with his ship the <hi>Great Neptune</hi> adventured to come away, as not liking these new and unreasonable Propositions.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:35668:180"/>
At their coming ashore they spake with Mr. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and there by his enforcement came to a new Agreement to accept the Security of the Town of <hi>Diep,</hi> upon certain hard Conditions; namely, The said Marquis <hi>d' Effiat</hi> as Extraordinary Ambassador in <hi>England,</hi> and as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power by deputation from the Duke of <hi>Chevereux</hi> and <hi>Villocleer,</hi> on or about <hi>August</hi> 15. 1625, did agree and promise to the said <hi>Moyer, Touchin, Thomas Davies, Dard, John Davies, Lewen,</hi> as Captains and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Owners of the said ships, called the <hi>Industry,</hi> the <hi>Pearl,</hi> the <hi>Marigold,</hi> the <hi>Loyalty,</hi> the <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> then being in the Road of the Town of <hi>Diep,</hi> That the French King should give and furnish to the said Owners (they being present, and accepting it in this Town) this sufficient security, That within fifteen dayes after the said French King should be in possession of the said ships, he should give sufficient caution in <hi>London,</hi> for the sum of Two hundred and thirteen thousand Livres, whereat the said ships were estimated, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with all that appertaineth to them, as Cannons and other Munitions of War; <hi>viz.</hi> Fifty thousand pounds. And in or about the same 15 <hi>August,</hi> 1625. the Commonalty of the said Town of <hi>Diep</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred security, and bound the goods of their Commonalty to the said English Captains and Owners, That the said French King and his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors should furnish the security within the City of <hi>London</hi> within the time, and for the sum aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>On or about <hi>August</hi> 16. 1625. the said Marquis <hi>d' Ef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit, because the said Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors had found it good now to discharge the English Mariners out of the said ships, that therefore the freight agreed upon by the said former Contract should not be wholly paid, but only for the space of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the first six moneths; yet if the French King would use them for twelve moneths longer, or for any less time, that then he should pay freight for the same according to a new particular rate and manner expressed in the said Articles, and bound the goods of himself and the said Duke of <hi>Chevereux</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Villocleer</hi> for the performance hereof, as by the said Article it self; reference being thereunto had, amongst other things more fully appeareth.</p>
                        <p>This Article being passed and recorded at <hi>Diep,</hi> all the said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> seven Merchants ships, except the <hi>Great-Neptune,</hi> who was gone away in detestation of the action intended by the French were forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with delivered into the absolute possession, power, and command of the French King, and of his said Ambassador <hi>d' Effiat,</hi> and other the Ministers and Subjects of the French King, to be imployed by him in his service at his pleasure, and not one of all the English
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:35668:181"/>
Company, Man or Boy, (other then one onely man, a Gunner as it should seem) would stay in any of those ships, to serve against the Rochellors, or those of our Religion.</p>
                        <p>As soon as these ships were thus delivered into the possession and power of the French, the said Ambassador then moved them, and dealt earnestly with them for the sale of their ships. Mr <hi>Nicholas</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving finished the work he went for, at his coming from <hi>Diep</hi> he recei-a Diamond-Ring worth Fifty pounds, and a Hatband set with Sparks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Diamonds, worth One hundred Marks, of the Ambassador, as a recompence for his pains taken in this Imployment, which (although Ambassadors do confer greater rewards sometimes at their parting upon persons of Mr <hi>Nicholas</hi> his quality, for less service done) yet was it more then so ill an office as he was imployed in could in any sort deserve.</p>
                        <p>The said Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> returned speedily into <hi>England,</hi> and took his journey towards the City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the Parliament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was then sitting, by adjournment from <hi>Westminster</hi> thither, and there several Propositions were taken into debate for the good of our Religion, and the supply of his Majesties occasions: For the well resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and setling whereof the true knowledg how, and upon what occasions and terms the several ships were sent, delivered, imployed, and to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, was very requisite. Afterwards neverthertheless upon or about <hi>August</hi> 6. 1625. at a meeting and conference between both the Houses of Parliament in <hi>Christchurch</hi>-Hall, after the reading there of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Majesties most gracious Answer to a Petition of the Lords and Commons formerly exhibited unto his Majesty touching our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and much for the good thereof, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> well knowing all the passages which I have now related to your Lordships to be true, did not onely cautelously conceal the same, but also much boldly and untruely, by colour of a Message deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Majesty to both the Houses, affirm unto them touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those ships to this effect; That it was not alwayes fit for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Kings to give accompt of their Counsels, and that about five of the six Moneths were already past, and yet the said ships were not imployed against <hi>Rochel</hi>; willing and advising the said Lords and Commons to judge the things by the event, to which he seemed to refer the matter. By which cunning Speeches the Duke intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and accordingly did make the Lords and Commons then to believe, That the said ships were never meant, or any way in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be imployed against the Rochellors, or those of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in <hi>France</hi>; and herein he did great injury and disservice to his Majesty, to the great scandal and prejudice of our Religion and Affairs, and highly abused both the Lords and Commons by this cautelous and subtile Speech and Insinuation, and thereby gave both Houses occasion to forbear Petitioning or suing to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty for Redress in this Business, while the time was not then passed; for the ships were not as then actually imployed against the Rochellors, albeit in truth they were then delivered into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> French Kings power.</p>
                        <p>And the same time before the Parliament was dissolved, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Pennington,</hi> who could have opened the whole truth of the business for the Service of the King and the Realm, came to <hi>Oxford,</hi> but was there drawn to conceal himself by means of the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:35668:181"/>
Duke, and not to publish in due time his knowledge of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, as was there shortly after reported. The truth whereof the Lords in this Parliament may be pleased to examine, as they shall see cause; the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> being shortly after, viz. <hi>Aug.</hi> 12. unhappily dissolved.</p>
                        <p>In or about <hi>September</hi> 1625. The said ships were actually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed against the <hi>Rochellors</hi> and their Friends, to their exceeding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> great prejudice, and almost utter ruine. It hath been said by some of the <hi>French,</hi> that the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> she mowed them down like grass: To the great dishonor of our Nation, and the scandal of our Religion, and to the disadvantage of the great affairs of this Kingdom, and all Christendom.</p>
                        <p>Also the Ships themselves were in eminent peril to be utterly lost, for lack of sufficient Cautions. If they be come home since this Parliament sate down, long after the matter was here expounded and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> taken into examination; It may be well presumed that it is by some underhand procuring of the Duke, and the secret complying of the <hi>French</hi> with him, to colour out the matter; which the Lords may examine as they see cause. The one and onely <hi>English-man</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to stay in one of the Ships, and serve against the poor <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors</hi> of our Religion, at his return was slain in charging a Peece of Ordnance not by him well sponged.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>February</hi> last 1625. Monsieur <hi>de la Touche</hi> having speech with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Master <hi>Thomas Sherwell</hi> a Member of the Commons House of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> as he was coming up to the Parliament, and Monsieur <hi>de la Touche</hi> going down into <hi>Somerset-shire</hi> to Master <hi>John Pawlets</hi> to Monsieur <hi>Sobysa</hi>; He told Master <hi>Sherwell,</hi> in the hearing also of one Master <hi>Iohn Clements</hi> of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> who is now in Town, the words that the Duke had spoken to him the last Summer touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Ships; and thereupon used these words, <hi>Ce Duque est un meshant homme.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                        <p>Upon this whole Narration of the Fact touching the manner of Delivery of the Ships to the <hi>French,</hi> divers things may be observed wherein the Dukes offences do consist: As, In betraying a Ship of the Kings Royal Navy unto a Foreign Princes hand, without good Warrant for the same; The dispossessing the Subjects of this Realm of their Ships and Goods by many artifices and subtilties, and in conclusion with high hand and open violence against the good will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the Owners; In breaking the duty of Lord Admiral and Guardian of the Ships and Seas of this Kingdom; In varying from the original good Instructions, and presuming to give others of his own head in matters of State; In violating the duty of a sworne Privy-Counsellor to his Majesty; In abusing both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a cautelous Misinformation, under a colour of a Message from his Majesty; And in disadvantaging the Affairs of those of our Religion in Foreign parts: Offences of an high and grievous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> nature.</p>
                        <p>For the proof of some parts thereof, which are not the least, I offer to your Lordships consideration the Statute of the 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>E.</hi> 6. touching the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi>; wherein is recited, That amongst other things, he did not suffer the Piers called the <hi>Newhaven</hi> and <hi>Blackerst</hi> in the parts beyond the Seas, to be furnished with victuals
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:35668:182"/>
and money, whereby the <hi>French</hi> were encouraged to invade and win the same; Aud for this offence amongst others, it was Enacted, That a great part of his Land should be taken from him. And if <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feazance</hi> in a matter tending to lose a fixed Castle belonging to the King, be an high offence; then the actual putting of a Ship Royal of the Kings into the hand of a Foreign Prince, which is a moveable and more useful Castle and Fortress of the Realm, must needs be held a greater offence.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will forbear to cite any more Presidents of this kind, because some of those who have gone before me have touched at divers Presidents of this nature, which may be applied to this my part. Only, because the abuse of the Parliament, which is the chiefest Council of State and Court of Judicature in the Realm, is not the least offence in this business, I shall desire your Lordships to take into consideration the Statute of <hi>Westm.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. whereby such as seem to beguile Courts of Justice, are to be sore judged in the same Courts, and punished, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by that Statute appeareth.</p>

            <p>So he concluded, and left the Duke to their Lordships equal Justice.</p>
            <p>The Ninth and Tenth Articles were read next.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Whereas the Titles of Honor of this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> were wont to be conferred as great Rewards, upon such vertuous and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> industrious Persons as had merited them by their faithful service; The said Duke, by his importunate and subtile procurement, hath not only perverted that antient and most honorable way, but also unduly for his own particular gain he hath enforced some that were rich (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing) to purchase Honor: As the Lord <hi>R.</hi> Baron of <hi>T.</hi> who by practice of the said Duke and his Agents was drawn up to <hi>London,</hi> in or about <hi>October</hi> in the Two and twentieth year of Reign of the late King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory, and there so threatened and dealt withall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that by reason thereof he yielded to give, and accordingly did pay the sum of Ten thousand pounds to the said Duke and to his use: For which said sum, the said Duke in the moneth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the Two and twentieth year of the said lake King, procured the Title of <hi>Baron R. of T.</hi> to the said Lord <hi>R.</hi> In which practice, as the said Lord <hi>R.</hi> was much wronged in his particular, so the Example thereof tendeth to the prejudice of the Gentry, and dishonor of the Nobility of this Kingdom.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

            <p n="10">X. Whereas no Places of Judicature in the Courts of Justice of our Soveraign Lord the King, nor other like Preferments given by the Kings of this Realm, ought to be procured by any Subject whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for any Reward, Bribe, or Gift; He the said Duke in or about the moneth of <hi>December</hi> in the Eighteenth year of the Reign of the late King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory, did procure of the said King the Office of <hi>High Treasurer of England</hi> to the Lord Vicount <hi>M.</hi> now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Earl of <hi>M.</hi> Which Office at his procurement was given and granted accordingly to the Lord Vicount <hi>M.</hi> And as a Reward for the said procurement of the same Grant, he the said Duke did then receive to his own use of and from the said Lord Vicount <hi>M.</hi> the sum of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> of lawful money of <hi>England.</hi> And also in or about the moneth of <hi>Ianuary</hi>

ALthough I know that I shall speak to my own disadvantage, yet I shall labor to speak with as little disadvantage to the matter as I can. I have no learning or ornament whereby I might shew my self, and I shall think it enough plainly to shew the matter; For all that I aim at is, that I may lose nothing of the Cause. And therefore, my Lords, I shall apply my self with as much convenient brevity, as one that knows that your Lordships time is much more precious then my words: Your Lordships being such Judges, as will measure things by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> true and natural proportions, and not by the proportion of the action or expression.</p>
                        <p>The first entrance into my service must be reading the Articles.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth the 11. Article.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>My Lords, This Charge for matter of Fact is so notorious and apparent, that it needs no proof that these Honors have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured: And therefore I will only insist upon the Consequence. First I will shew, That by this fact the Duke hath committed a great Offence: And secondly, That this Offence hath produced a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Grievance to the Commonwealth. And I will conclude, in strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole by some Presidents of former times, that Parliaments have proceeded in that course in which your Lordships are like to proceed.</p>
                        <p>First to prove it a fault or an offence, I must prove that there was a duty; for every fault presupposeth a duty: And in this case the first work is to shew, that the Duke was bound to do otherwise: For which I need to alleage nothing else, then that he is a sworne Servant and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Counsellor to the King, and so ought to have preferred his Majesties honor and service before his own pride in seeking to Ennoble all that Blood that concerned him. And it is not enough to say, that it is not questionable; For there have been Great men questioned in the like cases. There be some Laws made that are particular according to the temper and occasions of several States: There are other Laws that be coessential and collateral with Government; and if those Laws be broken, all things run to disorder and confusion. Such is that Rule ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in all States, of suppressing Vice to encourage Vertue, by apt Punishment and Rewards: And this the fittest Law to insist upon in a Court of Parliament, when the Proceedings are not limited either by the Civil or Common Laws, but matters are adjudged according as they stand in opposition or conformity with that which is <hi>suprema lex, Salus populi.</hi>

2. By this late Law, whoever moves the King to bestow Honor, which is the greatest reward, binds himself to make good a double proportion of Merit in that Party who is to receive it; The first of value and excellence; the second of continuance and durableness. And as this Honor sets men up above others, so they should be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in vertue beyond others: As it is perpetual, not ending with their persons, but descending upon their posterity; so there ought to be in the first root of this Honor some such active merit in the service of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Commonwealth, as might transmit a vigorous Example to his Successors, whereby they may be raised to an Imitation of the like Vertues.</p>
                        <p>He said, he would for bear to urge this point further, out of a modest respect to those persons whom it did collaterally concern, professing his Charge to be wholly against the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. From the consideration of Honor, together with the price of Money: The which being compared together, may be reduced to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> two heads, (may it please your Lordships:) The one being earthly and base, may be bought with a proportionable price of white and red earth, Gold and Silver; The other which is spiritual (which is sublime) to which Money cannot be a proportionable price. Honor is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent, in regard it was held a sacred and divine thing, insomuch that there was a Temple dedicated to her by the <hi>Romans:</hi> And so I conclude by prescription, that Honor is a divine thing; for the Scripture calls Kings <hi>Gods</hi>; and then those that are about Kings must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> needs be resembled to those Powers and Principalities that attend next to the Throne: And if Honor be such a divine thing, it must not then be bought with so base a price as Money.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Lastly, Honor is a Publick thing, it is the reward of Publick Deserts.</p>
                        <p>And thus your Lordships have seen, that the sale of Honor is an offence unnatural against the Law of Nature. Now what an offence this is, your Lordships may discern, considering the kinds of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the Adjuncts, which I now fall upon.</p>

                           <item>2. It takes from the Crown the most fair and frugal Reward of deserving Servants: For when Honor comes to be at so mean a rate as to be sold, there is no Great man will look after it.</item>
                           <item>3. It is the way to make a man more studious for lucre and gain,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then of sufficiencie in Vertue; when they know that they shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Titles of Honor according to the heaviness of purse, and not for the weightiness of their merit.</item>
                           <item>4. It introduceth a strange confusion, mingling the meaner with the more pure and refined metal.</item>

                        <p>For Examples and Presidents, I am confident there are none; and your Lordships can look for none, because it is not parallel'd to any President. But certainly it is now a fit time to make a President of this man, this great Duke, that hath been lately raised to this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent height in our Sphere; who thinketh he cannot shine enough,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:35668:183"/>
unless he dim your Lordships Honors in making the same contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble through the sale of it, by the commonness of it.</p>
                        <p>Yet I am commanded further to observe another step of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness in this Gentleman, who hath not only set Honor to sale by his Agents, but compelled men likewise unwilling to take Titles of Honor upon them. For the particular, that Noble Gentleman that this concerns, I am commanded to say of him from the House of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Commons, That they conceive of him that he was worthy of this Honor, if he had not come to it this way; They can lay no blame upon him, that was constrained to make this bargain to redeem his trouble. But we must distinguish of this, as Divines do betwixt the Active and Passive Usurers; they condemn the Active, speaking favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of the Passive.</p>
                        <p>And I must here observe to your Lordships by the direction of the House of Commons, That it seems strange to them, that this Great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> man, whom they have taken notice of to be the principal Patron and Supporter of a Semipelagian and a Popish Faction set on foot to the danger of this Church and State, whose Tenets are <hi>Liberty of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> though somewhat mollified; That a man imbracing these Tenets should not admit of Liberty in Moral things: And that he should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel one to take Honor and Grace from a King whether he will or no, what is that but to adde Inhumanity and Oppression to Injury and Incivility?</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
But here I must answer a President or two, which may be by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding inforced against me. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 5. There was <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Babington,</hi> and others, which were chosen to be Serjeants, and they did decline from it out of their modesty, and doubted that their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states were not answerable to their Place: yet upon the Charge of the Warden of <hi>England,</hi> they accepted it and appeared to their Writs. Likewise there is a Writ in the <hi>Register,</hi> That many by reason of the Tenure of their Lands may be compelled to be made Knights. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But this makes rather against, then for this Faction: For it is true, that this is the wisdom and policie of the Common-Law, that those that be thought fit men for Imployment, may be drawn forth to be imployed for the good of the Commonwealth, where otherwise they would not take it upon them: But that any man for his own gain should force a man to take Degrees of Honor upon him, certainly this is beyond all Presidents, and a thing not to be exampled either in our Nation or any other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
And further I am commanded to tell your Lordships, That it is dangerous, that if a great Lord by his power or strength may compel a Subject to take such Honors, why may he not compel them as well to take his Lands at what price he will, and to sell them again as he thinks fit; yea, to marry his Children as it pleaseth him? The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of this is great, if that it be well considered; And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it is of so great a consequence, that if it be not stopped, it may come in time to make way for a dangerous Subversion, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> demonstrates a great Tyranny of a Subject, under a most wise, most gracious, and most moderate King.</p>
                        <p>And thus (my Lords) I have done with the first Article allotted to my Charge, and so I proceed to the next.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="342" facs="tcp:35668:184"/>
                           <hi>My Lords,</hi> Before I enter into the enforcement of this Article, I shall by way of Protestation from the House of Commons do in this as I did in the other Article.<note place="margin">The 10. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle enlarged.</note> And first for the Kings Majesty under whom we are now happily governed and placed, I must by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection say for his honor, and our comfort, and with humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment confess, That since his coming to the Crown there have been men of as great parts and learning advanced into Places in Church and Commonwealth, as any have been heretofore. And then for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> first of those Lords whose names are mentioned in this Article, I must say, that they do not intend to reflect at all upon him; nay they think his person so worthy, as to be advanced to as high a place without any price at all, and that he ought to have kept it longer, if those that shuffled in those times, had not shuffled him out.</p>
                        <p>Now to the matter of this Article, which is the Sale of Places of Judicature, being an offence: And to prove this, is all one as to make the glass clear by painting of it. The grounds whereon I shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> go, shall be laid open <hi>Magna Charta cap.</hi> 29. The words are these; <hi>Nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus Justitiam.</hi> It may be said, this comes not close to my purpose: Yet by your Lordships favor I shall make it good that it doth, and I shall begin with the latter of the two first, <hi>Nulli negabimus:</hi> For if any that hath power or favor with the King, should procure him to delay the making of Judges, when there were Judges to take it, it will not be denied that they do their best endeavor to make the King break his word; For if any use their favor about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the King to procure Places of Judicature for money, they do what in them lies to make Justice it self saleable: For it is plain that he that buyes must sell, and cannot be blamed if he do sell.</p>
                        <p>I shall open the evil Consequences that depend upon the sale of Places of Judicature, or any Places of great trust.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. By this means unable men shall be sure of the precedence unto Places; For they being conscious of their own want of Merits, they must be made up by the weight in Gold.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. It must needs hence follow, that Suits, Contentions, Brawls and Quarrels shall be increased in the Commonwealth: For when men come to seats of Judicature by purchase, they must by increase of Suits increase their own profit.</item>
                           <item>3. Men will not study for sufficiencie of Learning to be able to discharge their Places, but how they may scrape together Money to purchase Places.</item>
                           <item>4. It will follow, that those that have the best Purses, though worst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Causes, will carry away the victory always.</item>
                           <item>5. It will follow, that when they be preferred for money to those Places, they are tied to make the best of those Places <hi>viis &amp; modis:</hi> And then the Great man that sold those Places to them, must uphold them in their Bribery; and he is tied to it, because they are his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; nay further he is tied to support them in their Bribery, to advance their Places upon the next remove.</item>
                           <item>6. And lastly, when good men and well deserving come to any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Place, they shall not continue there, but they shall be quarrelled at, so that there may be a vacancie in that Place, and then some other shall suddenly step into the saddle by giving a competent price.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Upon these and the like reasons, this fact of selling and buying Places and Offices of Trust, hath not only been declaimed against by
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:35668:184"/>
Christians, but also by Moral Pagans. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his 5 <hi>lib.</hi> of <hi>Ethicks cap.</hi> 8. gives it as a <hi>Caveat,</hi> That no man amongst the <hi>Thebans</hi> was to take upon him any Place of Government in the Commonwealth if that he were a Merchant, unless there were ten years distance between. And the reason is this; Because Merchants are used to buying and selling, It is their Trade and Art to to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Money, so that their fingers are accustomed to that which they cannot leave when they come to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Places of Trust and Judicature. Nay further, in honor of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, He is accounted the wisest Merchant that gains most; so that if any such comes to Offices and Places of Trust, he thinks it best to advance his profit.</p>
                        <p>Next to the <hi>Pagans,</hi> the <hi>Popes,</hi> a Generation full of Corruption, yet they by their Bulls are full of Declamation against such. And this is plain by a Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> who lays the Penalty of Confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goods of any that do for money acquire any Offices, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them by his Papal sentence to be great sinners. So <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth condemns the like.</p>
                        <p>And now to come nearer home, to come to that which will prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally lead your Lordships, which are the Judgments of your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors in Parliament; wherein it appears by the Statute of 5 <hi>H.</hi> 6. that the same Statute condemns the Seller and Receiver, as well as the Buyer and Giver. It further appears by the Preamble of that Statute, that such offences were against the Law, and they foresaw the Corruptions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of those that came into those Places by those means, and that it is a hinderance of sufficient and worthy men from those Places. And also 2, <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>E.</hi> 6. which was likewise cited in the Case of the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> by which he was to forfeit his Estate, that one thing was for selling of Places in the Commonwealth for money. And certainly, with your Lordships favor, it is most just and probable, that they that profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be <hi>Patriots,</hi> and shew by their actions that they aim at their own lucre, and labor to hinder the distributing of Iustice, it is most just <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and proper that those men should return back again to the Publick Treasury of the King and Kingdom, what they have by their unsatisfied lucre gotten.</p>
                        <p>And so, my Lords, craving Pardon of you for my boldness, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and distractions in going through this business, I humbly leave my self to the judgments of your favors and charities, and this Great man the Duke to your wise Censure and Justice.</p>

And afterwards he surrendred to his said Majesty divers Mannors and Lands, parcel of those Lands formerly granted unto him, to the value of Seven hundred twenty three pounds eighteen shillings and two pence half-penny <hi>per annum</hi>; in consideration of which surrender, he procured divers other Lands of the said late King to be sold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for by his own Servants and Agents, and thereupon hath obtained grants of the same to pass from his late Majesty to several persons of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Kingdom, and hath caused Tallies to be stricken for the money, being the consideration mentioned in those Grants in the Receipt of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, as if any such monies had really come to his Majesties Coffers; whereas the Duke, (or some other by his appointment) hath indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the same sums, and expended them upon his own occasions.

In examination of which second Evil, the Trade and Comerce of Honor, we have, as the Commons do conceive, <hi>confitentem reum:</hi> For he endeavouring to colour the matter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sayes for himself, That he was not the onely introducer and first bringer in of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they finde that he was the first that defiled this Virgin of Honor so publickly, making an accompt, that all things and persons should stoop and subject themselves to his vain desires and extravagancy. Now that this comerce of Honor is an Offence; then to prove what kinde of Offence it is, is the onely thing I shall trouble your Lordships with.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.
And first that it is an Offence, I shall draw my first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from the <hi>Nature of Honor</hi>; Honor is a Beam of Vertue; now this Honor can be no more fixed upon an undeserving Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for Money, then Fire can be struck out of a Stick.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.
From <hi>the Suject of Honor,</hi> which is Merit, for the which no price ought to be paid to any great man (by any undeserving) person for the same, but their own merit and desert.</p>
                        <p>Then he passed to the Grievances which are caused by the selling of Titles, and they are Three.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                        </p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1.
First it is prejudicial to the Noble Barons of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</item>
                           <item>2.
To the King, by disabling him to reward extraordinary ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</item>
                           <item>3.
To the Kingdom which comprehends both King, Lords, and people.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>For the first, He said, he would not trouble their Lordships with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> recital, how Ancient, how Famous the Degree of Barons hath been in these Western Monarchies; He said, the Baronage of <hi>England</hi> hath longer upheld that Dignity, and doth yet retain a greater height then in any other Nation; they are great Judges, a Court of the last resort, they are great Counsellors of State, and not onely for the present, but as Law-makers, Counsellors for the time to come; and this not by Delegacy and Commission, but by Birth and Inheritance:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> So that when any man shall be made a Member of this great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who is not qualified for the performance of such noble Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it must needs be a prejudice to the whole body, and dishonor to the head. As if a little water be put into a great vessel of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:35668:186"/>
Wine, as it receives spirit and strength from the Wine, so it doth impart some degrees of its own infirmity and coldness to the Wine.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is prejudicial to the King; not that it can disable him from giving Honor (for that is a power inseparable) but by making Honor ordinary, it becomes as an incompetent Reward for extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertue; when men are made noble, they are taken out of the Press of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the common sort, and how can it chuse but fall in estimation, if Honor it self be made a Press?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It is prejudicial to the Kingdom; the Stories and Records are full of the great assistance which the Crown hath received from the Barons, both in Forein and Domestick Actions, not onely by their own persons, but by their Retinue and Tenants, and therefore they are called by <hi>Bracton, Robur Belli</hi>; how can we now expect the like from such as have no Tenants, and are hardly able to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        <p>But this is not all; for the prejudice grows not primitively by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that assistance which they might give the State, but positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have been a great burthen to the Kingdom by Gifts and Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons already received, and yet stand in need of more for the future sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their Dignities. This makes the Dukes offence the greater, that in this weakness and consumption of the Commonwealth, he hath not been contented alone to consume the qublick Treasure, (which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is the blood and nourishment of the State) but hath brought in others to help him in this work of destruction. And that they might do it more eagerly, by inlarging their Honors, he hath likewise inlarged their Necessities, and their Appetites. He did second his Charge with two Presidents; the first, 28 <hi>Henry</hi> 6. in the Complaint against the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in the One and thirtieth Article of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, this was one of his Charges, That he <hi>William de la Pool</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> had procured one who had married his Niece to be made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Earl of <hi>Kendal,</hi> and obtained for him One thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Guienne</hi>; and yet this Party was the Son of a Noble and well deserving Father. So you see this is no new thing for the House of Commons to complain, that those that are neer the King should raise their Kindred to an unnecessary Honor; and if that were worthy of punishment for advancing of one, then what punishment is he worthy of that hath advanced so many?</p>
                        <p>The second President is 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. There passed an Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for the Degrading of <hi>Iohn Nevil,</hi> Marquis <hi>Montague,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi>; the reason expressed in the Act is, because he had not a Revenue sufficient for the maintaining of that Dignity; to which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another reason of that nature, that when men of mean birth are called to a high Estate, and have not livelihood to support it, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth great poverty, and causeth briberies and extortions, imbraceries and maintenance.</p>
                        <p>And now my Lords, how far these Reasons shall lead your Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in this Case, I must leave it to your Lordships.</p>

                  </body>
               </floatingText>
            </q>
            <p>Then he read the Twelfth Article,<note place="margin">He enlargeth the Twelfth Article.</note> being the second part of his Charge; the Title whereof was, The Exhausting, Intercepting and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imploying the Kings Revenues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:35668:187"/>
               <q>My Lords, This Article consists of several Clauses, which in some respects may be called so many distinct Charges; for though they all tend to one end and scope, the diminishing the Kings Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, yet it is by divers wayes, so that every Clause is a particular Branch. Therefore he desired to break it into parts, and to select the most material, either in point of offence or grievance, inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing to pass through them with this order; first, to declare the state of the proof, and then to add such reasons and inforcements as he did conceive most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> conduceable to that Judgement which the Commons were to expect from their Lorships.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He made two main Branches of this Article. The first concerns Lands obtained from the Crown; the second concerns Money in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Gifts, Farms, and other kinde of profit.</p>
            <p>Touching the Lands he observed four Things.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1.
The sum of Three thousand thirty five pounds <hi>per annum</hi> of old Rent, besides the Forest of <hi>Layfield,</hi> of which we have no value, and we can finde no Schedule granted by the late King to my Lord of <hi>Buckingkham</hi> within ten years past, as appeareth by the several Grants vouched in the Schedule annexed; and it was in it self a great grievance, That in a time of such necessity, when the Kings Revenues are not able to support such a great charge, that so much Land should be conveyed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to a private man; This he acknowledged was not the Dukes case alone, for others had received divers Grants from the King, but none in so great measure.</p>
               <p>And because the Commons aim not at Judgement onely, but at Reformation, he wished, That when the King should bestow any Land for support of Honors, that the caution which was wont to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully observed might again return into use; that is, to annex those Lands to the Dignity, lest being obtained and wasted, the Party repair <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to the King for a new support; by which provision the Crown will reap this Benefit, That as some Lands go out by new Grants, others will come in by spent Intails.</p>
               <p>He said he would not trouble their Lordships with repetition of the Laws heretofore made for preventing the alienation of the Kings Lands, and for resuming those that had been alienated, nor of the Ordinances made in this high Court for the same purpose, and Fines set upon those that presumed to break such Ordinances; he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> onely added as a further enforcement of the Grievance, That when the Kings Revenues be unable to defray publick necessities, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons must needs be more burthened with Supplies.</p>
            </q>
            <p n="2">2.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="2">His second Point was, the unusual Clauses which the Duke by his greatness hath procured to be inserted into the Warrants for passing of those Lands, of which two were mentioned; the first, That the casual profits should not be rated in the particulars; the second,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> That all Bailiffs Fees should be reprised: Both which are to be proved by the Warrants remaining with the Auditor of the Rates, and other Auditors; whereupon he presented these Considerations.</p>
               <p>First, That it was a mark of Ingratitude and Insatiableness in the Duke, thus to strain the Kings Bounty beyond his intention; and that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:35668:187"/>
he would not receive this Bounty by the ordinary way, but by the way of Practice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It argued Unfaithfulness in him, that being a sworne Counsellor, he should put the King into such Courses of so much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, deceitfully, in concealing the value of that which he bought; so that the King gave he knew not what; For under the proportion of Two thousand pounds, he gives it may be Four thousand pounds. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by this the King did not only sustain great loss for the present, but it opened a way of continual loss, which hath ever since been pursued by all those who have passed Lands from the Crown.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <p>Thirdly, The King is hereby not left Master of his own Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, neither in proportion, nor certainty; for it might so fall out, that the Quantity passed from him, might be treble to that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  <hi>3. The third was,</hi> The Surrender of divers Parcels of these Lands back to the King, after he had held them some years, and taking others from the King in exchange. <hi>Where he noted,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the best of the Lands and most vendible being passed away, the worst lay upon the Kings hand; that if he shall have occasion to raise money by sale of Lands, that Course is not like to furnish him. Besides, that in the mean time betwixt the Grants and the Surrenders, opportunity was left to the Duke to cut down Woods, to infranchise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Copiholds, to make long Leases; and yet the old Rent remaining still, the Land may be surendred at the same value. Whether this have been practised, he could not affirm, not having had time to examine it; yet he desired the Lords to enquire after it, the rather for that the Manor of <hi>G.</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> being dismembred, and Seventeen pounds of the old Rents sold out of it, was by a Surrender turned back upon his Majesty.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
4. The fourth point of this Branch was, The colourable Tallies divers parcels of these Lands had from the Crown in lieu of this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, being sold and contracted for by his own Agent, and the money received by himself or to his use, and yet Tallies were stricken out, as if it had really come to the Exchequer for his Majesties service. This is to be proved by his own Officers, by the Officers of the Exchequer, and by the Tallies themselves, which Tallies amount unto 20563 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> Whence he observed,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
First, That there ran a trade of Falshood toward the King through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all this his dealing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this was a Device thought upon to prevent the wisdom of Parliament; for by this means the Grant seems to have the face of valuable purchases, whereas they were indeed free gifts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the Title of those Lands should prove questionable, it appearing by Record as if the King had received the money, he was bound in honor to make restitution, and yet the Duke had the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> profit.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, This was the Purchasors desire for their own security. Of which objection he made this use, That the Subjects generally took notice of so much Lands given to the Duke, that there is good cause <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> expect a Resumption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:35668:188"/>
In the second general branch of this Article concerning Money, the first point observed was, the Total sum received by him in Ten years space, amounting to 162995 <hi>l.</hi> besides the Grant he hath of the Overplus above Three thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to be made of the Third imposed upon Strangers goods, and besides the Moyetie of Seven thousand pounds out of the Customs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he is bound to pay to the King; but whether it hath been paid, or no, is doubtful.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               </p>
               <p>This he delivered as a Sum Estimative, yet so computed as it may be more, but not less. And this Total ariseth by free gifts, by Pensions to himself; else by profit of Farms, by Pensions to others; For Offices, whereof he received the profit, as the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and <hi>Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Horse.</hi> All which appear by a Schedule annexed to this Charge.</p>
               <p>The Grievances consist in this; That the Commonwealth hath been bereaved of the use and imployment of so Publick Treasure, in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> time of as great want, and great occasions in this State, as it hath had in many Ages, when the expences of the Kings Court can hardly be supplied, when his Houses and Castles are unfurnished, when the Seas have been unguarded, the Coasts subject to the incursion and spoil of Enemies by default of provision in the Navy, to the dishonor of the Nation, and damage of the Subjects, and the hazard of the whole. And the offence in this, that the wants in the Navy and the Stores being within his own Charge, he was no more sensible of them; whereby it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> appears, he preferred the serving of his own turn before his duty, and before the safety of this State.</p>
               <p>The second point observed in this branch, was, That the Duke under pretence of secret services, hath procured great sums of money to be issued by Privy-seals to sundry persons named by himself, but afterward imployed to his own use. Hereof two instances are propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The one of Eight thousand pounds paid to Sir <hi>Robert Pye,</hi> 12 <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 1620. and by him disbursed for the Dukes purchase of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Pye</hi> discharged by another Privy-seal, 4 <hi>Iunii</hi> following. The second instance is of Sixty thousand pounds paid to <hi>Burlimach</hi> by a Privy-seal, in <hi>September</hi> 1625. Which time he rather noted, because the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> was broken up a little before out of discontent that the King was not supplied for the setting out of the Fleet, which would have been done with a less sum. For the proof of that, the House of Commons will offer to your Lordships Witnesses.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               </p>
               <p>The quality of this offence he left to their Lordships judgment; yet propounding some things by way of enquiry, from whence it might receive measure and proportion. 1. Whether it had not affinity with the Crime in the Civil Law, called <hi>Crimen peculatus</hi>; which was, when a man did unjustly turn to his own use that money which was either <hi>sacra,</hi> dedicated to Gods service religiously; or <hi>religiosa,</hi> used about Funerals and Monuments of the dead; or <hi>publica,</hi> of which kind the matter now in question is? And this offence by that Law was Death, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of goods and estate. Which he notes the rather, that their Lordships might perceive, that in the wisest State the Publick Treasure was held in the same reputation with that which was dedicated to God and Religion. 2. And whether it doth not resemble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> other Crime in the same Law termed <hi>Crimen falsi,</hi> and is defined to be when a man shall
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:35668:188"/>
                  <hi>imitatione veri suum compendium alieno dispendio per dolum facere,</hi> by semblance of truth make gain to himself of other mens losses: Which in the case of a Bondman was Death, and in case of another man Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Confiscation, or otherwise very penal, as the Judges should find cause of moderation, or rigor, in the nature and circumstances of the Fact. 3. Whether their Lordships will estimate it according to any Sentences in the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> which have been very frequent in cases <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Fraud: Or according to the Common-Law, which so much detests this kind of dealing, as that they term it <hi>Covin,</hi> and make it vitiate ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and lawful actions. Or lastly, whether they will measure it by that Judgment which the Duke hath pass'd against himself in the guilt of his own Conscience? (Direct Actions are not afraid to appear open-faced; but Injustice and Fraud desire to be masked with Subtilty and Closeness.) It were offence enough, if there were no more but a cunning concealing of unthankfulness to hide his Majesties bounty, or guilt of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> unworthiness, as if he durst not avow the receit of that which he had not merited; both which proceed from <hi>Malum culpae</hi>: Or else that other kind of guilt which proceeds from <hi>Malum poenae,</hi> the fear of punishment, foreseeing this Inquisition into his actions, and hoping under this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise of Publick service to escape their Lordships censure.</p>
               <p>The third point in this branch is, That he hath received sundry sums of money intended for the maintenance of the Navy: whereof there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are two instances; the one whereof is 20000 <hi>l.</hi> the other of 30000 <hi>l.</hi> both in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1624. By Privy-seal, by the which these sums are issued, they appear to be Free gifts: But by the affirmation of some in answer for the Duke, it hath been said, He was only the hand to convey them to the Treasury of the Navy. If the truth be according to the Privy-seal, they are to be added to the former Total as parcel of his own gain: If according to that allegation, it may prove a president of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er damage to the King, then the money is worth; for by this way his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Majesty hath no means by matter of Record to charge the Treasurer of the Navy with these sums, and may lose the benefit of the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> whereby Accomptants Lands are made liable to the paiment of their Debts to the King, and in many cases may be sold for his Majesties satisfaction. The Treasurer of the Navy is a worthy man; but if he should die, the King loseth the benefit.</p>
               <p>The fourth point of this branch is, That he hath caused so great a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mixture and confusion between the Kings Estate and his own, that they cannot be distinguished by the Records and Entries which ought to be kept for the safety of his Majesties Treasure, and indempnity of the Subject. This is proved in divers instances, whereof the last alleaged is one, and others follow.</p>
               <p>By the wisdom of the Law in the constitution of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> there be three Guards set upon the Kings Treasure and Accompts. The first is a legal Impignoration, whereby the Estates personal and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> real of the Accomptants are made liable to be sold for the discharge of their Debts, which I mentioned before. The second, an apt Control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over every Office; by which the King relies not upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry and honesty of any one man; but if he fail in either, it may be discovered by some other sworne to take notice of it, and either to correct his Errors, or amend his Faults. The third is, a durable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:35668:189"/>
and Certainty, not for the present time only, but for perpetuity; because the King can neither receive, or pay, but by Record.</p>
               <p>All these Guards have been broken by the Duke, both in the Cases next before recited, and in these which follow. The Custom of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> is the Law of the Kingdom, for so much as concerneth the Kings Revenue. Every breach of a Law by a particular offence, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable; but such an offence as this, being destructive of the Law it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, is of a far higher nature.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth point of this second branch, is concerning two Privy-seals of Release; the one 16, the other 20 <hi>Iac.</hi> whereby this Duke is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of divers sums secretly received to his Majesties use, but by vertue of these Releases to be converted to the support of his own Estate: The proof hereof is referred to the Privy-seals themselves. From which he made one observation, of the subtilty he used to winde himself into the possession of the Kings money, and to get that by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> cunning steps and degrees, which peradventure he could not have obtained at once. A good Master will trust a Servant with a greater sum that is out of his purse, then he would bestow upon him being in his purse; and yet after it is out of his hands, may be drawn more easily to make a Release, then at first to have made a Free gift. This is a proper instance to be added to the proof of the point of mingling his own Estate with the Kings; and of the same kind be other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars mentioned in the Schedule, though not expressed in the Charge; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as Twenty thousand pounds received in Composition for the Earl of <hi>M.</hi> his Fine, which cannot be discovered whether part or all be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Dukes benefit, and yet it appears by a Privy-seal to be cleerly intended to the Kings own service for the Houshold and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drobe, till by the Dukes practice it was diverted into this close and by-way.</p>
               <p>Another instance in this, is, His endeavor to get the money which should be made of Prize-goods into his own hands: And for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this purpose, he first labored to procure that his man <hi>Gabriel Marsh</hi> might receive it; and when it was thought fit some Partner should be joined with him, trial was made of divers, but none of any credit would undertake the Charge with such a Consort. And the Commons have reason to think there was good cause of this refusal; for he is so ill an Accomptant, that he confessed in their House (being examined) that by authority from the Duke he received divers bags of gold and silver out of the <hi>S. Peter</hi> of <hi>Newhaven,</hi> which he never told.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               </p>
               <p>When this practice of imploying his own man would take no effect, then he procured a Commission from Sir <hi>William Russell,</hi> who is indeed without exception an able and worthy Officer; but that is not enough for the Kings security; For howsoever he was to receive the money, it was to be disbursed by and to the Dukes warrant and profit. Which Clause hath been altered since this was questioned in Parliament; and now it is to be issued from an immediate Warrant from his Majesty: But as it was before, it may be noted as an incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> upon the Office of my Lord Treasurer, whereby he might make a more easie way to some sinister end of his own; so that upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Sir <hi>William</hi> was but a safeguard of the money for the Duke himself. And this I must note of some guilt in the very act of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:35668:189"/>
The last point upon this whole Charge, was a reduction of the value of the Land, together with the mony into one totall, and to that purpose, he rated the Land, being valued at a reasonable value, at forty years purchase, for although some of it was sold for thirty, yet a great part was worth more then a hundred years purchase, so as forty years is conceived to be an easy <hi>Medium</hi>; at this rate 3035 <hi>l.</hi> amounteth to 121400 <hi>l.</hi> which being added to the total of the mony received 162995 <hi>l.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> both together make the sum of 284395 <hi>l.</hi> besides the Forrest of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild,</hi> and besides the profit made out of the thirds of Strangers goods, and the Moyetie of the profit made out of the Customes of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a great sum in it self, but much greater by many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; if we look upon the time past, never so much came into any private mans hands out of the publique purse; if we respect the time present, the King never had so much want, never so many forreign oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> important and expensive; the Subjects never have given great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er supplies, and yet those supplies unable to furnish these expences. But as the Circumstances make the sum greater, so there be other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances which make it less, if it be compared with the inestimable gain he hath made by the sale of Honors and Offices, and by projects hurtfull to the State, both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; or if it be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his profusion, it will appear but a little sum. All these gifts, and other ways of profit notwithstanding, he confest before both Houses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Parliament, that he was indebted 100000 <hi>l.</hi> If this be true, how can we hope to satisfie his prodigality? if false, how can we hope to satisfie his Covetousness? and therefore their Lordships need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the Commons desire, and that earnestly, to be delivered from such a Grievance.</p>
               <p>That this complaint and proceedings of theirs may appear to be suitable to the proceedings of their Predecessors in like Cases; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged three Presidents, which he said were Presidents in kinde, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not in proportion, because there hath never been the like.</p>
               <p>The first 10 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. in the Complaint against <hi>Michael de la Pool,</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi>; out of which he took Three Articles, the first, That being Chancellor and sworn to the Kings profit, he had purchased divers Lands from the King, more then he had deserved, and at an under rate; yet this was thought to be an offence against the State.</p>
               <p>The second, That he had bought of one <hi>Tydman</hi> an Annuity of Five hundred pound <hi>per annum</hi>; which Grant was void by the Laws, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> yet he being Chancellor, procured the King to make it good by a new Grant upon Surrender of the old. This was complained of in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there punished.</p>
               <p>The third, Whereas the Master of St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> being a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, had forfeited his Possessions into the Kings hand; this Earl took them in Farm at Twenty Marks a year, converting the overplus which was One thousand Marks to his own profit, which should have come to the King.</p>
               <p>The next President II <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. in the Judgment against <hi>Robert de Vere</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and others; out of which, he took two Articles, the Fifth and the Seventh: The Fifth was for taking Mannors and Lands annexed to the Crown, whereby they themselves were inriched, and the King made poor; the Seventh was for intercepting the Subsidies grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the defence of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:35668:190"/>
The third President is that of 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. in the Parliament Roll, out of the Complaint against <hi>William de la Pool,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Article 29. That he being next and primest of Council to the King, he had procured him to grant great Possessions to divers persons, whereby the King was much impoverished, the expence of his House unpaid, Wages, Wardrobe, Castles, Navy, Debts unsatisfied; and so by his subtile Council, and unprofitable Labor, the Revenues of the Crown and the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and other the Kings Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> so much diminished, and the Commons of the Kingdom so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly charged, that it was near to a final destruction.</p>
               <p>The fourth was, That the Kings Treasure was mischievously distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to himself, his friends, and well-willers; so that for lack of Money, no Army, nor Ordnance could be provided in time; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these great persons were not brought to judgment upon these Articles alone, but for other misdemeanors, he made this observation, That ravening upon the Kings Estate is always accounted with other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> great faults that deserve judgment.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then he said he had done with that which had been left to him; and so he left the Duke to their Lordships Justice, That as he had exceeded others in this Offence, so he might not come behinde them in punishment. And so he humbly desired their Lordships to be pleased to pardon his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, and to give a favorable censure of him.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            <p>Lastly, The Thirteenth Article was read.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Whereas especial care and order hath been taken by the Laws of the Realm, to restrain and prevent the unskilful Administration of Physick, whereby the health and life of men may be much endangered. And whereas most especially, the Royal Persons of the Kings of the Realm, in whom, we their Loyal Subjects, humbly challenge a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, are and always have been esteemed by us so sacred, that nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ought to be prepared for them, or administred unto them in the way of Physick or Dyet in the times of their sickness, without the consent and direction of some of their sworn Physitians, Apothecaries, or Surgeons. And the boldness of such (how near soever to them in place and favor) who have forgotten their Duties so far, as to presume to offer any thing unto them beyond their experience, hath been always ranked in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of high Offences and Misdemeanors. And whereas the sworn Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians of our late Soveraign Lord King <hi>Iames</hi> of Blessed memory, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> on his Majesty in the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> in the Two and twentieth year of his most glorious Raign, in the times of his sickness, being an Ague, did in due and necessary care of, and for the recovery of his health and preservation of his Person, upon and after several mature Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in that behalf had and holden, at several times in the same moneth, resolve and give directions, That nothing should be applied or given unto his Highness, by way of Physick or Dyet, during his said sickness, but by and upon their general advice and consents, and after good delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thereof first had, more especially by their like care, and upon like consultations; did justly resolve and publickly give warning to and for all the Gentlemen, and other Servants and Officers of his said late Majesties Bed-chamber, That no Meat nor Drink whatsoever should be given unto him, within two or three hours next before the usual time of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:35668:190"/>
and for the coming of his Fit in the said Ague, nor during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, nor afterwards, until his cold Fit were past. The said Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> being a sworn Servant of his said late Majesty, of and in his Majesties said Bed-chamber, contrary to his duty and the tender respect which he ought to have had of his Majesties most Sacred Person; and after the Consultations, Resolutions, Directions, and Warning aforesaid, did nevertheless without any sufficient warrant in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> unduly cause and procure certain Plaisters, and a certain Drink or Potion to be provided for the use of his said Majesty, without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or privity of his said late Majesties Physitians, not prepared by any of his Majesties sworn Apothecaries or Chirurgeons, but compounded of several ingredients to them unknown. Notwithstanding the same Plaisters, or some Plaister like thereunto, having been formerly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred unto his said Majesty, did produce such ill effects, as that some of the said sworn Physitians did altogether disallow thereof, and utterly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> refused to meddle any further with his said Majesty, until these Plaisters were removed, as being hurtful and prejudicial to the health of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; yet nevertheless the same Plaisters, as also a Drink or Potion, was provided by him the said Duke; which he the said Duke, by colour of some insufficient and slight pretences, did upon Monday the One and twentieth day of <hi>March,</hi> in the Two and twentieth year aforesaid, when his Majesty by the judgment of his said Physitians, was in the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Disease, cause and procure the said Plaisters to be applied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the Brest and Wrists of his said late Majesty. And then also at and in his Majesties Fit of the said Ague, the said Munday, and at several times within two hours before the coming of the same Fit, and before his Majesties then cold Fit was passed, did deliver, and cause to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, several quantities of the said Drink or Potion to his said late Majesty; who thereupon at the same times, within the seasons in that behalf prohibited by his Majesties Physitians as aforesaid, did by the means and procurement of the said Duke, drink and take divers quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the said Drink or Potion.</p>
            <p>After which said Plaisters, and Drink or Potion, applied and given unto, and taken and received by his said Majesty as aforesaid, great distempers and divers ill symptoms appeared upon his said Majesty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, That the said Physitians finding his Majesty the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much worse in the estate of his health, and holding a Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereabout, did by joynt consent send to the said Duke, praying him not to adventure to minister to his Majesty any more Physick, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> without their allowance and approbation. And his said Majesty himself finding himself much diseased and affected with pain and sickness, after his then fit, when by the course of his Disease he expected intermission and ease, did attribute the cause of such his trouble unto the said Plaister and Drink, which the said Duke had so given, and caused to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred unto him. Which said adventrous act by a person obliged in duty and thankfulness, done to the Person of so great a King, after so ill success of the like formerly administred, contrary to such Directions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as aforesaid, and accompanied with so unhappy event, to the great grief and discomfort of all his Majesties Subjects in general, is an Offence and Misdemeanor of so high a nature, as may justly be called, and is by the said Commons deemed to be an act of transcendent presumption, and of dangerous consequence.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Article enlarged by Mr. <hi>Wandes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
               </note>Mr. <hi>Wandesford</hi> deputed to enlarge and aggravate upon the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Article, commended the charity and providence of that Law, which makes it penal for unskilful Empyricks, and all others, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and practice Physick upon common persons, without a lawful Calling and Approbation, branding them that thus transgress, as <hi>Improbos, Ambitiosos, Temerarios, &amp; Audaces homines:</hi> But he that without skill and calling shall direct a Medicine, which upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> same person had wrought bad effects, enough to have disswaded a second adventure; and then when Physitians were present, Physitians selected for Learning and Art, prepared by their Office and Oaths, without their consent, nay, even contrary to their Direction, and in a time unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, He must needs (said he) be guilty, albeit towards a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a precipitate and unadvised rashness, much more towards his own Soveraign. And so pious are our selves to put the Subjects in minde of their duty towards their Princes, Persons so Sacred, that in the attempt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of a Madman upon the King, his want of Reason, which towards any of his fellow Subjects might have quit him of Felony, shall not excuse him of Treason. And how wary and advised our Ancestors have been not to apply things in this kinde to the Person of a King, may appear by a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, 32 <hi>Hen</hi> 6. where <hi>Iohn Arundel,</hi> and others, the Kings Physitians and Chirurgeons, thought it not safe for them to administer any thing to the Kings Person, without the assent of the Privy Council first obtained, and express Licence under the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>This Medicine found his Majesty in the declination of his desease, (and we all wish it had left him so) but his better days were shortly turned into worse; and instead of health and recovery, we hear by good testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (that which troubles the poor and loyal Commons of <hi>England</hi>) of great distempers, as Droughts, Raving, Fainting, an intermitting Pulse, strange effects to follow upon the applying of a Treacle Plaister. But the truth is, Testimony tells us, That this Plaister had a strange smell, and an invective quality striking the malignity of the disease inward; which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Nature otherwise might have expelled outward. Adde to this the Drink twice given to his Majesty, by the Duke his own hands, and a third time refused, and the following Complaint of that blessed Prince, the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians telling him, to please him for the time, That his second impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was from cold taken, or some other ordinary cause: <hi>No, no,</hi> said his Majesty, <hi>it is that which I had from Buckingham.</hi> And though there be no President (said he) of an act offered to the Person of a King, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent as this, yet is it true that divers persons, as great as this, have been questioned and condemned for less offences against the Person of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their Soveraign. It was an Article amongst others laid against the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> for carrying <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth away in the night time out of his own head but from <hi>Hampton</hi> Court to <hi>Windsor</hi>; and yet he was trusted with the Protection of his person: Presidents failing us in this point, the Common Law will supply us. The Law judgeth a deed done in the execution of an unlawful act, Man-slaughter, which otherwise would but have been Chance-medley; and that this act was unlawful, the House of Commons do believe, as belonging to the Duty and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of a sworn and experimented Physitian, and not the unskilfulness of a yong Lord. And so pretious are the lives of men in the Eye of the Law, that though Mr. <hi>Stanford</hi> saith, If a Physitian take one into his Cure, and he die under his hands; it is not Felony, because he did it
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:35668:191"/>
not Feloniously. Yet it is Mr. <hi>Bractons</hi> opinion, That if one that is no Physitian or Chirurgeon undertake a Cure, and the party die under his hands, this is Felony. And the Law goeth further, making Physitians and Chirurgeons themselves accomptable for the Death of their Patients, if it appear they have transgressed the Rules of their own Art; that is, by undertaking a thing wherein they have no experience, or having yet failed in the care and diligence.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Lastly, He said he was commanded by the House of Commons to desire their Lordships, That seeing the Duke hath made himself a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in committing that which former Ages knew not, their Lordships will out of their Wisdom and Justice make him an example for the time to come.</p>

                        <p>Your Lordships have heard how his Ambition was expressed in procuring, and getting into his hands, the greatest Offices of strength and power of this Kingdom; by what means he had attained them; and how Money stood for Merit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> There needs no Argument to prove this but the common sense of the Miseries and Misfortunes which we suffer, adding but one, The Regality of our Narrow Seas, the Antient Inheritance of our Princes, lost or impeached.</p>
                        <p>This I need not further to press, but from hence my Observation must descend to his other Virtues, and that by way of Perspective: I shall give it so near and short, as rather to exercise your Lordships Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, then to oppress your patience.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> First, I propose unto your Lordships, the inward Character of the Dukes minde, which is full of Collusion and Deceipt, I can express it no better then by the Beast called by the Antients <hi>Stellionatus</hi>; a Beast so blur'd, so spotted, so full of foul lines, that they knew not what to make of it: So do we finde in this mans practice, who first inveagled the Merchants, drawing them to <hi>Deep</hi> to be inchralled; then dealt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully with the King, to colour his Offences, his design being against <hi>Rochel,</hi> and the Religion: Next with the Parliament, to disguise his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Actions, a practice no less dangerous and disadvantageous to us, then prejudicial to our Friends and Allies.</p>
                        <p>Next I present to your Lordships, the Dukes high oppression, and that of strange latitude and extent, not to Men alone, but to Laws and Statutes, to Acts of Council, to Pleas and Decrees of Court, to the pleasure of his Majesty; all must stoop to him, if they oppose or stand
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:35668:192"/>
in his way. This hath been expressed unto you in the Ship called the St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and those of <hi>Deep,</hi> nay, he draws on the colour of his Majesties great Name to shadow his design.</p>
                        <p>It had been his duty, nay, the trust of his place, not to have translated them into the hands of strangers; that had his Majesty yeilded in that point, the Duke should have opposed it by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Prayers and Intercessions, making known unto his Majesty the Inconveniencies likely to ensue, and not to rest there, but to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it to your Lordships sitting in Council, to have desired and prayed your aid and assistance, in a matter of so great importance: And if this had failed, he should have entered into a Protestation against it. This hath been done by worthy Predecessors in that Office, and this had been the worthy discharge of the great trust reposed in his place.</p>
                        <p>I heard the Ships were returned, but I know it not; but if I knew so, this neither excuseth, nor qualifieth the Dukes offence.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The French in this case are to be commended, not he excused; he left them in the hands of a Foreign Power, who when they once had them, for any thing he knew, might easily have kept them.</p>

All which particulars your Lordships have heard opened and enforced with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Proofs, what in themselves they are, and therefore I spare fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to press them.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth place, I observe a wonder in Policy and in Nature, how this man so notorious in evil, so dangerous to the State in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense greatness, is able to subsist of himself, and keep a Being? To this I answer, That the Duke hath used the help of art to prop him up: It was apparent, That by his skill he hath raised a party in the Court, a party in the Country, and a main party in the cheif places of Government in the Kingdom: So that all the most deserving Offices <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that require Abilities to discharge them, are fixed upon the Duke, his Allies, and Kinred. And thus he hath drawn to him and his, the Power of Justice, the Power of Honor, and the Power of Command, and in effect the whole Power of the Kingdom, both for Peace and War, to strengthen his Allies; and in setting up himself, hath set upon the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:35668:192"/>
Kingdoms Revenues, the Fountain of Supply, and the Nerves of the Land.</p>
                        <p>He intercepts, consumes, and exhausts the Revenues of the Crown, not onely to satisfie his own lustful desires, but the Luxury of others; and by emptying the Veins the Blood should run in, he hath cast the Body of the Kingdom into a high Consumption.</p>
                        <p>Infinite sums of Money, and mass of Land, exceeding the value <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Money, Contributions in Parliament have been heaped upon him, and how have they been employed? Upon costly Furniture, sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Feasting, and magnificent Building, the visible evidences of the express exhausting of the State; and yet his Ambition, which is boundless, resteth not here, but like a violent flame bursteth forth, and getteth further scope: Not satisfied with injuries, and injustice, and dishonoring of Religion, his attempts go higher, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his Soveraign, which is plain in his practice. The effects <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> I fear to speak, and fear to think, I end this passage as <hi>Cicero</hi> did in a like case, <q>
                              <hi>Ne gravioribus utar verbis quam rei natura fert, aut levioribus quam causae necessitas postulat</hi>
                           </q>.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordships have an <hi>Idea</hi> of the Man, what he is in himself, what in his affections. You have seen his power, and some I fear have felt it; you have known his practice, and have heard the effects. It rests then to be considered, what (being such) he is in reference to the King and State? how compatible or incompatible with either? In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the King, he may be stiled the Canker in his Treasure; in reference to the State, the Moth of all goodness. What future hopes are to be expected, your Lordships may draw out of his Actions and Affections. I will now see by comparison with others, to what we may finde him likened. I can hardly finde him a match or parallel in all Presidents; none so like him as <hi>Sejanus,</hi> who is thus described by <q>
                              <hi>

For his secret Intentions and Calumniations, I wish this Parliament had not felt them, nor the other before. For his Pride and Flattery, it is noted of <hi>Sejanus</hi> that he did <hi>Clientes suos Provinciis adornare.</hi> Doth not this Man the like? Ask <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and they will tell you. <hi>Sejanus</hi> pride was so excessive, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> saith, he neglected all Councel, mixed his businesses and service with the Prince, seeming to confound their Actions, and was often stiled <hi>Imperatoris laborum socius.</hi> How lately, and how often hath this Man commixed his Actions in Discourses with ACtions of the Kings?</p>
                        <p>My Lords, I have done, you see the Man; onely this which was conceived by the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, should be boldly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by me spoken, That by him came all these evils, in him we finde the Cause, and on him we expect the Remedies, and to this we met your Lordships in Conference; to which, as your Wisdom invites us, so we cannot doubt, but in your Lordships Wisdom, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Power, we shall in due time finde Judgment as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.</p>

I conclude by presenting to your Lordships, the particular Censure of the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> reported in the 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 1. and to give you a short view of his faults. He was first of all noted to be Luxurious; secondly, He married his own Kinred to Personages of highest rank and places; thirdly, No mans business was done without his help; fourthly, He would not suffer the Kings Council to advise in Matters of State; fifthly, He grew to such a height of Pride, that no man was thought worthy to speak unto him; and lastly, His Castles and Forts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Trust, he did <hi>obscuris &amp; ignotis hominibus tradere</hi>; his doom was this, <hi>Per totam insulam publicè proclamatur, periat qui perdere cuncta festinat, opprimatur ne omnes opprimat.</hi>

                           <p>That since the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, these Parliamentary discoursings might never be suffered, as being but certain symptomes of Subsequent Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Civil Wars, and the dethroning of our King, and no one Patriot daring to oppose them, least he incur the reputation of a Fool or Coward in his Countreys <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Cause.</p>
                           <p>His Majesty therefore strengthned himself ever with some Favorite, as whom he might better trust, then many of the Nobility, tainted with this desire of Oligarchy,</p>
                           <p>It behoveth without doubt his Majesty to uphold the Duke against them, who if he be but decourted, it will be the Corner Stone, on which the demolishing of his Monarchy will be builded: For if they prevail with this, they have hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thousand other demands to pull the Feathers of Royalty.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

And all these, though actions of the King, are imputed to the Duke: Who if he suffer for obeying his Soveraign, the next attempt will be to call the King to accompt for any thing he undertakes, which doth not prosperously succeed, as all men would desire it.</p>
                           <p>If it please his Majesty to remove and set aside all these disadvantages, he shall find the Charge against the Duke very empty and of small moment: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And if his Majesty and the Dukes Grace think it no impeachment to their Honors, all that the Parliament hath objected against the Duke, except two or three things that may receive an Answer, is pardoned at the Kings Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which benefit every poor Subject enjoyeth.</p>

I may very fitly compare the heaviness of this House unto some of my misfortunes by Sea in my Travels: For as we were bound unto <hi>Marseillis,</hi> by oversight of the Mariners we mistook our Course, and by ill fortune met with a Sand; That was no sooner overpast, but we fell on another; and having escaped this likewise, we met with a third, and in that we stuck fast.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> All of the Passengers being much dismaied by this disaster, as now we are here in this House for the loss of those two Members: At last an old experienced Mariner upon consultation affirmed, That the speediest way to come out from the Sands, was to know how we came there; So well looking and beholding the Compass, he found
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:35668:194"/>
by going in upon such a point we were brought into that streight; wherefore we must take a new point to rectifie and bring us out of danger.</p>
                        <p>This House of Parliament may be compared to the Ship; the Sands, to our Messages; and the Commitment, to the Sands that the Ship did stick fast in; and lastly the Compass, to the Table where the Book of Orders doth lie. Then I beseech you, let us look into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Book where the Orders are, whether the Gentlemen did go no further then the Order did warrant them. If they did not, it is fit that we should defend them whom we imployed in our behests: But if they have exceeded their Commission, and delivered that which they had not warrant for, it is just that we let them suffer for this presumption; and this our Course will bring us from these Rocks.</p>
                        <p>I beseech you Gentlemen, move not his Majesty with trenching upon his Prerogatives, lest you bring him out of love with Parliaments. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> You have heard his Majesties often Messages to you, to put you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in a Course that will be most convenient. In those Messages he told you, That if there were not Correspondencie between him and you, he should be inforced to use new Counsels. Now I pray you consider what these new Counsels are, and may be: I fear to declare those that I conceive. In all Christian Kingdoms you know that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were in use antiently, by which their Kingdoms were governed in a most flourishing manner; until the Monarchs began to know their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> own strength, and seeing the turbulent spirit of their Parliaments, at length they by little and little began to stand upon their Prerogatives, and at last overthrew the Parliaments throughout Christendom, except here only with us.</p>
                        <p>And indeed you would count it a great misery, if you knew the Subject in Foreign Countries as well as my self; to see them look not like our Nation, with store of flesh on their backs, but like so many Ghosts, and not men, being nothing but skin and bones, with some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thin cover to their nakedness, and wearing only woodden shoos on their feet; so that they cannot eat meat, or wear good clothes, but they must pay and be taxed unto the King for it. This is a misery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expression, and that which yet we are free from: Let us be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then to preserve the Kings good opinion of Parliaments, which bringeth this happiness to this Nation, and makes us envied of all others, while there is this sweetness between his Majesty and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; lest we lose repute of a Free-born Nation, by our turbulencie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in Parliament. For in my opinion, the greatest and wisest part of a Parliament are those that use the greatest silence, so as it be not opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niotory, or sullen, as now we are by the loss of these our Members that are committed.</p>
                        <p>This good Correspondencie being kept between the King and his people, will so join their love and favor to his Majesty with liking of Parliaments, that his Prerogative shall be preserved entire to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self without our trenching upon it; and also the Priviledge of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (which is our happiness) inviolated, and both be maintained to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the support of each other. And I told you, if you would hear me pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, I would tell you what exception his Majesty doth take at those Gentlemen that are committed. You know that Eight Members were chosen to deliver the Charge against the Duke, but there were only Six imployed for that purpose; insomuch that there was no Exception.</p>

As for Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs</hi> his part, that was the Prologue, and in that his Majesty doth conceive that he went too far beyond his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, in pressing the death of his ever blessed Father in these words, That he was commanded by the House, concerning the Plaister applied to the King, <hi>That he did forbear to speak further in regard of the Kings Honor,</hi> or words to that effect; this his Majesty conceiveth to be to his dishonor, as if there had been any underhand dealing by his Majesty, in applying of the Plaister, and this may make his Subjects jealous of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> doings: In this Point his Majesty is assured, that the House did not warrant him. Now for that which is excepted against Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot,</hi> his over bitterness in the Aggravation upon the whole Charge, and specially upon some of the heads of it: For if you please to remember, when I moved for putting of the St <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Newhaven</hi> out of the Charge against the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and shewed my reasons for that purpose, you know how tender Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot</hi> was of it, as if he had been a child of his own, and so carefull in the handling thereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by a Stranger, that he would not suffer it to be touched, though with never so tender a hand, for fear it might prove a Changeling: which did manifest, how specious soever his pretences were, that he had <hi>occulum in Cauda</hi>: And I must confess, I was heartily sorry when he delivered his Aggravation to the Lords, to see his Tartness against the Duke; when as he had occasion to name him, he onely gave him this Title of <hi>This man,</hi> and <hi>The man</hi>; whereas the other observed more respect and modesty in their Charges against so great a Person as the Duke is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> considering that then he was not convicted, but stood <hi>rectus in Curia.</hi> Lastly, for pressing the death of his late Majesty, you know that the Sense of the House concluded, That it is only an Act of Presumption; nay, some of them expresly said, <hi>Nay God forbid that I should lay the death of the King to his Charge.</hi> If he without warrant from the House in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon the Composition of the Plaister, as if there were <hi>Aliquid latet quod non patet</hi>; This was beyond his Commission from our House, and this is that which his Majesty doth except against; And this I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> say drew his Majesty, with other insolent Invectives, to use his Regal authority in committing them to the <hi>Tower.</hi>

            <p>The Lord President affirmed, That he had reported the words in the same sence they were delivered unto him by the party himself, and though the connexion of them require to be explained, yet he agreed with the rest of the Lords, for the Parties good meaning, and made the same Protestation.</p>

            <p>And because the Committee appointed yesterday to search for Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had not yet made any Report to the House; therefore the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> directions for this business were suspended for that time.</p>
            <p>Not long after the Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi> made report to the House, That the Lords Committees for Priviledges met on Monday last; The first Question that arose amongst them was, Whether those Proxies were of any validity which are deputed to any Peer, who sitteth not himself in Parliament? And it was conceived that those Votes were lost: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Committee found this House to be deprived of five suffrages by the absence of the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> unto whom they were intrusted:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And the Committee finding by the Journal Book, that the Sub-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee which was appointed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Lords resolved to maintain their priviledges.</note>Hereupon the House was moved to give power to the Lords Sub-Committees for Priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to proceed in the search of Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Commitment of a Peer of this Realm during the time of Parliament; and that the Kings Council might shew them such Presidents as they have of the said Commitment; And that the said Sub-Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> may make the Report unto the House at the next access.</p>

            <p>Much about this time, Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> a Member of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> having spoken some words which seemed to reflect upon his Majesty, they were reported to the House, <hi>viz.</hi> That he said, <hi>We were born free, and must continue free, if the King will keep his Kingdom:</hi> Adding these words, <hi>Thanks be to God, we have no occasion to fear, having a just and pious King.</hi> The House for these words committed Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> to the Tower of <hi>London</hi>; And his Majesty shortly after sent a Message, That he had passed by his offence.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> While the Duke stood charged in the Parliament,<note place="margin">The Duke chosen Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> during his Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the Chancellorship of <hi>Cambridge</hi> became void by the death of the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who died on <hi>Whitsonday</hi> the 28. of <hi>May</hi> 1626. The University having understood by several hands, That it was the Kings express will and pleasure that the Duke should be chosen in his stead, were ambitious and forward to express their obedience to his Majesty in that behalf; well knowing, that in regard of their multitude, and worthy Judgment and wisdom, that is esteemed and ought to be in those Electors, this was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> one of the most honorable Testimonies of Worth and Integrity that the Nation can afford: And that whereas all other the Dukes Honors did but help the rather to sink him with their weight, this would seem to shoar and prop him up.</p>
            <p>Letters were pretended to be sent from his Majesty, to the intent to disencourage all opposers: But though the pretence of Letters served mainly to effect their ends, yet the producing of them would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced the chief intendment of the Election, namely the honor of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Testimony in it; which chiefly lying in the freedom of the Votes, had by Letters been cut off. Many Heads of Houses bestirr'd themselves according to their several power and interest in their respective Societies; and <hi>Trinity</hi>-Colledge alone (the Master whereof was Doctor <hi>Maw,</hi> one of the Kings Chaplains) supplied the Duke with Forty three Votes, the third part of those which served the turn, for he had in all One hundred and eight.</p>
            <p>He was chosen the Thursday following the death of his Predecessor, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> namely the fourth day after the Vacancie, notwithstanding fourteen days are allowed by the University-Statute. His chief strength consisted in the Doctors (whereof seventeen were for him, and onely one against him) and in the Non-Regents, who are Masters of Art of five years standing and upward: Among the Regents (who are Masters under five years) thirty more were against him then for him, and four whole Colledges
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:35668:201"/>
were entire against the Duke. For notwithstanding all the industry that could be imployed on his behalf, there was a Party so diligent and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that the same morning the Choice was made, they jointly pitch'd upon the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> second Son to the late deceased Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and Earl of <hi>Berkshire</hi>; though they had no Head appearing for him, nor one man in the Uniuersity that was known to have any reference to him, excepting one Mr. <hi>Granado Chester,</hi> who was either his Chaplain or otherwise interessed in him: And notwithstanding all disadvantages,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they lost it for the said Earl but by five Voices; for the Duke had but One hundred and eight, and the Earl had One hundred and three, besides that two of the Dukes were void by Statute, as being given to the Vice-Chancellor by compromise, to dispose of as he should think fit.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Berkshire</hi> being afterwards acquainted with the intentions of the University towards him, wrote this Letter to Mr. <hi>Chester,</hi> a Divine related to his Lordship.</p>

                        <p>IN a case of pressure considered by it self,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> Speech to the Lords House, before he gave in his Answer.</note> I have a fair beginning, it is a due debt to your Lordships for this Honorable Favor in leaving it to my choice, whether I would answer to the particulars in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Aggravation, or not. I may without lessening my Obligation say, The favor is greater at first, it may be yours, or your Posterities hereafter. I have in a manner tied my self to my charge, hoping if I give your Lordships satisfaction in that, the Aggravations will fall of themselves. I could not well have followed the Aggravations, being composed of words, which I hope my actions have not deserved; and I am sure my ears have not been made acquainted with, without some distraction of spirit; yet I have left nothing of them unanswered that is material. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> have used as much speed to come to an answer, as conveniently I could, without prejudice of my cause, having my Reputation too long upon the stage; and had your Lordships called for it sooner, I had been as ready as now I was desirous, to detain your Lordships as little as may be (with the expectation of my particular) from weightier business.</p>
                        <p>I was also grieved that my business should be a cause of the loss of this year from foreign attempts, and the hindrance of those resolutions that would have comforted our Friends abroad, and secured our selves at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> home: But in this, my Lords, I am sure you will easily acquit me in your thoughts. When I look upon my Charge in general (as they did) without searching into the integrity of mine own heart and actions, which are yet unknown to most of them, I wonder not so much at their proceedings, the particulars not being voted against me, nor unanimously; but had they taken the means to have been better and trulier informed of the particulars, or have given me cause to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them, I assure my self they had not troubled your Lordships <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with this Charge: But I confess there hath been that contestation in the House of Commons concerning my Justification, that I cannot but acknowledge much favor there from many. And if the actions of some others in that House, do not conclude me of a worse disposition then I shall hereafter be found, there is none but may say with me, <hi>I am at peace with all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I shall onely for the present, apply my self to the clearing of my Reputation, and for the future, of those actions and endeavors which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> may repossess me of that I have counted one of my greatest losses, their good opinions. I would not speak nor profess this before your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, if Reason and my own disposition did not warrant the performance of it.</p>
                        <p>For first, Who accused me? Common Fame. Who gave me up to your Lordships? The House of Commons.</p>
                        <p>The one is too subtile a Body, if a Body; the other too great for me to contest with; and I am confident, when my cause shall be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> tried, neither the one, or the other, or part of either, will be found to be my enemy.</p>
                        <p>But as Fame is subtle, so it is often and especially in accusations false; therefore the House of Commons have not wronged me: Yet I am confident it will at length be found, that Common Fame hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused both them and me.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="380" facs="tcp:35668:203"/>
I presume the House of Commons have proceeded against me out of an hearty and zealous affection, to do their King and Country ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I hope out of Christian Charity to punish and amend my faults (if fame could have proved them) and not to envy my Reputation, or destroy my Fortune. I shall never call such proceedings wrong, if seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cure my errors, give me opportunity to clear and publish my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency: For the State it self, I have little to say, it is but a little, I will not abuse your Lordships patience. I was born and bred in it, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ow it my self; I have been raised to Honors and Fortunes in it (I freely confess) beyond my Merits; what I wanted in sufficiency and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience for the service of it, I have endeavored to supply by care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</p>
                        <p>And could there be the least alienation hereafter in my heart from the service of the State, for any thing that hath past, I should be the ungratefullest man living; should but such a thought stain my heart, I should be content it were let blood. If my Posterity should not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the same fidelity, I should desire an inversion in the course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and be glad to see them earthed before me. My Answer to the several points in Charge, I shall crave leave to deliver in brief, and in form of Law, but as naked as truth loves to be; and so I leave my self and my cause to your Lordships Justice.</p>

                           <p>To the first,<note place="margin">His Charge touching Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> which concerneth Plurality of Offices which he hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he answereth thus, That it is true that he holdeth those several Places and Offices, which are enumerated in the preamble of his Charge, whereof onely three are worthy the name of Offices, <hi>viz.</hi> The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, the Wardenship of the Cinque Ports, and Mastership of the Horse; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the other are rather titulary and additions of Honor. For these Offices he humbly and freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> acknowledgeth the bounty and goodness of his most Gratious Master who is with God; who when he had cast an Eye of Favor upon him, and had taken him into a more near place of service about his Royal Person, was more willing to multiply his Graces and Favors upon him, then the Duke was forward to ask them; and for the most part (as many honorable persons, and his now most Excellent Majesty, above all others, can best testifie) did prevent the very desires of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Duke in asking: And all these particular places, he can and doth truly affirm, his late Majesty did bestow them of his own Royal motion (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Wardenship of the Cinque Ports onely) and thereto also he gave his approbation and encouragement.</p>
                           <p>And the Duke denieth, that he obtained these places, either to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his exorbitant ambition, or his own profit or advantage, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against him: And he hopeth he shall give good satisfaction to the contrary in his particular Answers ensuing, touching the manner of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> obtaining the places of the Admiralty, and the Wardenship of the Cinque Ports, whereunto he humbly desireth to refer himself. And for the Mastership of the Horse to his Majesty, he saith it is a meer domestick office of attendance upon the Kings person, whereby he receiveth some profit; yet but as a conveniency to render him more sit for his continual attendance; and in that place, the times compared, he hath retrenched the Kings annual charge to a considerable value, as shall be made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And for the number of places he holdeth, he saith, That if the Commonwealth doth not suffer thereby, he hopeth he may without blame, receive and retain that, which the liberal and bountiful hand of his Master hath freely conferred upon him: And it is not without many Presidents, both in Antient and Modern times, That one man eminent in the esteem of his Soveraign, hath at one time held as great and as many Offices: But when it shall be discerned, That he shall falsly or corruptly execute those places, or any of them, or that the Publick shall suffer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thereby; he is so thankful for what he hath freely received, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever his Gratious Master shall require it, without disputing with his Soveraign, he will readily lay down at his Royal Feet, not onely his Places and Offices, but his whole Fortunes and his life, to do him service.</p>
                           <p>But the integrity of his own Heart and Conscience, being the most able and most impartial witnesses, not accusing him of the least thought of disloyalty to his Soveraign, or to his Country, doth raise his spirits again to make his just defence before your Lordships, of whose Wisdom, Justice, and Honor, he is so well assured, That he doth with confidence, and yet with all humbleness submit himself and his cause to your Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and Judgments, before whom he shall with all sincerity and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, unfold and lay open the secrets of his own actions, and of his heart; and in his Answer shall not affirm the least Substantial, and as near as he can the least Circumstantial point, which he doth not believe he shall clearly prove before your Lordships.</p>

                              <note place="margin">His Charge touching his buying the Admirals place.</note>That it is true, that in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the Sixteenth year of his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Raign, his late Majesty did by his Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> grant unto the Duke the Office of Admiralty for his life; which Grant, as he well knoweth it, was made freely and without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> any Contract or Bargain with the late Lord Admiral, or any other; and upon the voluntary Surrender of that Noble and wel-deserving Lord, so he is advised it will appear to be free from any defect in Law, by reason of the Statute of 5 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. mentioned in this Article of his Charge, or for any other cause whatsoever: For he saith the true manner of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this Office, and of all the passages thereof, which he is ready to make good by Proof, was thus, That Honorable Lord, the late Earl of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                              <hi>Nottingham,</hi> the Lord Admiral, being grown much in years, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was not then so able to perform that which appertained to his place, as in former times he had done to his great Honor; and fearing lest his Majesties service, and the Commonwealth, might suffer by his defect, became an humble and earnest Petitioner to his late Majesty, to admit him to surrender his Office. His late Majesty was at the first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing unto it, out of his Royal Affection to his Person, and true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his worth: But the Earl renewed his Petitions, and in some of them nominated the Duke to be his Successor, without the Dukes privity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or fore-thought of it. And about that time, a Gentleman of good place about the Navy, and of long experience, of himself came to the Duke, and earnestly moved him to undertake the place. The Duke apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weight of the place, and considering his yong years, and want of experience to manage so great a charge, gave no ear unto it; but excused it not for form, but really and ingenuously out of the apprehension of his then unfitness for it. This Gentleman not thus satisfied, without the Duke, applied himself to the late King, and moved his Majesty therein,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and offered Reasons for it, That the Duke was the fittest man at that time, and as the State of the Navy then stood, for that place; for, he said, it was then a time of peace. That the best service that could be done for the present, was to repair the Navy and Ships Royal, which then were much in decay, and to retrench the Kings charge, and to employ it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually; and that before there was like to be personal use of service otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Duke being yong and active, might gain experience, and make himself as fit as any other; and that in the mean time, none was so fit as himself, having the opportunity of his Majesties Favor and Means <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to his Person, to procure a constant assignment and payment of moneys for the Navy; the want whereof, was the greatest cause of the former defects.</p>
                           <p>These Reasons perswaded his late Majesty, and upon his Majesties own motion, perswaded the Duke to take the charge upon him: And thereupon the Earl voluntarily, freely, and willingly, and upon his own earnest and often suit, surrendred the place without any President<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or Promise whatsoever; which might render the Duke in the least <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> degree subject to the danger of the Law (which was not then so much as once thought upon) and upon that Surrender, the Grant was made to the Duke. But it is true, That his Majesty out of his Royal bounty, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the long and faithful service of the said Earl, and for an
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:35668:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
honorable memory of his deserts to him, and the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> did grant him a Pension of One thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> for his life; which in all Ages hath been the Royal way of Princes, wherewith to reward antient and well-deserving Servants in their elder years; when without their own faults they are become less serviceable to the State: And the Duke also voluntarily and freely, and as an argument of his noble respect towards so honorable a Predecessor, whom to his death he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> called Father; whose Estate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when the Duke had thus obtained this place of great trust, he was so careful of his duty, that he would not relie upon his judgment or ability, but of himself humbly besought his then Majesty to settle a Commission of fit and able persons for the Affairs of the Navy; by whose Council and assistance, he might manage that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> weighty business with the best advantage for his Majesties service; which Commission was granted, and yet continueth, and without the advice of those Commissioners, he hath never done any thing of moment; and by their advice and industry he hath thus husbanded the Kings money, and furthered the service, that where before the ordinary charge of the Navy was Fifty four thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and yet the Ships were very much decayed, and their Provisions neglected, the charge was returned to Thirty thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and with that charge, the Ships <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all repaired and made serviceable, and two new Ships builded yearly; and for the two last years, when there were no new Ships built, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary charge was reduced to Twenty one thousand six hundred pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> And now he dare boldly affirm, that his Majesties Navy is in better state by much, then ever it was in any precedent time what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>

There are many and continual differences in executing of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants against offenders; the Officers of the one, refusing to obey or assist <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Authority of the other; whereby the offenders protected or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by either, easily escapeth.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Merchants and Owners of Goods questioned in the Admiralty, are often enforced to sue in both Courts, and often enforced for their peace to compound with both Officers.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The Kings service is much hindred for the most usual and ordinary Rendevouz of the Kings Ships, being at the <hi>Downs,</hi> and that being within the Jurisdiction of the Lord Warden, the Lord Admiral or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the Kings Ships, have no Power or Warrant to press men from the shore, if the Kings Ships be in distress.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. When the Kings Ships, or others, be in danger on the <hi>Goodwins,</hi> and other places within the view of the Portsmen, they have refused to help with their Boats, lest the Kings Ships should command them on board, whereby many Ships have perished, and much Goods have been lost.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. When Warrants come to press a Ship at Road for the Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Officers take occasion to disobey the Warrants, and prejudice the Kings service. For if the Warrant come from the Lord Warden, they will pretend the Ship to be out of their Jurisdiction; if the Warrant come from the Lord Admiral, they will pretend it to be within the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the Cinque Ports: And so whilst the Officers dispute, the opportunity of the service is lost.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. When the Kings Ships lie near the Ports, and the men come on shore, the Officers refuse to assist the Captains to reduce them to the Ships without the Lord Wardens Warrant.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">8. If the Kings Ships, on the sudden, have any need of Pilots for the Sands Coasts of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or the like, wherein the Portsmen are best experienced, they will not serve without the Lord Wardens, or his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants Warrant, who perhaps are not near the place.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. When for great occasions for the service of the State, the Lord Admiral and Lord Warden must both joyn their Authority; if the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers for want of true understanding of their several Limits and Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, mistake their Warrants, the service which many times can endure no delay, is lost, or not so effectually performed.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                           <p>For these and many other Reasons of the like kinde, the Duke not being led, either with ambition or hope of profit as hath been objected (for it could be no encrease of Honor to him, having been honored before with a greater place; nor of profit, for it hath not yielded him in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any profit at all, nor is like to yield him above Three hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> at any time) but out of his desire to make himself the more able to do the King and Kingdom service, and prevent all differences and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> difficulties which heretofore had, or hereafter might hinder the same; He did entertain that motion, and doth confess, that not knowing, or so much as thinking of the said Act of Parliament before mentioned, he did agree to give the said Lord One thousand pounds in money, and Five
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:35668:205"/>
hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> in respect of his Surrender, he not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave his place without such consideration, nor the Duke willing to have it without his full satisfaction; and the occasion why the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> gave that consideration to the Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> was, because the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> in his life time had first agreed to give the same consideration for it; and if he had lived, he had had that place upon the same terms: And when the said Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> was dead, his late <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Majesty directed the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to go thorow for that place, and for the Reasons before-mentioned, to put both these Offices together, and to give the same consideration to the said Lord, which the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> should have given, and his late Majesty said he would repay the money. And how far this act of his, in acquiring this Office, accompanied with these Circumstances, may be within the danger of the Law, the King being privy to all the passages of it, and encouraging and directing it, he humbly submitteth to your judgement; and he humbly leaves it to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> your Lordships judgments, in what third way an antient servant to the Crown, by age or infirmity, disabled to perform his service, can in an honorable course relinquish his place; for if the King himself give the Reward, it may be said it is a charge to the Crown; if the succeeding Officer give the Recompence, it may thus be objected to be within the danger of the Law: And howsoever it be, yet he hopeth it shall not be held in him a crime, when his intentions were just and honorable, and for the furtherance of the Kings service; neither is it without president, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in former times of great employment, both these Offices were put into one hand by several Grants.</p>
                           <p>To this Article,<note place="margin">The Charge touching his not guarding the Seas.</note> whereby the not guarding of the Narrow Seas in these last two years by the Duke, according to the trust and duty of an Admiral, is laid to his charge; whereof the consequence, supposed to have been meerly through his default, are the ignominious infesting of the Coasts with Pirats and Enemies, the endangering of the Dominion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> these Seas, the extream loss of the Merchants, and the decay of the Trade and Strength of the Kingdom:</p>
                           <p>The Duke maketh this Answer, That he doubteth not but he shall make it appear to the good satisfaction of your Lordships, that albeit there hath hapned much loss to the Kings Subjects within the said time of two years by Pirats and Enemies, yet that hath not hapned by the neglect of the Duke, or want of care and diligence in his place: For whereas in former times the ordinary Guard allowed for the Narrow Seas hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> been but four Ships, the Duke hath since Hostility begun and before procured their number to be much increased; for since <hi>Iune,</hi> 1624. there hath never been fewer then Five of the Kings Ships, and ordinarily Six, besides Pinnaces, Merchants Ships, and Drumblers; and since open hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Eight of the Kings Ships, besides Merchants of greater number and Pinnaces and Drumblers; and all these well furnished and manned, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently instructed and authorised for the service. He saith, he hath from time to time, upon all occasions acquainted his Majesty, and the Council-Bord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> therewith, and craved their advice, and used the assistance of the Commissioners for the Navy in this service; and for the Dunkirkers who have of late more infested these Coasts then in former years, he saith, There was that Providence used for the repressing of them, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Ships, and the Hollanders joyning together, the Port of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was blocked up, and so should have continued, had not a sudden storm
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:35668:206"/>
dispersed them, which being the immediate hand of God, could not by any pollicy of man be prevented; at which time, they took the opportunity to Rove abroad, but it hath been so far from endangering the Dominion of the Narrow Seas thereby, as is suggested, That his Majesties Ships or Men of War, were never yet mastered, nor encountred by them, nor will they endure the sight of any of our Ships; and when the Duke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was in person, the Dunkirkers run into their Harbors. But here is a necessity, that according to the fortune of Wars, interchangeable losses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> will happen; yet hitherto notwithstanding their more then wonted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency, the loss of the Enemies part hath been as much, if not more then what hath hapned to us; and that loss that hath faln, hath cheifly come by this means, that the Dunkirkers Ships being of late years exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in continual hostility with the Hollanders, are built of a Mold as fit for flight as for fight; and so they pilfer upon our Coasts, and creep to the shore, and escape from the Kings Ships: But to prevent that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience for the time to come, there is already order taken for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> some Ships, which shall be of the like Mold, light and quick of sail, to meet with the adverse party in their own way. And for the Pirates of <hi>Sallie,</hi> and those parts, he saith, it is but very lately that they found the way into our Coasts, where, by surprise, they might easily do hurt; but there hath been that provision taken by his Majesty, not without the care of the Duke, both by force and treaty to repress them for the time to come, as will give good satisfaction. All which he is assured will clearly appear upon proof.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                              <note place="margin">The Charge touching the unjust stay of the Ship of <hi>Newhaven,</hi> called the St. <hi>Peter,</hi> after Sentence.</note>To this Article the Duke maketh this Answer, That about <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> last, this Ship called the <hi>St. Peter</hi> (amongst divers others) was seised on as lawful prize by his Majesties Ships, and brought into <hi>Plimouth,</hi> as Ships laden by the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; in the end of <hi>October,</hi> or beginning of <hi>November,</hi> they were all brought to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> all of them were there unladen; but the <hi>Peter</hi> and the bulk of her Goods was not stirred, because they were challenged by the Subjects of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> French King; and there did not then appear so much proof against her, and the goods in her, as against the rest. About the middle of <hi>November,</hi> Allegations were generally put in against them all in the Admiralty Court, to justifie the seisure, and all the Pretendants were called in upon these proceedings, divers of the Ships and Goods were condemned, and divers were released in a legal course; and others of them were in suspence till full proof made. The Eight and twentieth day of <hi>December,</hi> complaint was made on the behalf of some Frenchmen at the Council-Board con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this Ship and others, when the King by Advice of his Council (his Majesty being present in person) did order that the Ship of <hi>Newhaven</hi> called the <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Goods in her, and all such other Goods of the other prizes, as should be found to appertain to his Majesties own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or to the Subjects of his good Brother the French King, or the States of the United Provinces, or any other Princes or States in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or Alliance with his Majesty, should be delivered: But this was not absolute, as is supposed by the Charge, but was thus qualified, so as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> were not fraudulently coloured, and it was referred to a judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                           <p>According to this just and honorable Direction, the Kings Advocate proceeded upon the general Allegations formerly put in the 26 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> after there was a Sentence in the Admiralty, that the <hi>Peter</hi> should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:35668:206"/>
and the Kings Advocate not having then any knowledge of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof, consented to it. But this was not a Definitive Sentence, but a Sentence Interlocutory, as it is termed in that Court. Within few days after, this Ship prepared her self to be gone, and was falling down the River, then came new intelligence to the Lord Admiral, by the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> That all those Ships were laden by the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; that the <hi>Amirantasco</hi> wasted them beyond the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> North Cape; that they were but coloured by Frenchmen; that there were Witnesses ready to make good this new Allegation; neither was it improbable to be so, for part of the Goods in that Ship have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to be lawful prize. This Ship being now falling down the River, and being a Ship of the most value of all the rest, the Duke acquainted the King therewith, and by his commandment made stay of the Ship, lest otherwise it would be too late, which the Duke in the duty of his place of Admiral, as he believeth, ought to have done without such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And if he had not done so, he might worthily have been blamed for his negligence, and then instantly he sent for the Judge of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty to be informed from him how far the Sentence already past did binde, and whether it might stand with Justice to make stay of her again, she being once discharged in such manner as before: The Judge answered, As he was advised, that it might justly be done upon better proofs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet discreetly in a matter of that moment, he took time to give a resolute answer, That in the interim he might review the Acts which had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> passed: The next day, or very shortly after, the Judge came again to the Duke, and upon Advice answered resolutely, That the Ship and the Goods might justly be stayed, if the proofs fell out to be answerable to the Information given; whereof he said he could not judge, till he had seen the Depositions. And according to this resolution of the Judge, did five other Learned Advocates, besides the Kings Advocate, concur in opinion, being intreated by the Duke to advise thereof; so cautious was the Duke, not to do any unjust act. Then he acquainted the King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> again therewith, and his Majesty commanded him to reseize this Ship, and to proceed judicially to the proofs; and the Duke often required the Kings Advocate to hasten the examination of the Witnesses, and many Witnesses were produced and examined, in pursuance of this new Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But the French Merchants impatient of any delay, complained again to the Council-Board, where it was ordered not barely, That the Ship and Goods should be presently delivered, but should be delivered upon security; and upon security she had been then delivered, if it had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> been given, and security was once offered, but afterwards retracted: And when all the Witnesses produced, were examined and published, the Kings Advocate having duly considered of them, forthwith acquainted the Duke that the proofs came too short for the <hi>Peter</hi>; and thereupon the Duke instantly gave order for her final discharge, and she was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by order of Court accordingly.</p>
                           <p>By which true Narration of the Fact, and all the proceedings, the Duke hopeth it will sufficiently appear, That he hath not done any thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> herein, on his part, which was not justifiable, and grounded upon delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and well-advised Councils and Warrant. But for the doing of this to his own lucre and advantage, he utterly denieth it; for he saith, that there was nothing removed out of the Ship, but some moneys, and some small boxes of stones of very mean value, and other small Portable things lying above the Deck, easily to be imbezilled: And whatsoever
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:35668:207"/>
was taken out of the Ship, was first publickly shewed to his Majesty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and then committed to the custody of <hi>Gabriel Marsh,</hi> in the Article mentioned, by Inventory, then and still Marshal of the Admiralty, by him to be safely kept; whereof the money was employed for the Kings immediate service, and by his direction, and the rest was left in safe keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and are all since delivered and reimbursed to the owners, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed owners thereof, and not a penny profit thereof, or thereby, hath come to the Duke himself, as shall be made good by proof. And whereas the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> suggestion hath been made, that this accident was the cause of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo of the Ships and Goods of our Merchants trading in <hi>France,</hi> he saith, that is utterly mistaken, for divers of their Goods were imbarged before this hapned; and if in truth, the French had therein received that as either they pretend or is pretended for them; yet the imbarguing of the Goods of the English upon that occasion, was utterly illegal and unwarrantable: For by the mutual Articles between the two Kings, they ought not to have righted themselves before Legal Complaint, and a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> denial on our part, and then by way of Reprisal, and not by Imbargo. So that the Duke doth humbly leave it to the consideration of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, whether the harm which hath hapned to our Merchants, hath not been more occasioned by the unseasonable justifying of the actions of the French, which animated them to increase their injuries, then by any act either of the Duke, or any other.</p>

                           <p>About the end of <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, 1623. the Duke had informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given him by a principal Member of their own Company, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Company had made a great advantage to themselves in the Seas of <hi>East-India,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> by rich prizes gotten there forcibly from the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and others; and a large part thereof was due to his Majesty, and to the Duke as Admiral by the Law; for which, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them had any satisfaction. Whereupon directions were given for a legal prosecution in the Court of Admiralty, and to proceed in such Matter as should be held fittest by the Advice of Council.</p>
                           <p>In the Moneths of <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in that year divers Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> were examined in the Admiralty according to the ordinary course of that Court, to instruct and furnish Informative Processes in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. After the Tenth of <hi>March,</hi> 1623. an Action was commenced in the Court in the joynt names of his Majesty, and the Admiral, grounded upon the former proceeding; this was prosecuted by the Kings Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and the demand at first was Fifteen thousand pounds. The Action being thus framed in both their names, by Advice of Council, because it was doubtful in the judgment of the Council, Whether it did more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> belong to the one, or to the other, or to both; and the form of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring that Action being most usual in that Court, on the Eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>April,</hi> 1624. the Judicial Agreement and Sentence passed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in the Admiralty Court, wherein the Companies consent, and their own offer, plainly appeareth; so that for the second part of the right, it
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:35668:207"/>
were very hard to conclude that the Duke had no right, contrary to the Companies own consent, and the sentence of the Court, grounded on their Agreement, unless it shall fully appear, That the Company was by strong hand inforced thereto, and so the money extorted.</p>
                           <p>Therefore to clear that scruple, That as the matter of the Suit was just, or at least so probable as the Company willingly desired it for their peace, so the manner was as just and honorable; your Lordships are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> entreated to observe these few true Circumstances. The Suit in the Admiralty begun divers moneths before the first mention of it in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and some moneths before the beginning of it in that Parliament, it was prosecuted in a legal course, and upon such grounds as will yet be maintained to be just. The Composition made by the Company, was not moved by the Duke, but his late Majesty on the behalf of himself, and of the Duke, treated with divers Members of the Company about it, and the Duke himself treated not at all with them. The Company <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> without any compulsion at all agreed to the Composition, not that they were willing to give so much, if they might have escaped for nothing, but that they were willing to give so much, rather then to hazard the success of the Suit: And upon this Composition concluded by his Majesty, the Company desired and obtained a Pardon for all that was objected against them. The Motion in Parliament about the stay of the Companies Ships then ready prepared and furnished, was not out of any respect to draw them the rather to give the Composition, but really out of an apprehension, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that there might be need of their strength for the defence of the Realm at home; and if so, then all private respects must give way to the Publick Interest. These Ships upon the importunity of the Merchants, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons given by them, were suffered nevertheless to fall down to <hi>Tilbury,</hi> by his late Majesties direction to speed their Voyage the better, whilst they might be accommodated for this Voyage, without prejudice to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick safety, they were discharged when there was an Accommodation propounded and allowed, which was, That they should forthwith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> other Ships for the home service, whilst those went over with their Voyage, which they accordingly did. That the Motion made in the Commons House, was without the Dukes knowledge or privity. That when there was a rumor, that the Duke had drawn on the Composition by staying of the Ships which were then gone, the Duke was so much offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereat, that he would have had the former Communication to have broken off, and have proceeded in a legal course, and he sent to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to that purpose; but the Company gave him satisfaction, That they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had raised no such rumor, nor would, nor could avow any such thing, and entreated him to rest satisfied with their publick acts to the contrary. That after this, their Ships being gone, themselves careful of their future secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, solicited the dispatch of the Composition, consulted with Councel upon the Instruments which passed about it, and were at the charge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the money was paid long after the sentence, and the sentence given after the Ships were gone, and no security given at all for the money, but the sentence; and when this mony was paid to the Duke, the whole sum (but Two hundred pounds thereof onely) was borrowed by the King, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by his own Officers, for the service of the Navy. If these things do upon proof appear to your Lordships, as is assured they will, he humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth it to your judgments, how far verbal Affirmations or Informations extrajudicial, shall move your judgments, when Judicial Acts, and those things which were acted and executed, prove the contrary?</p>

                           <p>That he was so far from practising or consenting that the said Ships should so be employed, that he shall make it clearly to appear, that when it was discovered, that they would be employed against those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Protestation of the French King being otherwise, and their pretence being, That there was a Peace concluded with those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and that the French King would use those Ships against <hi>Genoa,</hi> which had been an action of no ill consequence to the Affairs of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: The Duke did by all fit and honorable means, endeavor to divert that course of their employment against <hi>Rochel.</hi> And he doth truly and boldly affirm, That his endeavors under the Royal care of his most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majesty, hath been a great part of the means to preserve the Town of <hi>Rochel,</hi> as the Proofs, when they shall be produced, will make appear. And when his Majesty did finde that beyond his intention, and contrary to the faithful Promises of the French, they were so misemployed, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> found himself bound in honor to intercede with the most Christian King, his good Brother, for the Peace of that Town, and of the Religion, lest his Majesties Honor might otherwise suffer: Which intercession his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty did so sedulously, and so successfully pursue, that the Town and the Religion there, do and will acknowledge the fruits thereof.</p>
                           <p>And whereas it is further objected against him, That when in so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful a manner he had delivered those Ships into the power of a foreign State, to the danger of the Religion, and scandal and dishonor of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Nation, which he utterly denieth to be so: That to mask his ill intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in cunning and cautelous manner, he abused the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in affirming before the Committees of both Houses, That the said Ships
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:35668:208"/>
were not, nor should be so used or employed; he saith, (under the favor of those who so understood his words,) That he did not then use those words which are expressed in the Charge to have been spoken by him, but there being then a jealousie of the mis-employing of those Ships, the Duke having no knowledge thereof, and knowing well what the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the French King were, but was not then seasonable to be published; he hoping they would not have varied from what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> did say, That the event would shew it was no undertaking for them, but a Declaration of that in general terms which should really have been performed, and which his Majesty had just cause to expect from them.</p>
                           <p>That the Duke did compel the Lord <hi>R.</hi> to buy his Title of Honor,<note place="margin">The Charge touching the compelling the Lord <hi>R.</hi> to buy Honor.</note> he utterly denieth; and he is very confident, that the Lord <hi>R.</hi> himself will not affirm it, or any thing tending that way: Neither can he, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> any man else truly say so, but the said Duke is able to prove, that the Lord <hi>R.</hi> was before willing to have given a much greater sum, but could not then obtain it; and he did now obtain it by solicitation of his own Agents.</p>
                           <p>For the selling of places of Judicature by the Duke,<note place="margin">The Charge touching his selling of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> which are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially instanced in the Charge, he answereth, That he received not, or had a penny of either of those sums to his own use; but the truth is, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Lord <hi>M.</hi> was made Lord Treasurer by his late Majesty without contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for any thing for it; and after that he had the Office conferred upon him, his late Majesty moved him to lend him Twenty thousand pounds upon promise of repayment at the end of a year; the Lord <hi>M.</hi> yielded to it, so as he might have the Dukes word that it should be repayed unto him accordingly: The Duke gave his word for it; the Lord <hi>M.</hi> relied upon it, and delivered the said sum to the hands of Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> then attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Duke, by the late Kings appointment, to be disposed as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his Majesty should direct. And according to the Kings direction, that very money was fully paid out to others, and the Duke neither had, nor disposed of a penny thereof to his own use, as is suggested against him.</p>
                           <p>And afterwards when the Lord <hi>M.</hi> left that place, and his money was not repayed unto him, he urged the Duke upon his promise; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke being jealous of his Honor, and to keep his word, not having money to pay him, he assured Lands of his own to the Lord <hi>M.</hi> 
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for his security. But when the Duke was in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Lord <hi>M.</hi> obtained a promise from his late Majesty of some Lands in Fee-farm, to such a value, as he accepted of the same in satisfaction of the said money, which were afterwards passed unto him; and at the Dukes return, the Lord <hi>M.</hi> delivered back unto him the security of the Dukes Lands which had been given unto him as aforesaid.</p>
                           <p>And for the Six thousand pounds supposed to have been received by the Duke, for procuring to the Earl of <hi>M.</hi> the Mastership of the Wards, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he utterly denieth it; but afterwards he heard that the Earl of <hi>M.</hi> did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse Six thousand pounds about that time; and his late Majesty bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same upon Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> his Servant, without the Dukes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and he had it and enjoyed it, and no penny thereof came to the said Duke, or to his use.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="392" facs="tcp:35668:209"/>To this Article the Duke answereth, That it is true that his late Majesty out of his Royal Favor unto him,<note place="margin">The Charge touching his procuring of Honors for his poor Kinred.</note> having honored the Duke himself with many Titles and Dignities of his bounty; and as a greater argument of his Princely Grace, did also think fit to honor those who were in equal degree of Blood with him, and also to ennoble their Mother who was the Stock that bare them:</p>
                           <p>The Title of the Countess of <hi>Buckingham</hi> bestowed upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was not without President; and she hath nothing from the Crown but a Title of Honor which dieth with her.</p>
                           <p>The Titles bestowed on the Viscount <hi>P.</hi> the Dukes Elder Brother, were conferred on him, who was a Servant of the Bed-chamber to his now Majesty, then Prince, by his Highness means; the Earl of <hi>A.</hi> was of his late Majesties Bed-chamber, and the Honors and Lands conferred on him, was done when the Duke was in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Earl of <hi>D.</hi> hath the Honors mentioned in the Charge, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he hath not a foot of Land which came from the Crown, or the Kings Grant.</p>
                           <p>But if it were true, That the Duke had procured Honors for those who are so near and so dear unto him; the Law of Nature, and the Kings Royal Favor, he hopeth will plead for his excuse; and he rather believeth he were worthy to be condemned in the opinion of all generous mindes, if being in such Favor with his Master, he had minded onely his own advancement, and had neglected those who were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nearest unto him.</p>

But for the immense sums and values which are suggested to have been given unto him, he saith, There are very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> great mistakings in the calculations which are in the Schedules in this Article mentioned; unto which the Duke will apply particular Answers in another Schedule, which shall express the truth of every particular as near as he can collect the same, to which he referreth himself; whereby it shall appear, what a great disproportion there is between Conjectures and Certainties: And those gifts which he hath received, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, that they exceed his Merit, yet they exceed not Presidents of former times. But whatsoever it is he hath, or hath had, he utterly denieth that he obtained the same, or any part thereof, by any undue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sollicitation, or practice, or did unduly obtain any Release of any sums of money he received; but he having at several times, and upon several occasions disposed of divers sums of the moneys of his late Majesty, and of his Majesty that now is, by their private directions, he hath Releases thereof for his discharge, which was honorable and gratious in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties, who granted the same for their Servants indempnity; and he hopeth was not unfit for him to accept of, lest in future times, he or his might be charged therewith, when he could not be able to give <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> so clear an account thereof, as he hopeth he shall now be well able to do.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="393" facs="tcp:35668:209"/>To this Charge, which is set forth in such an expression of words as might argue an extraordinary guiltiness in the Duke,<note place="margin">The Charge touching his transcendent presumption in giving Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick to the King.</note> who by such infinite bonds of duty and thankfulness was obliged to be tender of the life and health of his most dread and dear Soveraign and Master, he maketh this clear and true Answer: That he did neither apply nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Plaister or Posset-drink, in the Charge termed to be a Potion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> unto his late Majesty, nor was present when the same was first taken or applied: But the truth is this; That his Majesty being sick of an Ague, took notice of the Dukes recovery of an Ague not long before, and asked him how he had recovered, and what he found did him most good? The Duke gave him a particular answer thereto, and that one who was the Earl of <hi>Warwicks</hi> Physician had ministred a Plaister and Posset-drink to him; and the chief thing that did him good was a Vomit, which he wished the King had taken in the beginning of his sickness. The King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was very desirous to have that Plaister and Posset-drink sent for, but the Duke delayed it; whereupon the King impatiently asked whether it were sent for, or not? and finding by the Dukes speeches he had not sent for it, his late Majesty sent for <hi>Iohn Baker</hi> the Dukes servant, and with his own mouth commanded him to go for it: Whereupon the Duke besought his Majesty not to make use of it but by the advice of his own Physicians, nor until it should be tried of <hi>Iames Palmer</hi> of his Bed-chamber, who was then sick of an Ague, and upon two Children <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the Town. Which the King said he would do: And in this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Duke left his Majesty, and went to <hi>London</hi>; and in the mean time in his absence the Plaister and Posset-drink was brought and applied by his late Majesties own command. At the Dukes return, his Majesty was in taking of the Posset-drink, and the King then commanded the Duke to give it him, which he did in the presence of some of the Kings Physicians, they then no ways seeming to dislike it, the same Drink being first tasted of by some of them, and divers others in the Kings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Bed-chamber. And he thinketh this was the second time the King took it. Afterwards when the King grew somewhat worse then before, the Duke heard a rumor as if his Physick had done the King hurt, and that the Duke had ministred that Physick to him without advice. The Duke acquainted the King therewith, to whom the King with much discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent answered thus, <hi>They are worse then Devils that say it.</hi> So far from the truth it was, which now notwithstanding (as it seemeth) is taken up again by some, and with much confidence affirmed. And here the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Duke humbly prayeth all your Lordships not only to consider the truth of this Answer, but also to commiserate the sad thought which this Article hath revived in him.</p>
                           <p>This being the plain, clear and evident truth of all those things which are contained and particularly expressed in his Charge, (the rest being in general requiring no Answer) He being well assured that he hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in affirmed nothing which he shall not make good by proof in such way <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as your Lordships shall direct;</p>
                           <p>He humbly referreth it to the judgment of your Lordships, how full of danger and prejudice it is to give too ready an ear and too easie a belief unto Reports or Testimony without Oath, which are not of weight enough to condemn any. He humbly acknowledgeth how easie it was for him in his younger years and unexperienced, to fall into thousands of errors in
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:35668:210"/>
those ten years wherein he had the honor to serve so great and open-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Soveraign and Master: But the fear of Almighty God, his sincerity in the true Religion established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many weaknesses and imperfections, which he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed humbly and heartily to confess) his awfulness not willing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend so good and gracious a Master, and his love and duty to his Country have restrained him and preserved him (he hopeth) from running into hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and high misdemeanors and crimes. But whatsoever upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and mature deliberation they shall appear to be, lest in any thing unwittingly within the compass of so many years he shall have offended, He humbly prayeth your Lordships not only in those, but as to all the said misdemeanors, misprisions, offences and crimes wherewith he standeth charged before your Lordships, to allow unto him the benefit of the free and general Pardon granted by his late Majesty in Parliament in the 21. year of his Reign, out of which he is not excepted; and of the gracious Pardon of his now Majesty granted to the said Duke, and vouchsafed in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> like manner to all his Subjects at the time of his most happy Inauguration and Coronation: Which said Pardon under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> granted the said Duke, beareth date the 10. day of <hi>February</hi> now last past, and here is shewn forth unto your Lordships, on which he doth most humbly rely: And yet he hopeth your Lordships in your Justice and Honor, upon which with confidence he puts himself, will acquit him of and from those misdemeanors, offences, misprisions and crimes wherewith he hath been charged; And he hopeth, and will daily pray, that for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> future he shall by Gods grace so watch over his actions both publick and private, that he shall not give any just offence to any.</p>

And if by their denial or delay, any thing of ill consequence shall fall out either at home or abroad, We call God and man to witness that We have done our part to prevent it, by calling our People together to advise with us, by opening the weight of our occasions
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:35668:210"/>

            <p>About this time there happened, at three a clock in the afternoon, a terrible storm of Rain and Hail in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and with it a very great Thunder and Lightening: The graves were laid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> open in S. <hi>Andrews</hi> Church-yard in <hi>Holborn,</hi> by the sudden fall of the Wall which brought away the Earth with it, whereby many Coffins and the Corps therein were exposed to open view, and the ruder sort would ordinarily lift up the lids of the Coffins to see the posture of the dead Corps lying therein, who had been buried of the Plague but the year before.</p>
            <p>At the same instant of time there was a terrible Storm and strange Spectacle upon <hi>Thames</hi> by the turbulencie of the waters, and a Mist that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> arose out of the same, which appeared in a round Circle of a good big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness above the waters. The fierceness of the Storm bent it self towards <hi>York</hi>-House, (the then habitation of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>) beating against the stairs and wall thereof: And at last this round Circle (thus elevated all this while above the water) dispersed it self by degrees like the smoke issuing out of a Furnace, and ascended higher and higher till it quite vanished away, to the great admiration of the beholders.

                        <p>Such misinformations they fear have begot those interruptions and diversions which have delayed the ripening and expediting of those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> great Counsels which concern your Majesties important service, and have enforced this Declaration.</p>
                        <p>I pass from that to the Petition in which my purpose is not to urge those Reasons which your Majesty may hear expressed in their own words in the language of the people.</p>
                        <p>I am onely directed to offer to your great wisdom and deep judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that this petition of theirs is such as may stand with your Majesties honor and justice to grant.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Your Majesty hath been pleased to give many Royal Testimonies and Arguments to the world how good and gracious a Master you are; and that which the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> once said to the wisest King, may without flattery be said to your Majesty,
<q>
                              <l>Happy are those Servants which stand continually before you.</l>
                           </q>

But the Relations by which your Majesty stands in a gracious aspect towards your people, do far transcend, and are more prevalent and binding, then any relation of a Master towards a Servant; and to hear and satisfie the just and necessary desires of your people, is more honorable, then any expression of grace to a servant.</p>
                        <p>To be a Master of a Servant is communicable to many of your Subjects; to be a King of people, is Regal, and incommunicable to Subjects.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your Majesty is truly stiled with that name which the greatest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, though they borrowed names and titles from those Countries which they gained by conquest, most delighted in, <hi>Pater Patriae</hi>; and desires of children are preferred before those of servants, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant abideth not in the house for ever, but the son abideth ever.</p>
                        <p>The Government of a King was truely termed by your Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Politick Marriage between him and his People; and I may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, there was never a better union between a married Pair, then is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> between your Majesty and your People.</p>

                        <p>WE your loyal and faithful Subjects the Commons assembled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by your Majesties most Royal authority in this present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, having with all dutiful affection from the time of our first méeting earnestly endeavored to procéed spéedily in those affairs that might best and soonest conduce to our dispatch of the intended supply of your Majesties great designs, to the enlargement of your support, and to the enabling of our selves and them whom we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to the full and timely performance of the same; have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by reason of divers informations, interruptions, and other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> preventions béen hitherto so retarded in the prosecution of these affairs, that we now thought it a necessary part of our most humble duties thus to declare both those interruptions and preventions, with the true original and continual cause of them, as also our most earnest devotion of the Parliamentary service of your most excellent Majesty, and of the careful safety and defence of your Dominions, Crown and Dignity: And we most humbly therefore beséech your most excellent Majesty to be graciously pleased here to cast your eye on some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that have relation as well to your first Parliament, as to this; out of which we cannot doubt but that your great Goodness may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an ample satisfaction touching our most loyal and faithful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
                        <p>In the first Parliament of the first Year of your Majesties most happy Reign over us, the Commons then assembled, after they had cheerfully presented to your Majesty as the first-fruits of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Two entire Subsidies, were excéedingly pressed by the means of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and for his own ends, as we conceive, to enlarge that Supply: which when he conceived would not be there effected, he procured for the same ends from your Majesty an Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Parliament to the City of <hi>Oxford</hi>; where the Commons then taking into just consideration the greatest mischiefs which this Kingdom variously hath suffered, and that chiefly by reason of the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant power and frequent misdoings of the said Duke, were entring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> into a Parliamentary course of examination of those mischiefs, power, and misdoings: But no sooner was there any mention made of his Name to this purpose, but that he fearing lest his Actions might so have béen too much laid open to the view of your most excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and to the just Censure that might then have followed, presently through his misinformations to your Majesty of the intentions of your said Commons (as we have just cause to believe) procured a dissolution of the said Parliament: And afterwards also in the same year,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> through divers misreports made to your Majesty in his behalf touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Members of the said Commons, who had more particularly drawn his Name into just question, and justly professed themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to his ends there, procured (as we cannot but conceive) the said Members to be made the Sheriffs of several Counties for this
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:35668:215"/>
year that followed, to the end that they might have all béen precluded from being chosen Members of the present Parliament, lest they should again have therein questioned him; and by the like practice also (as we are perswaded) he procured soon after the said dissolution ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="*" place="margin">

In this consideration we found that the most pressing and comprehensive Mischief and Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance that we suffered, was fundamentally setled in the vast power and enormous Actions of the said Duke, being such, that by reason of his plurality of Offices, all gotten by ambition, and some for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> expresly against the Lawes of your Realm; His breach of Trust, in not guarding the Seas; his high injustice in the Admiralty; his extortion; his delivering over the Ships of this Kingdom into the hands of a Forein Prince; his procuring of the compulsory buying of honor for his own gain; his unexampled exhausting of the Treasures and Revenues of the Kingdom; his transcendent presumption of that unhappy applying of Phisick to your Royal Father of blessed memory, few dayes before his death, and some other his Offences carefully and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> maturely examined by us, we made a Parliamentary Charge of the same matters and offences against him, to the Lords by your Majesty assembled in Parliament, there expecting some remedy by a speedy proceeding against him; but, may it please your most excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, not onely during the time of our examination of the matters and offences of the same Charge, we were diversly interrupted, and diverted, by Messages procured through misinformation from your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which with most humble duty and reverence we did ever receive, whence it first fell out, that so not onely much time was spent amongst us, before the same Charge was perfected, but also within two dayes next after the same Charge was transmitted by us to the Lords: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on untrue and malicious misinformations privately and against the Priviledge of Parliaments, given to your Majesty of certain words
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:35668:216"/>
supposed to have been spoken by Sir <hi>Dudley Digs</hi> and Sir <hi>John Elliot</hi> Knights, two of the Members of our House, in their service of the transmitting of the said Charge, both of them having been espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially employed in the Chairs of Committees with us, about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the said matters and offences, they were both by your Majesties command committed to close imprisonment in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and their Lodgings presently searched, and their papers there found presently taken away; by reason whereof, not onely our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> known Priviledges of Parliament were infringed, but we our selves that upon full hope of speedy course of Iustice against the said Duke were preparing with all dutifull affection to proceed to the dispatch of the Supply, and other Services to your Majesty, were wholly, as the Course and Priviledge of Parliament bindes us, diverted for divers dayes, to the taking onely into consideration some Courses for the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and preservation of the Priviledges so infringed, and we think it our duties, most gracious Soveraign, most rightly to inform here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> your most excellent Majesty of the Course held in the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the two Members: For whereas by your Majesties War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to your Messengers for the arresting of them, you were pleased to command, that they should repair to their Lodgings. And there take them; Your Majesties principal Secretary the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> gave the said Messengers, (as they affirmed) an express command, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the said Warrants, that they should not go to their Lodgings, but to the House of Commons, and there take them; and if they found <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them not there, they should stay until they were come into the House, and apprehend them wheresoever else they should finde them. Which besides that it is contrary to your Majesties command, is an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Testimony of some mischievous intention there had against the whole House of Commons, and against the service intended to your Majesty. All which, with the several interruptions that preceded it, and the misinformation that hath caused all of them, we cannot doubt but that they were wrought and procured by the Duke to his own behoof,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and for his advantage, especially because the said Interruptions have through misinformation come amongst us, onely at such times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have had the matters and offences charged against him in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but your Majesty out of your great goodness and justice being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards informed truely of our Priviledge, and the demerit of the Cause that concerned our said two Members, graciously commanded the delivery of them out of the Tower, for which we render unto your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Majesty most humble thanks; and were then again by reason of our hopes of the dispatch of proceedings with the Lords, upon our Charge against him said the Duke, in a cheerfull purpose to go on with the matter of Supply, and other services to your Majesty, when again these hopes failed in us, by reason of some new exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies now lately shewed in the exercise of his so great power and ambition; for by such his power and ambition, notwithstanding our Declaration against him for his so great plurality of Offices, he also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> procured to himself, by the sollicitation of his Agents, and of such as depended upon him, the Office of Chancellor of the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi>; whereas the same University having two Burgesses in Parliament, did by the same Burgesses a few weeks before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with us in the Charge against him for his ambition for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:35668:216"/>
such a plurality of Offices; such was his ambition to sue for it, such was his power to make them give it him contrary to what themselves had agréed in Parliament with all the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And he procured also the same Office by the special labors and endeavors (as we are informed) of a Factious party, who adhereth to that dangerous Innovation of Religion, published in the seditious Writings of one <hi>Richard Montague</hi> Clerk; of whom it is thence also, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and heretofore upon other reasons it hath béen conceived, that the said Duke is, and long hath béen an Abettor and Protector.</p>
                        <p>These Actions of the said Duke have thus among us hindred the service of your Majesty, by reason both of the interruptions that have so necessarily accompanied them, and of the prevention of our chéerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which otherwise had long since béen most effectually shewed in us, that have nothing else in our cares next to our duty to God, but the loyal service of your Majesty, the safety of your Kingdom, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> subsistence of our selves and those whom we represent, for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that service and safety: Which we cannot hope for, and we beséech your most excellent Majesty graciously to receive this our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and frée protestation, That we cannot hope for it, so long as we thus suffer under the pressures of the power and ambition of the said Duke, and the divers and false Informations so given to your Majesty on his behalf and for his advantage; especially when we observe also that in such his greatness he preventeth the giving of true Information <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to your Majesty in all things that may any ways reflect on his own misdoings, to shew unto your Majesty the true state of your Subjects and Kingdoms, otherwise then as it may be represented for his own ends. And to that purpose also hath he procured so many persons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on him, either by alliance or advancement, to places of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie near your Sacred person. Through his misinformations of that kind also, and power, we have séen to our great grief, both in the time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of your Majesties Royal Father of blessed memory, and of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, divers Officers of the Kingdom so often by him displaced and altered, that within these few years past, since the beginning of his greatness, more such displacings and alterations have by his means happened, then in many years before them: Neither was there in the time of your Royal Father of blessed memory any such Course held, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was by the practice of the said Duke thus induced. And since that time divers Officers of the Crown, not only in this your Kingdom of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                           <hi>England,</hi> but also in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as they have béen made friends or adverse to the said Duke, have béen either so commended, or mispresented by him to his Soveraign, and by his procurement so placed, or displaced, that he hath always herein, as much as in him lay, made his own ends and advantage the measure of the good or ill of your Majesties Kingdoms.</p>
                        <p>But now at length, may it please your most excellent Majesty, we have received from the Lords a Copy of the said Dukes Answer to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> our Charge transmitted against him; whereunto we shall presently in such sort reply, according to the Laws of Parliament, that unless his power and practice again undermine our procéedings, we do not doubt but we shall upon the same have Iudgment against him.</p>
                        <p>In the times also (most gracious Soveraign) of these Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which came amongst us, by reason of the procurement of
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:35668:217"/>
two of our Members committed, A gracious Message was formerly received from your Majesty, wherein you had been pleased to let us know, That if you had not a timely Supply, your Majesty would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your self to New Counsels: which we cannot doubt were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by your most excellent Majesty to be such as stood with Iustice and the Laws of this Realm. But these words <hi>New Counsels</hi> were remembred in a Speech made amongst us by one of your Majesties Privy-Council, and lately a Member of us, who in the same Speech <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> told us, He had often thought of those words <hi>New Counsels;</hi> That in his consideration of them, he remembred that there were such kinds of <hi>Parliaments</hi> antiently among other Nations, as are now in <hi>England;</hi> That in <hi>England</hi> he saw the Country-people live in happiness and plenty, but in these other Nations he saw them poor both in persons and habit; or to that effect: Which state and condition happened (as he said) to them, where such New Counsels were taken, as that the use of their Parliaments ended.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>This intimation, may it please your Majesty, was such as also gave us just cause to fear there were some ill Ministers near your Majesty, that in behalf of the said Duke, and together with him, who is so strangely powerful, were so much against the Parliamentary Course of this Kingdom, as they might perhaps advise your most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majesty such New Counsels as these, that fell under the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and consideration of that Privy-Counsellor. And one especial reason among others hath increased that fear amongst us, For that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> whereas the Subsidies of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> which determined upon the death of your most Royal Father our late Soveraign, and were never payable to any of your Majesties Ancestors but only by a special Act of Parliament, and ought not to be levied without such an Act, yet ever since the beginning of your Majesties happy Reign over us, the said Subsidies have béen levied by some of your Majesties ministers, as if they were still due; although also one Parliament hath béen since then begun, and dissolved by procurement of the said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Duke, as is before shewed, wherein no Act passed for the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies. Which example is so much against the constant use of former times, and the known Right and Liberty of your Subjects, that it is an apparent effect of some new Counsels given against the antient setled Course of Government of this your Majesties Kingdom, and chiefly against the Right of your Commons, as if there might be any Subsidy, Tax or Aid levied upon them, without their consent in Parliament, or contrary to the setled Laws of this Kingdom. But if any such do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> so ill an office, as by the misrepresentation of the state and right of your Majesties loyal Subjects, advise any such new Counsels as the levying of any Aid, Tax or Subsidy among your people, contrary to the setled Laws of your Kingdom, We cannot, most gracious Soveraign, but esteem them that so shall advise, not only as Uipers, but Pests to their King and Commonwealth, (as all such were to both Houses of Parliament expresly stiled by your most Royal Father)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> but also Capital Enemies as well to your Crown and Dignity, as to the Commonwealth. And we shall for our parts in Parliament shew, as occasion shall require, and be ready to declare their offences of this kind, such as that may be rewarded with the highest punishment as your Laws inflict on any Offenders.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="409" facs="tcp:35668:217"/>These, and some of these things, amongst many other, (Most gracious Soveraign) are those which have so much prevented a right understanding betwéen your Majesty and us, and which have possessed the hearts of your people and loyal Commons with unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sorrow and grief, finding apparently all humble and hearty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors misinterpreted, hindred, and now at last almost frustrated utterly, by the interposition of the excessive and abusive power of one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> man; Against whom we have just cause to protest, not only in regard of the particulars wherewith he hath béen charged, which in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary way we are enforced to insist upon, as matters which lie in our notice and proof, but also because we apprehend him of so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled Ambition, and so averse to the good and tranquillity of the Church and State, that we verily believe him to be an Enemy to both: And therefore, unless we would betray our own duties to your Majesty, and those for whom we are trusted, We cannot but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> express our infinite grief, that he should have so great power and interest in your Princely affections, and under your Majesty wholly in a manner to engross to himself the administration of your Affairs of the Kingdom, which by that means is drawn into a Condition most miserable and hazardous.</p>
                        <p>Give us then leave, most dear Soveraign, in the name of all the Commons of this your Kingdom, prostrate at the féet of your Sacred Majesty, most humbly to beséech you, even for the Honor of Almighty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> God, whose Religion is directly undermined by the practice of that Party whom this Duke supports; For your Honor, which will be much advanced in the relieving of your people in this their great and general grievance; For the honor, safety and welfare of your Kingdom, which by this means is threatned with almost unavoidable dangers; And for the love which your Majesty as a good and loving Father bears unto your good people, to whom we profess in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Almighty God (the Searcher of all hearts) you are as highly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> estéemed and beloved as ever any of your Predecessors were, That you would be graciously pleased to remove this Person from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to your sacred presence, and that you will not ballance this one man with all these things, and with the Affairs of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world, which do all suffer so far as they have relation to this Kingdom, chiefly by his means. For we protest to your Majesty, and to the whole world, That until this Great person be removed from intermedling with the Great Affairs of State, we are out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of hope of any good success; and do fear that any money we shall or can give, will through his misimploiment be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of this your Kingdom, then otherwise, as by lamentable experience we have found in those large Supplies we have formerly and lately given.</p>
                        <p>But no sooner shall we receive redress and relief in this, (which of all others is our most insupportable grievance) but we shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> forthwith proceed to accomplish your Majesties own desire, for Supply; and likewise with all cheerfulness apply our selves to the perfecting of divers other great things, such as we think no one Parliament in any Age can parallel, tending to the stability, wealth, and strength, and honor of this your Kingdom, and the support of your Friends and Allies abroad: And we doubt not but
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:35668:218"/>
through Gods blessing, as you are the best, so shall you ever be the best beloved, and greatest Monarch that ever sate in the Royal Throne of this famous Kingdom.</p>

                              <hi>The Kings Declaration of the Causes of assembling and dissolving the two last Parliaments.</hi>
                           </note>THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, since his happy access to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, having by his Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity summoned and assembled two several Parliaments; the first whereof was in <hi>August</hi> last by Adjournment held at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there dissolved; and the other begun in <hi>February</hi> last, and continued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> until the Fiftéenth day of this present moneth of <hi>June,</hi> and then to the unspeakable grief of himself, and (as he believeth) of all his good and well-affected Subjects, dissolved also: Although he well knoweth that the Calling, Adjourning, Proroguing, and Dissolving of Parliaments, being his great Council of the Kingdom, do peculiarly belong unto himself by an undoubted Prerogative inseparably united to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown; of which, as of his other Regal actions, he is not bound to give an Accompt to any but to God only, whose immediate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Lieutenant and Uicegerent he is in these his Realms and Dominions by the Divine providence committed to his charge and government: Yet forasmuch as by the assistance of the Almighty, his purpose is, so to order himself, and all his Actions, especially the great and publck Actions of State, concerning the weal of his Kingdoms, as may justifie themselves not only to his own Conscience, and to his own People, but to the whole World; His Majesty hath thought it fit and necessary, as the Affairs now stand both at home and abroad, to make a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> true, plain &amp; clear Declaration of the Causes which moved his Majesty to assemble, and after enforced him to dissolve these Parliaments; That so the mouth of malice it self may be stopped, and the doubts and fears of his own good Subjects at home, and of his Friends and Allies abroad may be satisfied, and the deserved blame of so unhappy Accidents may justly light upon the Authors thereof.</p>
                        <p>When his Majesty by the death of his dear and Royal Father of ever blessed memory first came to the Crown, he found himself en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in a War with a potent Enemy; not undertaken rashly, nor without just and honorable grounds, but enforced for the necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of himself and his Dominions, for the support of his Friends and Allies, for the redéeming of the antient Honor of this Nation, for the recovering of the Patrimony of his dear Sister, her Confort, and their Children, injuriously and under colour of Treaties and Friendship taken from them, and for the maintenance of the true Religion, and invited thereunto and encouraged therein by the humble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Advice of both the Houses of Parliament, and by their large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and protestations to his late Majesty, to give him full and real assistance in those Enterprises which were of so great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to this Realm, and to the general peace and safety of all his Friends and Allies: But when his Majesty entred into a view of his
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:35668:218"/>
Treasure, he found how ill provided he was to proceed effectually with so great an Action, unless he might be assured to receive such Supplies from his loving Subjects, as might enable him to manage the same.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon his Majesty being willing to tread in the steps of his Royal Progenitors, for the making of good and wholsom Laws for the better Government of his people, for the right understanding of their true Grievances, and for the Supply of monies to be imployed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for those publick services, he did resolve to summon a Parliament with all convenient spéed he might; And finding a former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment already called in the life of his Father, he was desirous for the the spéedier dispatch of his weighty affairs, and gaining of time, to have continued the same without any alteration of the Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, had he not beacute;en advised to the contrary by his Iudges and Council at Law, for that it had béene subject to question in Law, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to avoid. But as soon as possibly he could, he summoned a new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Parliament, which he did with much confidence and assurance of the love of his people that those (who not long before had with some importunity won his Father to break off his former Treaties with <hi>Spain,</hi> and to effect it had used the mediation of his now Majesty being then Prince, and a Member of the Parliament, and had promised in Parliament their uttermost assistance for the enabling of his late Majesty to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the War which they then foresaw might follow) would assuredly have performed it to his now Majesty, and would not have suffered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him in his first Enterprise of so great an expectation, to have run the least hazard through their defaults.</p>
                        <p>This Parliament (after some Adjourment (by reason of his Majesties unavoidable occasions interposing) being assembled on the Eightéenth day of <hi>June,</hi> It is true, that his Commons in Parliament taking into their due and serious Consideration the manifold Occasions which at his first entry did press his Majesty, and his most important Affairs which both at home and abroad were then in action, did with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> great readiness and alacrity, as a pledge of their most bounden duty and thankfulness, and as the first fruits of the most dutiful affections of his loving and loyal Subjects devoted to his service, present his Majesty with the frée and cheerful gift of two entire Subsidies: which their gift, and much more the freeness and heartiness expressed in the giving thereof, his Majesty did thankfully and lovingly accept: But when he had more narrowly entred into the consideration of his great affairs wherein he was imbarqued, and from which he could not without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> much dishonor and disadvantage withdraw his hand, he found that this sum of money was much short of that which of necessity must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently expended for the setting forward of those great Actions, which by advice of his Council he had undertaken, and were that Summer to be pursued. This his Majesty imparted to his Commons house of Parliament; but before the same could receive that debate and due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration which was fit, the fearful Uisitation of the Plague in and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> about the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> where the Lords and the principal Gentlemen of quality of his whole Kingdom were for the time of this their service lodged and abiding, did so much increase, that his Majesty, without extreme peril to the lives of his good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which were dear unto him, could not continue the Parliament any longer in that place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="412" facs="tcp:35668:219"/>His Majesty therefore on the eleventh day of <hi>July</hi> then following, adjourned the Parliament from <hi>Westminster,</hi> until the first day of <hi>August</hi> then following, at the City of <hi>Oxford.</hi> And his Highness was so careful to accommodate his Lords and Commons there, that as he made choice of that place being then the fréest of all others from the danger of that grievous Sickness, so he there fitted the Parliament-men with all things convenient for their entertainment: And his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Majesty himself being in his own heart sincere and frée from all Ends upon his people, which the Searcher of hearts best knoweth, he little expected that any misconstruction of his actions would have béen made, as he there found. But when the Parliament had béen a while assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and his Majesties affairs opened unto them, and a further Supply desired, as necessity required, he found them so slow, and so full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays and diversions in their Resolutions, that before any thing could be determined, the fearful Contagion daily increased and was dispersed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> into all the parts of this Kingdom, and came home even to their doors where they assembled. His Majesty therefore rather preferred the safety of his people from that present and visible danger, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for that which was more remot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, but no less dangerous to the State of this Kingdom, and of the affairs of that part of Christendom which then were, and yet are in friendship and alliance with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. And thereupon his Majesty not being then able to discern when it might please God to stay his hand of Uisitation, nor what place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> might be more secure then other at a time convenient for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assembling, his Majesty dissolved that Parliament.</p>
                        <p>That Parliament being now ended, his Majesty did not therewith cast off his Royal care of his great and important affairs; but by the advice of his Privy-Council, and of his Council of War, he continued his preparations, and former resolutions; And therein not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended those monies which by the two Subsidies aforesaid were given unto him for his own private use, whereof he had too much occasion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as he found the state of his Exchequer at his first entrance, but added much more of his own, as by his credit, and the credit of some of his servants he was able to compass the same. At last, by much disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, by the retarding of provisions and uncertainty of the means, his Navy was prepared and set to Sea, and the Designs unto which they were sent and specially directed, were so probable and so well advised, that had they not miscarried in the execution, His Majesty is well assured they would have given good satisfaction not only to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> own people, but to all the world, that they were not lightly or unadvisedly undertaken and pursued. But it pleased God, who is the Lord of Hosts, and unto whose providence and good pleasure his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty doth and shall submit himself and all his endeavors, not to give that success which was desired: And yet were those Attempts not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together so fruitless as the envy of the Times hath apprehended, the Enemy receiving thereby no small loss, nor our party no little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And it would much avail to further his Majesties great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and the Peace of Christendom, which ought to be the true end of all Hostility, were these first beginnings, which are most subject to miscarry, well seconded and pursued, as his Majesty intended, and as in the judgment of all men conversant in Actions of this nature, were fit not to have béen neglected.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="413" facs="tcp:35668:219"/>These things being thus acted, and God of his infinite goodness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation asswaging the rage of the Pestilence, and in a manner of a suddain restoring health and safety to the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> which are the fittest places for the resort of his Majesty, his Lords and Commons to meet in Parliament; His Majesty in the depth of winter, no sooner descried the probability of a safe assembling of his people, and in his princely wisdom and providence foresaw, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> if the opportunity of seasons should be omitted, preparations both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive and offensive could not be made in such sort as was requisite for their common safety, but he advised and resolved of the summoning of a new Parliament, where he might freely communicate the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the State, and by the Council and advice of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament, who are the Representative body of the whole Kingdom, and the great Council of the Realm, might proceed in these enterprises and be enabled thereunto, which concern the common good, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> safety and honor both of Prince and people; and accordingly the sixth of <hi>February</hi> last, a new Parliament was begun. At the first meeting his Majesty did forbear to press them with any thing which might have the least appearance of his own interest, but recommended unto them the care of making of good Laws, which are the ordinary Subject for a Parliament.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty believing that they could not have suffered many days, much less many weeks to have passed by, before the apprehension and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> care of the common safety of this Kingdom, and the true Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and maintained therein, and of our Friends and Allies, who must prosper, or suffer with us, would have led them to a due and a timely consideration of all the means which might best conduce to those ends; which the Lords of the Higher-House, by a Committee of that House did timely and seasonably consider of, and invited the Commons to a Conference concerning that great business: At which Conference there were opened unto them, the great occasions which pressed his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Majesty; which making no impression with them, his Majesty did, first by Message, and after by Letters, put the House of Commons in minde of that which was most necessary, the defence of the Kingdom, and due and timely preparations for the same.</p>
                        <p>The Commons House after this, upon the 27 of <hi>March</hi> last, with one unanimous consent at first agreed to give unto his Majesty three intire Subsidies, and three Fifteens for a present supply unto him, and upon the 26 of <hi>April</hi> after, upon second Cogitations they added a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fourth Subsidy, and ordered the dayes of payment for them all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the first should have been on the last day of this present <hi>June.</hi> Upon this, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and other Princes and States being enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with his Majesty in this common Cause, his Majesty fitted his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions according to the times which were appointed for the payment of those Subsidies and Fifteens, and hasted on the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, and his Council at War, to perfect their Resolutions for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the ordering and setling of his designs, which they accordingly did, and brought them to that maturity, that they found no impediment to a final conclusion of their Councels, but want of mony to put things into action. His Majesty hereupon, who had with much patience expected the real performance of that which the Commons had promised, finding the time of the year posting away, and having intelligence not onely
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:35668:220"/>
from his own Ministers and Sujects in Forrein parts, but from all parts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> of the great and powerfull preparations of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that his design was upon this Kingdom, or the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or both, (and it is hard to determine which of them would be of worst consequence) He acquainted the House of Commons therewith, and laid open unto them truly and clearly, how the state of things then stood, and yet stand, and at several times, and upon several occasions reiterated the same: But that House being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> abused by the violent and ill-advised passions of a few Members of the House, for private and personal ends ill-beseeming publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, trusted by their Country, as then they were, not onely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but wilfully refused to hearken to all the gentle admonitions which his Majesty could give them, and neither did nor would intend any thing but the prosecution of one of the Peers of this Realm, and that in such a disordered manner, as being set at their own instance into a legal way, wherein the proofs on either part would have ruled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the cause, which his Majesty allowed, they were not therewith content, but in their intemperate passions, and desires to seek for Errors in another, fell into a greater Error themselves, and not onely neglected to give just satisfaction to his Majesty in several Cases which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning his Regality, but wholly forgot their engagements to his Majesty for the publick defence of the Realm; whereupon his Majesty wrote the forementioned Letter to the Speaker, dated the ninth day of <hi>June</hi> 1626.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding which Letter read in the House, being a clear and gracious Manifest of his Majesties Resolutions, they never so much as admitted one Reading to the Bill of Subsidies, but instead thereof they prepared and voted a Remonstrance or Declaration, which they intended to prefer to his Majesty, containing (though palliated with glossing terms) aswel many dishonorable aspersions upon his Majesty, and upon the sacred memory of his deceased Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as also dilatory excuses for their not proceeding with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> adding thereto also coloured conditions crossing thereby his Majesties direction, which his Majesty understanding, and esteeming (as he had cause) to be a denial of the promised Supply, and finding that no admonitions could move, no reasons or perswasions could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail when the time was so far spent, that they had put an impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon themselves to perform their promises, when they esteemed all gracious Messages unto them to be but interruptions: His Majesty upon mature advisement discerning that all further patience would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> prove fruitless, on the fifteenth day of this present moneth he hath dissolved this unhappy Parliament: The acting whereof, as it was to his Majesty an unexpressible grief, for the memory thereof doth renew the hearty sorrow which all his good and well affected Subjects will compassionate with him.</p>
                        <p>These passages his Majesty hath at the more length and with the true Circumstances thereof expressed and published to the world,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> least that which hath been unfortunate in it self, through the malice of the Author of so great a mischief, and the malevolent report of such as are ill-affected to this State, or the true Religion here professed, or the fears or jealousies of Friends and dutifull Subjects, might be made more unfortunate in the consequences of it, which may be of worse
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:35668:220"/>
effect then at the first can be well apprehended; and his Majesty being best privy to the integrity of his own heart, for the constant maintaining of the sincerity and unity of the true Religion professed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to free it from the open contagion of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and secret infection of Schism, of both which by his publick Acts and Actions he hath given good testimony, and with a single heart, as in the presence of God, who can best judge thereof, purposeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and constantly to proceed in the due execution of either; and observing the subtilty of the adverse party, he cannot but believe that the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> hath been in this disaster, that the common Incendiaries of <hi>Christendom</hi> have subtilly and secretly insinuated those things which unhappily (and as his Majesty hopeth, beyond the intentions of the Actors) have caused these diversions and distractions: And yet notwithstanding, his most excellent Majesty, for the comfort of his good and well-affected Subjects, in whose loves he doth repose himself <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with confidence, and esteemeth it as his greatest riches; for the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Friends and Allies, with whom, by Gods assistance, he will not break in the substance of what he hath undertaken; for the discouraging of his Adversaries, and the Adversaries of his Cause, and of his Dominions, and Religion, hath put on this resolution, which he doth hereby publish to all the world, That as God hath made him King of this great people, and large Dominions, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in former ages both by Land and Sea, and trusted him to be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Father and Protector both of their Persons and Fortunes, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Faith, and true Religion; so he will go on cheerfully and constantly in the defence thereof, and (notwithstanding so many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and discouragements) will take his Scepter and Sword into his hand, and not expose the persons of the people committed to his charge, to the unsatiable desires of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who hath long thirsted after an Universal Monarchy, nor their Consciences to the yoke of the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> And that at home he will take that care <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to redress the just grievances of his good Subjects, as shall be every way fit for a good King.</p>
                        <p>And in the mean time his Majesty doth publish this to all his loving Subjects, that they may know what to think with truth, and speak with duty, of his Majesties actions and proceedings in these two last dissolved Parliaments.</p>

               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:35668:224"/>In the Moneth of <hi>September,</hi> the King being informed of the disaster that had befaln his Uncle (and principally also) the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to the raising of Moneys by Loan.</note> whose engagement was chiefly for the cause of the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Council to advise by what means and ways he might fitly and speedily be furnished with moneys suitable to the importance of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, after a Consultation of divers days together, they came to this Resolution, That the urgency of Affairs not admitting the way <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Parliament, the most speedy, equal, and convenient means were by a general Loan from the Subject, according as every man was assessed in the Rolls of the last Subsidy.</p>

               <note place="margin">A Declaration concerning Loan-Money.</note>Upon which Result, the King forthwith chose Commissioners for the Loan, and caused a Declaration to be published, wherein he alledged for this course of Supply, the Reasons set down at large in his late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration touching the Dissolution of the Parliament. Adding further, That the urgency of the occasion would not give leave to the calling of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a Parliament, but assuring the People that this way should not be made a President for the time to come, to charge them or their Posterity to the prejudice of their just and antient Liberties enjoyed under his most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Progenitors; endeavoring thereby to root out of their mindes the suspition that he intended to serve himself of such ways, to the abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Parliaments: And promising them in the word of a Prince, first, To repay all such sums of Money as should be lent without Fee or Charge, so soon as he shall in any ways be enabled thereunto, upon shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> forth the Acquittance of the Collectors, testifying the Receipt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And secondly, That not one penny so borrowed, should be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or expended but upon those Publick and General Services, wherein every of them, and the Body of the Kingdom, their Wives, Children, and Posterity, have their Personal and common Interest.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions to the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for the general Loan.</note>Private Instructions were given to the Commissioners, how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves in this Negotiation.</p>
            <p>As first, That they should themselves, for a good example to others,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> lend unto his Majesty the several sums of money required of them, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it by their names, with their own hands, That when they shall in his Majesties name require others to lend, they may discern the said Commissioners forwardness.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To take for their guide those Rates at which men were assessed in the Book of the last Subsidy, and to require the Loan of so much money, as the entire rate and value comes to, at which they are rated, and set; as (namely) he that is set at a Hundred pounds in Goods,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to lend a Hundred marks; and he that is set at a Hundred pounds in Land, to lend a Hundred pounds in money; and so <hi>per rata</hi> for a greater or lesser sum.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To use all possible endeavors to cause every man willingly and chearfully to lend, opening unto them the necessity and unavoidable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this course, the Honor and Reputation of the Nation, the true Religion, and common safety of Prince and People, of our Friends and Allies engaged in the common Cause; that there is no time now of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> but of acting.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That they appoint the days of payment to be within Fourteen days, and perswade such as shall be able, to pay it at one entire payment, the better to accommodate his Majesties occasion, otherwise to accept of the one half at Fourteen days, and the other
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:35668:224"/>
to be paid before the Twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> now next coming.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That they Treat apart with every one of those that are to lend, and not in the presence or hearing of any other, unless they see cause to the contrary. And if any shall refuse to lend, and shall make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, or excuses, and persist in their obstinacy, That they examine such persons upon Oath, whether they have been dealt withal to deny, or refuse to lend, or to make an excuse for not lending? Who hath dealt so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with him, and what speeches or perswasions he or they have used to him, tending to that purpose? And that they shall also charge every such person in his Majesties name, upon his Allegiance, not to disclose to any other what his Answer was.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That they shew their discretion and affections by making choice of such to begin with, who are likely to give the best examples; and when they have a competent number of hands to the Roll or List of the Leaders, that they shew the same to others to lead them in like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> manner.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That they endeavor to discover, whether any publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or underhand, be workers or perswaders of others to dissent from, or dislike of this course, or hinder the good disposition of others. And that, as much as they may, they hinder all discourse about it, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie to the Privy Council in writing the names, qualities, and dwelling places of all such refractory persons with all speed, and especially if they shall discover any Combination or Confederacy against these proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            <p>Eightly, That they let all men know whom it may concern, that his Majesty is well pleased upon lending these sums required, to remit all that which by Letters in his name was desired upon the late Benevolence for free Grant; and what ever hath been already paid upon that account, shall be accepted for part of this Loan; and if it exceed the sum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, that the overplus shall be repaid without Fee or Charge; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for Privy Seals, if any have been already paid: But if not, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the agreeing of the Loan of the sum required, be excused of the payment of the Privy Seal.</p>
            <p>Ninethly, That they admit of no Suit to be made, or Reasons to be given for the abating of any sum, the time and instant occasion not admitting any such dispute, which would but disturbe and protract the Sheriff.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The Commissioners were required and commanded upon their Faith and Allegiance to his Majesty, to keep secret to themselves, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and not to impart or disclose these Instructions to others.</p>
            <p>To the Imposition of Loan,<note place="margin">Billeting of Soldiers.</note> was added, The burthen of Billeting of Soldiers formerly returned from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and the Moneys to discharge their Quarters were for the present levied upon the Countrey, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid out of sums collected upon the general Loan.</p>
            <p>The Companies were scattered here and there in the Bowels of the Kingdom,<note place="margin">Commissions for Martial Law.</note> and governed by Martial Law: The King gave Commissions to the Lords Lieutenants and their Deputies, in case of Felonies, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Murders, Outrages, or Misdemeanors, committed by Mariners, Soldiers, or other disorderly persons joyning with them, to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to certain Instructions, to the Tryal, Judgment, and Execution of such Offenders, as in time of War; and some were executed by those Commissions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:35668:225"/>Nevertheless, the Soldiers brake out into great disorders; they mastered the people, disturbed the peace of Families, and the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Land; there were frequent Robberies, Burglaries, Rapes, Rapines, Murthers, and Barbarous Cruelties: Unto some places they were sent for a punishment; and where ever they came, there was a general outcry. The High-ways were dangerous, and the Markets unfrequented; they were a terror to all, and an undoing to many.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Lords to advance the Loan.</note>Divers Lords of the Council were appointed to repair into their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> several Countreys, for the advancement of the Loan, and were ordered to carry a List of the names, as well of the Nobility and Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, as of the Judges, and Serjeants at Law, that had subscribed to lend, or sent in money for the Publick service, to be a Patern and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Example to the whole Nation.<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Randolph Crew</hi> removed from his place for not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Loan.</note> But Sir <hi>Randolph Crew</hi> shewing no zeal for the advancing thereof, was then removed from his place of Lord Chief Justice, and Sir <hi>Nicholas Hide</hi> succeeded in his room: A person, who for his parts and abilities, was thought worthy of that preferment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> yet nevertheless came to the same with a prejudice, coming in the place of one so well beloved, and so suddenly removed; but more especially by reason the Duke appeared in his advancement, to express a grateful Acknowledgment to that Knight, for the care and pains he took in drawing the Dukes Answer to the Impeachment in Parliament against him.</p>
            <p>This business of the Loan occasioned a Complaint to the Lords of the Council, against the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> for publickly speaking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> words concerning it, which was conceived to be against the King and Government.</p>
            <p>Whereupon Sir <hi>Iohn Lamb,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sibthorpe,</hi> informed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to this purpose, That many were grieved to see the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> give place to unconformable Ministers, when he turned his back to those that were conformable; and how the <hi>Puritans</hi> ruled all with him, and that divers <hi>Puritans</hi> in <hi>Leicestershire</hi> being Convented, his Lordship would not admit proceedings to be had against them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

               <note place="margin">The Bishop refuses to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Ex Officio</hi> against the <hi>Puritans.</hi>
               </note> The said Bishop replied, He would not meddle against the <hi>Puritans,</hi> for his part he expected not another Bishoprick; they might complain of them, if they would, to the Council Table; for he was under a Cloud already, and he had the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> for his Enemy; and he would not draw the <hi>Puritans</hi> upon him, for he was sure they would carry all things at last: Besides, he said, the King in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> First year of his Reign, had given Answer to a Petition of the Lower House, in favor of the <hi>Puritans</hi>

            <p>It appeared also by the Information of others who were present at the Conference at <hi>Bugden,</hi> That Sir <hi>Iohn Lamb,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sibthorpe,</hi> did notwithstanding the Bishops aversness, again press the Bishop to proceed

               </note> To which Sir <hi>Iohn Lamb</hi> replied (Dr. <hi>Sibthorpe</hi> being present) That they seem to the World to be such as would not Swear, Whore, nor Drink, but yet would Lie, Cozen, and Deceive: That they would frequently hear two Sermons a day, and repeat the same again too; and afterwards pray, and sometimes fast all day long.

To which Sir <hi>Iohn Lamb</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sibthorpe</hi> replied, That they did generally resolve to lend freely: Then said the Bishop, no man of discretion can say, That that place is a place of <hi>Puritans:</hi> For my part (said the Bishop) I am not satisfied to give way to proceedings against them. At which Dr. <hi>Sibthorpe</hi> was much discontented, and said, He was troubled to see that the Church was no better regarded.</p>

            <p>These with other Romish Priests within this Realm, began to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> practise and teach, That the Pope upon the Marriage Treaty, assumed to himself, or his Delegates, the Jurisdiction of the Queens whole family, especially the Institution and Destitution of the Ecclesiasticks; and that the King of <hi>England</hi> had no power to intermeddle therein, because he was an Heretick, the Pope threatning to declare those to be Apostates that should seek their establishment from the King. Likewise the Queen insisted to have the ordering of her family, as her self pleased, and the naming of her Officers and Servants; and being therein crossed, did somewhat distaste the King, and unkindness grew between <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> them.</p>
            <p>These things the King represented to his Brother of <hi>France,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the same to the Crafty and Evil Counsels of her Servants, rather then to her own inclination; And so declared, he could no longer bear with those that were the known causes and fomenters of these disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,

                           </note> through the long sense of your Majesties displeasure, willing in every act of Duty and Obedience to satisfie your Majesty of the loyalty of his heart, then which he hath nothing more desired, that there may not remain a jealousie in your Royal Brest, that stubbornness and will have béen the motives of his forbearing to condescend to the said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Loan, low as your Highness foot, with a sad, yet a faithful heart; for an Apology to your Clemency and Grace, he now presumes to offer up the Reasons that induced him, which he conceiveth necessity of his Duty to Religion, Justice, and your Majesty, did inforce.</p>
                        <p>The Rule of Iustice he takes to be the Law, impartial Arbiter of Government and Obedience, the support and strength of Majesty, the observation of that Iustice by which Subjection is commanded. This and Religion (added to this Power not to be resisted) binds up the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in an Obligation to that Rule, which (without open prejudice and violence of these duties) may not be impeached.</p>
                        <p>In this particular therefore of the Loan, being desirous to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied how far the Obligation might extend, and resolving where he was left Master of his own, to become Servant to your Will, he had recourse unto the Laws, to be informed by them; which in all humility he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth to your most Sacred view in the Collections following.</p>
                        <p>In the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, he findeth that the Commons of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that age were so tender of their Liberties, as they feared even their own frée acts and gifts might turn them to a Bondage and their Heirs. Wherefore it was desired, and granted,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That for no business such manner of Aids, Taxes, nor Prizes, should be taken, but by common assent of the Realm, and for the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The like was in force by the same King, and by two other Laws again Enacted,</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                           <hi>That no Tallage or Aid should be taken or levied, without the good will and assent of the Archbishops, Bishops, Earls, Barons, Knights, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses, and other Freeman of the Land.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that Prudent and Magnanimous Prince, <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, led by the same Wisdom, having granted,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That the greatest gift given in Parliament for the Aid and speed of his matchless undertaking against France, should not be had in Example, nor fall to the prejudice of the Subject in time to come; did likewise adde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in Confirmation of that Right, That they should not from thenceforth be grieved to sustain any Charge or Aid, but by the Common Assent, and that in Parliament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And more particularly upon this point, upon a <hi>Petition</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons afterwards in Parliament, it was established,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="434" facs="tcp:35668:230"/>
                           <hi>That the Loans which are granted to the King by divers persons, be released, and that none from henceforth be compelled to make such Loans against their Wills, because it is against Reason and the Franchises of the Land, and Restitution be made to such as made such Loans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And by another Act upon a new occasion, in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, it was ordained,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That the Subject in no wise be charged with any such Charge, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, or Imposition, called a Benevolence, nor such like Charge; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that such like Exactions be damned and annulled for ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such were the Opinions of these times, for all these Aids, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volences, Loans, and such like Charges exacted from the Subject not in Parliament, which they held to be Grievances contrary to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and illegal; and so pious were their Princes in Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Liberties, as having secured them for the present by such frequent Laws and Statutes, they did likewise by them provide for their Posterity; and in some so strictly, that they bound the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with a Curse, as in that of 33 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. And also under pain of Excommunication; as by the other of the Five and twentieth of the same King, which was to be denounced against all those that violate or break them; which Act extends to us.</p>
                        <p>And these Reasons he presents to your Majesty as the first Motive taken from the Law.</p>
                        <p>There are others also, which in his humble apprehension he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Action it self, which he likewise tenders to your most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Excellent Wisdom.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That the Carriage and Instructions accompanied with the Authority of the Great Seal, imported a Constraint, such Requests to Subjects being tacite and implied Commands, and so preventing that readiness and love which in a frée way would have far excéeded those Demands, whereas the wonted Aids given to your happy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors were <hi>Ex spontanea voluntate, &amp; charitate populi,</hi> whereby they made that Conjunction of their Hearts at home, which wrought such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> power and reputation to their acts abroad.</p>
                        <p>Whereas the firmest Obligation of that readiness and love, is the benignity of Princes, giving and preserving to their People, just and decent Liberties, which to this Kingdom are derived from the Clemency and Wisdom of your Progenitors, to whom there is owing a Sacred Memory for them: He could not as he feared, without pressure to these immunities, become an actor in this Loan, which by imprisonment and restraint, was urged, contrary to the Grants of the Great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by so many glorious and victorious Kings so many times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, being therein most confident of your Majesty, that never King that raigned over us; had of his own benignity and goodness, a more pious disposition to preserve the just Liberties of his Subjects, then your Sacred Self.</p>
                        <p>Though we were well assured by your Majesties Royal Promise, whose words he holds as Oracles of Truth, that it should become a president, during the happiness of your Raign (the long continuance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whereof, is the daily subject of his Prayers) yet he conceived from thence a fear, that succeeding Ages might thereby take occasion for Posterity to strike at the propriety of their Goods, contrary to the piety and intention of your Majesty so graciously exprest.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="435" facs="tcp:35668:230"/>And these being the true Grounds and Motives of his forbearance to the said Loan, shewing such inconveniences in Reason, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting it an Act contradicting so many of your Laws, and most of them by the most prudent and happiest of our Princes granted which could not without presumption beyond pardon in your Suppliant, in taking to himself the Dispensation of those Laws, so piously Enacted, by him be violated or impeached.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> In the fulness of all Submission and Obedience, as the Apology of his Loyalty and Duty, he lowly offers to your most Sacred Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the satisfaction of your Majesty, most humbly praying your Majesty will be graciously pleased to take them into your Princely consideration, where when it shall appear (as he doubts not, but from hence it will to your déep judgment) that no factious humor, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection led on by stubbornness and will, hath herein stirred or moved him, but the just Obligation of his Conscience, which binds him to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the service of your Majesty, in the observânce of your Laws; he is hopeful (presuming upon the Piety and Iustice of your Majesty) that your Majesty according to your innate Clemency and Goodness, will be pleased to bestow him to your Favor, and his Liberty, and to afford him the benefit of those Laws which in all humility he craves.</p>

                           <p>Which Declaration notwithstanding, I intend not to communicate to any, but to let it lie by me privately, That it being set down imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, whilst all things are fresh in memory, I may have recourse to it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if Questions shall be made of any thing contained in this Relation.</p>

                              <note place="margin">His Age when this befel him.</note>And this I hold necessary to be done, by reason of the strangeness of that, which by way of Censure was inflicted upon me, being then of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> age of Sixty five years, incumbred with the Gout, and afflicted with the Stone, having lived so many years in a place of great service; and for ought I know, untainted in any of my actions, although, my Master King <hi>Iames,</hi> who resteth with God, had both a searching Wit of his own to discover his Servants whom he put in trust, whether they took any sinister courses, or no; and wanted not some suggesters about him to make the worst of all mens actions whom they could misreport: Yet this Innocency and good Fame to be overturned in a moneth, and a Christian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Bishop suddenly to be made <hi>Fabula Vulgi,</hi> to be tossed upon the Tongues of Friends and Foes, of Protestants and Papists, of Court and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, of English and Foreigners, must needs in common opinion, presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some Crime, open or secret: Which being discovered by the King, albeit not fully appearing to the World, must draw on indignation in so high a measure.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">His indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion kept him from Court, and exposed him to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note>I cannot deny, that the indisposition of my Body kept me from Court, and thereby gave occasion to Maligners to traduce me, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> my self from publick services; and therefore misliking some courses that were taken, which abstaining perhaps neither pleased the King, nor the great man that set them on foot.</p>
                           <p>It is true, that in the turbulency of some things, I had no great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitements to draw me abroad, but to possess my Soul in Patience, till God sent fairer weather: But the true ground of my abstaining from solemn and publick places, was the weakness of my Feet, proceeding from the Gout; which disease being hereditary unto me, and having possessed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> me now nine years, had debilitated me more and more: So that I could not stand at all, neither could I go up or down a pair of Stairs; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides my Staff, I must have the service of one, at least, of my men, which was not fit to be admitted in every place where <hi>I</hi> was to come.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="439" facs="tcp:35668:232"/>And although <hi>I</hi> was oft remembred by the wisest of my Friends, that <hi>I</hi> might be carried as the old Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh</hi> was, yet <hi>I</hi> did not think my service so necessary for the Commonwealth, as his Lordships by long experience was found to be. <hi>I</hi> did not value my self at so high a rate, but remembred that it was not the least cause of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> that he prized himself so, as if Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> and the Kingdom could not well have stood, if he had not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> both the one and the other.</p>
                           <p>Now for me thus enfeebled, not with Gout onely, but with the Stone also and Gravel, to wait on the King or the Council Table, was by me held a matter most inconvenient. In the Courts of Princes, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle feeling of the infirmities belonging to old age, they like them that be yong and gallant in their actions, and in their cloaths, they love not that men should stick too long in any room of greatness. Change and alteration bringeth somewhat with it. What have they to do with Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and Staves, with lame or sickly men? it is certainly true, There is little compassion upon the bodily defects of any. The Scripture speaketh of men standing before Kings, it were an uncouth sight to see the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject sit the day before the Coronation, when on the morrow <hi>I</hi> had work enough for the strongest man in <hi>England,</hi> being weak in my Feet, and coming to <hi>Whitehal</hi> to see things in a readiness against the next day; yet notwithstanding the Stone and Gout, <hi>I</hi> was not altogether an inutile servant in the Kings Affairs, but did all things in my house that were to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be done; as in keeping the High Commission Court, doing all inferior Actions conducing thereunto, and dispatching References from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty that came thick upon me.</p>
                           <p>These Relations which are made concerning me, be of certain truth, but reach not to the reason wherefore <hi>I</hi> was discarded.</p>
                           <p>To understand therefore the verity,<note place="margin">The Duke offended with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, for not stooping to him.</note> so it is, That the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> being still great in the favor of the King, could endure no man that would not depend upon him; among other men had me in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> eye for not stooping unto him so, as to become his Vassal. <hi>I</hi> that had learned a Lesson, which <hi>I</hi> constantly hold, To be no mans servant but the Kings (for mine Old Royal Master, which is with God, and mine own Reason, did teach me so) went on mine own ways, although <hi>I</hi> could not but observe, That so many as walked in that path, did suffer for it upon all occasions, and so did <hi>I,</hi> nothing wherein <hi>I</hi> moved my Master, taking place; which finding so clearly, as if the Duke had set some ill character upon me, <hi>I</hi> had no way but to rest in patience, leaving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> all to God, and looking to my self as warily as <hi>I</hi> might. But this did not serve the turn, his undertakings were so extraordinary, That every one that was not with him, was presently against him; and if a hard opinion were once entertained, there was no place left for satisfaction or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</p>
                           <p>What befel the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Randal Crew,</hi> and divers others, <hi>I</hi> need not to report, and no man can make doubt but he blew the Coals.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> For my Self,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of the Dukes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</note> there is a Gentleman called Sir <hi>H. S.</hi> who gave the first light what should befal me: This Knight being of more livelihood then wisdom, had married the Lady <hi>D.</hi> Sister to the now Earl of <hi>E.</hi> and had so treated her, that both for safeguard of her Honor, blemished by him scandalously, and for her Alimony or maintenance (being glad to get from him) she was inforced to endure a Suit in the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:35668:233"/>
Court: So to strengthen his party, he was made known to the Duke, and by means of a Dependant on his Grace, he got a Letter from the King, That the Commissioners should proceed no further in hearing of that Cause, by reason that it being a difference between a Gentleman and his Wife, the Kings Majesty would hear it himself. The Solicitor for the Lady finding that the course of Justice was stopped, did so earnestly; by Petition, move the King, that by another Letter there was a relaxation of the former restraint, and the Commissioners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Ecclesiastical went on: But now in the new proceeding, finding himself by Justice like enough to be pinched, he did publickly in the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to speak by any Councel, but would plead his cause himself; wherein he did bear the whole business so disorderly, tumultuously, and unrespectively, that after divers reproofs, <hi>I</hi> was enforced for the Honor of the Court, and Reputation of the High Commission, to tell him openly, That if he did not carry himself in a better fashion, <hi>I</hi> would commit him to Prison.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                           </p>
                           <p>This so troubled the yong Gallant, that within few days after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Dinner or Supper, where some wished me well, he bolted it out, That as for the Archbishop, the Duke had a purpose to turn him out of his place, and that he did but wait the occasion to effect it. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought unto me constantly, by more ways then one, <hi>I</hi> was now in expectation what must be the issue of this great mans indignation, which fell out to be as followeth.</p>

When I had once or twice perused it, I found some words which seemed unto me to cross that which the King intended, and in a sort to destroy it; and therefore upon his return, a day or two after I exprest my self <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thus.</p>

                              <p>I conceive that the King intendeth that this Sermon shall promote the service now in hand about the <hi>Loan of Money,</hi> but in my opinion it much crosseth it; for he layeth it down for a rule, and because it should not be forgotten, he repeateth it again,</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>That Christians are bound in duty one to another,</hi>

                                 <hi>especially all Subjects to their Princes according to the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom wherein they live.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Out of this will men except this <hi>Loan,</hi> because there is neither Law <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> nor Custom for it in the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Secondly, In my judgment there followeth a dangerous Speech, <hi>Habemus necessitatem vindicandae libertatis.</hi> For this was all that was then quoted out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> no mention being made of any the other words which are now in the Printed Copy: For when by the former Rule he
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:35668:234"/>
hath set men at liberty, whether they will pay or no, he imposeth upon them a necessity to vindicate this Liberty, and <hi>Vindicare</hi> may be extended to challenge with violence <hi>cum vi.</hi> But for my part I would be most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give occasion to Sedition and Mutiny in the Kingdom.</p>
                              <p>Again, here is mention made of Poll-Money, which as I have heard hath already caused much distaste where the Sermon was Preached.</p>
                              <p>Moreover, what a Speech is this, <hi>That he observes the forwardness of the Papists to offer double,</hi> according to an Act of Parliament so providing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> yea, to profess that they would part with the half of their Goods, where he quoteth in the Margent <hi>Anno</hi> 1 <hi>Caroli</hi>; the Act for the Subsidy of the Layty, whereby Popish Recusants were to pay double; when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no such Act.</p>
                              <p>And in the fifth place it is said in this Sermon, that the Princes of <hi>Bohemia</hi> have power to depose their Kings, as not being Hereditary, which is a great question. Such a one as hath cost much blood, and must not in a word be absolutely defined here, as if it were without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> I pray you make his Majesty acquainted with these things, and take the Book with you (where it is to be noted, That all this time we had but one single Copy, which was some time at the Court, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time left with me.)</p>

                              <p>Secondly, The King saith for the words <hi>Habemus necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem vindicandae libertatis,</hi> he taketh them to be for him; and he will stand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> on his Liberty.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, For Poll-money he thinketh it lawful.</p>
                              <p>Fourthly, It is true, there was no such Act passed, and therefore it must be amended (and yet in the Printed Book it is suffered still to stand. Such slight, and I may say, slovenly care was had by them that published this Sermon.)</p>
                              <p>And fifthly, For that of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he hath crossed it out of the Book.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                              </p>
                              <p>Some other matters there were, against which I took exception, but Mr. <hi>Murrey</hi> being a yong Gentleman, although witty and full of good behavior, I doubted that being not deeply seen in Divinity, he could not so well conceive me, nor make report of my words to his Majesty: And therefore I being lame, and so disabled to wait on the King, did
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:35668:234"/>
move him, That he would in my name humbly beseech his Majesty to send the Bishop of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> unto me, and I would by his means make known my Scruples;<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop desires Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> may be sent to him to treat of that Sermon.</note> and so I dismissed Mr. <hi>Murrey,</hi> observing with my self, that the Answers to my Five Objections, especially to two or three, were somewhat strange: As if the King were resolved, were it to his good or to his harm, to have the Book go forth.</p>
                              <p>After one or two days more, the yong Gentleman cometh to me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> again, and telleth me, That the King did not think it fit to send the Bishop of <hi>Bathe</hi> unto me; but he expecteth I should pass the Book. In the mean time had gone over one High Commission day, and this Bishop who used (otherwise) very few days to fail, was not there, which being joyned to his Majesties Message, made me in some measure to smell, that this whole business might have that Bishops hand in it, especially I knowing in general the disposition of the man.</p>
                              <p>The mindes of those that were Actors for the publishing of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Book, were not quiet at the Court, that the thing was not dispatched; and therefore one day the Duke said to the King, Do you see how this business is deferred, if more expedition be not used, it will not be Printed before the end of the Term; at which time it is fit that it be sent down into the Countreys.</p>
                              <p>So eager he was, That either by my Credit his undertakings might be strengthned, or at least I might be contemned and derided as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy fellow.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> This so quickned the King, that the next Message which was sent by Mr. <hi>Murrey,</hi> was in some degree minatory, That if I did not dispatch it, the King would take some other course with me.</p>
                              <p>When I found how far the Duke had prevailed,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop sends his Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Court in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against the Sermon.</note> I thought it my best way to set down in writing many Objections, wherefore the Book was not fit to be published; which I did modestly, and sent them to the King. The words were these which I culled out of the Written Sermon.</p>

                              <p>It was an observation what a sweet man this was like to be, that the first observable act that he did, was the marrying of the Earl of <hi>D.</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Lady <hi>R.</hi> When it was notorious to the World, that she had another Husband; and the same a Nobleman, who had divers Children then living by her.<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> was a long time offended with Bishop <hi>Laud.</hi>

This is a new kinde of Learning unto me, I have formerly found fault, that the Author of this Sermon quoteth not the places whereupon he grounds his Doctrine; and when I have oft called for them, it is replied unto me, that I must take them upon the credit of the Writer, which I dare not do; for I have searched but one place which he quoted in general, but sets down neither the words, nor the Treatise, nor the Chapter, and I finde nothing to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> purpose, for which it is quoted; and therefore I have reason to suspect all the rest. I pray you therefore in the humblest manner to commend my service to the King my Master, and let him know, that unless I may have all the Quotations set down, that I may examine them, and may have that writing, wherein I am so ill used, I cannot allow the Book.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>This is a fourth Case of Exception.</p>
                           <p>And here before I go to the rest, the Doctor did truly hit upon a good point, in looking to the Laws and Customs, if he could have kept him to it; for in my memory, and in the remembrance of many Lords,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and others that now live, Doctor <hi>Haresenet,</hi> the then Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> and now of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in Parliament time Preached a Sermon at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> (which was afterward burned) upon the Text, <hi>Give unto</hi> Caesar, <hi>the things that be</hi> Caesars. Wherein he insisted, That Goods and Money were <hi>Caesars</hi>
                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore they were not to be denied unto him.</p>
                           <p>At this time, when the whole Parliament took main offence thereat, King <hi>Iames</hi> was constrained to call the Lords and Commons into the Banqueting-house at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and there his Majesty calmed all by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                              <hi>The Bishop onely failed in this, when he said the Goods were</hi> Caesars; he did not adde, They were his according to the Laws and Customs of the Countrey wherein they did live.</p>
                           <p>So moderate was our <hi>Caesar</hi> then, as I my self saw, and heard, being then an eye and ear witness, for I was then Bishop of <hi>London.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To the fourth, The Poll-Money, in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> was imposed by the Emperor, as a Conqueror over the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the execution of it in <hi>England,</hi> although it was by a Law, produced a terrible effect in King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                              <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time, when onely it was used, for ought that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.</p>
                           <p>Here the Bishop in the Paper excepted divers things, as, That some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times among us by Act of Parliament, strangers are appointed to pay by the Poll, which agreeth not with the Case; and that it was not well to bring examples out of weak times, whereas we live in better; but that it was a marvelous fault, the blame was not laid upon the Rebels of that Age.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                           </p>
                           <p>Those are such poor things, that they are not worth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering.</p>
                           <p>But my Objection in truth prevailed so far, that in the Printed Book it was qualified thus. Poll-Money, other persons, and upon some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; where <hi>obiter</hi> I may observe, That my refusing to sign the Sermon,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:35668:236"/>
is not to be judged by the Printed Book, for many things are altred in one, which were in the other.</p>
                           <p>To the fifth, <hi>Page</hi> 12. It is in the bottome, view the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, whether it be fit to give such allowance to the Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing surreptiously put out.</p>
                           <p>To this it was said, That being a good passage out of a blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Book, there was no harm in it.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> But before the Question of <hi>Sibthorps</hi> Treatise, the Bishop of <hi>Bathe</hi> himself being with me, found much fault with that Treatise, as being put out for a scandalous Parallel of those times.</p>
                           <p>To the sixth in the same <hi>Page,</hi> Let the largeness of those words be well considered, <hi>Yea, all Antiquity to be absolutely for absolute Obedience to Princes, in all Civil or Temporal things:</hi> For such Cases (as <hi>Naboths</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard) may fall within this.</p>
                           <p>Here the Bishop was as a man in a rage, and said, That it was an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> comparison; for it must suppose, that there must be an <hi>Ahab,</hi> and there must be a <hi>Iezabel,</hi> and I cannot tell what: But I am sure my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception standeth true, and reviling, and railing, doth not satisfie my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>All Antiquity</hi> taketh the Scripture into it; and if I had allowed that proportion for good, I had been justly beaten with my own Rod.</p>
                           <p>If the King the next day had commanded me to send him all the Money and Goods I had, I must by mine own rule have obeyed him; and if he had commanded the like to all the Clergy-men in <hi>England,</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Doctor <hi>Sibthorps</hi> proportion, and my Lord of <hi>Canterburies</hi> allowing of the same, they must have sent in all, and left their Wives and Children in a miserable case. Yea, the words extend so far, and are so absolutely delivered, That by this Divinity, if the King should send to the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Inhabitants thereof, commanding them to give unto him all the wealth which they have, they were bound to do it: I know our King is so gratious, that he will attempt no such matter; but if he do it not, the defect is not in these flattering Divines, who if they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> called to question for such Doctrine, they would scarce be able to abide it. There is a <hi>Meum</hi> and a <hi>Tuum,</hi> in Christian Commonwealths, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Laws and Customs, Princes may dispose of it, that saying being true, <hi>Ad Reges potestas omnium pertinet, ad singulos proprietas.</hi>

                           <p>How that agreeth with his Majesties Commission and Proclamation which are quoted in the Margent, they make no Answer; but in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished Sermon distinguisheth a Tribute from a Loan or Aid, whereby they acknowledge it was not well before, and indeed it was improper and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, worthy of none but Dr. <hi>Sibthorpe.</hi>

                           <p>I have now delivered the Grounds whereupon I refused to authorise this Book, being sorry at my heart, that the King, my Gratious Master, should rest so great a building upon so weak a Foundation, the Treatise being so slender, and without substance, but that it proceeded from a hungry man.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="448" facs="tcp:35668:237"/>If I had been in Council when the Project for this Loan was first handled, I would have used my best Reasons to have had it well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but I was absent, and knew not whereupon they proceeded, onely I saw it was followed with much vehemency: And since it was put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, I did not interpose my self to know the Grounds of one, nor of the other.</p>
                           <p>It seemed therefore strange unto me, That in the upshot of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I was called in to make that good by Divinity, which others had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> done; and must have no other inducement to it, but Doctor <hi>Sibthorps</hi> contemptible Treatise. I imagined this for the manner of the carriage of it, to be somewhat like unto the Earl of <hi>Somersets</hi> Case, who abused the Wife of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> must have her divorsed from her Husband, and must himself marry her: And this must not be done, but that the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> must ratifie all judicially. I know the Cases are different, but I onely compare the manner of the carriage.</p>

                              </note> When the Approbation of the Sermon was by me refused, it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> carried to the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> who gave a great and stately allowance of it; the good man being not willing that any thing should stick which was sent unto him from the Court, as appeareth by the Book which is commonly called <hi>The Seven Sacraments,</hi> which was allowed by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with all the Errors, which since that time have been expunged, and taken out of it.</p>
                           <p>But before this passed the Bishops File, there is one accident which fitly cometh in to be recounted in this place. My Lord of <hi>London</hi> hath a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Chaplain, Doctor <hi>Worral</hi> by name, who is Schollar good enough, but a kinde of free Fellow-like man, and of no very tender Conscience. Doctor <hi>Sibthorps</hi> Sermon was brought unto him, <hi>And hand over head</hi> (as the Proverb is) he approved it, and subscribed his name unto it. But afterwards being better advised, he sendeth it to a learned Gentleman of the <hi>Inner Temple,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi>
                              </note> and writing some few lines unto him, craveth his opinion of that which he had done, the Gentleman read it: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had promised to return his Judgment by Letter, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so to do, but desired that Doctor <hi>Worral</hi> would come himself; which being done, he spake to this purpose, What have you done, you have allowed a strange Book yonder; which if it be true, there is no <hi>Meum</hi> or <hi>Tuum,</hi> no man in <hi>England</hi> hath any thing of his own: If ever the Tide turn, and Matters be called to a Reckoning, you will be hanged for publishing such a Book. To which the Doctor answered, Yea, but my hand is to it, what shall I do? For that the other replied, You must scrape out your name, and do not suffer so much as the sign of any Letter to remain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in the Paper. Which accordingly he did, and withdrew his finger from the Pye.</p>
                           <p>But what the Chaplain well-advised would not do, his Lord without sticking accomplished; and so being unsensibly hatched, it came flying into the World: But in my opinion, the Book hath perswaded very few understanding men, and hath not gained the King six pence.</p>

                           <p>HItherto I have declared at length all Passages concerning the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and to my remembrance I have not quitted any thing that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was worthy the knowing. I am now in the second place to shew what was the issue of this not allowing the worthy and learned Treatise. In the height of this Question, I privately understood from a Friend in the Court, That for a punishment upon me, it was resolved that I should be sent away to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and confined there. I kept this silently, and expected Gods pleasure, yet laying it up still in my minde, esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Duke to be of the number of them, touching whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth, <hi>That such as are false in their love, are true in their hate.</hi> But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whatsoever the event must be, I made that use of the Report, that <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula praevisa minus feriunt.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">The Duke presseth his Majesty to have the Archbishop sent away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he set to Sea.</note> The Duke at the first was earnest with the King, That I must be presently sent away before his going to Sea: For, saith he, if I were gone, he would be every day at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and at the Council Table, and there will cross all things that I have intended. To meet with his Objection, I got me away to <hi>Croyden</hi> a moneth sooner then in ordinary years I have used to do; but the Term was ended early, and my main fit of the Stone did call upon me to get me to the Countrey, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that there on Hors-back I might ride upon the Downs; which I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards performed, and I thank God found great use of it, in recovering of my Stomack which was almost utterly gone.</p>
                           <p>The Duke hastned his preparations for the fleet, but still that cometh in for one <hi>Memorandum,</hi> That if he were once absent, there should no day pass over, but that the Archbishop would be with the King, and infuse things that would be contrary to his proceedings. What a miserable and restless thing Ambition is, when one talented, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but as a common person, yet by the favor of his Prince, hath gotten that interest, that in a sort all the Keys of <hi>England</hi> hang at his Girdle (which the wife Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would never endure in any Subject yet stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his own heart in such tickle terms, as that he feareth every shadow, and thinketh that the lending of the Kings ear unto any grave and well-seasoned Report, may blow him out of all; which in his estimation he thinketh is setled upon no good foundation, but the affection of the Prince, which may be mutable, as it is in all men more or less? If a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> would wish harm unto his enemy, could he wish him a greater torment, then to be wrested and wringed with ambitious thoughts? Well, at first it went currant, that with all hast I must be doffed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but upon later consideration it must be staid till the Duke be at Sea, and then put in execution by the King himself; that as it seemeth <hi>Buckingham</hi> might be free from blame, if any should be laid upon any person. Hence it was, that after his going, there was new prosecution of the <hi>Yorkshire</hi>-men, and the refusing <hi>Londoners</hi> were pursued more fervently then before; and it is very likely, that the Arrow came out of the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Quiver; that the Bishop coming to the Election at <hi>Westminster</hi> was driven back so suddenly to <hi>Bugden.</hi> Take heed of these things Noble Duke, you put your King to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to give more money, and commanding them to meddle no more with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; you came the next day and thought to smooth all, taking the glory of qualifying disturbances to your self; whereas, if you had read Books of true State Government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal you are not acquainted, sweet things are personally to be acted by Kings and Princes, as giving of Honors, and bestowing of noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; and those things that are sour and distasting, are to be performed by their Ministers, you go the contray way.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

pray you, my Lord, is the King precisely set upon my going to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>; there are questions in Law between me and that Town, about the Liberties of my Archbishoprick, which I by my Oath am bound to maintain; and if I should be among them, I have many Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of the Citizens, I have there some Tenants, and the Dean and Chapter are interessed in the Question, I would be unwilling that my Servants and their people should fall together by the ears, while I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> am in the Town: His Majesty knoweth this difference to be between us, by the token that a Suit which I lately brought against them by a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> was stopped, Justice being denied me, which is not usual to be denied to any Subject, and the King well knoweth by whose means it was stayed.

                           <p>It comforted me not a little, that the word was now out: My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining must be for not allowing of a Book!

I had almost forgotten that among many other memorable Speeches that passed between us, I used this one, That peradventure the King might be offended at me, because I was no more present at the matter of the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:35668:239"/>
Loan; but said I, my lameness hindered me therein, and I hoped thereby to do my Master better service, because if ever course be taken to reconcile the King and his people (which if it be not, this Kingdom will rue it in the end) I would hope among many other, to be a good Instrument therein, since my hand hath not been in those bitternesses which have of late faln out.</p>
                           <p>You say well saith the <hi>Secretary,</hi> Would you that I should tell the King so much? Yea, said I, if you please, I hold it not unfit that his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Majesty should know it.</p>
                           <p>What he reported therein, I do not know, but matters proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former course, as if there were no regard had of any such thing.</p>
                           <p>The Lord <hi>Conway</hi> being gone from me for two or three days, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to hear the resolution, to what place in <hi>Kent</hi> I should betake my self; and receiving no news, I tossed many things in my minde, as perhaps, that the King desired to hear somewhat from the Duke how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he sped in his journey; or that peradventure he might alter his purpose upon report of my ready obeying; or that it might so fall out, that some of the Lords at the Court understanding upon the <hi>Secretaries</hi> return from <hi>Croyden,</hi> that which was formerly concealed from them, might infuse some other Councils into the King. These thoughts I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved at last, not forgetting the courses of the Court, and imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that into my heart, That there was no good intended towards me; but that any advantage would be taken against me, I sent a man to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                              <hi>Whitehal</hi> whether the King was now come, for a night or two, and by him I wrote to the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> in these words.</p>

I will not trouble my self to mention some idle things, but some other of them require a little consideration.<note place="margin">The reason why the Duke was thought to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Archbishop.</note> A main matter that the Duke was said to take in ill part, was, the resort which was made to my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> House at the times of Dinner and Supper, and that oftentimes of such as did not love him.</p>
                           <p>My Answer unto that is,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> That by Nature I have been given to keep a House according to my Proportion, since I have had any means, and God hath blessed me in it. That it is a property by Saint
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:35668:240"/>
                              <hi>Paul</hi> required in a Bishop, <hi>That he should be given to Hospitality</hi>; that it is another of his Rules, <hi>Let your Conversation be without Covetousness</hi>; and those things I had in mine eyes. Besides I have no Wife, nor Childe; and as for my Kinred, I do that for them which I hold fit; but I will not rob the Church, nor the Poor for them.</p>
                           <p>Again, It is so rare a fault in these days, that men not feeding on the Kings Meat, but of their own charge, should frankly entertain their Friends when they come unto them, that I deserve to be pardoned for it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> But this is not all.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> injoyned the Archbishop to live like an Archbishop.</note>When King <hi>Iames</hi> gave me the Bishoprick, he did once between him and me, and another time before the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> charge me that I should carry my House Nobly (that was his Majesties word) and live like an Archbishop; which I promised him to do: And when Men came to my House, who were of all civil sorts, I gave them friendly entertainment, not sifting what exceptions the Duke made against them; for I knew he might as undeservedly think ill of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> others, as he did of me. But I meddled with no mans quarrels, and if I should have received none but such as cordially and in truth had loved him, I might have gone to Dinner many times without company. There frequented me Lords Spiritual and Temporal, divers Privy Counsellors, as occasion served, and Men of the highest rank; where, if the Duke thought that we had busied our selves about him, he was much deceived: Yet perhaps the old saying is true, <hi>That a Man who is guilty of one Evil to himself, thinketh that all men that talk together, do say <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> somewhat of him.</hi> I do not envy him that happiness, but let it ever attend him.</p>
                           <p>As for other men of good sort, but of lesser quality, I have heard some by name, to whom exception hath been taken, and these are three, (I know from the Court by a Friend, that my House for a good space of time hath been watched, and I marvel that they have not rather named sixty then three.)</p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The Duke was not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs</hi> frequented the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops house.</note>The first of these is Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi> a very great Mote in the Dukes Eye, as I am informed; for it is said, That this Knight hath paid him in Parliament with many sharp Speeches. If this be so yet what is that to me, he is of age to answer for himself. But in the time of the late Parliament, when the Earl of <hi>Carlile</hi> came unto me, and dealt with me thereabout, I gave him my word, and I did it truly, That I was not acquainted with these things; onely being sick as I was, I had in general given him advice, That he should do nothing that might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> give just offence to the King; and I have credibly heard, that when Sir <hi>Dudley</hi> was last in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> committed from the Council Table, he was much dealt withal, to know, Whether he was not instigated by me to accuse the Duke in Parliament: The Knight with all the Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Assurances, that could come from a Gentleman, acquitted me of the part, and whole, wherein he did me but right: And I do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when that man now so hated, was a great Servant of the Dukes. So that if he have now lost him, it cannot but be presumed that it is for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> some unworthy carriage which the Gentleman conceiveth hath by that Lord been offered unto him.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, How can I but imagine the words and actions of Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs</hi> have been ill interpreted, and reported: When I my self saw the Duke stand up nine times in a morning in the Parliament House
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:35668:240"/>
to fasten upon him words little less (if at all less) then Treason; when by the particular Votes of all the Lords and Commons in both Houses, he was quit of those things, which the other would have enforced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: And a little while before he was hastily clapt into the <hi>Tower,</hi> and within a day or two released again, because nothing was proved against him. And I assure you, I am so little interessed in his actions, That to this day I could never learn the reason why he was imprisoned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> although he was kept there for Seven or eight weeks. I distinguish the King from the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; the one is our Soveraign by the Laws of God and Men; the other a Subject as we are: And if any Subject do impeach another, though of different degrees, let the party grieved, remedy himself by Law, and not by Power.</p>
                           <p>But to speak further for this Knight, I may not forget when he was publickly employed; one time to the <hi>Hague,</hi> a second time to <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia,</hi> 
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and thirdly, into <hi>Ireland,</hi> about Affairs of the State, such opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was then held of his good endeavors. And for mine own part ever since the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I have been nearly acquainted with him,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to Sir <hi>Dudley Digs</hi> at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                              </note> he was my Pupil at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and a very towardly one; and this knowledge each of other, hath continued unto this time. He calleth me Father, and I term his Wife my Daughter, his eldest Son is my God-son, and their Children are in love accounted my Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children.</p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                           <p>The second that I have heard named, was Sir <hi>Francis Harrington,</hi> a Gentleman whom for divers years I have not seen, and who for ought I know, was never in my house but once in his life.</p>
                           <p>The third was Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">The Duke was offended that Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Wentworth</hi> frequented the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops House.</note> who had good occasion to send unto me, and some times to see me, because we were joynt Executors to Sir <hi>George Savile,</hi> who married his Sister, and was my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Pupil at <hi>Oxford</hi>; to whose Son also, Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> and I were Guardians, as may appear in the Court of Wards, and many things passed between us in that behalf; yet to my remembrance I saw not this Gentleman but once in these Three quarters of a year last past; at which time he came to seek his Brother-in-law, the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> who was then with me at Dinner at <hi>Lambeth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For one of the punishments laid upon me, it was told me by the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to meddle no more in the High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> That I must meddle no more with the High Commission; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and accordingly within a few days after a Warrant is sent to the Attorney General, that the Commission must be renewed, and the Archbishop must be left out: This under hand being buzzed about the Town with no small mixture of spight, I conceived it to be agreeable to the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the Lords and Gentlemen which refused to contribute to the Loan, they all being laid aside in the Commissions for Lieutenancy, and the Peace, in their several Countreys. For my part, I had no cause to grieve at this, since it was his Majesties pleasure; but it was by the actors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> therein understood otherwise, they supposing that this power gave me the more Authority and Splendor in the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                           <p>To deliver therefore truly the state of this Question,<note place="margin">Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion Court.</note> It cannot be denied, but that it was a great point of policy for the establishing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Ecclesiastical, and consequently Civil Estate also, to erect
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:35668:241"/>
such a Court, whereby Church-men that exorbitated in any grievous manner, might be castigated, and rectified, and such sort of crimes in the Layety might be censured as were of Ecclesiastical Cognisance. And verily this is of great use in the Kingdom, as well for cherishing the Study of the Civil Law, as otherwise: So that it be kept incorruptible, and with that integrity, as so grave a Meeting and Assembly requireth. That was principally my care, who took much pains and spent much money, that in fair and commendable sort, Justice was indifferently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to all the Kings people that had to do with us: But every one might see that this was to my singular trouble; for besides that to keep things in a streight course, sometimes in fits of the Gout, I was forced by my Servants to be carried into the Court, where I could not speak much, but with difficulty; I was at no time free from Petitions, from Examinations, from signing of Warrants, to call some, to release others, from giving way to speeding and forwarding Acts of Courts; Suitors as their fashion is being so importunate, as that in Summer and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Winter, in the day, and in the night, in sickness and health, they would not be denied.</p>
                           <p>These things were daily dispatched by me out of Duty, and more out of Charity, no allowance being of pay from the King, or of Fee from the Subject, to us that were the Judges: Nay, I may say more, the holding of that Court in such sort as I did, was very expenceful to me out of my private Purse, in giving weekly entertainment to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners; the reason whereof was this, King <hi>Iames</hi> being desirous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when he made me Archbishop, that all matters should gravely and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably be carried, directed me, that I should always call some of the Bishops that were about <hi>London,</hi> and some Divines, and Civilians, that by a good presence, Causes might be handled for the reputation of the action, and willed me therewithal to imitate therein, the Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> who invited weekly some of the Judges to dinner, the rather to allure them thither. This advice proceeded from the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> that now is, which was not ill if it came from a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The High Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers chargeable to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop.</note>I obeyed it singly, and did that which was enjoyned: But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in those times the Commissioners were but few, since that time there hath been such an inundation of all sorts of men into that Company, that without proportion, both Lords Spiritual and Temporal, Commissioners and not Commissioners, resorted thither, and divers of them brought so many of their men, that it was truly a burthen to me. I think it may by my Officers be justified upon Oath, That since I was Archbishop, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thing alone hath cost me out of my private estate One thousand pounds and a half, and if I did say Two thousand pounds, it were not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, besides all the trouble of my Servants; who neither directly nor indirectly gained six pence thereby in a whole year, but onely travel and pains for their Masters honor, and of that they had enough: My Houses being like a great Hostry every Thursday in the Term; and for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences no man giving me so much as thanks.</p>
                           <p>Now this being the true Case, if the Church and Commonwealth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> be well provided for in the Administration of Justice, and regard be had of the Publick, can any discreet man think that the removing of me from this molestation, is any true punishment upon me: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one that have framed my self to Reality, and not to Opinion, and growing more and more in years, and consequently into weakness,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:35668:241"/>
having before surfeited so long of worldly shews, whereof nothing is truly gained temporally but vexation of spirit; I have had enough of these things and do not dote upon them: The world, I hope, hath found me more stayed and reserved in my Courses.</p>
                           <p>Nevertheless, whatsoever was expedient for this, was dispatched by me while I lived at <hi>Lambeth</hi> and <hi>Croyden,</hi> albeit I went not out of door.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Yea, but you were otherwise inutile, not coming to the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> nor to the Council-Table?</p>
                           <p>My pain or weakness by the Gout,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty permitted him not to come to the Star-chamber, or Council-Table.</note> must excuse me herein. When I was younger, and had my health, I so diligently attended at the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> that for full seven years I was not one day wanting. And for the Council-Table, the same reason of my Indisposition may satisfie: But there are many other things that do speak for me. The greatest matters there handled, were for Money, or more Attempts of War: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> For the one of these, we of the Clergy had done our parts already; the Clergy having put themselves into Paiments of Subsidy by an Act of Parliament, not only for these two last years, when the Temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lay in a sort dry, but yet there are three years behind, in which our Paiments run on with weight enough unto us; And no man can justly doubt but my hand was in those Grants in a principal fashion.</p>
                           <p>And concerning the Provisions for War, I must confess mine igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the Feats thereof: I knew not the grounds whereupon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies were entred in general: I thought that before Wars were begun there should be store of Treasure; That it was not good to fall out with many great Princes at once; That the turning of our Forces an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way, must needs be some diminution from the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was engaged by us into the Quarrel for the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and hazarded both his Person and Dominions in the prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Question. These matters I thought upon, as one that had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sometimes been acquainted with Councils; but I kept my thoughts unto my self.</p>
                           <p>Again, I was never sent for to the Council-Table, but I went, saving one time, when I was so ill, that I might not stir abroad.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, I was sure that there wanted no Councellors at the Board, the Number being so much increased as it was. Besides, I had no great encouragement to thrust my crasie Body abroad, since I saw what little esteem was made of me in those things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to mine own Occupation: With Bishopricks, and Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or other Church-Places. I was no more acquainted, then if I had dwelt at <hi>Venice,</hi> and understood of them but by some <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had the managing of these things, as it was generally conceived: For, what was he not fit to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, in Church, or Commonwealth; in Court, or Council; in Peace, or War; at Land, or at Sea; at Home, or in Foreign <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> parts?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Montague</hi> had put out his <hi>Arminian</hi> Book; I threee times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it, but he was held up against me, and by the Duke magnified as a well-deserving man.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Cosens</hi> put out his Treatise, which they commonly call [<hi>The Seven Sacraments</hi>;] which, in the first Edition, had many strange
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:35668:242"/>
things in it, as it seemeth: I knew nothing of it, but as it pleased my Lord of <hi>Durham,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Bath:</hi> So the World did read.</p>
                           <p>We were wont in the High-Commission to repress obstinate and busie Papists: In the end of King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, a Letter was brought me under the Hand and Signet of the King, That we must not meddle with any such matter, nor exact the Twelve-pence for the Sunday of those which came not to the Church, (with which Forfeit we never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> medled.) And this was told us to be in contemplation of a Marriage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> the Daughter of <hi>France.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>After the death of King <hi>Iames,</hi> such another Letter was brought from King <hi>Charls,</hi> and all Execution against Papists was suspended. But when the Term was at <hi>Reading,</hi> by open divulgation in all Courts under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> We and all Magistrates are set at liberty to do as it was prescribed by Law: And now our Pursuvants must have their Warrants again, and take all the Priests they can, whereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Mr. <hi>Cross</hi> took fourteen or fifteen in a very short space. Not long after, all these are set free; and Letters come from the King under his Royal Signet, That all Warrants must be taken from our Messengers, because they spoiled the Catholicks, and carried themselves unorderly unto them, especially the Bishops Pursuvants: Whereas we had in all but two; <hi>Cross</hi> my Messenger, for whom I did ever offer to be answerable; and <hi>Thomlinson,</hi> for whom my Lord of <hi>London</hi> (I think) would do as much. But the Caterpillers indeed, were the Pursuvants used by the Secretaries,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> men of no value, and shifters in the world, who had been punished and turned away by us for great misdemeanors.</p>
                           <p>But truth of Religion and Gods service, was wont to overrule hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Policies, and not to be overruled; And I am certain that things best prosper, where those courses are held. But be it what it may be, I could not tell what to make of this variation of the Compass; since it was only commanded unto me to put such and such things in execution, but I never understood any thing of the Councel, whereby I might give <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> my Judgment how fit, or unfit they were, or might speak to alter the Tenure, whereunto in former times I had been otherwise used. Variety of Reasons breedeth variety of Actions.</p>
                           <p>For the matter of the Loan, I knew not a long time what to make of it: I was not present when the Advice was taken; I understood not what was the Foundation whereupon the Building was raised, neither did ever any of the Council acquaint me therewith. I saw on the one side the Kings necessity for Money, and especially it being resolved that the Wat should be pursued; And on the other side I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that in the Parliament great Sums were offered, if the Petitions of the Commons might be hearkened unto. It ran still in my mind, That the old and usual way was best; That in Kingdoms, the harmony was sweetest, where the Prince and the People tuned well together; That, whatsoever pretence of Greatness, he was but an unhappy man that set the King and the Body of the Realm at division; That the People (though not fit to be too much cockered, yet) are they, that must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> pray, that must pay, that must fight for their Princes; That it could not be, but a Man so universally hated in the Kingdom as the Duke was, must for the preservation of himself desperately adventure on any thing, if he might be hearkened unto.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="459" facs="tcp:35668:242"/>These Meditations I had with my self; and God knoweth I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in my prayers did beg, That he whom these things did most concern, would seriously think upon them. It ran in my mind, that this new Device for Money could not long hold out; That then we must return into the High-way, whither it were best to retire our selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the shortest Errors being the best. But these thoughts I suppressed within my soul; neither did I ever discourage any man from Lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nor encourage any man to hold back: Which I confidently avouch.</p>
                           <p>At the opening of the Commission for the Loan, <hi>I</hi> was sent for from <hi>Croyden.</hi> It seemed to me a strange thing; but <hi>I</hi> was told there, That howsoever it shewed, the King would have it so, there was no speaking against it. <hi>I</hi> had not heard, that men throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should lend Money against their will; <hi>I</hi> knew not what to make of it: But when <hi>I</hi> saw in the Instructions, the Refusers should be sent away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for Soldiers to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> I began to remember <hi>Urias</hi> that was sent in the Forefront of the Battel; and to speak truth, <hi>I</hi> durst not be tender in it. And when afterwards <hi>I</hi> saw, that men were to be put to their Oath, With whom they had had Conference, and whether any did disswade them? And yet further beheld, that divers were to be imprisoned: I thought this was somewhat a New world. Yet all this while <hi>I</hi> swallowed my own spittle, and spake nothing of it to any man. Nay, when after some trial in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> the first Sitting was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for <hi>Surrey</hi> in my House at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and the Lords were there assembled with the Justices of the whole County, <hi>I</hi> gave them entertainment in no mean fashion: And <hi>I</hi> sate with them, albeit <hi>I</hi> said nothing; for the confusion was such, that <hi>I</hi> knew not what to make of it: Things went on every day, and speech was of much Money to be raised out of some Counties; yet afterwards it was not so readily paid, as preferred; and at length some refused even in <hi>London</hi> it self, and <hi>Southwark,</hi> besides many Gentlemen of special rank, and some Lords, as it was said. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> though it was reported that they were but a contemptible company, yet the Prisons in <hi>London</hi> demonstrated that they were not a very few, but persons both of note and number. The Judges besides concurring another way; That they could not allow the Legality of the Demand, and the Enforcement that is used thereupon, did somewhat puzzle me for being too busie in promoting of that, for which <hi>I</hi> might one day suffer. Yet hitherto <hi>I</hi> remained silent, hoping that time would break that off, which was almost come to an absolute period. But in stead of this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by the permission of God, <hi>I</hi> was called up to the King to look clearly into the Question. When the Allowance of <hi>Sibthorp's</hi> Pamphlet was put upon me, <hi>I</hi> then had some reason out of the grounds of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to fear, (and <hi>I</hi> pray God that my fear was in vain) that the Duke had a purpose to turn upside down the Laws, and the whole Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Courses, and Liberties of the Subject; and to leave us not under the Statutes and Customs which our Progenitors enjoyed, but to the pleasure of Princes; of whom, as some are gentle and benign, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> so some others, to ingr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Besides now it came in my heart, that I was present at the Kings Coronation, where many things on the Princes part were solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; which being observed would keep all in order, and the King should have a loving and faithful people, and the Commons should have a
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:35668:243"/>
a kinde and gracious King. The contemplation of these things made me stay my Judgment; not any unwillingness to do my Prince any dutiful service, whom I must and do honor above all the Creatures in the world, and will adventure as far for his true good, as any one whatsoever. But I am loth to plunge my self so over head and ears in these difficulties, that I can neither live with quietness of conscience, nor depart out of the world with good fame and estimation. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps my Soveraign, if hereafter he looked well into this Paradox,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> would of all the world hate me, because one of my profession, age and calling, would deceive him, and with base flattery swerve from the truth. <hi>The hearts of Kings are in the hand of God, and he can turn them as the rivers of water.</hi>

King <hi>Iames,</hi> for many insolencies, grew weary of <hi>Somerset</hi>; and the Kingdom groaning under the Triumvirate of <hi>Northampton, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Somerset,</hi> (though <hi>Northampton</hi> soon after died) was glad to be rid of him. We could have no way so good to effectuate that which was the common desire, as to bring in another in his room; One nail (as the Proverb is) being to be driven out by another. It was now observed that the King began to cast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his eye upon <hi>George Villiers,</hi> who was then Cup-bearer, and seemed a modest and courteous Youth. But King <hi>Iames</hi> had a fashion, that he would never admit any to nearness about himself, but such a one as the Queen should commend unto him, and make some suit on his behalf; That if the Queen afterwards being ill intreated, should complain of this <hi>Dear one,</hi> he might make his answer, <hi>It is long of your self, for you were the Party that commended him unto me.</hi> Our old Master took delight strangely in things of this nature.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                           </p>
                           <p>That Noble Queen (who now resteth in Heaven) knew her Husband well; and having been bitten with Favorites both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was very shie to adventure upon this request. King <hi>Iames</hi> in the mean time more and more loathed <hi>Somerset,</hi> and did not much conceal it that his affection increased towards the other. But the Queen would not come to it, albeit divers Lords (whereof some are dead, and some yet living) did earnestly sollicit her Majesty thereunto. When it would not do, I was very much moved to put to my helping hand; they knowing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was graciously pleased to give me more credit then ordinary; which all her Attendants knew she continued to the time of her death. I laboured much, but could not prevail: The Queen oft saying to me; <q>
                                 <hi>My Lord, You and the rest of your Friends know not what you do: I know your Master better then you all; For if this Young man be once brought in, the first persons that he will plague must be you that labor for him, yea I shall have my part also; The King will teach him to despise and hardly intreat us all, that he may seem to be beholden to none but himself.</hi>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Noble Queen! how like a Prophetess or Oracle did you speak!</p>
                           <p>Notwithstanding this we were still instant, telling her Majesty that the Change would be for the better: For, <hi>George</hi> was of a good nature, which the other was not; And if he should degenerate, yet it would be a long time before he were able to attain to that height of evil which the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:35668:243"/>
other had. In the end upon importunity Queen <hi>Anne</hi> condescended, and so pressed it with the King, that he assented thereunto: Which was so stricken while the Iron was hot, that in the Queens Bed-chamber the King Knighted him with the Rapier which the Prince did wear. And when the King gave order to swear him of the Bed-chamber, <hi>Somerset,</hi> who was near, importuned the King with a message, that he might be only sworne a Groom: But my self and others that were at the door, sent to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> her Majesty, that she would perfect her work, and cause him to be sworne a Gentleman of the Chamber. There is a Lord or two living that had a hand in this atchievement; I diminish nothing of their praise for so happy a work: But I know my own part best; and, in the word of an honest man, I have reported nothing but truth. <hi>George</hi> went in with the King; but no sooner he got loose, but he came forth unto me into the Privy-gallery, and there embraced me: He professed that he was so infinitely bound unto me, that all his life long he must honor me as his Father. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And now he did beseech me that I would give him some lessons how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The first was, That daily upon his knees he should pray to God to bless the King his Master, and to give him <hi>(George)</hi> grace studiously to serve and please him. The second was, That he should do all good offices between the King and the Queen, and between the King and the Prince. The third was, That he should fill his Masters ears with nothing but Truth. I made him repeat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> these three things unto me, and then I would have him to acquaint the King with them, and so tell me when I met him again, what the King said unto him. He promised me he would; and the morrow after, Mr. <hi>Tho. Murrey</hi> the Princes Tutor and I standing together in the Gallery at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> Sir <hi>Geo. Villeirs</hi> coming forth and drawing to us, he told Mr. <hi>Murrey</hi> how much he was beholden unto me, and that I had given him certain Instructions; which I prayed him to rehearse, as indifferently well he did before us; yea, and that he had acquainted the King with them, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> said, They were Instructions worthy of an Archbishop to give to a Young man. His countenance of thankfulness for a few days continued, but not long either to me, or any other his Welwishers. The Roman Historian <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath somewhere a note, That benefits while they may be requited seem courtesies; but when they are so high that they cannot be repaid, they prove matters of hatred.</p>
                           <p>Thus, to lie by me to quicken my remembrance, I have laid down the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Cause and the Proceedings of my sending into <hi>Kent,</hi> where I remain at the writing of this Treatise: Praying God to bless and guide our King aright; To continue the prosperity and welfare of this Kingdom, which at this time is shrewdly shaken; To send good and worthy men to be Governors of our Church: To prosper my mind and body, that I may do nothing that may give a wound to my Conscience; and then to send me patience quietly to endure whatsoever his Divine Majesty shall be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> pleased to lay upon me; <hi>Da quod jubes, &amp; jube quod vis</hi>! And in the end to give me such a happy deliverance either in life or death, as may be most for his glory, and for the wholsom example of others, who look much on the Actions and Passions of Men of my Place.</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Darnell</hi> was the first that was brought to the Bar upon that Writ; where the Kings Attorney-General Sir <hi>Robert Heath</hi> did inform the Court, that his Majesty told him, He heard that some of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the imprisoned Gentlemen for the Loan did report, That the King did deny them the Course of Justice; And therefore his Majesty command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to renew the Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> lest they should not move for another themselves, by reason the Warden of the <hi>Fleet</hi> had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the first according to his duty.</p>
            <p>To this Sir <hi>Thomas Darnell</hi> replied, That such words never came into his thoughts: And did humbly pray they might make no impression up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Court to the disparagement of his Cause; for he was accused of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that he was in no manner guilty of. Upon which Sir <hi>Nicholas Hide</hi> Chief Justice said, That he had made a fair and temperate Answer: And you may perceive (said the Chief Justice) the upright and sincere proceedings which have been in this business: You no sooner moved for a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> but it was granted you; you no sooner desired Council, but they were assigned you, though any Council might move for you without being assigned, and should have had no blame for it: The Kings pleasure is, his Law should take place and be executed, and for that do we sit here; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And whether the Commitment be by the King or others, this Court is the place where the King doth sit in person to do right, if injury be done: And we have power to examine it; and if it appear that any man hath wrong done him by his Imprisonment, we have power to deliver and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him; if otherwise, he is to be remanded by us to Prison again. And the Attorney-General, after the Chief Justice had spoken, said, Though this be a Case which concerns the King in an high degree, yet he hath been so gracious and so just, as not to refuse the Examination <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and Determination thereof according to the Laws of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Then the Court proceeded to hear the Arguments made in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners behalf. Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> argued for Sir <hi>Walter Earl,</hi> Serjeant <hi>Bramston</hi> for Sir <hi>Iohn Heveningham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> for Sir <hi>Edward Hampden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calthrop</hi> for Sir <hi>Iohn Corbet,</hi> who were all assigned of Council with the Prisoners
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:35668:244"/>
by the Court of Kings-Bench, upon a Petition delivered by them to that purpose. After they had argued, Mr. Attorney had a day appointed to argue for the King. It is not our intention to take up the Readers time with the Arguments at large, either by the one side, or the other: We shall only hint unto you some generals, chiefly concerning the form of the Return of the Writ. The first Exception taken by the Council for the imprisoned Gentlemen, was to the form of the Return.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 1. For that the Return is not positive, but referred to the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by another, (by the Lords of the Council.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Keepers of the Prisons have not return'd the Cause of the Commitment, but the Cause of the Cause; which they held not to be good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Return of the Commitment is imperfect, for that it sheweth onely the Cause of the detaining in Prison, and not the Cause of the first Commitment.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That the Return is contradictory in it self: For that in the first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> part thereof it is certified, that the detaining of those Gentlemen in Prison is <hi>per speciale mandatum Domini Regis</hi>; And when the Warrant of the Lords of the Council is shewn, it appeareth that the Commitment is by the command of the King signified by the Lords of the Council.</p>
            <p>The second general Exception was to the matter of the Return; and that was touching the Imprisonment, <hi>per speciale mandatum Domini Regis,</hi> by the Lords of the Council, without any Cause expressed. Wherefore, said Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> by the constant and setled Laws of this Kingdom (without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which we have nothing) no man can be justly imprisoned either by the King or Council, without a Cause of the Commitment; and that ought to be expressed in the Return. The Law saith expresly, No Free-man shall be imprisoned without due Process of the Law: <hi>Nullus liber homo capiatur vel imprisonetur nisi per legem terrae, &amp;c.</hi> And in the Charter of King <hi>Iohn</hi> there are these words, <hi>Nec eum in carcerem mittimus,</hi> We will not commit him to Prison; that is, <hi>The King himself will not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This right (said Serjeant <hi>Bramston</hi>) is the onely means that a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hath whereby to obtain his Liberty; and the end of it is to return the Cause of the Imprisonment, that it may be examined in this Court whether the parties ought to be discharged or not: Which cannot be done upon this Return; for the Cause of the Imprisonment is so far from appearing particularly by it, that there is no Cause at all expressed: And the Writ requires that the Cause of the Imprisonment should be returned, and the Cause ought to be expressed so far, as that it ought to be none of those Causes for which by the Laws of the Kingdom the Subject ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not to be imprisoned; and it ought to be expressed, that it was by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment or Indictment, or upon Petition or Suggestion made unto the King. For (said he) observe but the consequence: If those Gentlemen who are committed without any Cause shewn, should not be bailed, but remanded; the Subjects of the Kingdom may be restrained of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for ever, and by Law there can be no remedy. We shall not reflect upon the present time and Government; but we are to look what may betide us in time to come hereafter. The Laws are called the great Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of every Subject, and the Inheritance of Inheritances, without which we have nothing that deserves the name of Inheritance.</p>
            <p>If upon a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> a Cause of Commitment be certified, then (said Mr. <hi>Noy</hi>) the Cause is to be tryed before your Lordships; but if no Cause be shewn, the Court must do that which standeth with Law and Justice, and that is to deliver the party. The Commons did complain in
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:35668:245"/>
               <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. his time, that the great Charter and other Statutes were broken; They desired, that for the good of himself and his people they may be kept and put in execution, and not infringed by making any Arrest by special command, or otherwise. And the Answer which was given them was this, That the said great Charter and other Statutes should be put in execution according to the Petition, without disturbance of Arrests by special command; And the King granteth the Commons desire in the same words as they were expressed in their Petition. And afterwards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> complaining again, That notwithstanding this Answer of the King, they were imprisoned by special command, without Indictment or other legal course of Law: The Kings Answer was upon another Petition unto him, That he was therewith well pleased; And for the future he added further, <hi>If any man be grieved, let him complain, and right shall be done.</hi> And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as it doth not appear to the Court, that there was any Cause of the Commitment of these Members, no Charge against them, no Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Process according to the Laws: Wherefore Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> prayed they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> might be no longer detained in Prison, but be bailed or discharged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Admit the Commitment of the Command of the King was lawful, yet, said Mr. <hi>Calthorp,</hi> when a man hath continued in prison a reasonable time, he ought to be brought to answer, and not to continue still in prison without being brought to answer; For that it appeareth by the Books of our Laws, that Liberty is a thing so favored of the Law, that the Law will not suffer the continuance of a man in prison for any longer time then of necessity it must: And therefore the Law will neither suffer the Party,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Sheriffs or Judges to continue a man in prison by their power and pleasure. It doth speak of the delivery of a man out of prison with as reasonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition as may be: And upon this reason it hath been resolved, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Law alloweth that there may be a Term between the <hi>Teste</hi> of an Original Writ, and the Return of the same, where there is only a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and no Imprisonment of the body; yet the Law will not allow that there should be a Term between the <hi>Teste</hi> of a Writ of <hi>Capias,</hi> and the Return of the same, where the body of a man is to be imprison'd; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that it will give no way that the party shall have power to continue the body of a man longer time in prison then needs must; so tender is the Law of the Subjects Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 27. of <hi>November,</hi> the Attorney-General argued for the King, That this was a very great Cause, and hath raised great expectation; and he was afraid that those Gentlemen whom it concerns, have rather advised their Councils, then their Councils them. For the first Exception, That the Return is not positive, but hath relation to some others; He did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> conceive it was positive enough: For (said he) the words are, <hi>Quod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentus est sub custodia mea per speciale mandatum Domini Regis:</hi> The other words [<hi>mihi significatum</hi>] they follow after, but are not part of the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation made before it. And if they will have it as they seem to understand it, then they must return the words thus; <hi>Quod significatum est mihi per Dominos Privati Consilii, quod detentus est per speciale mandatum Domini Regis</hi>; And then it had not been their own proper Return, but the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of another, the Lords of the Council. The turning of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> would resolve this point; the thing it self must speak for it self: It is clear, it is a positive Return, that the detaining is by the command of the King; and the rest of the Return is rather satisfaction to the Court, then any part of the Return. And for the other Exception, That the Cause of the Cause is returned, and not the Cause it self; He said, Among the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:35668:245"/>
Logicians there are two Causes; there is <hi>Causa causans,</hi> and <hi>Causa cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sata.</hi> The <hi>Causa causans</hi> here in this Case, is not the Warrant from the Lords of the Council, for that is <hi>Causa causata:</hi> But the primary and original Cause, which is <hi>Causa causans,</hi> is, <hi>Speciale mandatum Domini Regis</hi>; the other is but the Councils signification, or testification, or Warrant for him that made the Return. And for the other Exception, The Cause is imperfect, because it shews only the Cause of detaining in Prison, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and not the Cause of the first Commitment; He conceives it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for an Officer of the Law to answer, That the Writ is a Command to make a Return of the detaining of the Prisoner, and he accordingly makes a Return of the Detention; and if the Keeper of the Prison had only said they were detained <hi>per speciale mandatum, &amp;c.</hi> it had been good.</p>
            <p>Then he proceeded to the matter of the Return, and to answer the Book-Cases and Records that had been cited by the Council for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Prisoners, and to produce Presidents on the Kings behalf; which are extant in Print, to which the Reader is referred.</p>
            <p>Afterwards Sir <hi>Nicholas Hide</hi> Chief Justice, Justice <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> Justice <hi>Iones,</hi> and Justice <hi>Whitlock</hi> being upon the Bench, and Sir <hi>Iohn Heveningham</hi> and the forementioned Prisoners being brought to the Bar, Sir <hi>Nicholas Hide</hi> Lord Chief Justice, by the consent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Judges, spake to this purpose:</p>
            <p>That the Court hath seriously considered what hath been spoken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by either side, and are grown to a resolution; And that his Brothers have enjoined him to deliver unto you the resolution of the whole Court; And therefore (said he) though it be delivered by my mouth, it is the resolution of us all. I am sure you expect Justice from hence, and God forbid we should sit here but to do Justice to all men according to our best skill and knowledge, as it is our oaths and duties so to do. But this is a Case of very great weight, and great expectation, and requires more solemn Arguments then the time will now permit. The Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which have been taken to this Return, are two; the one for the form, the other for the substance. First for the form, because it is not returned, as they say, positively and absolutely, but with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to a Warrant of the Lords of the Council: Now the Court is of opinion, That this is a positive and absolute Return, upon this reason, That the Keeper of the Prison first returns, that they are detained by the special command of the King; And if they had ceased there, it had been positive: And for that which follows, That it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> signified to him by the Lords of the Council, this is only to certifie the Court that he returned the Cause truly, and not to shew us that he had no knowledge of the Cause but by the signification of the Lords of the Council: There is not one word in the Writ that demands the cause why they were taken, but why they are detained. So that that point in the Writ is sufficiently answered, which was only to certifie the cause of the detention: And therefore we resolve, That the form of this Return is good.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> The next thing is the main point in Law, Whether the substance or matter of the Return be good, or no? Where in the substance is this; He doth certifie that they are detained in Prison by the special command of the King: And whether this be good in Law, or no, is the Question. Here the Lord Chief Justice did mention the several Presidents and Book-Cases cited by each side, too long to be here related.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="466" facs="tcp:35668:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>And concluded, That that which is now to be judged by us, is this, Whether one that is committed by the Kings authority, and no Cause shewn of his Commitment, according as here it is upon this Return, whether we ought to deliver him by Bail, or to remand him back again? Where by the way you must know, that we can take notice only of <hi>this Return</hi>; That when the Case appears to us no otherwise then by the Return, we are not bound to examine the truth thereof, but the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of the Return: We cannot judge upon rumors or reports, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> upon that which is before us on Record, which is examinable by us whether it be sufficient, or not.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> hath told you, That the King hath done it; And we trust him in great matters: And we make no doubt but the King, if you seek to him, knowing the cause why you are imprisoned, will have mercy; but we leave that, we must not counsel you: If in Justice we ought to deliver you, we would do it; But upon these grounds, Records, Presidents and Resolutions cited and produced, the Court is of opinion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they cannot deliver you, but you must be remanded.</p>

               </note>Whilst these Arguments about the Loan were in agitation, (which began in <hi>October</hi> in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term) various Reports and Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments came from the Isle of <hi>Rhee:</hi> Sometime, That they were in a Treaty with the Duke to surrender the Citadel unto him; Others wrote, That it was but a device of the Governor to get time till Relief came: And many were dissatisfied with the Presents and Complements <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which passed between the Duke and the Governor of the Citadel; Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities to an enraged Enemy (as was said) seldom producing good effect.

            <p>But before the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> set sail, let us see what they are doing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> at the Isle of <hi>Rhee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first news we meet with there,<note place="margin">The Citadel at <hi>Rhee</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</note> is, That the <hi>French</hi> (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Army at Land, and a hundred Sail of Ships at Sea) had got into the Harbor with relief of Provisions: And that Sir <hi>Iohn Burroughs,</hi> the 20. of <hi>September,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> slain.</note> going to take a view of the Works, was shot with a bullet, whereof he presently dyed; His death was much lamented, having been a great Honor to the English Nation both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> About this time landeth Sir <hi>Pierce Crossby,</hi> and some other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, with about Sixteen hundred <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> which came as an Assistance to the Forces before <hi>Rhee.</hi> And now <hi>Toras</hi> the Governor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to foresee want, notwithstanding his late supply, and to study all ways and means how to give advertisement to the King of <hi>France</hi> of the low condition he was reduced unto.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Toras</hi> sends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Sandgrein,</hi> a Frenchman, adventured out of the Citadel, and privately escaped the Guards, and got with Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the King of <hi>France:</hi> Yet <hi>Toras</hi> fearing left he might miscarry, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> prevailed with three of his men, promising large rewards, to adventure their lives, and to swim to the shore of the main Continent: Two miscarried, but the third got safe, and delivered the Message which the Governor entrusted him with. In the mean time more small Vessels got into the Harbor under the Citadel, and was a further (though small) Supply unto them.</p>
            <p>But the King of <hi>France</hi> was extremely allarm'd by the advertisement from <hi>Toras,</hi> and thereupon blocks up <hi>Rochel</hi> with his Army, as if he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> designed the taking of it; but the main end in seeming to design the Army against <hi>Rochel,</hi> was thereby to take the opportunity to be near at hand to land Forces under the favor of the Little-Fort, so much neglected at first, and to put Victuals into the Citadel at S. <hi>Martins,</hi> which was at that time reduced to a low condition. And the same was effected time after time, and supplies of men and victuals got in, notwithstanding the English Guards at Land and Sea, which now and then took some of the Vessels; but nevertheless so much provision got in, as served their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in the Citadel to the end of the Siege.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Rochellers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Rochellers</hi> at last declare for <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> after they had in vain continued promises of obedience to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and entettained a division among the Protestants, one Party crossing another, and finding the evil consequence of the division, they put forth a <hi>Manifesto,</hi> and declare for <hi>England</hi>; and the Duke of <hi>Rhoan</hi> having given Commissions to raise Forces to assist the <hi>English,</hi> declareth in preservation of the Edict of two Peaces, and protesteth not to demand any thing but the observation of the said Edicts. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> On the other part the King of <hi>France</hi> declareth and promiseth, That he will on his part observe the said Edict: And further declares the Duke of <hi>Rhoan</hi> to be drawn to death; and declares <hi>Sobiez</hi> a Traitor, and that he that should kill him, should be accounted Noble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="468" facs="tcp:35668:247"/>By this time the <hi>French</hi> had got a great supply of Shipping from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for their assistance, which with their own made up above a hundred Sail,<note place="margin">A Treaty for Surrender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke and <hi>Toras.</hi>
               </note> (exceeding the English Navy in number) yet did avoid engaging with the English Fleet, exercising all their skill and art how to get in a good and round supply of Provision into the Citadel; and <hi>Toras</hi> the Governor employed his wit to gain time to that end, by entertaining a Treaty of Surrender upon honorable terms; and prevails with the Duke that he may first send to the King of <hi>France,</hi> that he might come off with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> honor: The Duke consents thereunto, on condition that an English Gentleman, an Attendant upon the Duke, might go with that Party which <hi>Toras</hi> sent, and have a safe conduct through <hi>France</hi> to pass into <hi>England.</hi> And so they both go to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> where the English Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was secured, but the Party whom <hi>Toras</hi> sent did his errand, and no doubt gave the King of <hi>France</hi> a perfect account of their condition in the Citadel; whilst the English Gentleman was detained that he could not do the like service for the King of <hi>England,</hi> in delivering to him what he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in command from the Duke. The French Gentleman returns to the Leagure at S. <hi>Martins</hi>; but by reason the English Gentleman was not permitted to go for <hi>England,</hi> the Frenchman was not permitted to go again into the Citadel.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Citadel reliev'd again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
               <hi>Toras</hi> again renews the Treaty, pretending that if he had not Relief such a day by such an hour, he would surrender: And spun out the time so long, that in good earnest Relief got in both of men, victuals and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and the same Vessels which brought the Relief, carried away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the sick and wounded, and unserviceable men in the Citadel. So the Treaty proceeded no further; and the Enemy holds upon their Pike-heads Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Capons, Turkies, &amp;c. to let the English see they had no want. Now we go to work with Mine and Battery; And presently also comes news, that the French had landed more Forces near the <hi>Meadow-Castle,</hi> (a place also at the first neglected, though then unmanned) And orders are given to draw out men (leaving the Trenches unguarded) to encounter the French that were landed: Which was performed with some reasonable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> success; but the Enemy got security under the Castle, and thereupon the English retreated, and were enforced to fight to recover their Trenches, which the Enemy had now possessed, and many mens lives were lost in the regaining thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Retreat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved on.</note>This last refreshment of the Enemy (being about the middle of <hi>October</hi>) caused the Duke to enter into Council, and to think of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution for a Retreat; which he communicated to <hi>Sobiez,</hi> and tells him further, That the season is past, his Army diminished, his Victuals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and his Council of War had judged it fitting to retire.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sobiez</hi> against it.</note> 
               <hi>Sobiez</hi> answered the Duke, That the Earl of <hi>Holland's</hi> Fleet was coming with Supplies; that the Relief given was not considerable; that the Retreat would draw after it the loss of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and thereby make <hi>Sobiez</hi> guilty of the ruine thereof; but above all, it would bring an irreparable prejudice and dishonor upon his Master of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that had made an Enterprise of so little honor and profit. Upon this the Duke continues the Siege, and shortly after resolves to storm the Citadel and Works; <note place="margin">The Citadel stormed.</note> to which (it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> was said) the English Commanders were much averse, but the French Commanders were zealous for it: And so for a farewell, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 6. a vain Attempt was made on all sides of the Citadel. In short, we lost men and honor; for the Fort was unaccessible, besides well manned with fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of men newly put in: And having left many dead and hurt, we were
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:35668:247"/>
forced to retire. This ill success, with the advise given that the Troops of the other Forts did increase, (the French, notwithstanding our Shipping, pouring their Forces amain into the Island) hastened the Duke to raise the Siege and to retreat, to ship his men again for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Novemb.</hi> 8. early in the morning the Drums beat,<note place="margin">The Army retreats.</note> and the Army pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for a March; but scarce had the Rearguard come out, but the Troops of the Enemy appeared equal in number for Foot, and far stronger in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Horse, which the Enemy had (during the Siege) landed in the Island under the favor of the Little-Fort, and the Meadow-Castle, (the two places so strangely omitted at the first to be possessed by the English:) Yet notwithstanding their strength, and the advantage of falling upon an Army on a retreat, which had endured much hardship and received many discouragements, would not the Enemy engage in plain field, when the Duke several times drew up the Army in their march, and made a stand in hopes of a Battel. But the wary French Commander shunned the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Fight on equal terms, foreseeing a greater advantage with less ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: For no sooner were the English entred into the Narrow Causey and Lane, having on each hand deep ditches and Salt-pits, but the Enemy observed the advantage, and that the English had neglected to raise a Fort at the entry of the Causey to secure their retreat, and (yet worse) that they had not raised a Fort at the further end thereof near the Bridge to secure the passage over it, but had only raised a small Work not tenable on the further side of the Bridge, whereupon the Enemy advanced with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> great fury on a weak Rearguard of Horse,<note place="margin">The Enemy engageth the Rear of the Army.</note> and quickly put them to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, who in that Narrow Causey disordered the Foot, and the Enemy thereby took the advantage, followed close and did much execution upon the English: Those who escaped the sword, were drowned in the Salt-pits and Ditches; and the Crowd was so great on the Bridge, (the Enemy pursuing them over) that many English were drowned in the River. Yet in this discom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ited condition the English took courage, faced about, ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied their Forces, made up a smart body that drew up to fight the Enemy; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but the French (not daring to engage but upon great advantage) were enforced to retreat over the Bridge. The English lost several hundreds of men, and many Colors, and great was their dishonor: The loss of the men was not so great, as that they were left upon so unequal terms, where the proof and valor of an Englishman could not put forth it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Novemb.</hi> 9. the Army was shipped, and the Duke promiseth the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> to come again to their relief, and presently after set sail for <hi>England,</hi> meeting with the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> as he was setting out of <hi>Plymouth</hi> coming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with a Supply.</p>
            <p>And now every man passeth his censure upon this Expedition:<note place="margin">Several opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to <hi>Rhe.</hi>
               </note> Some laying the fault upon the Duke, (1) For being too slow in his march after the first landing, whereby the Enemy got in provision and heartned his men. (2) In being too remiss during the Siege, in not preventing provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for going into the Citadel, by doubling Guards at Land and Sea, when the wind stood fair. (3) In omitting to take in the Little Fort, from whence (as it was said) proceeded all the misery that afterwards followed. (4) In <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> retreating before all things were certainly prepared in order to a secure march in narrow places and passages. The Duke pleaded for himself, That he acted for the most part by the advice of a Council of War; and if Orders were given, and not observed, it was not his fault: That had the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> come with a Supply of shipping, men and victuals, so soon as he might and ought to have done, he had then without doubt so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:35668:248"/>
blocked up the Harbor to the Citadel by Sea, that no Provision should have got into it. The Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> answered for himself, That when he was ready to have gone aboard the Fleet at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> the Ships with Provision were not come out of <hi>Chattam</hi>; and when the Provisions were shipt, time was spent before he could get them to a Rendevouz; and when they were come to a Rendevouz, and he ready to set sail with the whole Fleet, the winds proved contrary. But some of the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders when they came into <hi>England,</hi> spake somwhat loudly of other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> miscarriages at <hi>Rhee,</hi> pleading much on the behalf of the Council of War.</p>

               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:35668:248"/>The <hi>Rochellers,</hi> after the Dukes arrival in <hi>England,</hi> sent their Deputies to his Majesty for succor and relief in their distressed condition, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented their Desires in nature of a Remonstrance to the King and the Lords of the Council; wherein they gave his Majesty most humble thanks for the great assistance and comfort they had received by the Fleet sent in <hi>Iuly</hi> last, whereof the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was Admiral, which would have been of greater assistance unto them, had the season of the year per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their stay longer there, or that the supply of Victuals and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition had come unto them which his Majesty had assigned. That they are given to understand, that there is application made to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to propound the making of a Peace between the two Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> a thing to be wished (if really intended:) But the Proceedings of <hi>France</hi> with the Reformed Churches there, hath hitherto been such, as when they spake most fair, and nothing but Peace uttered, nothing less was intended, and great advantages thereby have been taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> against the Reformed Churches. But in case the Treaty do proceed, they humbly prayed, that then his Majesty will be pleased to insist upon the Capitulation which was made upon his mediation, and for which he passed his word that the Reformed Churches should perform on their part, which they kept inviolable till there were Forces placed and kept in Forts against them contrary to Capitulation, and more Forces drawn down in order to the reduction of the Remonstrants, and a Fleet unexpectedly come upon them to destroy their Navigation, when nothing on their part was offered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in violation of the Treaty.</p>
            <p>They did further remonstrate, That now the Forces of <hi>France</hi> are breaking down apace about them totally to block them up by Land, and do intend to make a Barracado cross the Channel, leaving a narrow pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for the flux and reflux of the Sea, and by that means to stop all manner of Provisions by Sea; which evidently remonstrates their further ruine, if they with all expedition have not succor and help from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of <hi>Great Britain:</hi> For their necessities and straits are very great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by reason their Magazines are consumed, their monies spent, and the Inhabitants reduced to small allowances. And therefore do beseech his Majesty with all possible diligence to send them supply of all sorts of Provisions fit for a Siege, and to succor them once more with the Navy-Royal to interrupt the blocking up of the River, otherwise they are inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably lost. And lastly they did humbly beseech his Majesty and the Lords of his Council to have also so far pity of their indigencie and need, as to permit a General Collection to be made in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> of such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> persons whom God shall move to contribute to their succor and relief. And declare that they are resolved still to hold out, hoping yet a Relief would come that might be of advantage unto them; and they were assured thereof by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> at his departure, that he would once more come in person to their assistance.</p>
            <p>In this state of Affairs, it is said, Sir <hi>Robert Gotton</hi> being thereunto called, presented his Advice to certain Lords of the Council in manner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> following.</p>
            <p>AS soon as the House of <hi>Austria</hi> had incorporated it self with <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Robert Cotton's</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice touching the present state of affairs.</note> and by their new Discoveries gotten to themselves the Wealth of the <hi>Indies,</hi> They began to affect, and have ever since pursued a Fifth Monarchy. The Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> would lay the first Foundation of <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <pb n="472" facs="tcp:35668:249"/>
by surprising <hi>Rome:</hi> From this he was thrust by force, and respect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. being made <hi>Caput Foediris</hi> against him. He then attempted <hi>High-Germany,</hi> practising by faction and force to reduce them first to Petty States, and so to his absolute power: In this <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. again prevented him, by laying the Lutheran Princes under this Confederacie and assistance. His Son the Second <hi>Philip</hi> pursued the same Ambition in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> by reduction whereof he intended to make his way further into the others. This the late Queen of <hi>England</hi> interrupted, by siding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with the afflicted people on the one part, and making herself the Head of the Protestant League with the Princes on the other part, drawing in secret o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> State the countenance of <hi>France,</hi> to give the more reputation of assistance to them, and security to it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spain</hi> seeing his hopes thus fruitless by these Unions, and streights, began first to break, if he might, the Amity of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> But finding the Common danger to be a fast tie, he raiseth up a party in that Kingdom of his own; by which the French King was so distressed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that had not the English Council assisted and relieved him, <hi>Spain</hi> had there removed that next and greatest Obstacle of his Ambition.</p>
            <p>His Council now tells him from these examples, That the way to his great work is impossible, so long as <hi>England</hi> lay a let in his way; And adviseth him, that the remove of that Obstacle be the first of his intents. This drew on those often secret practises against the person of the Queen, and his open fury in <hi>Eighty Eight</hi> against the body of the State: which she perceiving, following the advice of a free Council, would never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> after admit of a Peace; winning thereby the hearts of a loving people, who ever found hands and money for all occasions at home, and keeping sacredly all her Alliances abroad, securing to her Confederates all her time freedom from fear of Spanish slavery, and so ended her old and happy days in glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spain</hi> then, by the wisdom and power of that great Lady, despoiled so of his means to hurt, though not of his desires, makes up with her Peaceful Successor of happy memory that Golden League; That dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> us at home by the opinion of Security, and giving them a power in our Councils by believing their Friendships and pretended Marriage, gave them way to cherish amongst us a Party of their own, and benefit of power abroad to lead in Jealousie and some division between us and our Confederates: By which we see they have swallowed up the Fortune of your Majesties Brother's Estate, with the rest of the Imperial States; distressed the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> by that quarrel; diverted <hi>Sweden's</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance by the Wars with the <hi>Pole,</hi> and moving them now with offer of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Danish Crown; And now (whether from the Plot of our Fatality) hath cast such a bone between <hi>France</hi> and us, as hath made themselves by our quarrel of Religion a fast Confederate, and us a dangerous Enemy. So as now we are left no other assurance against their malice and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> where the tie of mutual safety is weakned by daily discontents bred and fed between us by some ill-affected to both our securities, that from the doubtfulness of friendship as we now stand, we may rather suspect from our own domestick Faction, if they grow too <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> furious, they will rather follow the example of <hi>Rome</hi> in her growing (that held that equal safety, honorable and more easie, <hi>dare regnum,</hi> then <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugare provinciam</hi>) considering the power they have in their hands, then to give any friendly assistance to save the present condition of a State. You may therefore see in what terms we stand abroad, and I fear we are
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:35668:249"/>
at home for resistance in no better state. There must be to withstand a Forein Invasion, a proportion both of Sea and Land-Forces: For to give an Enemy an easie passage, and a Port to relieve him in, is no less then to hazard all at one stake.</p>
            <p>And it is to be considered, That no March by Land can be of that speed to make head against the landing of an Enemy. Then that follows, That there is no such prevention, as to be Master of the Sea. To this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> point of Necessary Defence, there can be no less then Two hundred and forty thousand pounds.</p>
            <p>For the Land-Forces, if it were for an Offensive War, the men of less livelihood were the best spared; and we used formerly to make such War <hi>Purgamenta reipub</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we made no further purchase by it. But for the safety of a Commonwealth, the wisdom of all times did never intrust the Publick Cause to any other then to such as had a portion in the Publick Adventure. And that we saw in <hi>Eighty Eight,</hi> when the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> care of the Queen, and of the Council, did make the body of that large Army no other then of the Trained Bands, which with the Auxiliaries of the whole Realm, amounted to no less then Twenty four thousand men. Neither were any of these drawn from forth their Country and proper habitations, before the end of <hi>May,</hi> that they might be no long grievance to the Publick; such Discontentments being to us a more fatal Enemy, then any Forein forces.</p>
            <p>The careful distributing and directing of their Sea and Land-forces, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> being more fitting for a Council of War, then a private man to advise of, I pass over; yet shall ever be willing and ready, when I shall be called, humbly to offer up such Observations as I have gathered by the former like occasion in this Realm.</p>
            <p>To make up this Preparation, there are requisite two things, Money, and Affections; for they cannot be properly severed. It was well and wisely said of that great and grave Councellor the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> in the like case, to the late Queen; <hi>Win hearts, and you have their hands and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> purses.</hi> And I find that of late, Diffidence hath been in the one, and hath unhappily prevented the other.</p>
            <p>In gathering then of Money for this present need, there are three things requisite, <hi>Speed, Assurance,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi>; And the way to gather (as in other like cases hath been done) must be by the path-way formerly called <hi>Via regia,</hi> being more secure and speedy: For by unknown and untrodden ways, it is both rough and tedious, and never succeedeth well. This last way, although it took place as it were by a Supply at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> first, and received no general denial, yet since, it hath drawn many to consult with themselves and others in the consequence, as it is now
conceived a pressure on their Liberties, and against Law. I much fear, if that now again it be offered, either in the same face, or by Privy-seal, it will be refused wholly. Neither find I that the restraint of the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants hath produced any other effect, then a stiff resolution in themselves and others to forbear. Besides, although it were at the first with some assurance, yet when we consider the Commissions and other forms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to such like services, as that how long it hangs in hand, and the many delays that are, we may easily see that such a Sum granted by the Parliament, is far sooner and easier levied.</p>
            <p>If any will make the succession of times to produce an inevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to enforce it if denied, whether in general by Excise or Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, or in particular on some select persons, which is the custom of
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:35668:250"/>
some Countries, and so conclude it, as there, for the Publick State, <hi>suprema lege</hi>; He must look for this to be told him, That seeing Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity must conclude always to gather Money, 'tis less speedy or assured then that by a Parliament: The sucess attendeth the humor of the heedless Multitude, that are full of jealousie and distrust, and so unlike to comply to any unusual Course of Levy, but by force; which if used, the effect is fearful, and hath been fatal to the State. Whereas that by Parliament resteth principally on the Regal person, who may with ease <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and safety mould them to his fit designs by a gracious yielding to their just desires and Petitions.</p>
            <p>If a Parliament then be the most speedy assurance and safe way, it is fit to conceive what is the fairest way to act and work that to the present need.</p>
            <p>First for the time of usual Summons, Forty days, reputed to be too large for this present Necessity, it may be by dating the Writs lessened, since it is no positive Law; so that a care be had that there may a County<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> after the Sheriff hath received the Writ, before the time of sitting. If then the Sum to be levied be once granted and agreed of for the time, there may be in the body of the Grant an Assignment made to the Knights of every County respectively, who under such assurance may safely give Security proportionable to the Receipts, to such as shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture in present for the Publick service any Sums of money.</p>
            <p>The last and weightiest Consideration, if a Parliament be thought fit, is, How to remove or comply the Differences between the King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and Subjects in their mutual demands. And what I have learned amongst the better sort of the Multitude, I will freely declare, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships may be the more enabled to remove, and answer those Distrusts, that either concern Religion, publick safety of the King and State, or the just Liberty of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Religion is a matter that they lay nearest to their Consciences, and they are led by this ground of jealousie to doubt some practices against it. First, for that though the Spanish Match was broken by the careful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of my Lord of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> out of his religious care (as he then declared) that the Articles there demanded might lead to some such Sufferance as might endanger the quiet, if not the state of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion here; yet there have (when he was an Actor principal in the Conditions of <hi>France</hi>) as hard, if not worse to the preservation of our Religion, passed, then those with <hi>Spain.</hi> And the suspect is strengthened by the close keeping of this Agreement, and doubt in them of his affection, in that his Mother and others, many his Ministers of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> near imploiment about him are so affected.</p>
            <p>They talk much of his advancing men Popishly devoted, to Places in the Camp of nearest service and chief Command; and that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants have got these late years by his power, more courage and assurance then before.</p>
            <p>If to clear these doubts, (which perhaps are worse in fancie then in truth) he take a course, it might much advance the Publick service against the squeamish humors, that have more of violent Passion then of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> setled Judgment, and are not the least of the opposite number in the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>The next is, The late misfortunes and losses of Men, Munition, and Honor in the late Undertakings abroad; which the more temperate spirits impute to want of Council, and the more sublime Wits to Practice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:35668:250"/>They begin with the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and lay the fault of the loss thereof on the imputed Credit of <hi>Gondomar,</hi> distrusting him for the staying of supply to Sir <hi>Horatio Vere,</hi> when Colonel <hi>Cecil</hi> was cast on that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> became Master of the Kings Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Inheritance. And when Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> had a Royal supply of Forces to assist the Princes of our party for the recovety thereof, either Plot or Error defeated the enterprise for us to <hi>Spains</hi> advantage. That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Sir <hi>Robert Mansfields</hi> Expedition to <hi>Algiers,</hi> should purchase only the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and guard of the Spanish Coasts.</p>
            <p>To spend many Hundred thousand pounds in the <hi>Cadiz</hi>-Voyage, against the Advice in Parliament, only to warn the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to be in readiness, and so our selves weakned, is taken for a sign of an ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection amongst the Multitude.</p>
            <p>The spending of much Munition, Victuals and Money, in my Lord <hi>Willoughbies</hi> Journey, is counted an unthrifty error in the Director of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it; To disarm our selves in fruitless Voyages, may seem a plot of danger.</p>
            <p>It was held not long ago a fundamental Rule of our Neighbors, and our Security, by the old Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> That nothing can prevent the Spanish Monarchy, but a Fastness of those two Princes, whose Amity gave countenance and courage to the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and German-Princes to make head against his Ambition. And we see, by this disunion, a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Defeat hath happened to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and that party, to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> advantage of the Austrian Family.</p>
            <p>And this waste of Publick Treasure in fruitless Expeditions, will be an important Cause to hinder any new Supply in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Another fear that may disturb the smooth and speedy passage of the Kings desires in Parliament, is the vast waste of the Kings livelihood; whereby is like, as in former times, to arise this jealousie and fear, That when he hath not of his own to support his ordinary Charge, for which the Lands of the Crown were setled unalterable, and called <hi>Sacrum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonium <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Principis,</hi> that then he must needs of necessity rest upon those assistances of the people, which ever were only collected and consigned for the Commonwealth; from whence it is like there will be no great labor and stiffness, to induce his Majesty to an Act of Resumption; since such desires of the State have found an easie way in the will of all Princes, from the Third <hi>Henry</hi> unto the last.</p>
            <p>But that which is like to pass the deepest into their Disputes and care, is the late Pressures they supposed to have been done upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Publick Liberty and Freedom of the Subject, in commanding their Goods without assent by Parliament, imprisoning and confining their Persons without special Cause declared, and that made good against them by the Judges lately, and pretending a Writ to command their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances in Forein war; All which they are like to enforce as repugnant to any positive Laws, Institutions, and Customary Immunities of this Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>And these dangerous distastes to the people are not a little improved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by the unexampled course, as they conceive, of retaining an Inland Army in Winter-season, when former times of general fear, as in <hi>Eighty eight,</hi> produced none such; And makes them in their distracted fears to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture idly, it was raised wholly to subject their Fortunes to the will of Power, rather then of Law; and to make good some further breach upon their Liberties and Freedoms at home, rather then defend us from
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:35668:251"/>
any force abroad. How far such Jealousies, if they meet with any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual disorder of lawless Soldiers, are an apt distemper of the loose and needy Multitude, which will easily turn away upon any occasion in the State that they can side withall, as a glorious pretence of Religion and Publick safety, when their true end will be only rapine and ruine of all, is worthy a prudent and preventing care.</p>
            <p>I have thus far delivered, with that freedom you pleased to admit, such Difficulties as I have taken up amongst the Multitude, as may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> arrest, if not remove Impediments to any Supply in Parliament. Which how to facilitate, may better become the care of your Judgments, then my Ignorance.</p>
            <p>Only I could wish to remove away a personal distaste of my Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> amongst the people: He might be pleased, if there be a necessity of a Parliament, to appear first Adviser thereunto, and of the satisfaction it shall please his Majesty of grace to give at such time to his people; which I would wish to be grounded by president of his best <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and fortunate Progenitors; And which I conceive will satisfie the desires and hopes of all, if it may appear in some sort to be drawn down from him to the people, by the zealous care &amp; industry that my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> hath of the publick unity and content. By which there is no doubt but he may remain not only secure from any further quarrel with them, but merit a happy memory amongst them of a zealous Patriot. For, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate the passion of the people, at such times, with sacrifice of any of his Majesties Servants, I have found it—as in <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.— <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> no less fatal to the Master, then to the Ministers in the end.</p>

               </note>A little before the Parliament assembled, a Society of Recusants was taken in <hi>Clerkenwell:</hi> Divers of them were found to be Jesuites, and the House wherein they were taken was designed to be a Colledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of that Order.</p>
            <p>Among their Papers was found a Copy of this Letter written to their Father Rector at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> discovering their Designs upon this State, and their Judgment of the temper thereof, with a Conjecture of the success of the ensuing Parliament.</p>

                     </note>LEt not the damp of Astonishment seise upon your ardent and zealous soul,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in apprehending the sudden and unexpected Calling of a Parliament: We have not opposed, but rather furthered it; So that we hope as much in this Parliament, as ever we feared any in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> days.</p>
                  <p>You must know, the Council is engaged to assist the King by way of Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, in case the Parliamentary way should fail. You shall see this Parliament will resemble the Pelican, which takes a pleasure to dig out with her beak her own bowels.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Election of Knights and Burgesses hath been in such confusion of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Faction, as that which we were wont to procure heretofore with much art and industry (when the Spanish Match was in Treaty) now breaks out naturally as a botch or boil, and spits and spues out its own rankor and venom.</p>
                  <p>You remember how that famous and immortal Statesman the Count of <hi>Gondomar</hi> fed King <hi>James</hi> his fancy, and rocked him asleep with the soft and sweet sound of Peace, to keep up the Spanish Treaty. Likewise we were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> much bound to some Statesmen of our own Country, for gaining time by procuring those most advantagious Cessations of Arms in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and advancing the Honor and Integrity of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nation, and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the <hi>Hollanders</hi>; remonstrating to King <hi>James,</hi> That that State was most ungrateful both to his Predecessor Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and his Sacred
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:35668:252"/>
Majesty; That the States were more obnoxious then the <hi>Turk,</hi> and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually injured his Majesties loving Subjects in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and likewise they have usurped from his Majesty the Regality and unvaluable profit of the Narrow-Seas in fishing upon the English Coast, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This great Statesman had but one principal means to further their great and good designs, which was to set on King <hi>James,</hi> that none but the <hi>Puritan</hi>-Faction, which plotted nothing but Anarchy, and his Confusion, were averse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to this most happy Union. We steered on the same Course, and have made great use of this Anarchical Election, and have prejudicated and anticipated the Great one, that none but the Kings Enemies, and his, are chosen of this Parliament, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We have now many strings to our Bow, and have strongly fortified our Faction, and have added two Bulwarks more: For when King <hi>James</hi> lived (you know) he was very violent against Arminianism, and interrupted (with his pestilent Wit and deep Learning) our strong Designs in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and was a great Friend to that old Rebel and Heretick the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we have planted that Soveraign Drug <hi>Arminianism,</hi> which we hope will purge the <hi>Protestants</hi> from their Heresie; and it flourisheth and bears fruit in due season.</p>
                  <p>The Materials which build up our Bulwark, are the Projectors and Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of all ranks and qualities: Howsoever, both these Factions cooperate to destroy the Parliament, and to introduce a new species and form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which is Oligarchy.</p>
                  <p>Those serve as direct Mediums and Instruments to our end, which is the Universal Catholick Monarchy. Our foundation must be Mutation, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will cause a Relaxation, which will serve as so many violent diseases, as the Stone, Gout, &amp;c. to the speedy distraction of our perpetual and insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable anguish of body, which is worse then death it self.</p>
                  <p>We proceed now by Councel and mature deliberation, how and when to work upon the <hi>Duke's</hi> Iealousie and Revenge; And in this we give the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> honor to those which merit it, which are the Church-Catholicks.</p>
                  <p>There is another matter of Consequence, which we take much into our consideration and tender care, which is to slave off the <hi>Puritans,</hi> that they hang not in the <hi>Duke's</hi> ears, They are impudent subtile people.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be feared lest they should negotiate a Reconciliation between the <hi>Duke</hi> and the Parliament: Tis certain, the <hi>Duke</hi> would gladly have reconciled himself to the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Westminster</hi>; But now we assure our selves we have so handled the matter, that both <hi>Duke</hi> and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> are irreconcileable.</p>
                  <p>For the better prevention of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> the <hi>Arminians</hi> have already locked up the <hi>Duke's</hi> ears; And we have those of our own Religion, which stand continually at the <hi>Duke's</hi> Chamber, to see who goes in and out: We cannot be too circumspect and careful in this regard.</p>
                  <p>I cannot choose but laugh to see how some of our own Coat have accoutred themselves; you would scarce know them, if you saw them: And 'tis admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, how in speech and gesture they act the <hi>Puritans.</hi> The <hi>Cambridge</hi>-Scholars <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to their woful experience shall see we can act the <hi>Puritans</hi> a little better then they have done the <hi>Jesuites</hi>: They have abused our sacred Patron Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> in jest, but we will make them smart for it in earnest. I hope you will excuse my merry digression; For I confess unto you, I am at this time transported with joy to see how happily all Instruments and means, as well great as less, cooperate unto our purposes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="480" facs="tcp:35668:253"/>But to return unto the main Fabrick: Our foundation is <hi>Arminianism;</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Projectors,</hi> as it appears in the premisses, affect mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. This we second, and enforce by probable Arguments. In the first place we take into consideration the Kings honor, and present necessity; and we shew how the King may free himself of his Ward, as <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh did. And for his great splendor and lustre, he may raise a vast Revenue, and not be beholden to his Subjects; which is by way of Imposition of Excise. Then our Church-Catholicks proceed to shew the means how to settle this Excise,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which must be by a Mercenary Army of Horse and Foot. For the Horse, we have made that sure; They shall be Foreiners, and <hi>Germans,</hi> who will eat up the Kings Revenues, and spoil the Country wheresoever they come, though they should be well paid; What havock will they make there, when they get no Pay, or are not duly paid? They will do more mischief, then we hope the Army will do.</p>
                  <p>We are provident and careful, that this Mercenary Army of Two thousand Horse, and Twenty thousand Foot, shall be taken on and in pay before the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be setled. In forming the Excise, the Country is most likely to rise: If the Mercenary Army subjugate the Country, then the Soldiers and Projectors shall be paid out of the Confiscations; If the Country be too hard for the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then they must consequently mutiny, which is equally advantagious unto us. Our superlative design is, to work the Protestants as well as the Catholicks to welcom in a Conqueror, and that is by this means: We hope instantly to dissolve Trades, and hinder the building of Shipping, in devising probable Designs, and putting on the State upon Expeditions, as that of <hi>Cadiz</hi> was,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in taking away the Merchant Ships, so that they may not easily catch and light upon the <hi>West-India</hi> Fleet, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>THese Times are for Action:<note place="margin">The King's Speech at the opening of the Parliament.</note> Wherefore for Examples sake, I mean not to spend much time in Words; expecting accordingly that your (as I hope) good Resolutions will be speedy, not spending time unnecessarily, or (that I may better say) dangerously; For, tedious Consultations at this conjuncture of time, are as hurtful as ill Resolutions.</p>
                        <p>I am sure you now expect from me, both to know the cause of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> your meeting, and what to resolve on: Yet I think there is none here but knows that Common danger is the cause of this Parliament, and that Supply at this time is the chief end of it: So that I need but point to you what to do. I will use but few perswasions: For if to maintain your own Advices, and as now the case stands for the following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the true Religion, Laws, and Liberties of this State, and the just Defence of our true Friends and Allies, be not sufficient, then no Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Men or Angels will prevail.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Only let me remember you, That my duty most of all, and every one of yours according to his degree, is, to seek the maintenance of this Church and Commonwealth: And certainly, there never was a time in which this duty was more necessarily required, then now.</p>

I therefore judging a Parliament to be the antient, speediest, and best way in this time of Common danger, to give such Supply as to secure our selves, and to save our Friends from imminent ruine, have called you together. Every man now must do according to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: Wherefore if you (as God forbid) should not do your duties in contributing what the State at this time needs, I must in discharge of my conscience use those other means which God hath put into my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hands, to save that which the follies of particular men may otherwise hazard to lose.</p>
                        <p>Take not this as a Threatening, for I scorn to threaten any but my Equals; but an Admonition from him, that both out of nature and duty, hath most care of your preservations and prosperities: And (though I thus speak) I hope that your demeanors at this time will be such, as shall not only make me approve your former Councels, but lay on me such obligations as shall tie me by way of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to meet often with you: For, be assured, that nothing can be more pleasing unto me, then to keep a good Correspondence with you.</p>
                        <p>I will only adde one thing more, and then leave my Lord Keeper to make a short Paraphrase upon the Text I have delivered you; which is, <hi>To remember a thing, to the end we may forget it.</hi> You may imagine that I came here with a doubt of success of what I desire, remembring the distractions of the last Meeting: But I assure you that I shall very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> easily and gladly forget and forgive what is past, so that you will at this present time leave the former ways of distractions, and follow the Councel late given you, <hi>To maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</hi>

YE are here-in Parliament by his Majesties Writ and Royal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,<note place="margin">The Lord Keepers Speech.</note> to consult and conclude of the weighty and urgent Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Kingdom. Weighty it is, and great; as great as the honor, safety, and protection of Religion, King and Country; And what can be greater? Urgent it is; It is little pleasure to tell or think how urgent: And to tell it with circumstances, were a long work: I will but touch the sum of it in few words.</p>
                        <p>The Pope and House of <hi>Austria</hi> have long affected, the one a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Spiritual, the other a Temporal Monarchy: And to effect their ends, to serve each others turn, the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> besides the rich and vast Territories of both the <hi>Indies</hi> and in <hi>Africa</hi> joined together, are become Masters of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and the great Country of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> And although <hi>France</hi> be not under their subjection, yet they have invironed all about it; The very Bowels of the Kingdom swayed by the Popish Faction: They have gotten such a part and such inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in the Government, that under pretence of Religion, to root <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> out the Protestants and our Religion, they have drawn the King to their adherence so far, that albeit upon his Majesties interposition by his Ambassadors, and his engagement of his Royal word, there was between the King and his Subjects Articles of Agreement, and the Subjects were quiet, whereof his Majesty interessed in that great Treaty, was bound to see a true accomplishment; yet against that
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:35668:254"/>
strict Alliance, that Treaty hath been broken, and those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion have been put to all extremity, and undoubtedly will be ruined, without present help. So as that King is not onely diverted from assisting the Common Cause, but hath been misled to engage himself in hostile acts against our King and other Princes, making way thereby for the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> to the ruine of his own, and other Kingdoms.</p>
                        <p>Other Potentates, that in former times did ballance and interrupt the growing greatness of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> are now removed and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> diverted. The <hi>Turk</hi> hath made Peace with the Emperor, and turned himself wholly into Wars with <hi>Asia:</hi> The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled in a War with <hi>Poland,</hi> which is invented by Spanish practices, to keep that King from succoring our part: The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> is chased out of his Kingdom on this, and on that side the <hi>Zound</hi>; so as the House of <hi>Austria</hi> is on the point to command all the Sea-coasts from <hi>Dantzick</hi> to <hi>Embden,</hi> and all the Rivers falling into the Sea in that great extent: So as besides their power by Land, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> begin to threaten our Part by Sea, to the subversion of all our State.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Baltique</hi>-Sea, they are providing and arming all the Ships they can build, or hire; And have at this time their Ambassadors treating at <hi>Lubeck,</hi> to draw into their service the <hi>Hans</hi>-Towns, whereby taking from us and our Neighbors the Eastland-Trade, by which our Shipping is supplied, they expect without any blow given to make themselves Masters of that Sea. In these Western parts,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by the <hi>Dunkirkers,</hi> and by the now French and Spanish Admiral, to the ruine of Fishing (of infinite consequence both to us, and the Low-Countries) they infest all our Coast, so as we pass not safely from Port to Port. And that Fleet which lately assisted the French at the Isle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> is now preparing at <hi>S. Andrews,</hi> with other Ships built in the Coast of <hi>Biscay</hi> to reinforce it, and a great Fleet is making ready in <hi>Lisbon</hi>; where besides their own, they do serve themselves upon all Strangers Bottoms coming to that Coast for Trade: And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> these great preparations are, no doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, to assault us in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> as they shall find advantage, and a place fit for their turn.</p>
                        <p>Our friends of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> besides the fear that justly troubles them lest the whole force of the Emperor may fall down upon them, are distracted by their Voyages into the East, which hath carried both Men and Money into another World, and much weakened them at home.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus are we even ready on all sides to be swallowed up; The Emperor, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> being in open War against us, <hi>Germany</hi> overrun, the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> distressed, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> diverted, and the Low-Country-men disabled to give us assistance.</p>
                        <p>I speak not this to increase fear, unworthy of English courages, but to press to provision worthy the wisdom of a Parliament: And for that cause his Majesty hath called you hither, that by a timely provision against those great imminent dangers, our selves may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> strengthened at home, our Friends and Allies encouraged abroad, and those great causes of fear scattered and dispelled.</p>
                        <p>And because in all Warlike preparations Treasure bears the name, and holds the semblance of the nerves and sinews; And if a sinew be too short or too weak, if it be either shrunk or strained, the part
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:35668:254"/>
becomes unuseful: It is needful that you make a good and timely supply of Treasure, without which all Councels will prove fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. I might press many Reasons to this end; but I will but name few.</p>
                        <p>First for his Majesties sake, who requires it. Great is the duty which we owe him by the Law of God; great by the Law of Nature, and our own Allegiance; great for his own merit, and the memory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of his ever blessed Father. I do but point at them: But methinks our thoughts cannot but recoil on one Consideration touched by his Majesty; which to me seems to sound like a Parliamentary Pact or Covenant.</p>
                        <p>A War was advised here, Assistance professed, yea and protested here: I do but touch it, I know you will deeply think on it; and the more, for the example the King hath set you; His Lands, his Plate, his Jewels he hath not spared to supply the War: What <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the People hath protested, the King for his part hath willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly for the Cause sake: It concerns us in Christian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to tender the distresses of our Friends abroad; It concerns us in Honor, not to abandon them, who have stood for us. And if this come not close enough, You shall find our Interest so woven and involved with theirs, that the Cause is more ours then theirs. If Religion be in peril, we have the most flourishing and Orthodox <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Church: If Honor be in question, the Stories and Monuments in former Ages will shew, that our Ancestors have left us as much as any Nation: If Trade and Commerce be in danger, we are Islanders, it is our life. All these at once lie at stake, and so doth our safety and being.</p>
                        <p>Lastly in respect of the manner of his Majesties demand, which is in Parliament, the way that hath ever best pleased the Subjects of <hi>England.</hi> And good cause for it: For, Aids granted in Parliament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> work good effects for the People; they be commonly accompanied with wholsom Laws, gracious Pardons, and the like. Besides, just and good Kings finding the love of their People, and the readiness of their Supplies, may the better forbear the use of their Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, and moderate the rigor of the Laws towards their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                        <p>This way, as his Majesty hath told you, he hath chosen, not as the onely way, but as the fittest; Not as destitute of others, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as most agreeable to the goodness of his own most gracious dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and to the desire and weal of his people. If this be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Necessity, and the Sword of the Enemy make way to the others. Remember his Majesties Admonition; I say, remember it.</p>
                        <p>Let me but add, and observe Gods mercy towards this Land above all others. The Torrent of War hath overwhelmed other Churches and Countries; but God hath hitherto restrained it from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> us, and still gives us warning of every approaching danger, to save us from surprise. And our gracious Soveraign in a true sense of it calls together his High Court of Parliament, the lively Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Wisdom, Wealth, and Power of the whole Kingdom, to join together to repell those hostile Attempts, which have distressed our Friends and Allies, and threatned our selves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="484" facs="tcp:35668:255"/>
And therefore it behoves all to apply their Thoughts unto Councel and Consultations, worthy the greatness and wisdom of this Assembly; To avoid discontents and divisions, which may either distemper or delay; And to attend that <hi>Unum Necessarium,</hi> the Common Cause; propounding for the scope and work of all the Debates, the general good of the King and Kingdom, whom God hath joined together with an indissoluble knot, which none must attempt to cut or untie. And let all, by unity and good accord,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> endeavour to pattern this Parliament by the best that have been, that it may be a Pattern to future Parliaments, and may infuse into Parliaments a kind of Multiplying power and faculty, whereby they may be more frequent, and the King our Soveraign may delight to sit on his Throne, and from thence to distribute his graces and favors amongst his people.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty hath given you cause to be confident of this you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> have heard from his Royal mouth; which nevertheless he hath given me express command to redouble: If this Parliament, by their dutiful and wise proceedings, shall but give this occasion, His Majesty will be ready, not onely to manifest his gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, but to put out all memory of those distastes that have troubled former Parliaments.</p>

YOur obedient and loyal Subjects, the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses by your Royal Summons here assembled, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to your gracious direction, according to their antient usage and priviledge, have lately proceeded to the Choice of a Speaker; And whether sequestring their better Judgments for your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> more weighty Affairs; or to make it known, that their Honor and Wisdom can take neither increase, or diminution, by the value or demerit of any one particular Member in what place soever serving them; Omitting others of worth and ability, they have fixed their eyes of favor and affection upon me.</p>

                           <pb n="485" facs="tcp:35668:255"/>
Their long knowledge of my unfitness every way to undergo a charge of this important weight and consequence, gave me some hope they would have admitted my just excuse: Yet for their further and clearer satisfaction, I drew the Curtains and let in what light I could up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my inmost thoughts, truly and really discovering to them what my self best knew, and what I most humbly beseech your Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to take now into your consideration that of so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sitting amongst them, they could have found few or none, whose presentation to your Majesty would have been or less repute or advantage to them: for <hi>et impeditioris linguae sum,</hi> and the poor experience I have of that Royal Assembly is so ill ballanced with true Judgement, that every gust and wave hath power on me, whereby I shall not onely suffer in my own particular, but (which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with much more care and sorrow) do prejudice to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interest.</p>

Wherefore, dread and dear Soveraign, as low as the lowest step of your Royal Throne, I humbly bend, appealing to your great and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Judgement, for my discharge from this so unequal a burthen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on me; most humbly and earnestly beseeching your most excellent Majesty, for the Honor of that Great Council, and the better digestion of Publick services, there, and withal to avert so ill an Omen, as the choise of me in the beginning of a Parliament, ordained (I hope) for the joy of our own, and the envy of other Nations; that by your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Command the House may reconsult, and settle their better thoughts on some more worthy their Election and your Majesties Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
IF my Country had held me worthy to have served in this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">The Speech without doors.</note> I had now been made a Member of your Lower-House, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I have been in sundry other Parliaments: But how unkindly soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver she dealeth with me, I will ever shew my thankfulness to her, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, by way of observation, what I have heretofore learned in that grave and wise Assembly; for admonishment to the elder, and a path-way for the younger to walk in.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Parliaments</hi> in my time have been wont to take up some space at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the first meetings, to settle the House, and to determine of <hi>unlawfull Elections</hi>; and in this point they never had greater cause to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect, then at this time: For by an Abuse lately crept in, there is introduced a custom, which if it be not foreseen and prevented, will be a great derogation to the Honor, and a weakning to the power of your House. Where the Law giveth a freedom to Corporations to elect
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:35668:256"/>
Burgesses, and forbideth any indirect course to be taken in their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; many of the Corporations are so base-minded, and timerous, that they will not hazard the indignation of a Lord Lieutenants Letter, who underhand sticks not to threaten them with the charge of a Musket or a Horse at the Muster, if that he hath not the Election of the Burgesses, and not they themselves.</p>
                        <p>And commonly those that the Lords recommend, are such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it for protection, or are so ignorant of the place they serve for, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that there being occasion to speak of the Corporation for which they are chosen, they have asked their Neighbors sitting by, whether it were a Sea or a Land Town?</p>
                        <p>The next thing that is required, is, <hi>Liberty of Speech,</hi> without which Parliaments have little force or power; Speech begets doubts, and resolves them, and doubts in Speeches beget understanding; he that doubts much, asketh often, and learns much; and he that fears the worst, soonest prevents a mischief.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Priviledge of Speech is anciently granted by the testimony of <hi>Philip Comines</hi> a Stranger, who prefers our Parliaments, and the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Subject in them, above all other Assemblies; which Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if it be broken or diminished, is negligently lost since the dayes of <hi>Comines.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If freedom of Speech should be prohibited, when men with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty make repetition of the Grievances and Enormities of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; when men shall desire reformation of wrongs and injuries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and have no relation of evil thought to his Majesty, but with open heart and zeal express their dutifull and reverent respect to him and his service: I say, if this kinde of liberty of Speech be not allowed in time of Parliaments, they will extend no further then to Quarter-Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their Meetings and Assembles will be unnecessary; for all means of disorder new crept in, and all remedies and redresses will be quite taken away.</p>
                        <p>As it is no manners to contest with the King in his Election of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Councellors and Servants, (for Kings obey no men, but their Laws) So were it a great negligence, and part of Treason, for a Subject not to be free in Speech against the abuses, wrongs, and offences, that may be occasioned by persons in Authority. What Remedy can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a Prince to the Subject, if the enormities of his Kingdom be concealed from him? Or what King so religious or just in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that may not hazard the loss of the hearts of his Subjects, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Liberty of Speech in Parliament? For such is the misfortune <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of most Princes, and such is the unhappiness of Subjects where Kings affections are setled, and their loves so far transported to promote ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as they onely trust and credit what they shall inform.</p>
                        <p>In this Case, what Subject dares complain? or what Subject dares contradict the words or actions of such a servant, if it be not warranted by freedom of a Parliament, they speaking with humility? For nothing obtaineth favor with a King, so much as diligent obedience.</p>
                        <p>The surest and safest way betwixt the King and his people, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> hath least scandal of partiality, is, with indifference, with integrity and sincerity, to examine the Grievances of the Kingdom, without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the person of any man, further then the cause giveth occasion: For otherwise, you shall contest with him that hath the Princes ears open to hearken to his inchanting tongue; he informs secretly, when you
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:35668:256"/>
shall not be admitted to excuses, he will cast your deserved malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, to your contempt against the King, and seeking to lessen his Authority; and so will make the Prince the Shield of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
                        <p>These are the sinister practices of such servants to deceive their Soveraigns, when our Grievances shall be authentically proved, and made manifest to the World by your pains to examine, and freedom to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> speak. No Prince can be so affectionate to a servant, or such an Enemy to himself, as not to admit of this indifferent proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If his services be allowable and good, they will appear with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; if bad, your labor shall deserve thanks both of Prince and Country.</p>
                        <p>When Justice shall thus shine, people will be animated to serve their King with integrity: For they are naturally inclined to imitate Princes in good and bad.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The words of <hi>Cicero</hi> will then appear, That malicious and evil men make Princes poor; and one perfect good man is able to make a Realm rich.</p>
                        <p>One Case I will instance that is common in the mouths of all men, and generally, <hi>vox Populi vox Dei.</hi> One of quality in the last Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Isle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> endeavored to conceale the number of men lost in the last encounter, and confidently affirmed their number not to exceed three or four hundred; till a Doctor of Physick, out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Conscience and duty to his Majesty, could not dissemble the vulgar and true Report, but acquainted his Majesty with Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of his Subjects there lost. This was so contrary to the first information, and so displeasing to the Informer and his Designs, that he caused the Physitians remove from his Highness presence, who yet remains in kinde of a banished man.</p>
                        <p>The truth of these two Reports is easily determined by the Clerks of the Bands of each Company, and is worthy to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for Truth sake Truth being so Noble of it self, as it will make him Honorable that promoteth it: Lyes may shadow it, but not darken it: They may blame, but never shame it. By this small President his Majesty shall see himself abused; and it may be a means for him to reflect both upon men and matters.</p>
                        <p>The men slain are no less injured by concealing their Names, whose lives were lost for King and Country. The Romans would have held it the highest Honor for their friends and posterity so to die: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And a Parliament may fear that those that stick not so palpably to wrong a King, may as unjustly cast Aspersions upon the House, and other his loving Subjects.</p>
                        <p>There is no remedy left for these misreports, but a freedom of Speech in Parliament. For there is no wise man that speaks, but knows what, and when to speak, and how to hold his peace. Whilst Subjects tongues are tyed, for fear they may reach him a rap whose conscience cries guilty; the King and his people are kept from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> one another; The Enemy is heartened abroad, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant humor of Discontent nourished at home, and all for one who is like a Dragon, that bites the ear of the Elephant, because he knows the Elephant cannot reach him with his trunk; and Princes are abused by false Reports whispered in their ears by Sycophants and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="488" facs="tcp:35668:257"/>
                           <hi>Diogenes</hi> being asked what beast bit sorest, answered, Of wilde beasts, the <hi>Back-biter</hi>; of tame, the <hi>Flatterer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to descend to Grievances, which are of two kinds; some concerning the Kingdom in general; some in particular, which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the general.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Grievances in general</hi> are so many in number, as will serve for every Member of the House to present Two apiece to your views. And because I cannot be admitted amongst you my self,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> yet in regard I have been a Member of you, I will prsume so far as to rank my self with you, and to tender the number of Two unto unto your consideration.</p>
                        <p>My first Complaint is <hi>of Titles of Honor</hi>; and in two kindes.</p>
                        <p>First, in respect of the Parties themselves, their Estates and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage.</p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        <p>Secondly, in respect of the manner of their attaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which is mercenary, base, and corrupt, which in reason should not hold: For by Law the consideration is unlawfull.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Trajanus</hi> commended <hi>Plutarch</hi> for his Precepts in School, when he taught that men should labor to deserve Honor, but avoid the getting of it basely: For if it were Reputation to have it by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it were Infamy to buy it for Money. In that Age where Rich men were honored, Good men were despised.</p>
                        <p>Honor is not to be valued according to the vulgar opinion of men, but prized and esteemed as the Sirname of Vertue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in the minde; and such Honor no King can give, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney can purchase. He that will strive to be more honorable then others, must abandon Passion, Pride, and Arrogancy; that so his Vertue may shine above others. For Honor consists not in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of a Lord, but in the opinion people have of their vertue; For it is much more honor to deserve, and not to have it, then to have it, and not deserve it.</p>
                        <p>There is one of three things, that commonly causeth mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, Desert, Favor, and Power.</p>
                        <p>The first makes a man worthy of it, the other two are but abuses: For, Favor is but a blinde fortune, an ounce of which at Court, is better then a pound of wisdom: Fortune never favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but flattereth; She never promiseth, but in the end she decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; She never raiseth, but she casteth down again. And this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement is meeter to be called Luck, then Merit.</p>
                        <p>That Honor that is compassed by Power, takes unto it self Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and desires not to be governed by wisdom, but force. It knows not what it desireth, nor hath a feeling of any Injury: It is neither moved with sweet words, nor pitifull tears; such men leave not to do evil, because they have a desire to it, but when their power faileth to do it.</p>
                        <p>The true Honor among the honorablest is, where Fortune casts down, where there is no fault: But it is Infamy where Fortune raiseth, where there is no Merit.</p>
                        <p>Examine the State and condition of men raised to Honor these 25
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:35668:257"/>
years past, and whether it be desert, favor or power that hath preferred them.</p>
                        <p>Enter into the mischief the Kingdom hath suffered, and doth suffer by it; and the cause of his Majesties great wants will soon appear: If you collect with your selves how many hungry Courtiers have been raised to the highest top of honor;</p>
                        <p>After this, examine their Princely expence in these Twenty five <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> years, their Estates in present, and what is requisite to maintain them in their future degrees of honor, to themselves and their Posterity, and you shall finde his Majesties annual Revenues consumed and spent upon those unworthy persons. Besides the impairing and impoverishing of the State, it brings with it the contempt of Greatness and Authority, it breeds an inward malice in Gentlemen better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of their Country, and better able to maintain the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of honor without charge to King or Kingdom, and whose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Houses and Alliance may better challenge it then the best of them.</p>
                        <p>The Character of a covetous man is, that he getteth his goods with care, and envy of his Neighbors, with sorrow to his Enemies, with travel to his body, with grief to his Spirit, with scruple to his conscience, with danger to his soul, with suit to his children, and curse to his heirs; his desire is to live poor, to die rich: But as these vices are made vertues, even so is he honored for them with Title of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Nobility.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> the second King of <hi>Spain</hi> entred with Arms upon his Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and though with his sword he might have made fitting Laws; yet were there some few Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which the Portugals besought they might enjoy; one whereof was, That the King would make no unworthy person No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or without their approbation, which was granted them, and to this day they hold that Freedom, which keeps that Kingdom in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the ancient State, Honor and Dignity, (that is to say) two Dukes, one Marquis, and Eighteen Earls: And thus much for the point of Honor.</p>
                        <p>The second Grievance I will recommend to your views is, <hi>The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of our Wars,</hi> the excessive charges vainly spent therein, the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of the people imployed, the grave and experienced neglected, the designs not warranted by reason and discretion, and the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worse performed, with many other circumstances that depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it.</p>
                        <p>But before I proceed herein, I must crave leave to speak to two Points.</p>
                        <p>The one to declare the property and condition of Impostors and Deceivers of Princes.</p>
                        <p>In the other I must clear the House of Parliament of an Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cast upon it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Abusers of Princes</hi> are they that perswade them to War; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> poor when they may live in Peace, and become rich; when they may be loved, cause them to be hated; when they may enjoy their lives surely, put them in hazard of cross fortune rashly; and lastly, having necessity to use their Subjects, put them into that necessity, as they refuse to do for him: All this is Pride of the Perswader, as <hi>Socrates</hi> saith.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="490" facs="tcp:35668:258"/>
In the second I will clear the Parliament (in which I was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) of an ungratefull aspersion cast upon it, that is to say, <hi>That the Parliament was a cause to draw his Majesty into a War, and failed on their parts to contribute to it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These have been often repeated, and the Parliament accused; the contrary hath been as often reiterated, and the truth expressed how far the Parliament proceeded therein. But to stop the mouths of such false Reports, and to free the Parliament of such a calumniation, I must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> use this Argument.</p>
                        <p>At the Assembly of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Parliament being Prorogued thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Money was required of us towards the furnishing of his Majesties Fleet then preparing, upon many reasons alleadged, too tedious now to repeat, with one consent it was refused.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon there was offer made by him that next the King, seem-to have best Authority, That if they would but contribute Forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds, they should choose their Enemy.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereupon I infer, That before that Proposition there was no Enemy, and therefore no Wars: The motion for Money being denied, the Parliament instantly brake up; and seeing no Enemy was nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor Money consented unto by us, I see not how the House can be taxed for Peace-breakers, but rather the name to be cast upon some young men; for youth by nature is prone to pride, especially where experience wants; They are credulous in what they hear that pleaseth them, and incredulous in what is told them by wise men; They are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> despisers of others counsels, and very poor in their own; They are dangerous for Princes to relie on, for self-will is of greater force then Precepts.</p>
                        <p>Now to proceed: In <hi>October</hi> following the Fleet put to Sea, and what they did is apparent by a Relation written by a their General at his Return.</p>
                        <p>The Voyage being ended, another followed the next Summer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of that noble Lord, the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> through the weakness and disability of the Ships, was not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he had in charge, and what he desired.</p>
                        <p>The last and most lamentable, was that to the Isle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> which I likewise refer to a man I have seen, and to the Books printed and extant.</p>
                        <p>These, with that to <hi>Algeir,</hi> to make up Mess of Island Voyages, I wish might be referred to the examination of choice and experienced Soldiers by Land and by Sea, to report their opinions of it, That so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their Errors, their wastefull Expences, their Negligences, their weak Designs, and want of experience may appear, with the Success that might have proved, if Advice and Counsel had had preheminence above Will and Arrogancy; For he that is ignorant of truth and knowledge, and led away with pride of his own opinions, must needs err. After it hath past your approbation, it is worthy his Majesties view, who then shall see the difference of Actions well mannaged, and rash and heady Enterprises undertook by ignorance, and performed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by folly.</p>
                        <p>Business of so great a consequence ought to be considered of with Counsel, and not onely of the necessity, profit and honor, but of the possibility that was like to follow; for an Action well begun is half ended.</p>

My experience in Discipline of War by Land and Sea can say no more then to refer it to others; for tis a Course I never was bred to in my youth, and now too late in mine age to practice: Onely one thing I observe, that in the two journeys of <hi>Cadiz</hi> and <hi>Rhee,</hi> in the first a Land Souldier commanded at Sea, who knew not what belonged thereunto; and the other was carried by him that was Souldier neither by Land nor by Sea, and the success proved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in both, yet their errors were never questioned, but they both highly advanced.</p>
                        <p>And it is no marvel, for according to the old saying, The best Fencer is not always the best Fighter, the fairer Tilter not the best experienced Souldier, nor the eye of a Favorite at Court the best General of an Host: And whosoever takes upon him that command without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, beholds himself in a false glass, that makes him seem what he is not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> As on the contrary, Experience is the mother of Prudence, and Prudence will take counsel, lest she joyn her will with her will; hastiness causeth repentance, and frowardness causeth hinderance.</p>
                        <p>Of the Evils that followed upon these two voyages, your selves are sufficient Witnesses, and can judge of them. As namely, the billet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Soldiers in the Country, and bringing their Ships into Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, not abating the entertainment of the one, nor the wages of the other. And yet notwithstanding this needless cost and charges, our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Ships and Coasts are daily infested in such sort, as we dare not peep out of Harbor.</p>
                        <p>Were the carriage of things now answerable to the Prudence and Presidents of former times, we cannot pretend a fear of invasion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Ships are divided into several Harbors, and our Soldiers billetted in Inland Countries; beside the season of the year giveth no opportunity to an Enemy to attempt it.</p>
                        <p>Here is a mass of wealth curiously consumed, whether the King or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Subject bear it, and no man bettered but onely those that have the titles of Soldiers, yet never had the happiness or honor to see what appertained to service.</p>
                        <p>Their example of disorder encourages the other to follow their Liberty, People that were wont to live poorly, yet safely, are now by these Fellows and their Followers robbed and spoiled, and no remedy for Redress.</p>
                        <p>The rich stand upon their guard, and dare not resort to their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Church, lest in their absence their Houses be surprised and Rifled.</p>
                        <p>The Enemy giveth a sudden attempt and returneth, the others do every day rob and spoil.</p>
                        <p>The Enemy surpriseth with fear, the others have neither fear nor shame.</p>
                        <p>The first lessening the greatness of the Roman Empire, was by the insolency of Soldiers; and the first raising of the House of <hi>Ottoman</hi> was by permission and conniving at his Army.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> What man is so old in <hi>England</hi> that hath seen, or what youth so young that ever thought to see Scottish men and Irish men Garrisoned in <hi>England,</hi> and no Enemy appear against us? Or who could have imagined he should ever have seen our own people tyrannized over in our own Kingdom by these of our own Nation, and those Scottish and Irish, and not dare so much as complain?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="492" facs="tcp:35668:259"/>
Would our forefathers have thought it safety or Policy to draw Two thousand Scotish men and Irish men, into the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> for their defence against <hi>France,</hi> when they of the Isle desired it not, nay when they opposed it?</p>
                        <p>Would they have thought it wisdom that Two thousand Mouthes besides the Inhabitants should live on the food of that Island, and so bring themselves into want and penury of victuals, if they should in earnest be attempted by an Enemy? Would they have thought fit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the charge of it should be required of them, and yet they to suffer all injuries from the hands of strange Souldiers, when the meanest boy in the Island is taught to mannage Arms better then the best of them that are there billetted? No, but they would rather have thought it discretion upon the return of those voyages, to have caused the men to repair to the place where they were pressed, and to have ordered, that each Parish should have set them on work for their maintenance, with command to be ready upon warning to repair to the place of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Rendezvous</p>
                        <p>There is no place or part in <hi>England</hi> so remote from the Sea, but they might have resorted to the Port assigned, before the Ships could be furnished or drawn together. They would have thought it more wisdom to have retired to their own Harbors, and to have had their men discharged, then to have continued this needless and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencefull course that is taken. They would have judged it better to have supplied the Isle of <hi>Weight</hi> with Two thousand men out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> main Land, when they feared any evil to the Island, then to send for them out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to keep them in continual entertainment. They would have thought it more fit to have returned the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Irish into the Country from whence they came, then to make them a vexation to the places and parts where they remain, seeing no shadow of reason can be pretended for it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>England</hi> wants no men, and hath as good and able men as either of the other two Nations, if his Majesty had occasion to use them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>England</hi> with small charge can raise what men his Majesty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to command, and that suddenly, and discharge them again without trouble or charge as quickly. The wise men of <hi>England</hi> would have thought Two or three hundred thousand pounds better spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then thus wastfully consumed, and disorders committed; we may compute it to that sum, and yet keep our selves within compass: And notwithstanding the want of Money, and the wayes to exact it of the Subject, is all the Song now sung; He that sees and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the evil mannaging of things, is either imprisoned, banished the Court, or censured for a Discontent.</p>
                        <p>There is no Englishman but knoweth the heart of every other true heated Englishman, and with one consent will all obey our Prince, and to his person we owe all due reverence; and we may truely say no King is more happy in Subjects for their love, nor no Subjects readier to serve their King with their purses and persons; nor never people was better blest with a King, who is endued with all kinde of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> vertues, and stained with no manner of vice.</p>
                        <p>False Informers and Misguiders of good Kings are much more perilous, then if Princes themselves were evil; for commonly as worms breed soonest in soft and sweet wood, so are the best na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inclined to Honor, and Justice soonest abused by false Flatterers.</p>
                        <p>

The evil they commit under the Authority of good Princes, is accounted as done by the Prince himself; but commonly such people in the end pay for it; for he that desires not to do good cannot be wise, but will fall into Four thousand Follies.</p>
                        <p>One of the first Propositions made to the House will be for Money to support his Majesties vast expence at this time; that the Enemy threatens thunder against the Kingdom. Your often alarms <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> upon such pretences may make you now too secure; for true it is that the last Parliament, books were published of invincible Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations intended against us, and nothing came of it. But beware you be not deceived by an old saying, That when one usually tells lyes, he is not trusted when he speaks truth; for certainly the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is much more then by the power and greatness of another Enemy.</p>
                        <p>In this case you must give for your own sakes, that so you may be sure to enjoy what is yours; for your Soveraigns sake, to maintain his greatness and state; and for your Countries sake, to keep it from oppression of the Enemy; but withall you ought to lay down the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Kingdom, and to shew that your necessity cannot run paralel with your hearts and your desires; that your mindes will be carried with a willingness to give, but your hands will keep back your hearts for want of ability to give.</p>

                           <hi>Themistocles</hi> demanding Tribute of the Athenians, told them he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> brought two Gods with him, that is to say, Perswasion and Violence; They answered, that they had two other Gods in their Country, both great and powerfull, which were Poverty and Impossibility, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them from giving.</p>
                        <p>We may truely say, that God hath so placed and seated this Isle of <hi>England,</hi> that nothing but evil counsel can hurt it: But true it is, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that is not warranted from wise men, may prove more forcible and perilous then the power of an Enemy.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> The Scripture telleth us, that the thought perisheth that taketh not counsel.</p>
                        <p>A King of the Lacedemonians asked how a Kingdom might ever stand, and was answered, two wayes, if a King take counsel of wise honest men, and they speak freely; and do Justice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly.</p>
                        <p>There was never Censor that judged, Senator that ordered, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror that commanded, Council that executed, Orator that perswaded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> nor any other mortal man, but sometimes he committed Errors, and deserved either blame or punishment for his misdoings, and if he were wise, desired advice what to do.</p>
                        <p>St <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, No man can give so faithfull counsel as he who loves one more then his gifts; Then who are or can be so true Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors to our Noble King, as a House of Commons that hath no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Kings gift, but only to his Honor, flourishing estate and safety.</p>
                        <p>This is the time to amend evil Counsels past, and to let evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors see their Errors.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> This is the time for all men to put to their helps, some with their hands to fight, others, with their advice to counsel: And for my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice this it is;</p>

                           <hi>That you present to his Majesty in all humbleness, your willing mindes and hearts, to repair and fit to Sea his Majesties Navy, your selves to have power
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:35668:260"/>
to make them able and serviceable, with the advice of experienced men that you may call unto you.</hi>
This is a matter of great importance at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for the safety of King, Realm, and Subject; for the strength of the Kingdom much depends upon this Bulwark, which we may well term <hi>The Walls of England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>His Majesty shall finde himself much eased by it, Businesses shall be carried without his trouble or care, Money shall not be sought for to that end, but provided by you, his Majesty may dispose of the rest of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his Revenue at his pleasure.</p>
                        <p>By your frugality and husbandry his Majesty shall have occasion to judge of things past, of yours in present, and hereafter it will serve for a President to walk after; it will stop the mouthes of Malignant tongues that inform his Majesty of the unwillingness of the Subject to give; and it will make it apparent, that their true grief is not in the matter of giving, but to see the Evil imploying of it when it is given.</p>
                        <p>If any man shall pervert this good meaning and motion of yours,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and inform his Majesty, <hi>'tis a derogation from his Honor, to yield to his Subjects upon Conditions</hi>: His Majesty shall have good cause to prove such mens Eyes malitious and unthankfull, and thereby to disprove them in all their other Actions: For what can it lessen the Reputation of a Prince whom the Subject onely and wholy obeyeth, that a Parliament which his Majesty doth acknowledge to be his highest Council should advise him, and he follow the advice of such a Council?

They (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to please the King, then to discharge their own consciences) answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Persian Kings might do what they listed: This base flattery tends to mischief, being fitter for reproof then imitation; and as flattery, so fear taketh away the judgment, let us not then be possessed with fear or flattery, of corruptions the basest: For my own part, I shall shun both these, and speak my conscience with as much duty to his Majesty as any man, but not neglecting the Publick, in which his Majesty and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth have an Interest: But how can we shew our affections whilst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we retain our fears? or how can we think of giving of Subsidies, till we know whether we have any thing to give or no? for if his Majesty be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by any to take from his Subjects what he will, and where it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him; I would gladly know what we have to give? Its true, it is ill with those Subjects that shall give Laws to their Princes, and as ill with those Princes which shall use force with those Laws; that this hath been done, appeareth by the billetting of Soldiers, a thing no way advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his Majesties service, but a burden to the Commonwealth; This <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> also appeareth by the last Levy of money against an act of Parliament: Again, Mr <hi>Speaker,</hi> what greater proof can there be of this, then the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment of divers Gentlemen for the Loan, who if they had done the contrary for fear, their fault had been as great as theirs that were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors in it; and to countenance these Proceedings, hath it not been preached (or rather prated) in our pulpits, that all we have is the Kings, <hi>Iure Divino</hi>? say these time-servers; they forsake their own function, and turn ignorant States-men; we see how willing they will be to change a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> good conscience for a Bishoprick, and (Mr <hi>Speaker</hi>) wee see how easie it is for a Prince, how just and good soever, to be abused, in regard he must see with other mens eyes, and hear with other mens ears. Let us not flatter his Majesty, it is too apparent to all the world, the King and people suffer more now then ever: His Majesty in his Affairs abroad, and his People in their Estates at home: But will you know the reason of all this, let us
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:35668:261"/>
look back to the Actions of former Princes, and we shall find that those Princes have been in greatest want and extreamity that exacted most of their Subjects and most unfortunate in the choice of their Ministers, and to have failed most in their undertakings; happy is that Prince that hath those that are faithful of his Council: That which his Majesty wanted in the management of his Affairs concerning <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> I am clear was his want of <hi>faithful Council</hi> to advise. The reason is plain, a Prince is strongest by faithfull and wise Council, I would I could truly say, such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> have been imployed abroad. I will confess, and still shall from my heart, he is no good Subject, nor well affected to his Majesty and the State, that will not willingly and freely lay down his life, when the end may be the service of his Majesty, and the good of the Commonweale: But on the contrary, when against a Parliament Law the Subject shall have taken from him, his goods against his will, and his liberty against the Laws of the Land: shall it be accounted want of duty in us to stand upon our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, hereditary to us, and confirmed by so many Acts of Parliament.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               </p>
               <p>In doing this we shall but tread the steps of our forefathers, who ever preferred the Publick Interest before their own right, nay, before their own lives; nor can it be any wrong to his Majesty to stand upon them so as thereby we may be the better enabled to do his Majesties service; but it will be a wrong to us and our posterity and our consciences, if we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly forego that which belongs unto us by the Law of God, and of the Land, and this we shall do well to present to his Majesty; we have no cause to doubt of his Majesties gracious acceptation.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

               <p>This Debate (said Sir <hi>Tho. Wentworth</hi>) carries a double Aspect towards the Soveraign and the Subject,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth.</hi>
                  </note> though both be innocent, both are injured, and both to be cured: Surely, in the greatest humility I speak it, these ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ways are punishment and marks of indignation, the raising of Loans strengthned by Commission, with unheard of Instructions and Oathes, the billetting of Soldiers by the Lieutenants, and Deputy Lieutenants, have been as if they could have perswaded Christian Princes, yea worlds, that the right of Empires, had been to take away by strong hands, and they have endeavored as far as possible for them, to do it. This hath not been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> done by the King (under the pleasing shade of whose Crown I hope we shall ever gather the fruits of Justice) but by Projectors, who have extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prerogative of the King, beyond the just Symetry, which maketh a sweet harmony of the whole: They have brought the Crown into greater want then ever, by anticipating the Revenues; And can the Shepherd be thus smitten and the Speep not scattered? They have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Privy-Council ravishing at once the Spheres of all ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, imprisoning us without either bail or bond; they have taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> from us, what; shall I say indeed, what have they left us? All means of supplying the King and ingratiating our selves with him, taking up the root of all propriety, which if it be not seasonably set again into the ground by his Majesties own hands, we shall have insteed of beauty, bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. To the making of those whole, I shall apply my self, and propound a Remedy to all these diseases. By one and the same thing have King and People been hurt, and by the same must they be cured; to vindicate,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> what, new things? no our ancient vital Liberties, by reinforcing the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws made by our Ancestors, by setting forth such a Character of them, as no licentious spirit shall dare to enter upon them; and shall we think this is a way to break a Parliament? no, our desires are modest and just, I speak truly, both for the interest of King and People, if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy not these, it will be impossible for to relieve him.</p>
               <p>

Therefore let us never fear they shall not be accepted by his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; wherefore I shall shortly descend to my motions consisting of four parts, two of which have relation to our persons, two to the propriety of goods for our persons; first, the freedom of them from imprisonment secondly, from imployment abroad, contrary to the ancient Customs: For our goods, that no Levies be made, but by Parliament; secondly, no billetting of Soldiers: It is most necessary that these be resolved, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that the Subject may be secured in both.</p>

I desire this House to avoid all contestations, the hearts of Kings are great, 'tis comely that Kings have the beter of their Subjects; give the King leave to come off, I believe his Majesty expects but the occasion, 'tis lawfull, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and our duty to advise his Majesty, but the way is to take a right course to attain the right end; which I think may be thus; by trusting the King, and to breed a trust in him, by giving him a large Supply according to his wants, by prostrating our Grievances humbly at his feet, from thence they will have the best way to his heart, that is done in duty to his Majesty: And to say all at once, Let us all labor to get the King on our side, and this may be no hard matter, considering the neer subsistence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> between the King and people.</q>

                  </note>This dayes Debate (said Sir <hi>Robert Philips</hi>) makes me call to minde the custom of the Romans, who had a solemn feast once a year for their Slaves, at which time they had liberty (without exception) to speak what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they would, whereby to ease their afflicted minds, which being finished, they severally returned to their former servitude. This may with some resemblance and distinction well set forth our present State; where now after the revolution of some time, and grievous sufferings of many vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oppressions, we have (as those Slaves had) a day of liberty of speech; but shall not, I trust, be herein Slaves, for we are free: we are not Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but Subjects; these after their Feast were Slaves again; but it is our hope to return Freemen. I am glad to see this mornings work, to see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> such a sense of the Grievances under which we groan. I see a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of grief from all parts, to see the Subject wronged, and a fit way to see the Subject righted: I expected to see a division, but I see honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conjunction, and I take it a good Omen. It was wished by one, that there were a forgetfulness of all, let him not prosper that wisheth it not. No, there is no such wayes to perfect remedy, as to forget injuries, but not so to forget, as not to recover them. It was usual in <hi>Rome</hi> to bury all injuries, on purpose to recover them. It was said by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that ever speaks freely: <hi>We must so govern our selves, as if this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament must be the Chrysis of all Parliaments, and this the last.</hi> I hope well, and there will be no cause for the King our Head to except against us, or we against him.

We have provoked two Potent Kings (the one too near) who are too strongly joyned together; the dangers are not Chimerical but real, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, but it must be done in proportion of our dangers at home; I more fear the violation of Publick Rights at home, then a Forein Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Must it be our duties and direction to defend Forein dangers, and establish security against them, and shall we not look at that which shall make us able and willing thereunto? We shall not omit to confide and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> trust his Majesty, otherwise our Councils will be with fears, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not Englishmen.

                  <hi>Sycophants</hi> have prated in the Pulpit to the contrary. Was there ever yet King of <hi>England</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ever violated the Subjects Liberty and Property, but their actions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> were ever complained of in Parliament, and no sooner complained of then redressed? 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. there went out a Commission to raise money in a strange manner, the succeeding Parliament prayed redress, and till <hi>H.</hi> 8. we never heard of the said Commissions again.</p>
               <p>Another way was by Loan, a worm that cankered the Law, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did redress it, and that money was paid again: The next little Engine was <hi>Benevolence,</hi> what the force of that was, look into the Statute of <hi>R.</hi> 3. which damned that particular way, and all other indirect wayes.</p>

                  </note> County I serve for were pleased to command me to seek the removal from them of the greatest burthen that ever people suffered. It was excellently said, Commissionary Lieutenants do deprive us of all Liberty; if ever the like was seen of the Lieutenancy that now is, I will never be believed more; They tell the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> people they must pay so much upon a warrant from a Deputy Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or be bound to the good behavior, and sent up to the Lords of the Council; it is the strangest Engine to rend the Liberty of the Subject that ever was; there was now a <hi>Decemviri</hi> in every County, and amongst that <hi>Decemviri</hi> there is some <hi>Claudius Appius</hi> that seek their own revenges; we complain of Loans and Impositions, but when Deputy Lieutenants may send warrants to imprison our persons at pleasure, if we pay not what they sent for, it concern us to preserve the Country in Freedom, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> consider of this kind of people. There is now <hi>necessity</hi> brought in for an argument, all know that <hi>necessity</hi> is an armed man, and that necessity is an <hi>evil Councellor,</hi> I would we had never known that Council; we are almost grown like the Turks, who send their Janizaries, who place the Halberd at the door, and there he is master of the house. We have Soldiers billet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and warrants to collect money, which if they do not, the Soldiers must
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:35668:263"/>
come and rifle. The Romans sending one into <hi>Spain,</hi> found no greater complaint then the discontent that did arise from Soldiers placed amongst them. I would you would look into <hi>Fortescue</hi> where he puts the Prince in minde, what misery he saw where Soldiers were put upon the people: But saith he, No man is forced to take Soldiers but Inns, and they to be paid by them; I desire we resort to his Majesty for redress, and to reduce all into bounds.</p>
               <p>The other way of Grievance is a Judgement in a legal course of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we have had three Judgements of late times, all exceeding one another in prejudice of the Subject: The first was, That that was judged in all formality, the <note n="*" place="margin">Scots.</note> 
                  <hi>Postnati</hi> Case, which people I honor; for we finde many of them love us more then we do our selves; I do not complain of it, but onely mention it.</p>
               <p>The other Judgement was for Impositions, which was given in the Exchequer, and this House two times after damned that Judgement: how remiss our eyes are upon that I grieve to see.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Judgement, if I may so call it, a fatal Judgement against the Liberty of the Subject, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. <hi>Car.</hi> in Sir <hi>Iohn Heveninghams</hi> case argued at the Bar, and pronounced but by one alone; I can live, although another without title be put to live with me; nay, I can live, although I pay Excises and Impositions for more then I do; but to have my liberty which is the soul of my life taken from me by power, and to be pent up in a Goal without remedy by Law, and this to be so adjudged to perish in Goal, O Improvident Ancestors! Oh unwise forefathers! to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be so curious in providing for the quiet possession of our Lands and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of Parliament, and to neglect our persons and bodies, and to let them die in prison, and that <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> remediless: If this be Law, what do we talk of our Liberties? why do we trouble our selves with the dispute of Law, Franchises, Propriety of goods?

I conclude: We will consider two particulars, his Majesty, and his People: his Majesty cals to us, and craves our assistance to revive again his Honor, and the Honor of the Nation: The people send us, as we hope, with that direction, that we shall return to them with that Olive-branch, that assurance of being free from those calamities under which they can hardly breathe. Our sins have brought on us those miseries, let us all bring our Portion to make up the wall: we come with Loyal hearts; his Majesty shall find, that it is we that are his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> faithfull Councellors; let all Sycophants be far removed from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, since we cannot help this Majesty without opening our Grievances; let us discharge our duties therein; yet while we seek Liberty, we will not forget Subjection; all things a State can be capable of, either blessings or punishments, depend on this meeting; if any think the King may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and the Commonwealth preserved without redress of Grievances, he is deceived. The Kings of <hi>England</hi> were never more glorious then when they trusted their Subjects; let us make all haste to do the Errand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> for which we came, let the House consider to prepare our Grievances fit for his Majesties view, not to make a Law to give us new Liberties, but Declaratory, with respective Penalties; so that those which violate them, if they would be vile, they should fear infamy with men; and then we shall think of such a Supply as never a Prince received, and with our monies
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:35668:263"/>
we shall give him our hearts, and give him a new people raised from the dead: Then I hope this Parliament will be entituled, The Parliament of wonders, and Gods judgements diverted, and these beams of goodness shall give us life, and we shall go home to our Countries, and leave our Posterity as free as our Ancestors left us.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> 24 <hi>March</hi> Secretary <hi>Cook</hi> renewed the motion of Supplies for his Majesty, yet so that Grievances be likewise taken into Consideration.</p>
            <q>
               <p>We all think fit (said he) that both these go hand in hand together;<note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Cook</hi> moves for Supply for his Majesty.</note> but let me put you in mind of that which concerns the King, let him have the precedency of honor, if not of time, let the heads of the Kings Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply first be propounded, this will be an honor to the King, and will do ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the House; the end of this Parliament is the subsistence of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> King, as he himself hath declared, and such a Command is not to be slighted; the King himself propounded it, and then he will agree with us in other requests that are fit for a King to give; we that have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to attend his Majesty, can tell you, that no King is more ready to hear the complaints of his Subjects, and withal you know no King is more sensible of all reproaches which touch his Honor.</p>
               <p>Will it not be fit to grant him this Honor, to have the Precedency? It was the Speech of an ancient Parliament man, Let us deal gently with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our King; by these Laws that we make we do bind our selves, and it is an addition of his power: None that dies but leaves his heir to the favor of the King, none that lives but needs the favor of the King: we having made our first union with God, it is next intended, that we be at one with our King, is it not fit we be at peace with our Head? his Majesty desires it, and expects it: After this unity with our head, there is consideration to be had of unity with our selves, after this we shall be all knit in one body, we shall all pronounce clearly <hi>Shiboleth,</hi> and we shall consider of the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and irregularities of the times, which none desires to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more then his Majesty and those whom you think most averse: Let us take the best way for Reformation: And will not this be a happy union, if the whole body concur to reduce all into regularity? if Laws be our Birth-rights, we shall hereby recover them and their splendor; this will have good aspect abroad, and it will give courage to our men that have been despised, and will prevent practises to continue divisions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us both at home and abroad. The first Sower of seeds of distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> amongst us, was an Agent of <hi>Spain, Gondomar,</hi> that did his Master great service here and at home.</p>
               <p>Since that we have had other Ministers that have blown the fire: The Ambassador of <hi>France</hi> told his Master at home, what he had wrought here the last Parliament, namely, divisions between King and people, and he was rewarded for it. Whilst we sit here in Parliament, there was another intended Parliament of <note place="margin">In <hi>Clerkenwel.</hi>

Give me leave to resemble her to <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>'s Tree, for she is so great, that she doth shade not onely the Palace of the King and the House of Nobles, but doth also shelter the Cottage of the poorest Begger.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if either now the blasts of indignation, or the unresist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able violater of Laws, <hi>Necessity,</hi> hath so bruised any of the Branches of this Tree, that either our Persons, or Goods, or Possessions have not the same shelter as before, yet let us not therfore neglect the root of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> great Tree, but water it with our Tears, that so these bruised Branches may be recovered, and the whole Tree again prosper and flourish. I know well, that <hi>Cor regis inscrutabile</hi>; and that Kings, although they are but men before God, yet they are gods before men. And therefore to my gracious and dread Soveraign (whose vertues are true qualities, ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate both in his judgment and nature) let my arm be cut off; nay, let my soul not live that day that I shall dare to lift up my arm to touch that forbidden Fruit, those Flowers of his Princely Crown and Diadem.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> But yet in our <hi>Eden,</hi> in this Garden of the Commonwealth, as there are the Flowers of the Sun, which are so glorious, that they are to be handled only by Royal Majesty: So, are there also some Daysies, and wholesom Herbs, which every common hand that lives and labors in this Garden may pick and gather up, and take comfort and repose in them: Amongst all which this <hi>Oculus Diei,</hi> this <hi>bona libertas</hi> is one, and the chief one. I will now descend to the Question, wherein I hold with all dutiful submission to better judgments, that these acts of Power, in imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and consining of his Majesties Subjects in such manner, without any Declaration of the Cause, are against the fundamental Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The first from the great favor which the Law doth give unto, and the great care which it hath ever taken of, the Liberty and safety of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>To proceed therefore in maintenance of my first reasons. I find our Law doth so much favor the Subjects Liberty of his person, that the body of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> man was not liable to be arrested or imprisoned for any other Cause at the Common-Law, but for force and things done against the Peace: For the Common-Law (being the preserver of the Land) so abhorreth force, that those that commit it she accounteth her capital Enemies, and therefore did subject their bodies to imprisonment. But by the Statute of <hi>Marle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge cap.</hi> 24. which was made 35 <hi>H.</hi> 3. who was the eighth King from the Conquest, because Bailiffs would not render accompts to their Lords, it was enacted, that their bodies should be attatched. And after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by the Stat: 23 <hi>E.</hi> 3.17. who was the eleventh King after the Conquest, because men made no conscience to pay their Debts, it was enacted, that their bodies should likewise be attached: But before those Statutes, no
mans body was subject to be taken or imprisoned, otherwise then as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid; whereby it is evident, how much the Common-Law favored the Liberty of the Subject, and protected his body from imprisonment.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Here he enforced the Reason by a Rule in Law, and mentioned some Cases in Law upon that rule, and so proceeded to a second Reason, drawn <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by an Argument <hi>à majore ad minus.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>I frame it thus (said he) If the King have no absolute power over our Lands or Goods, then <hi>à fortiori,</hi> not over our Persons, to imprison them, without declaring the cause, for our persons are much more worth, then either Lands or Goods; which is proved by what I have said already: And Christ himself makes it clear, where he saith, <hi>An non est corpus supra
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:35668:265"/>
vestimentum? Is not the Body of more worth then the Raiment?</hi> Nay, I may well say, that almost every leaf and page of all the Volumes of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law prove this right of Propriety, this distinction of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> as well between King and Subject, as one Subject and another: And therefore my conclusion follows, that if the Prerogative extend not nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Lands nor to Goods, then <hi>à fortiori,</hi> not to the Person, which is more worth then either Lands or Goods, as I said. And yet I agree, that by the very Law of Nature, service of the Person of the Subject is due <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to his Soveraign, but this must be in such things which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re not against the Law of Nature; but to have the body imprisoned without any cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and so to become in bondage, I am sure is contrary unto, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of Nature, and therefore not to be inforced by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign upon his Subjects.</p>
               <p n="3">3.
My next Reason is drawn <hi>ab inutili &amp; incommodo</hi>; for the Statute <hi>de frangentibus prisonám</hi> made 1 <hi>E.</hi> 2. is, <hi>Quod nullus qui prisonam fregerit subeat judicium vitae vel membrorum pro fractione prisonae tantum nisi causa <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> pro qua captus imprisonetur tale judicium requirat,</hi> whence this conclusion is clearly gathered, that if a man be committed to prison without declaring what cause; and then if either Malefactor do break the Prison, or the Gaoler suffer him to escape, albeit the Prisoner so escaping had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>crimen laesae Majestatis</hi>; yet neither the Gaoler, nor any other that procured his escape, by the Law suffer any corporal punishment for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him at large; which if admitted, might prove in consequence a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great danger to the Commonwealth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4.
My next Reason is drawn <hi>ab regis honore,</hi> from that great Honor the Law doth attribute unto Soveraign Majesty, and therefore the rule of Law is that <hi>Solum Rex hoc non potest facere, quod non potest justè agere.</hi> And <hi>Hussey</hi> chief Justice, 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. saith, that Sir <hi>Iohn Markham</hi> told King <hi>E.</hi> 4. he could not arrest a man either for Treason or Felony, as a Subject might, because that if the King did wrong, the party could not have an Action against him; and if the Kings Writ under his Great-Seal cannot imprison the Subject, unless it contains the cause; shall then the Kings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Warrant otherwise do it, without containing the cause? that his Judge upon the return thereof, may likewise judge of the same.</p>
               <p>But I will conclude with that which I finde reported of Sir <hi>Iohn Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> who was the Kings Serjeant, and so by the duty of his place would no doubt maintain, to his uttermost, the Prerogatives of the King his Royal Master: And yet it was by him thus said in those Reports of his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Case of Tavistry-Customs, That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> alwayes have had a Monarchy Royal, and not a Monarchy Seignoral: where, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the first saith he, <hi>The Subjects are Freemen, and have Propriety in their Goods and Free-hold, and Inheritance in their Lands: But under the later, they are as Villains and Slaves, and have propriety in nothing.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said he, <hi>When a Royal Monarch makes a new conquest; yet if he receives any of the Nations ancient Inhabitants into his Protection, they and their heirs after them shall enjoy their Lands and Liberties according to the Law.</hi> And there he vouched this President and Judgment following, given before <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror; viz. <hi>That one</hi> Sherborn, <hi>a</hi> Saxon, <hi>at the time of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Conquest being owner of a Castle and Lands in</hi> Norfolk, <hi>the Conqueror gave the same to one</hi> Warren <hi>a</hi> Norman, <hi>and</hi> Sherborn <hi>dying, the heir claiming the same by discent, according to the Law; it was before the Conqueror him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self adjudged for the heir, and that the gift thereof by the Conqueror was void.</hi>

                  </note> is onely an Award, and no Judgement; and in the L. Chief Justice his Argument there was no word spoken, that the King might commit or detain without cause.</p>
               <p>For the King to commit a man, is <hi>indignum Regi</hi>: Mercy and Honor flow immediately from the King, Judgement and Justice are his too, but they flow from his Ministers; the Sword is carried before him, but the Scepter in his hands. These are true Emblems of a good King.</p>

of any Noble man or Councellor against the Laws of the Realm; either else to help us to have access to her Majesty, to the end to become Suitors to her for the same: for divers have been imprisoned for suing ordinary Actions and Suits at the Common-Law, until they have been constrained to leave the same against their wills, and put the same to order, albeit Iudgement and Execution have been had therein to their great losses and griefs: for the aid of which persons her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Writs have sundry times been directed to sundry persons having the Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of such persons unlawfully imprisoned, upon which Writs no good or lawfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> cause of imprisonment hath been returned or certified: Whereupon, according to the Laws they have been discharged of their imprisonment; some of which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so delivered, have been again committed to prison in secret places, and not to any common or ordinary Prison, or lawfull Officer or Sheriff, or other lawfully authorized, to have or keep a Goal: So that upon complaint made for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the Queens Courts cannot tell to whom to direct her Majesties Writs; and by this means Iustice cannot be done. And moreover, divers Officers and Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of <hi>London</hi> have been many times committed to Prison for lawfull execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of her Majesties Writs, sued forth of her Majesties Court at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and thereby her Majesties Subjects and Officers are so terrified, that they dare not sue or execute her Majesties Laws, her Writs and Commandments: Divers others have been sent for by Pursevants, and brought to London from their dwellings, and by unlawfull imprisonment have been constrained, not only to withdraw their lawfull suits, but have been also compelled to pay the Pursevants so bringing such persons great sums of money. All which upon complaint, the Iudges are bound by Office and Oath to relieve and help, by, and according to her Majesties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Laws. And where it pleaseth your Lordships to will divers of us to set down in what Cases a Prisoner sent to custody by her Majesty or her Councel, are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Prison and not to be delivered by her Majesties Court or Iudges: We think, that if any person be committed by her Majesties command, from her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or by order from the Council board, and if any one or two of her Council commit one for high Treason, such persons so in the Cases before committed, may not be delivered by any of her Courts, without due Trial by the Law, and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of acquittal had. Nevertheless the Iudges may award the Queens Writ,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to bring the bodies of such Prisoners before them; and if upon return thereof, the causes of their commitment be certified to the Iudges, as it ought to be, then the Iudges in the Cases before, ought not to deliver him, but to remand the Prisoner to the place from whence he came, which cannot conveniently be done, unless no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the cause in general, or else in special, be given to the Keeper or Goaler that shall have the Custody of such a Prisoner.

               </note>After the reading of this Report, Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> said,
<q>That of my own knowledge this Book was written with my L. <hi>Andersons</hi> own hand; it is no flying report of a young Student. I was Solicitor then, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer <hi>Burley</hi> was as much against Commitment as any of this Kingdom; It was the <hi>White Staves</hi> that made this stir. Let us draw towards a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: The Question is, whether a Feeman can be imprisoned by the King without setting down the cause? I leave it as bare as <hi>Aesops</hi> Crow; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> they that argue against it, <hi>Humores moti &amp; non remoti corpus destruunt.</hi> It is a Maxime, the Common-Law hath admeasured the Kings Prerogative, that in no Case it can prejudice the Inheritance of the Subjects; had the Law given the Prerogative to that which is taken, it would have set some time to it, else mark what would follow. I shall have an Estate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:35668:267"/>
for life, or for years in my Land, or propriety in my Goods, and I shall be a Tenant at will for my liberty: I shall have propriety in my own house, and not liberty in my person, <hi>Perspicuè vera non sunt probanda.</hi> The King hath distributed his Judicial power to Courts of Justice, and to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Justice, it is too low for so great a Monarch as the King is, to commit men to Prison; and it is against Law, that men should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and no cause shewed. I would not speak this, but that I hope my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Gracious King will hear of it; yet it is not I <hi>Edw.

            <p n="1">I.

            <p n="2">II. That the Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> may not be denied, but ought to be granted to every man that is committed or detained in Prison, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise restrained, though it be by the command of the King, the Privy-Council, or any other, he praying the same.</p>
            <p n="3">III.

            <p>And then taking into consideration the Property of the Subject in his Goods, they came to this Resolution, to which there was not a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>In the first place (he said) we acknowledge all due honor, both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> unto the reverend Fathers of the Church, and to our Noble Lords; in that ye have shined before us as worthy Lights in the encouragement and maintenance of true Religion, being the true support of all Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Honors. And this forwardness of you is the more remarkable, when that viperous Generation, as your Lordships justly stiled them, do at ease with tooth and nail essay to rend the Bowels of their Mother. Give me leave to tell you what I know, that these now both vaunt at home and write to their friends abroad, They hope all will be well, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> doubt not to prevail, and to win ground upon us.</p>
               <p>And a little to awake the Zeal and Care of our learned and grave Fathers, it is fit that they take notice of that Hierarchy which is already established in competition with their Lordships; for they have a Bishop consecrated by the Pope; This Bishop hath his Subalternate Officers of all kindes, as Vicars-General, Arch-Deacons, Rural-Deans, Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, and such like: neither are these nominal or titular Officers alone; but they all execute their Jurisdictions, and make their ordinary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Visitations through the Kingdom, keep Courts, and determine Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Causes. And which is an Argument of more consequence, they keep ordinary intelligence by their Agents in <hi>Rome,</hi> and hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the Nuntio's and Cardinals both at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither are the Seculars alone grown to this height, but the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are more active and dangerous, and have taken deep root; they have already planted their Societies and Colledges of both Sexes, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> have setled Revenues, Houses, Libraries, Vestments, and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary provisions, to travel or stay at home: nay, even at this time they intend to hold a concurrent Assembly with this Parliament.</p>
               <p>But now since his Sacred Majesty hath extended his Royal arm, and since the Lords of his Council have by their Authority caused this nest of Wasps to be digged out of the Earth, and their Convocations to be scattered; And since your Lordships joyn in courage and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at least to reduce this people to their lawfull restraint, that they may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> do no more hurt, we conceive great hope and comfort, that the Almighty God will from henceforth prosper our endeavors both at home and aboad.</p>
               <p>But now, my Lords, to come to the chief Errand of this our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is to make known to you the Approbation of our House of that Petition to his Majesty, wherein you are pleased to request our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence.

One or two great men about the King so mewed him up, that he took no other advice but from them, whereupon the Chancellor took this Text and Theam in his Speech at the Parliament, <hi>Multorum consilia requiruntur in magnis, in bello qui maxime timent sunt in maximis periculis.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Let us give and not be afraid of our enemies, let us supply bountifully, cheerfully, and speedily, but enter not into particulars: <hi>Solomons</hi> Rule is, <hi>Qui repetit separat,</hi> nay, <hi>separat foederatos</hi>: We are united in duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the King, the King hath fourscore thousand pounds a year for the Navy, and to scowre the Narrow-seas, it hath been taken, and we are now to give it, and shall we now give more to guard the Seas? besides, when that is taken of our gift, it may be diverted another way.</p>
               <p>It shall never be said we deny all supply, I think my self bound, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there is <hi>commune periculum,</hi> there must be <hi>commune auxilium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Cannot forget that duty I owe to my Countrey,<note place="margin">Sir Thomas Wentworth</note> and unless we be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured against our Liberties, we cannot give; I speak not this to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions, but to the end that giving I may give cheerfully. As for the Propositions to be considered of, I incline to decline them, and to look upon the State of our Countrey, whether it be fit to give, or no: Are we come to an end for our Countries Liberties? have we trenched on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> rates of the Deputy Lieutenants? are we secured for time future?</p>
               <p>WE all desire remedies for our Grievances,<note place="margin">Sir Henry Martin.</note> and without them we shall neither be willing nor able to give; for my part, I heartily desire remedy, but which is the best and wisest way, that is the question: As we have made some progress in our Grievances, so let us now go on to supply; There is a Proverb, <hi>Non bis ad idem,</hi> dash not the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth twice against one Rock. We have Grievances, we must be eased of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them; who shall ease us? No Nation hath a people more loving to the King, then we; but let the King think it and believe it, there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betwixt him and us, before we can have his heart, we must remove it: Our disease is not so great but that it may be cured, it is the Kings Evil which must be cured with Gold; let us imitate <hi>Iacob,</hi> who wrestled with the Angel, and would not let him go; I would we could wrestle with the King in duty and love, and not to let him go in this Parliament, till he comply with us: We must take heed of too much repetition and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Grievances, it is dangerous, and it may make a further sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: He that talks too much of his Grievance, makes the party that is the cause of it make an apology, and to justifie it, and that is dangerous: let us do as Poets in a Tragedy, that sometimes have Comical Passages, and so a generous mind will sink presently. Sure a due presentation of such Grievances to such a King with moderation, will take place with him: In all deliberations go the safest way; The old way I have heard is first to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Grievances; we must not ty and bind our selves by all that was done before: I have gone over the Thames in former times on foot, when it was all an Ice, but that is no argument to perswade me by to do the like now, because I did so once.</p>

               <p>I have forgot my imployment unto the Palatinate, I was called before the Lords of the Councel, for what I know not, I heard it was for not lending on a Privy Seal, I told them if they will take my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Estate, let them, I will give it up, give I will not: When I was before the Lords of the Councel, they laid to my Charge my unwillingness to serve the King; I said, I had my Life and my Estate to serve my Countrey, and my Religion: They put upon me, if I did not pay, I should be put upon an imployment of Service; I was willing; after ten weeks waiting they told me I was to go with a Lord into the Palatinate, and that I should have imployment there, and means befitting; I told them I was a Subject, and desired means; some put on very eagerly, some dealt nobly; they said I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> must go on my own purse, I told them <hi>Nemo militat suis expensis</hi>; some told me I must go, I began to think, What, must I? none were ever sent out in that kinde; Lawyers told me I could not be so sent: having that assurance I demanded means, and was resolved not to stir upon those tearms, and in silence and duty I denied: upon this they having given me a Command to go, after some twelve days they told me they would not send me as a Soldier, but to attend on an Ambassador; I knew that stone would hit me, I setled my troubled estate, and addressed my self to that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. Hackwel</note>THis is a great Point that much concerns the Commonwealth, if the the King cannot command a Subject to his necessary service; and on the other side, it will be little less then an honorable banishment to the Subject, if he may. Our Books say the King cannot compel any to go out of the Realm, and an action brought against him, he cannot plead in Bar, that he is by command from the King in forein service, but the King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> may give him his protection. 5 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>N.</hi> 9. in the Parliament Roll there was an Ordinance whereby the King had power to send some to <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is ordained, that such Sages of the Law and Soldiers, where need shall be, though they refuse to go and excuse themselves, if their excuses be not reasonable, the King may do to them according to right and reason: If
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:35668:272"/>
the King by Law could do this of himself, and send them to <hi>Ireland,</hi> his own Dominion, he would never have taken power from his Parliament; and if men do not according to that Law, there is no imprisonment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
               <p>NO restraint,<note place="margin">Sir E.

               <p>IF any man owes a man displeasure,<note place="margin">Sir Thomas Wentworth</note> and shall procure him to be put into forain imployment, it will be a matter of high concernment to the Subject: We know the Honor and Justice of the King, but we know not what his ministers or the mediation of Ambassadors may do to work <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their own wrath upon any man.</p>

Yesterday after dinner we attended his Majesty, and he asked us what we had done: We said we had entred into the consideration of Supply, and that the final resolution was deferred till <hi>Friday</hi>; and that this was done for just reasons, to joyn the business <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of his Majesties and our Countries together, and this would further his Majesty, and it would give content to the Countrey, and that this union here might be spread abroad in the World. His Majesty answered, For Gods sake, why should any hinder them in their Liberties? if they did it not, I should think they dealt not faithfully with me. You may see a true Character of his Majesties disposition: let us proceed with courage, and rest assured his Majesty will give great ear unto us, and let us all joyn to make a perfect union to win the Kings heart; we shall find a gracious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> answer from the King, and a hearty cooperation from those that you think to be averse to us.</p>

I cannot believe it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> And as the sweetness and piety of his Majesty, which we have in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, makes me confident in this, so the expressions of our duty so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous and clear, as already hath been given, is my assurance for the other.</p>

               <p>Now let us proceed, said he, to those services that concern his Majesty and the Subject, which (I doubt not) in the end will render us so real unto him, that we shall not need more help to endear us to his favor.</p>

            <p>The Commons having expressed their dutiful affections towards his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, in giving him so large a Gift as five Subsidies, and having also shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their care of the Subjects in the liberty of their Person, and propriety in their Goods, did now prepare to transmit their Resolves to the Lords for their concurrence, and several Members were appointed to manage a Conference with the Lords concerning the same.

               <p>I am commanded to shew unto your Lordships in general, that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Reason, more ancient then Books, consisting much in unwritten Customs, yet so full of Justice and true Equity, that your most honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Predecessors and Ancestors propugned them with a <hi>Nolumus mutari</hi>; and so ancient, that from the Saxon days, notwithstanding the injuries and ruines of time, they have continued in most part the same, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in old remaining Monuments of the Laws of <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> the first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Christian King of <hi>Kent, Ina</hi> the King of the West Saxons, <hi>Osfa</hi> of the Mercians, and of <hi>Alfred</hi> the great Monarch, who united the Saxon Heptarchie, whose Laws are yet to be seen published, as some think, by Parliament, as he says to that end, <hi>ut qui sub uno rege, sub una lege regeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>: And though the Book of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> speaking of the times of the Danes, says, then <hi>Ius sopitum erat in regno, leges &amp; consuetudines sopitae sunt,</hi> and <hi>prava voluntas, vis &amp; violentia magis regnabant quam Judicia vel Justitia,</hi> yet by the blessing of God a good King <hi>Edward,</hi> commonly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> called St. <hi>Edward,</hi> did awaken those Laws; and as the old words are, <hi>Excitatas reparavit, reparatas decoravit, decoratas confirmavit,</hi> which <hi>Confirmavit</hi> shews, that good King <hi>Edward</hi> did not give those Laws which <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror and all his Successors since that time have sworn unto.</p>
               <p>And here my Lords, by many Cases frequent in our modern Laws strongly concurring with those of the ancient Saxon Kings, I might, if time were not more precious, demonstrate that our Laws and Customs were the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> same.</p>
               <p>I will onely intreat your Lordships leave to tell you, That as we have now, even in those Saxon times they had their Court Barons, and Court Leets, and Sheriffs Courts, by which as <hi>Tacitus</hi> says of the Germanes, their Ancestors <hi>Iura reddebant per pagos &amp; vicos</hi>; and I do believe as we have now, they had their Parliaments, where new Laws were made

               <p>Wherefore the cloudy part being mine, I will make haste to open way for your Lordships, to hear more certain Arguments, and such as go on more sure grounds.</p>
               <p>Be pleased then to know, that it is an undoubted and fundamental Point of this so ancient Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> That the Subject hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a true property in his goods and possessions, which doth preserve as sacred, that <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> that is the nurse of Industry, and mother of Courage, and without which there can be no Justice, of which <hi>meum &amp; tuum</hi> is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object. But the undoubted Birthright of true Subjects hath lately not a little been invaded and prejudiced by pressures, the more grievous, because they have been pursued by imprisonment, contrary to the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chises of this Land; and when according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, redress hath been sought for in a legal way, by demanding <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Corpus</hi> from the Judges, and a discharge by trial according to the Law of the Land, success hath failed: that now inforceth the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, to examine by Acts of Parliament, Precedents and Reasons, the truth of the English Subjects liberty, which I shall leave to learned Gentlemen to argue.</p>

               <note place="margin">Mr. Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note>NExt after Sir <hi>Dudly Diggs,</hi> spake Mr. <hi>Ed Littleton</hi> of the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi>
That their Lordships have heard that the Commons have taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> into consideration the matter of personal Liberty, and after long debate thereof, they have upon a full search, and clear understanding of all things pertinent to the question, unanimously declared, That no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to be committed or restrained in Prison by the command of the King or Privy Councel, or any other, unless some cause of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment, detainer, or restraint be expressed, for which by Law he ought to be committed, detained, or restrained: And they have sent me with other of their Members, to represent unto your Lordships the true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> grounds of their resolution, and have charged me particularly, leaving the reasons of Law and Precedents for others, to give your Lordships satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that this Liberty is established and confirmed by the whole State, the King, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, by several Acts of Parliament, the Authority whereof is so great, that it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Answer, save by Interpretation or Repeal by future Statutes. And these I shall minde your Lordships of, are so direct in the point, that they can bear no other exposition at all, and sure I am they are still in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> force; The first of them is the grand Charter of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> first granted in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. year of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and renewed in the 9<hi rend="sup">t•</hi>. year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and since confirmed in Parliament above 30. times, the words there are <q>
                  <bibl>Chap. 29.</bibl> 
                  <hi>Nullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur, aut dissei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sietur de libero tenemento suo vel liberis consuetudinibus suis, aut utlagetur, aut

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He then proceeded to open, and argued learnedly upon the several Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in the last recited Clause of <hi>Magna Charta</hi>; and further shewed,
<q>That no invasion was made upon this personal Liberty, till the time of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. which was soon resented by the Subject, for in the 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Chap. 9. it is enacted, That no man from henceforth shall be attached on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> any occasion, nor fore-judged of Life or Limb, nor his Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Goods, nor Chattels seised into the Kings hands, against the Form of the great Charter, and the Law of the Land: and 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Chap. 4. it is more full, and doth expound the words of the grand Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is thus; Whereas it is contained in the grand Charter of the Franchises of <hi>England,</hi> that none shall be Imprisoned nor put out of his Freehold, nor free Custom, unless it be by the Law of the Land, it is award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, assented and established, That from henceforth none shall be taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by Petition or suggestion made to our Lord the King, or to his Councel, unless it be by Indictment or Presentment of his good and lawful People of the the same neighborhood, which such Deed shall be done in due maner, or by process made by W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it original at the common Law; nor that none be outed of his Franchises, nor Office, Freehold, unless it be duly brought in Answer, and fore-judged of the same, by the course of the Law, and that if any thing be done against the same, it shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed and holden for none: and 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Chap. 3. it is more direct, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this Liberty being followed with fresh suit by the Subject, where the words are not many, but very full and significant, That no man of what state and condition he be, shall be put out of his Lands nor Tenements, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without it be brought in Answer by due process of the Law.</q>
Several other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes were cited by him, in confirmation of this point of the Liberty of the Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Kings Councel afterward made Objections to the said Argument, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> yet acknowledged that the seven Statutes urged by the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, are in force; yet said that some of them are in general words, and therefore conclude nothing, but are to be expounded by Precedents, and some of them are applied to the suggestion of Subjects, and not to the Kings command simply of its self; and that <hi>per legem terrae</hi> in Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, cannot be understood for process of Law and original Writs; for that in Criminal proceedings no original Writ is usual at all, but every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable either for Felony or breach of the Peace, or to prevent the breach <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the Peace, may commit without Process or original Writ; it were very hard the King should not have the power of a Constable. They also ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, That the King was not bound to express the cause of Imprisonment, because there may be in it matter of State, not fit to be revealed for a time, lest the confederates thereupon make means to escape the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Besides, that which the Commons do say, that the party ought to be delivered or bailed, is a contradiction in its self; for bayling doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a kinde of Imprisonment still, Delivery, is a total freeing: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> bayling is a grace or favor of a Court of Justice, and they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to do it.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>To this it was replyed,
That the Statutes were direct in Point, and though some of them speak of suggestions of the Subjects, yet they are in equal reason a commitment by command of the King, as when the King taketh notice of a thing himself: And for the words <hi>per legem terrae,</hi>
                  <pb n="536" facs="tcp:35668:276"/>
original Writs onely are not intended, but all other legal process, which comprehendeth the whole proceedings of the Law upon Cause other then trial by Jury, and the course of the Law is rendred by due process of the Law, and no man ought to be imprisoned by special command without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, or other due process to be made by the Law. And whereas it is said there might be danger in revealing the Cause, that may be avoided by declaring a general Cause, as for Treason, suspicion of Treason, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prision of Treason, Felony, without expressing the particulars which can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> give no greater light to a confederate, then will be conceived upon the very apprehension upon the imprisonment, if nothing at all were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               <p>And as for the bayling of the party committed, it hath ever been the discretion of the Judges, to give so much respect to a commitment, by the command of the King or the privy Councel, which are ever intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done in just and weighty Cases, that they will not presently set them free, but bail them to answer what shall be objected against them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> on the Kings behalf; but if any other inferior Officer do commit a man without shewing cause, they do instantly deliver him, as having no cause to expect their leasure; so that Delivery is applyed to the imprisoned, by command of some mean minister of Justice: Bailing, when it is done by command of the King or his Councel; and though Bailing is a grace and favor of the Court, in case of Felony and other crimes, for that there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way to discharge them in convenient time by their trial; but where no cause of imprisonment is returned, but the command of the King, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is no way to deliver such persons by trial or otherwise, but that of the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and if they should be then remanded, they might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually imprisoned without any remedy at all, and consequently a man that had committed no offence might be in a worse case then a greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, for the latter should have an ordinary trial to discharge him, the other should never be delivered.</p>

            <q>
               <p>Your Lordships have heard from the Gentleman that last spake, a great part of the grounds upon which the House of Commons upon mature deliberation proceeded, to that clear resolution touching the right of liberty of their persons: The many Acts of Parliament, which are the written Laws of the Land, and are expresly in the Point, have bin read and opened, and such Objections as have been by some made unto them, and Objections also made out of another Act of Parliament, have been cleared and answered: It may seem now perhaps (my Lords) that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> remains needful to be further added, for the enforcement and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of so fundamental and established a Right and Liberty, belonging to every freeman of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The House of Commons taking into consideration, that in this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being of so high a nature, that never any exceeded it in any Court of Justice whatsoever, all the several ways of just examination of the Truth should be used, have also most carefully informed themselves of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Judgements or Precedents concerning this great Point, either way; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and have been no less careful of the due preservation of his Majesties just Prerogative, then of their own Rights. The Precedents here are of two kinds, either meerly matter of Record, or else the former resolutions of the Judges, after solemn debate in the Point.</p>
               <p>This Point that concerns Precedents, the House of Commons have
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:35668:276"/>
commanded me to present to your Lordships, which I shall as briefly as I may, so I do it faithfully and perspicuously: to that end, my Lords, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the particulars of any of those Precedents, I shall first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to your Lordships that which will seem as a general key for the opening and true apprehension of all them of record, without which key no man, unless he be verst in the entries and course of the Kings Bench, can possibly understand.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
In all cases, my Lords, where any Right or Liberty belongs to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by any positive Law, written or unwritten, if there were not also a remedy by Law for enjoying or regaining of this Right or Liberty, when it is violated or taken from him; the positive Law were most vain, and to no purpose; and it were to no purpose for any man to have any right in any Land or other Inheritance, if there were not a known remedy, that is, an Action or Writ, by which in some Court of ordinary Justice he might recover it. And in this case of Right of Liberty of Person, if there were not a remedy in the Law for regaining it when it is restrained, it were of no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> purpose to speak of Laws that ordain it should not be restrained.</p>
               <p>The Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> or <hi>Corpus cum causa,</hi> is the highest remedy in Law for any man that is imprisoned, and the onely remedy for him that is imprisoned by the special command of the King, or the Lords of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Your Lordships have heard the resolution of the House of Commons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> touching the enlargement of a man committed by the command of the King, or the privy Councel, or any other, without cause shewed of such commitment; which resolution, as it is grounded upon Acts of Parliament already shewen, (the reason of the Law of the Land being committed to the charge of another to open unto unto you) so it is strengthened by many Precedents of Records.
He then produced twelve Precedents full and directly in the point, to prove that persons so committed ought to be delivered upon bayl, which were distinctly opened and read to their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Lordships; then he also offered to their consideration other kind of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, which were solemn resolutions of Judges, things not of Record, but yet remain in Authentick Copies, which Precedents and Authorities we omit for the length thereof.</p>
            </q>
            <p>He then proceeded, and said,
<q>The House of Commons desiring with
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:35668:277"/>
all care to inform themselves fully of the truth of the resolution of the Judges in the 34. year of the Queen, cited in the case of Sir <hi>Iohn Heven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> by the Kings Councel, as Arguments against his not being bayled, have got into their hands a Book of select Cases, collected by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and learned Judge, Chief Justice <hi>Anderson,</hi> all written with his own hand; which he caused to be read, being the same which hath been already mentioned in the Collections of this Parliament; which Precedents, saith he, do fully resolve enough for the maintenance of the ancient and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> point of Liberty of the Person, to be regained by <hi>Hab. Corp.</hi> when any is imprisoned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then he concluded, that having thus gone through the charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him by the House of Commons, he should now, as he had leave and direction given him, lest their Lordships should be put to much trouble and expence of time in finding and getting Copies at large of those things which he had cited, offer also to their Lordships Authentick Copies of them all, and so left them, and whatever else he had said, to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> further consideration.</p>
            <p>LAst of all Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> took up the Argument,<note place="margin">Sir Edward Cook.</note> as to the rational part of the Law, and began with this Introduction,</p>
            <q>
               <p>Your Lordships have heard 7. Acts of Parliament in point, and 31. Precedents summarily collected, and with great understanding delivered, which I have perused, and understand them all throughly; 12. of the Precedents are <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis terminantibus,</hi> a whole Jury of Precedents, and all in the point; I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> am much transported with joy, because of the hope of good success in this weighty business, your Lordships being so full of Justice, and the very Theme and Subject doth promise success, which was <hi>Corpus cum cansa,</hi> the freedom of an <hi>English</hi> man, not to be imprisoned without cause shewn, which is my part to shew, and the reason and the cause why it should be so, wherein I will not be prolix nor copious, for to guild Gold were idle and superfluous.
And after he had cleared some doubts made of the Statute of <hi>Westminster,</hi> which saith, That the Sheriffs and others in some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cases may not replevin men in Prison; he proceeded further, and said,
That all those Arguments offered unto your Lordships in this last conference, are of a double nature. 1. Acts of Parliament. 2. Judicial Precedents. For the first, I hold it a proper Argument for your Lordships, because you my Lords temporal, and you my Lords spiritual gave your assent unto those Acts of Parliament, and therefore if these cannot perswade you, nothing can. For the second, which are Judicial Precedents, it is <hi>Argumentum ab authoritate,</hi> and <hi>Argumentum ab authoritate valet affimative</hi>; that is, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> conceive, though it be no good Argument to say negatively the Judges have given no opinion in the point. 3. It is good Law; which I fortifie with a strong Axiome, <hi>Neminem oportet sapientiorem esse legibus.</hi> Now these two arguments being so well pressed to your Lordships by my Colleagues; I think your Lordships may wonder what my part may be; it is short, but sweet; it is the Reason of all those Laws and Precedents, and Reason must needs be welcome to all men; for all men are not capable of the understanding of the Law, but every man is capable of Reason; and those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Reasons I offer to your Lordships, in affirmance of the antient Laws and Precedents made for the Liberty of the Subject against Imprisonment without cause expressed.</p>

               <p>The first general Reason is <hi>a re ipsa,</hi> even from the nature of Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  <hi>ex visceribus causae,</hi> for I will speak nothing but <hi>ad idem,</hi> be it close or other Imprisonment; and this Argument is three-fold, because an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned man upon will and pleasure is
<list>
                     <item>1. A Bond-man.</item>
                     <item>2. Worse then a Bond-man.</item>
                     <item>3. Not so much as a man, for <hi>mortuus homo non est homo,</hi> a Prisoner is a dead man.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. No man can be imprisoned upon will and pleasure of any but he that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is a Bond-man and villain, for that Imprisonment and Bondage are <hi>Propria quarto modo</hi> to villains; now <hi>Propria quarto modo,</hi> and the <hi>species</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible, Whosoever is a Bond-man may be imprisoned upon will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and whosoever may be imprisoned upon will and pleasure is a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If free men of <hi>England</hi> might be imprisoned at the will and pleasure of the King or his commandment, then were they in worse case then Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or villains; for the Lord of a villain cannot command another to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> imprison his villain without cause, as of disobedience, or refusing to serve, as it is agreed in the year books.
And here he said that no man should reprehend any thing that he said out of Books or Records; he said he would prove a free man imprisonable upon command or pleasure, without cause expressed, to be absolutely in worse case then a villain; and if he did not make this plain, he desired their Lordships not to believe him in any thing else, and then produced two Book Cases 7. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 50. in the new print, 348. old print.
A Prior had commanded one to imprison his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> villain, the Judges were ready to bayl him, till the Prior gave his reason, that he refused to be Bayliff of his Manour, and that satisfied the Judges. 2d. Case 33. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. title <hi>Tresp.</hi> 253. in <hi>Faux imprisonment,</hi> it was of an Abbot, who commanded one to take and detain his villain, but demanded his cause, he gives it, because he refused, being thereunto required, to drive his Cattel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> free men imprisoned without cause shewn, are in worse case then villains, that must have a cause shewn them why they are imprisoned.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
3. A Free man impisoned without cause, is so far from being a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he is not so much as a man, but is indeed a dead man, and so no man; imprisonment is in Law a civil death; <hi>perdit domum, familiam, vicinos, patriam,</hi> and is to live amongst wretched and wicked men, Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors and the like.</p>
            </q>
            <p n="3">And that death and imprisonment was the same, he proved by an Argument <hi>ab effectis,</hi> because they both produce the like immediate effects; he quoted a Book for this: If a man be threatned to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> be killed, he may avoid seoffment of Lands, gifts of goods, &amp;c. so it is if he be threatned to be imprisoned, the one is an actual, the other is a civil death. And this is the first general Argument drawn <hi>a re ipsa,</hi> from the nature of imprisonment, to which <hi>res ipsa consilium dedit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second general Reason he took also from his books, for he said he hath no Law but what by great pains and industry he learnt at his book, for at ten years of age he had no more Law then other men of like age; and
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:35668:278"/>
this second reason is <hi>a minore ad majus,</hi> he takes it from <hi>Bracton, Minima poena corporalis, est major qualibet pecuniaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>But the King himself cannot impose a fine upon any man, but it must be done judicially by his Judges, <hi>per justitiarios in Curia, non per regem in Camera,</hi> and so it hath been resolved by all the Judges of <hi>England</hi>; he quoted 3. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>fo.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>The third general Reason is taken from the number and diversity of remedies which the Laws give against imprisonment. <hi>Viz.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The latter two of these are antiquated, but the Writ <hi>De odio &amp; atia</hi> is revived, for that was given by the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, Cha.</hi> 26. and therefore though it were repealed by Statute of 42. <hi>E.</hi> 3. by which it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is provided that all Statutes made against <hi>Magna Charta</hi> are void; now the Law would never have given so many remedies, if the free men of <hi>England</hi> might have been imprisoned at free will and pleasure.</p>
               <p>The fourth general Reason is from the extent and universality of the pretended power to imprison, for it should extend not onely to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of this Realm and their Posterities, but to the Nobles of the Land and their progenies, to the Bishops and Clergy of the Realm, and their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Successors. And he gave a cause why the Commons came to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, <hi>Commune periculum commune requirit auxilium.</hi> Nay, it reacheth to all persons of what condition, or sex, or age soever; to all Judges and Officers, whose attendance is necessary, &amp;c. without exception, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an imprisonment of such an extent, without reason, is against reason.</p>
               <p>The fifth general Reason is drawn from the indefiniteness of time, the pretended power being limited to no time, it may be perpetual during life, and this is very hard; to cast an old man into prison, nay, to close prison, and no time allotted for his coming forth, is a hard case, as any man would think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that had been so used. And here he held it an unreasonable thing, that a man had a remedy for his Horse or Cattle if detained, and none for his body thus indefinitely imprisoned; for a Prison without any prefixed time, is a kinde of Hell.</p>
               <p>The sixth and last Argument is <hi>a Fine</hi>; and <hi>sapiens incipit a Fine,</hi> and he wisht he had begun there also; and this Argument he made three-fold:
<list>
                     <label>Ab honesto.</label>
                     <item>This being less honourable.</item>
                     <label>Ab utili.</label>
                     <item>This being less profitable.</item>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                     <label>A tuto.</label>
                     <item>This Imprisonment by will and pleasure being very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for King and Kingdom.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Ab honesto.</hi> It would be no honour to a King or Kingdom, to be a King of Bond-men or Slaves, the end of this would be both <hi>Dedecus &amp; Damnum,</hi> both to King and Kingdom, that in former times hath been so renowned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ab utili.</hi> It would be against the profit of the King and Kingdom, for the execution of those Laws before remembred, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.28. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. whereby the King was inhibited to imprison upon pleasure; You see (quoth he) that this was <hi>vetus querela,</hi> an old question, and now brought in again, after seven Acts of Parliament; I say the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of all these Laws are adjudged in Parliament to be for the common profit of the King and People; and he quoted the Roll, this pretended
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:35668:278"/>
power being against the profit of the King, can be no part of his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</p>
               <p>He was pleased to call this a binding Reason, and to say that the wit of man could not answer it; that great men kept this Roll from being Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that it was equivalent in force to the printed Rolls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Reason <hi>a tuto.</hi> It is dangerous to the King for two respects; first, of loss, secondly, of destroying of the endeavors of men: First, if he be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> committed without the expression of the cause, though he escape, albeit in truth it were for treason or felony, yet this escape is neither felony nor treason, but if the cause be expressed for suspicion of treason or felony, then the escape, though he be innocent, is treason or felony. He quoted a Cause in print like a reason of the Law, not like <hi>Remittitur</hi> at the rising of the Court, for the Prisoner <hi>traditur in ballium quod breve Regis non fuit susficiens causa,</hi> The Kings Command. He quoted another famous Case, Commons in Parliament incensed against the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he should be committed: The Lords and all the Judges, whereof those great Worthies, <hi>Prescot</hi> and <hi>Fortescue,</hi> were two, delivered a flat opinion, that he ought not to be committed without an especial Cause. He questioned also the name and etymologie of the Writ in question, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus cum causa; Ergo,</hi> the Cause must be brought before the Judge, else how can he take notice hereof?</p>
               <p>Lastly, he pressed a place in the Gospel, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. last <hi>verse,</hi> which <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> conceives is an absurd and unreasonable thing, to send a Prisoner to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Roman Emperor, and not to write along with him the Cause alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; send therefore no man a Prisoner without his causes along with him, <hi>Hoc fac &amp; vives,</hi> and that was the first reason <hi>a tuto,</hi> that it was not safe for the King in regard of Loss, to commit men without a Cause.</p>
               <p>The second Reason is, That such commitments will destroy the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of all men; Who will endeavor to imploy himself in any profession, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of War, Merchandise, or of any liberal knowledge, if he be but Tenant at will of his Liberty? for no Tenant at will will support or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> any thing, because he hath no certain estate; <hi>Ergo,</hi> to make men Tenants at will of their Liberties, destroys all industry and endeavors whatsoever.</p>

            </p>
            <p>These were his Reasons.</p>
            <p>Here he made another Protestation,</p>
            <q>
               <p>That if remedy had been given in this Case, they would not have medled therewith by no means; but now that remedy being not obtained in the Kings Bench, without looking back upon any thing that hath been done or omitted, they desire some provision for the future onely. And here he took occasion to adde four <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Book Cases and Authorities, all in the Point, saying, That if the learned Councel on the other side, could produce but one against the Liberties, so pat and pertinent, oh! how they would hug and cull it. 16. <hi>H.</hi> 6.<hi>tit. monstrance de faits</hi> 82. by the whole Court, the King in his Presence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command a man to be arrested, but an action of false imprisonment lieth against him that arresteth; if not the King in his royal Presence,

then none others can do it, <hi>Non sic itur ad astra.</hi> 1. Hen. 7.4. <hi>Hussey</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the opinion of <hi>Markham,</hi> chief Justice to <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. that he could not imprison by word of mouth; and the reason, because the party hath no remedy; for the Law leaves every man a remedy of causless imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he added that <hi>Markham</hi> was a worthy Judge, though he fell into adversities at last by the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> his means. <hi>Fortescue,</hi> Chap. 8. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio ore nullus Regum usus est,</hi> to imprison any man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Times blessed and renowned for Justice and Religion, in <hi>Pl.</hi> 235. the common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Law hath so admeasured the Kings Prerogative, as he cannot prejudice any man in his inheritance, and the greatest inheritance a man hath, is the liberty of his Person, for all others are accessary to it; for thus he quoted the Orator: <hi>Major haereditas venit unicuique nostrum a Jure &amp; legibus quam a parentibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And these are the four Authorities he cited in this point: Now he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and answered two Objections; First, in point of State; Secondly, in the Course held by the House of Commons.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

May not the Privy Councel commit without cause shewed in no matter of State where secrecie is required? would not this be an hinderance to his Majesties service?</p>

                  <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
It can be no prejudice to the King by reason of matter of State, for the cause must be of a higher or lower nature; if it be for suspicion of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, misprision of Treason or Felony, it may be by general words couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if it be for any other thing of smaller nature, as contempt and the like, the particular cause must be shewed, and no <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> cause to be admitted.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
The Subject hath in this Case sued for remedy in the Kings Bench by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and found none; therefore it is necessary to be cleared in Parliament. And here ends his Discourse: And then he made a recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all that had been offered unto their Lordships, That generally their Lordships had been advised by the most faithful Counsellors that can be; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dead men these cannot be daunted by fear, nor muzled by affection, reward or hope of preferment, and therefore their Lordships might safely believe them; particularly their Lordships had three several kinds of Proofs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Acts of Parliament, judicial Precedents, good Reasons. First, you have had many ancient Acts of Parliament in the Point, besides <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that is, seven Acts of Parliament, which indeed are thirty seven, <hi>Magna Charta</hi> being confirmed thirty times, for so often have the Kings of <hi>England</hi> given their royal Assents thereunto.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Judicial Precedents of grave and reverend Judges, in <hi>terminis termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantibus,</hi> that long since departed the world, and they were many in number. Precedents being twelve, and the Judges four of a Bench, made four times twelve, and that is forty eight Judges.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You have, as he tearmed them, <hi>vividas rationes,</hi> manifest and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Reasons: Towards the conclusion he declared to their Lordships, That they of the House of Commons have upon great study and serious Consideration, made a great manifestation unanimously, <hi>Nullo contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> concerning this great liberty of the Subject, and have vindicated and recovered the Body of this fundamental Liberty, both of their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships and themselves, from shadows which sometimes of the day are long sometimes short, and sometimes long again; and therefore we must not be guided by shadows: and they have transmitted to their Lordships, not
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:35668:279"/>
                  <hi>capita rerum,</hi> Heads or Briefs, for these <hi>compendia</hi> are <hi>dispendia</hi>; but the Records at large, in <hi>terminis terminantibus:</hi> and so he concluded, that their Lordships are involved in the same danger, and therefore <hi>ex congruo &amp; condigno</hi> they desired a Conference, to the end their Lordships might make the like Declaration as they had done; <hi>Commune periculum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune requirit auxilium</hi>; and thereupon take such further course, as may secure their Lordships and them, and all their Posterity, in enjoying of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their ancient undoubted and fundamental Liberties.</p>

His Majesty having given timely notice to this House, as well of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the pressure of the time, as of the necessity of Supply, hath long since ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected some fruit of that which was so happily begun; but finding a stop beyond all expectation, after so good beginning, he hath commanded me to tell you, that without any further or unnecessary delay he would have you to proceed in this business; for however he hath been willing and consenting his affairs and ours should concur and proceed together, yet his meaning was not that the one should give interruption to the other, nor the time to be spun out upon any pretence, upon which the common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cause of Christendom doth so much depend: he bids us therefore take heed that we force not him to make an unpleasing end of that which was so well begun.</p>
                        <p>I will discharge my duty, I shall humbly desire this honorable House not to undervalue or overstrain this Message; if we conceive any thing in it to tend as if his Majesty threatned to dissolve this Parliament, we are deceived; his Majesty intends the contrary, and to put us in such a way that our business may have speedy success. His Majesty takes notice of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> peremptory order whereby he conceived that his business was excluded, at least for a time, that which doth most press his Majesty is time, believe that the affairs now in hand press his Majesties heart more then us, let us remove delaies that are more then necessary, let us awaken our selves, he intends a speedy dispatch. I must with some grief tell you; that
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:35668:280"/>
notice is taken, as if this House pressed not upon the abuses of Power onely, but upon Power it self; this toucheth the King and us, who are supported by that Power: Let the King hear of any abuses of Power, he will willingly hear us, and let us not bend our selves against the extention of his Royal Power, but contain our selves within those bounds, that we meddle onely with pressures and abuses of Power, and we shall have the best satisfaction that ever King gave. I beseech you all concur this way, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and use that moderation we have had the honor yet to gain.</p>
                        <p>Being moved to explain what he meant by the word (Power) which (he said) we did oppose, he answered,</p>
                        <p>I cannot descend to particulars, or go from that his Majesty gave me warrant or power to deliver.</p>
                        <p>This Message was very unpleasing to the House, and many debates suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thereupon. And</p>

YOur dutiful and loyal Commons here assembled, were lately humble suitors to your Majesty for access to your Royal presence; the occasion that moved their desires herein was a particular of importance, worthy your Princely consideration, which, as it well deserves, should have been the onely subject of my Speech at this time.</p>
                        <p>But since your gracious answer for this access obtained by a message from your Majesty, they have had some cause to doubt that your Majesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is not so well satisfied with the manner of their proceedings, as their hearty desire is you should be, especially in that part which concerns your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties present supply, as if in the prosecution thereof they had of late used some slackness or delay.</p>
                        <p>And because no unhappiness of theirs can parallel with that which may proceed from a misunderstanding in your Majesty of their clear and loyal intentions, they have commanded me to attend your Majesty with an humble and summary Declaration of their proceedings since this short <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> time of their sitting, which they hope will give your Majesty abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant satisfaction, that never People did more truly desire to be indeared in the favour and gracious opinion of their Soveraign; and withal to let you see, that as you can have no where more faithful counsel, so your great designs and occasions can no way be so speedily or heartily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, as in this old and antient way of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>For this purpose they humbly beseech your Majesty to take into your Royal consideration, that although by antient right of Parliament the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> matters there debated are to be disposed in their true method and order, and that their constant custome hath been to take into their considerations the common grievances of the Kingdom, before they enter upon the matter of supply; yet to make a full expression of that zeal and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which they bear to your Royal Majesty, equalling at least, if not exceeding the best affections of their predecessors, to the best of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors; they have in this Assembly, contrary to the ordinary proceedings of Parliament, given your Majesties Supply precedence before the common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> grievance of the Subject, how pressing soever, joyning with it onely those fundamental and vital liberties of the Kingdom, which give sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence and ability to your Subjects.</p>
                        <p>This was their original order and resolution, and was grounded upon a true discerning that these two considerations could not be severed, but did both of them intirely concern your Majesties service, consisting no less in enabling and encouraging the Subject, then in proportioning a Present suiting to your Majesties occasions and their abilities; nay, so far have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> they been from using any unnecessary delays, as though of the two that of Supply were the latter proposition amongst them, the Grand Committee to which both were referred hath made that of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties supply first ready for conclusion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="547" facs="tcp:35668:281"/>
And to be sure your Majesties supply might receive no interruption by the other, differing from usage and custome (in cases of this nature) sent up of those that concern the Subjects by parcels, some to your Majesty, and some to the Lords, to the end your Majesty might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such speedy content, as suted with the largest and best extent of their first order.</p>
                        <p>Sir, You are the breath of our nostrils, and the light of our eyes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and besides those many comforts, which under you and your Royal progenitors, in this frame of Government, this Nation hath enjoyed, the Religion we profess hath taught us whose Image you are; and we do all most humbly beseech your Majesty to believe, that nothing is or can be more dear unto us then the sacred Rights and Prerogatives of your Crown; no person or Councel can be greater lovers of you, nor be more truly careful to maintain them, and the preserving of those fundamental Liberties which concern the freedom of our persons, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> propriety of goods and estates, is an essential means to establish the true glory of a Monarchy.</p>
                        <p>For rich and free Subjects as they are best governed, so they are most able to do your Majesty service, either in peace or war, which next under God hath been the cause of the happy and famous victories of this Nation, beyond other Kingdoms of larger Territories and greater number of People.</p>
                        <p>What information soever contrary to this shall be brought unto your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Majesty, can come from no other then such as for their own ends under colour of advancing the Prerogative, do indeed undermine and weaken Royal Power by impoverishing the Subjects, render this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy less glorious, and the People less able to serve your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</p>
                        <p>Having (by this that hath been said) cleared our hearts and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to your Majesty, our trust is, that in your Royal Judgement we shall be free from the least opinion of giving any necessary stop to our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> proceedings in the matter of your supply, and that your Majesty will be pleased to entertain belief of our alacrity and chearfulness in your service, and that hereafter no such misfortune shall befal us to be misunderstood by your Majesty in any thing.</p>
                        <p>We all most humbly beseech your Majesty to receive no informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this or any other business from private relations, but to weigh and judge of our proceedings by those resolutions of the House that shall be represented from our selves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> This rightly and graciously understood, we are confident from the knowledge of your goodness and our own hearts, that the ending of this Parliament shall be much more happy then the beginning, and be to all ages styled the <hi>blessed Parliament,</hi> for making perfect union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the best King and the best People, that your Majesty may ever delight in calling us together, and we in the comforts of your gracious favour towards us.</p>
                        <p>In this hope I return to my first errand, which will best appear by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that which I shall humbly desire you to hear, and being an humble Petition for the House of Commons for redressing of those many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences and distractions that have befallen your Subjects by the billeting of Soldiers in private mens houses against their wills.</p>

<pb n="548" facs="tcp:35668:282"/>
that our faith and loyalty may have such place in your Royal thoughts, as to rest assured that all your Subjects will be ready to lay down their lives for the defence of your sacred person and this Kingdom.</p>

                        <p>For the second, we do most humbly beseech your Majesty to take into your Princely consideration, that many of those Companies, besides their dissolute dispositions and carriages, are such as do openly profess themselves Papists, and therefore to be suspected, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that if occasion serve they will rather adhere to a forein Enemy of that Religion, then to your Majesty their liege Lord and Soveraign, especially some of their Captains and Commanders, being as Popishly affected as themselves, and having served in the Wars on the part of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Arch-Dutchess against your Majesties Allies; which, of what pernicious consequence it may prove, and how prejudicial to the safety of your Kingdom, we leave to your Majesties high and Princely wisedom.</p>
                        <p>And now upon these, and many more which might be alledged, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> most weighty and important Reasons grounded on the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Worship and Service of Almighty God, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and advancement of your Majesties high honour and profit, the preservation of the antient and undoubted Liberties of your People, and therein of Iustice, Industry, Valour, which meerly concerns the glory and happiness of your Majesty, and all your

                        <p>We your Majesties most humble and loyal Subjects, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of your House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in the name of all the Commonalty of your Kingdom, who are upon this occasion most miserably disconsolate and afflicted, prostrate at the Throne of your Grace and Iustice do most ardently beg a present remove of this insupportable burden, and that your Majesty would be graciously pleased to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> secure us from the like pressure in the time to come.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen, when I sent you my last Message, I did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not expect a reply, for I intended it to hasten you, I told you at your first meeting this time was not to be spent in words, and I am sure it is less fit for disputes, which if I had a desire to entertain, Mr. Speakers pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble might have given me ground enough: The question is not now, what Liberty you have in disposing of matters handled in your House, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this time what is fit to be done.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore I hope you will follow my example, in eschewing Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fall to your important business. You make a Protestation of your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> affection and zeal to my Prerogative, grounded upon such good and just Reasons, that I must believe you: But I look that you use me with the like charity, to believe what I have declared more then once since your meeting with us, that I am as forward as you for the preservation of your true Liberties. Let us not spend so much time in this that may hazard both my Prerogative and your Liberties to our enemies.</p>
                        <p>To be short, go on speedily with your businesses without any more Apologies, for time calls fast on you, which will neither stay for you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nor me: Wherefore it is my duty to hasten, as knowing the necessity of it, and yours, to give credit to what I say, as to him that sits at the Helm.</p>
                        <p>For what concerns your Petition, I shall make answer in a convenient time.</p>

                        <p>MY Lords,<note place="margin">The Lord Keepers Speech to both Houses, concerning supply, by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note> and ye the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the House of Commons, ye cannot but remember the great and important Affairs concerning the safety both of the State and Religion, declared at first from his Majesties own mouth, to be the causes of the Assembling of this Parliament; the sense whereof, as it doth daily increase with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, so it ought to do, and his Majesty doubts not but it doth so with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> you, since the danger increaseth every day, both by effluxion of time, and preparations of the Enemy.</p>
                        <p>Yet his Majesty doth well weigh, that this expence of time hath been occasioned by the Debate which hath arisen in both Houses touching the Liberty of the Subject; in which, as his Majesty takes in good part the purpose and intent of the Houses, so clearly and frequently professed, that they would not diminish or blemish his just Prerogative, so he presumes that ye will all confess it a point of extraordinary Grace and Justice in him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to suffer it to rest so long in dispute without interruption; but now his Majesty considering the length of time which it hath taken, and fearing nothing so much as any future loss of that whereof every hour and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute is so pretious, and foreseeing that the ordinary way of Debate, though never so carefully husbanded, in regard of the Form of both Houses, necessarily takes more time then the Affairs of Christendom can permit, his Majesty out of his great Princely care hath thought of this expedient to shorten the business, by declaring the clearness of his own heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And therefore hath commanded me to let you know, <hi>That he holdeth the Statute of Magna Charta, and the other Six Statutes insisted upon for the Subjects Liberty, to be all in force, and assures you, that he will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all his Subjects in the just Freedom of their Persons, and safety of their Estates: And that he will govern according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm: And that ye shall finde as much security in his Majesties Royal Word and Promise, as in the strength of any Law ye can make; so that hereafter ye shall never have cause to complain.</hi> The conclusion is, That his Majesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> prayeth God, who hath hitherto blessed this Kingdom, and put into his heart to come to you this day, to make the success thereof happy, both to King and People: And therefore he desires that no doubt or distrust may possess any man, but that ye will all proceed unanimously to the business.</p>

            <p>The Commons being returned from the Lords House, Mr. Secretary <hi>Cook</hi> perswaded them to comply with the King.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> His Majesty, said he, puts us in minde of the great important Affairs of the State, and of his sense thereof, that by effluxion of time increaseth in him, and he doubts not but that it doth increase in us: Ye see his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties moderation in the interpretation of all our actions; he saith that he hopes we have the same sense he hath, he is pleased to consider of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of expence of time that grew from the Debates in both Houses. We
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:35668:286"/>
see how indulgent he is, that however the Affairs of Christendom are great, yet he omits not this, nay he takes in good part our Proceedings and our Declarations that we will not Impeach the Prerogative: Also his Majesty presumes that we will confess that he hath used extraordinary Grace, in that he hath indured dispute so long, he acknowledgeth it Justice to stand as we have done.</p>
            <p>Further, out of a Princely care of the Publique, he is careful no more time be lost; and because he sees some extraordinary course to be taken to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> us, he observes that in the Form of Debate such length is required, as the nature of the business will not indure. It is to be presumed, that his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will be according to the Law: We cannot but remember what his Father said, <hi>He is no King but a Tyrant, that governs not by Law</hi>; But this Kingdom is to be governed by the Common Law, and his Majesty assures us so much; the Interpretation is left to the Judges, and to his great Council, and all is to be regulated by the Common Law; I mean not <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta</hi> onely, for that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was part of the Common Law, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the ancient Law of this Kingdom; all our difference is in the Application of this Law, and how this Law with difference is derived into every Court. I conceive there are two Rules, the one of Brass, that is rigid and will not bend, and that is the Law of the Kings Bench, this Law will not bend; and when it lights on Subjects fitting, if it do not bend, it is unjust: And there comes in the Law of the Chancery and of Equity; this is Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Law in private mens Causes, when it comes to <hi>Meum &amp; tuum.</hi> And thus the general Government of Cases, with relation to the common State <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the Kingdom, is from the Council Board, and there they are to vary from the Law of the Kingdom: Suppose it be in time of Dearth, Propriety of Goods may in that time be forced, and be brought to the Market: We saw the experience of it in Coals in <hi>London,</hi> and the Council Board caused them to be brought forth and sold. In a time of Pestilence men may be restrained: If a Schism be like to grow in a Church, the State will enquire after the favorers of it: if there be fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Invasion, and it be encouraged by hope of a Party amongst us, it is in the power of Government to restrain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> men to their houses.</p>
            <p>In the Composure of these things there is great difference: What diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences have been between the Courts of Chancery and Kings Bench? It is hard to put true difference between the Kings Prerogative and our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. His Majesty saw expence of time would be prejudicial; it pleased God to move his Majesty by a Divine hand to shew us a way to clear all our difficulties; let us attend to all the parts of it, there be Five Degrees, and there is more assurance then we could have by any Law whatsoever. His <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Majesty declares, That <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the other Statutes are in force: This is not the first time that the Liberty of the Subject was infringed, or was in Debate and confirmed; all times thought it safe, that when they came to a Negative of Power, it was hard to keep Government and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty together; but his Majesty stopped not there, but according to the sense of these Laws, That he will govern his Subjects in their just Liberties, he assures us our Liberties are just, they are not of Grace, but of Right; nay he assures us he will govern us according to the Laws of the Realm,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and that we shall finde as much security in his Majesties Promise, as in any Law we can make; and whatsoever Law we shall make, it must come to his Majesties allowance; and if his Majesty finde cause in his Government, he may not put life to it: We daily see all Laws are broken, and all Laws will be broke for the Publique good, and the King may pardon all Offenders;
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:35668:286"/>
his Majesty did see that the best way to settle all at unity, is to express his own heart: The Kings heart is the best guarder of his own promise, his promise is bound with his heart. What Prince can express more care and wisdom?</p>
            <p>Lastly he saith, That hereafter ye shall never have the like cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; May we not think the breach is made up? is not his Majesty ingaged in his Royal word?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> The conclusion is full of weight: and he prayes God, that as God hath blessed this Kingdom, and put it into his heart to come amongst us, so to make this day successful. <hi>The wrath of a King is like the roaring of a Lyon,</hi> and all Laws with his wrath are to no effect; but <hi>the Kings favour is like to the dew of the grass,</hi> there all will prosper; and God made the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to unite all hearts.</p>
            <p>His Majesty having thus discharged himself, he prayes us to proceed to the business that so much concerns him. As his Majesty hath now shewed himself the best of Kings, let us acknowledge his Majesties goodness, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> return to that Union which we all desire.</p>

                        <p>WE are now upon a great business,<note place="margin">Sir Ben. Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards Speech concerning that motion.</note> and the maner of handling it may be as great as the business it self. Liberty is a precious thing, for every man may set his own price upon it, and he that doth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> value it, deserves to be valued accordingly; for mine own part, I am clear without scruple, that what we have resolved, is according to the Law; and if any Judge in <hi>England</hi> were of a contrary opinion, I am sure we should have heard of him ere now; out of all question, the very scope and drift of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was to reduce the Regal to a Legal Power in matter of Imprisonment, or else it had not been worthy so much contending for.</p>
                        <p>It is true, That the King ought to have a trust reposed in him, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid but he should, and I hope it is impossible to take it from him; for it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> lies not in the wit of man, to devise such a Law as shall comprehend all particulars, all accidents, but that extraordinary Causes may happen, which when they come, if they be disposed of for the common good, there will be no Law against them; yet must the Law be general, for otherwise Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions and Exceptions will fret and eat out the Law to nothing. God himself hath constituted a general Law of Nature, to govern the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course of things, he hath made no Law for Miracles; yet there is this observation of them, that they are rather <hi>praeter naturam,</hi> then <hi>contra na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam,</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and always <hi>propter bones fines</hi>: So the Kings Prerogatives are rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Law, then against it; and when they are directly to their ends for the publique good, they are not onely concurring Laws, but even Laws in singularity and excellency.</p>
                        <p>But to come nearer, let us consider where we are now, what steps we have gone, and gained; The Kings learned Councel have acknowledged all the Laws to be still in force, the Judges have not allowed any Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against these Laws, the Lords also have confessed, that the Laws <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> are in full strength; they have further retained our resolutions intire, and without prejudice.</p>
                        <p>All this hitherto is for our advantage; but above all his Majesty hath this day (himself being publiquely present) declared by the mouth of the Lord Keeper, before both the Houses, That <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the other
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:35668:287"/>
six Statutes, are still in force; That he will maintain his Subjects in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of their Persons, and Proprieties of their Goods; That he will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them according to the Laws of the Kingdom; this is a solemn and binding satisfaction, expressing his gracious readiness to comply with his people in their reasonable and just desires. The King is a good Man, and it is no diminution to a King, to be called so; for whosoever is a good Man shall be greater then a King, that is not so. The King certainly is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tender of his present Honor, and of his Fame hereafter: He will think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it hard to have a worse mark set upon him, then upon any of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, by extraordinary restraints: His Majesty hath already intimated unto us by a Message, That he doth willingly give way to have the abuse of Power reformed; by which I do verily believe he doth very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, what a miserable power it is, which hath produced so much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Himself, and to the Kingdom; And it is one happiness, that he is so ready to redress it.</p>
                        <p>For mine own part, I shall be very glad to see that old decrepite Law <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                           <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which hath been so long kept and lien bed-rid as it were. I shall be glad to see it walk abroad again with new vigor, and lustre, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and followed with the other six Statutes: questionless it will be a great heartning to all the people. I doubt not, but upon a debating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Lords, we may happily fall upon a fair, fit accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning the Liberty of our Persons, and Propriety of our Goods. I hope we may have a Bill, to agree in the point, against imprisonment for Loans, or privy Seals: As for intrinsecal power and reason of State, they are matters in the Clouds, where I desire we may leave them, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not meddle with them at all, left by the way of admittance, we may lose somewhat of that which is our own already: Yet this by the way I will say of reason of State, That in the latitude by which 'tis used, it hath eaten out almost, not onely the Laws, but all the Religion of Christendom.</p>
                        <p>Now I will onely remember you of one Precept, and that of the wisest man, <hi>Be not over wise, be not over just:</hi> and he gives his reason, <hi>for why wilt thou be desolate?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If Justice and Wisdom may be stretcht to desolation, let us thereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> learn that Moderation is the Vertue of Vertues, and Wisdom of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Let it be our Master-piece so to carry the business, that we may keep Parliaments on foot: For as long as they be frequent, there will be no irregular Power, which though it cannot be broken at once, yet in short time it will be made and mouldred away; there can be no total or final loss of Liberties, as long as they last; What we cannot get at one time, we shall have at another.</p>

                           <pb n="559" facs="tcp:35668:287"/>Upon this there was a silence for a good space: Then Mr. Secretary <hi>Cook</hi> proceeded.
This silence invites me to a further Speech, and further to address my self: Now we see we must grow towards an issue; for my part, how confident I have been of the good issue of this Parliament, I have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in this place, and elsewhere, and I am still confident therein; I know his Majesty is resolved to do as much as ever King did for his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. All this Debate hath grown out of the sense of our Sufferings, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a desire of making up again those Breaches that have been made.</p>
                        <p>Since this Parliament begun, hath there been any dispence made of that which hath formerly been done? when means were denied his Majesty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a yong King, and newly come to his Crown, which he found inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a War, what could we expect in such <hi>Necessities?</hi> His Majesty cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this Parliament to make up the Breach: His Majesty assures us we shall not have the like cause to complain: He assures the Laws shall be establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; what can we desire more? all is, that we provide for Posterity, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that we do prevent the like suffering for the future: Were not the same means provided by them before us? can we do more? we are come to the Liberty of the Subjects, and the Prerogative of the King, I hope we shall not adde any thing to our selves, to depress him. I will not divine, I think we shall finde difficulty with the King, or with the Lords, I shall not deliver my opinion as Counsellor to his Majesty, which I will not justifie and say here, or at the Councel Board. Will we in this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity strive to bring our selves into a better Condition and greater Liberty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then our Fathers had, and the Crown into a worse then ever? I dare not advise his Majesty to admit of that: if this that we now desire be no Innovation, it is all contained in those Acts and Statutes, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else we would adde more, is a diminution to the Kings Power, and an addition to our own. We deal with a wise and prudent Prince, that hath a Sword in his hand for our good, and this good is supported by Power. Do not think, that by Cases of Law and Debate we can make that not to be Law, which in experience we every day finde necessary: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> make what Law you will, if I do discharge the place I bear, I must commit men, and must not discover the Cause to any Jaylor or Judge; if I by this Power commit one without just Cause, the burthen falls heavy on me, by his Majesties displeasure, and he will remove me from my place: Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a solid thing, and must be supported for our good.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Philips</hi> hereupon spake this:</p>
            <p>
               <q>That if the words of Kings strike impressions in the hearts of Subjects, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then do these words upon this occasion strike an impression into the hearts of us all: to speak in a plain language, we are now come to the end of our journey, and the well disposing of an Answer to this Message, will give happiness or misery to this Kingdom. Let us set the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> before the eyes of his Majesty, that we may justifie our selves that we have demeaned our selves dutifully to his Majesty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And so the day following they had further Debate upon that matter, the House being turned into a Grand Committee, and Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Chair.</p>
            <p>Some say, that the Subject has suffered more in the violation of ancient Liberties within these few years, then in Three hundred years before, and therefore care ought to be taken for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> said, That that <hi>Royal word</hi> had reference to some Message formerly sent; his Majesties word was, That they may secure themselves
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:35668:288"/>
any way, by Bill or otherwise, he promised to give way to it; and to the end that this might not touch his Majesties Honor, it was proposed that the Bill come not from the House, but from the King: We will and grant for us and our Successors, and that we and our Successors will do thus and thus: and it is the Kings Honor, he cannot speak but by Record.</p>
            <p>Others desired the House to consider when and where the late promise was made, was it not in the face of both Houses? Cruel Kings have been careful to perform their promises, yea, though they have been unlawful, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>Herod.</hi> Therefore if we rest upon his Majesties promise, we may assure our selves of the performance of it: Besides, we binde his Majesty by rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his word: we have Laws enough, it is the execution of them that is our life, and it is the King that gives life and execution.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sir Thomas Wentworth</note>Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> concluded the Debate, saying,
<q>That never House of Parliament trusted more in the goodness of their King, for their own private, then the present; but we are ambitious that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> goodness may remain to posterity, and we are accomptable to a publique trust: and therefore seeing there hath been a publique violation of the Laws by his Ministers, nothing will satisfie him but a publique mends; and our desire to vindicate the Subjects Rights by Bill, are no more then are laid down in former Laws, with some modest Provision for Instruction, Performance and Execution.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Which so well agreed with the Sense of the House, that they made it the subject of a Message to be delivered by the Speaker to his Majesty.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The King gives notice to both Houses that he intends shortly to end this Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>AMidst those deliberations another Message was delivered from his Majesty by Mr. Secretary <hi>Cook</hi>;
That howsoever we proceed in this business we have in hand, which his Majesty will not doubt but to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our constant professions, and so as he may have cause to give us thanks; yet his resolution is, that both his Royal care, and hearty and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection towards all his loving Subjects, shall appear to the whole Kingdom and all the World, that he will govern us according to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Laws and Customs of this Realm; that he will maintain us in the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Persons, and Proprieties of our Goods, so as we may enjoy as much happiness as our forefathers in their best times; and that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie what hath been or may be found amiss amongst us, so that hereafter there may be no just cause to complain. Wherein as his Majesty will rank himself amongst the best of our Kings, and shew he hath no intention to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade or impeach our lawful Liberties, or Right: so he will have us to match our selves with the best Subjects, not by incroaching upon that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> or Prerogative which God hath put into his hands for our good, but by containing our selves within the Bounds and Laws of our forefathers, without restraining them, or inlarging them by new Explanations, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, Expositions, or Additions in any sort, which he telleth us he will not give way unto.</p>
               <p>That the weight of the Affairs of the Kingdom, and Christendom, do press him more and more, and that the time is now grown to that point of maturity, that it cannot endure long debate, or delay; so as this Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of Parliament must continue no longer then <hi>Tuesday</hi> come sevennight, at the furthest: In which time his Majesty for his part will be ready to perform what he promised; and if the House be not as ready to do that is fit for themselves, it shall be their own faults.</p>
               <p>And upon assurance of our good dispatch and correspondence his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:35668:288"/>
declareth, That his Royal intention is to have another Session of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Michaelmass</hi> next, for the perfecting of such things as cannot now be done.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Message was debated the next day, being Saturday <hi>May</hi> 30. whereupon Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot</hi> spake to this effect.</p>
            <p>The King,<note place="margin">Sir John Elliot.</note> saith he, will rank himself with the best of Kings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would have us to rank our selves with the best Subjects; we will not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> incroach upon that Soveraignty that God hath put into his hands: This makes me fear his Majesty is misinformed in what we go about, let us make some inlargement, and put it before him, that we will not make any thing new; as for the time of this Session, it is but short, and look how many Messages we have, so many interruptions, and mis-reports, and mis-represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to his Majesty produce those Messages.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Miles Fleetwood</hi> continues the Debate, and said, That this business is of great importance, we are to accommodate this: The breach of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> will be the greatest misery that ever befell us; the eyes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom are upon this Parliament, the state of all our Protestant friends are ready to be swallowed up by the Emperors Forces, and our own Kingdom is in a miserable straight, for the defence of our Religion that is invaded by the Romish Catholicks, by the colour of a Commission, which is intolerable; the defence of our Realm by Shipping is decayed, the Kings Revenue is sold and gone, where shall the relief be obtained but in Parliament? Now we are in the way, let us proceed by way of Bill, in pursuance of the Kings Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to establish the Fundamental Laws in Propriety of our Goods, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of our Persons: It was declared to us, that courses by Loan and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment were not lawful; let us touch them in our Bill, and that all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents and Judgements seeming to the contrary, be void, and that all Commitments against the Law be remedied, and that we be protected against the fear of Commitments.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the Commons agree to an Answer to all the preceding Messages, and present it to the King by the mouth of their Speaker.</p>

there was an expression of your desire to know whether this House would rest upon your Royal Word and Promise, assuring them, that if they would, it should be royally and really performed: As they again present their humble thanks for the seconding and strengthning of your former Royal expressions, so in all humbleness they assure your Majesty, that their greatest confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <p>They say also, That of late there hath been publique violation of the Laws, and the Subjects Liberties, by some of your Majesties Ministers, and thence conceive that no less then a publique remedy will raise the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected hearts of your loving Subjects to a chearful supply of your Majesty, or make them receive content in the proceedings of this House.</p>

                        <p>Thus if you please you may be secured from your needless fears, and this Parliament may have a happy wished for end: whereas by the contrary, if ye seek to tie your King by new, and indeed impossible bonds, you must be accomptable to God and the Countrey for the ill success of this meeting. His Majesty hath given his Royal Word, that ye shall have no cause to complain hereafter: less then which hath been enough to reconcile Great Princes, and therefore ought much more to prevail between a King and his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Subjects.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I am commanded to tell you that his Majesties pleasure is, That without further Replies or Messages, or other unnecessary delays, ye do what ye mean to do speedily, remembring the last Message that Secretary <hi>Cook</hi> brought you in point of time: His Majesty always intending to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Promise to his power.</p>

<q>That he had rather follow others, then begin to enter into this business: loss of time hath been the greatest complaint, the matter fallen now into consideration, is what way to take, whether to relye on his Majesties Word, or on a Bill: If we will consider the advantage we have in taking his Majesties Word, it will be of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest extent, and we shall choose that that hath most Assurance: An Act of Parliament is by the consent of the King and Parliament; but this Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by Word, is that he will govern us by the Laws; the King promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that, and also that they shall be so executed, that we shall enjoy as much freedom as ever: this contains many Laws, and a grant of all good Laws; nay, it contains a confirmation of those very Laws, Assurance, which binds the King further then the Law can; First, it binds his affection, which is the greatest bond between King and Subject, and that binds his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also, nay, his Honor, and that not at home but abroad; the Royal Word of a King, is the Ground of all Treaty; nay, it binds his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this Confirmation between both Houses, is in nature of a Vow; for my part I think it is the greatest advantage to relie on his Majesties Word. He further added, this Debate was fitter to be done before the House, and not before the Committee, and that it was a new Course to go to a Committee of the whole House.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whereunto it was replied by Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir John El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liot.</note> That the proceeding in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Committee, is more Honorable and advantagious to the King, and the House, for that way leads most to Truth; and it is a more open way, and where every man may adde his reason, and make answer upon the hearing of other mens Reasons and Arguments.</p>
            <p>This being the general Sense, the House was turned into a Committee, to take into consideration what was delivered to the King by the Speaker, and what was delivered to them by the Lord Keeper, and all other Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:35668:290"/>
and the Committee was not to be bounded with any former order: the Key was brought up, and none were to go out without leave first asked.</p>
            <p>In the Debate of this business at the Committee, some were for letting the Bill rest:<note place="margin">Sir. E. Cook.</note> but Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> reasons prevailed to the contrary,
<q>Was it ever known (said he) that general words were a sufficient satisfaction to particular grievances? was ever a verbal Declaration of the King <hi>verbum <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Regni?</hi> when grievances be, the Parliament is to redress them: Did ever Parliament relie on Messages? they put up Petitions of their Grievances, and the King ever answered them: the Kings Answer is very gracious, but what is the Law of the Realm, that is the question. I put no diffidence in his Majesty, the King must speak by a Record, and in Particulars, and not in General: Did you ever know the Kings Message come into a Bill of Subsidies? all succeeding Kings will say, Ye must trust me as well as you did my Predecessors, and trust my Messages; but Messages of love never came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> into a Parliament. Let us put up a Petition of Right: Not that I distrust the King, but that we cannot take his trust, but in a Parliamentary way.</q>

               <hi>Maii,</hi> the Petition of Right was finished, and the Clause of Martial Law was added unto it, and it was delivered to the Lords at a Conference for their Concurrence; the which Conference was managed by Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> and the same day, as to the matter of supply, ordered that the two first Subsidies should be paid 10<hi rend="sup">o</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> one more 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>

            <q>
               <p>My Lords, it is evident what necessity there is, both in respect of your selves and your Posterities, to have good success of this business: We have acquainted your Lordships with the Reasons and Arguments, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have had some conference, we have received from your Lordships Propositions; and it behoves me to give your Lordships some reasons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> why you have not heard from us before now; for in the mean time as we were consulting of this weighty Business, we have received divers Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages from our great Soveraign the King, and they consisted of five Parts;
<list>
                     <item>1. That his Majesty would maintain all his Subjects in their just free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, both of their Persons and Estates;</item>
                     <item>2. That he will govern according to his Laws and Statutes;</item>
                     <item>3. That we should find much confidence in the Royal Word, I pray <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> observe that;</item>
                     <item>4. That we shall enjoy all our Rights and Liberties, with as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as ever any Subjects have done in former times;</item>
                     <item>5. That whether we shall think it fit, either by Bill or otherwise, to go on in this great Business, his Majesty would be pleased to give way to it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>These gracious Messages did so work upon our affections, that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> have taken them into deep consideration. My Lords, when we had these Messages (I deal plainly, for so I am commanded by the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> we did consider what way we might go for our more secure way, nay yours; we did think it the safest way to go in a Parliamentary course, for we have a Maxim in the House of Commons, and written on the Walls of our House, That old ways are the safest and surest ways: And at last we did fall upon that, which we did think (if that your Lordships
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:35668:290"/>
did consent with us) it is the most ancient way of all, and that is, my Lords, <hi>via fausta,</hi> both to Majesty, to your Lordships, and to our selves: for, my Lords, this is the greatest Bond that any Subject can have in open Parliament, <hi>Verbum Regis,</hi> this is an high point of Honor, but this shall be done by the Lords and Commons, and assented to by the King in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, this is the greatest Obligation of all, and this is for the Kings Honor, and our Safety: Therefore my Lords we have drawn a Form of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Petition, desiring your Lordships to concur with us therein; for we do come with an unanimous consent of all the House of Commons, and there is great reason your Lordships should do so, for your Lordships be involved in the same danger. And so I have done with the first part: and I shall now desire your Lordships leave that I may read that which I have so agreed on.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Here the Petition of Right was read; but we forbear to insert it as yet, because there were propositions for alteration; and it is not perfect, till the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Royal assent be given to it.</p>
            <p>From the Eighth to the Twelfth of <hi>May,</hi> all Publique businesses were laid aside. On Monday the Twelfth the Lords had a Conference with the Commons, where the Lord Keeper made this Speech.</p>

                        <p>Concerning the Commitment by the King and the Councel, without expressing the cause, it was resolved by the Lords to debate it this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and assoon as they should have debated it, they purposed. to have your concurrence with them before they resolved it; but at instant when they thought to have debated it, they received a Letter from his Majesty, which they conceive will give a satisfaction to both Houses in the main point.

                     </note>WE being desirous of nothing more then the advancement of the Peace and Prosperity of our People, have given leave to free Debate upon the highest Points of our Prerogative Royal, which in the time of our Predecessors, Kings and Queens of this Realm, were ever restrained as matters that they would not have discussed; and in other things we have been willing so far to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to the desires of our good Subjects, as might fully satisfie all moderate mindes, and free them from all just fears and jealousies, which those Messages <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which we have heretofore sent into the Commons House, will well demonstrate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; yet we finde it still insisted upon, that in no case whatsoever, should it never so nearly concern matters of State or Government, we or our Privy Council have power to commit any man without the cause shewed; whereas it often happens, that should the cause be shewed, the service it self would thereby be destroyed and defeated, and the cause alledged must be such as may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by our Iudges of our Courts of <hi>Westminster,</hi> in a Legal and ordinary way of Iustice, whereas the Causes may be such as those Iudges have not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Iudicature, nor Rules of Law to direct and guide their Iudgement in cases of that transcendent nature; which hapning so often, the very incroaching on that constant Rule of Government for so many ages within this Kingdom pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, would soon dissolve the very Foundation and Frame of our Monarchy. Wherefore as to our Commons we made fair Propositions, which might equally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the just Liberty of the Subject: so, my Lords, we have thought good to let you know, that without the overthrow of Soveraignty we cannot suffer this Power to be impeached; notwithstanding, to clear our conscience and just intentions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this we publish, That it is not in our heart, nor will we ever extend our Royal Power lent unto us from God, beyond the just rule of Moderation, in any thing which shall be contrary to our Laws and Customs, wherein the safety of our People shall be our onely aim. And we do hereby Declare our Royal pleasure and resolution to be, which, God willing, we shall ever constantly continue and maintain, That neither we nor our Privy Council shall or will at any time hereafter commit or command to Prison, or otherwise restrain the persons of any for not lending Money to us, nor for any cause which in our conscience doth not concern the publique <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good and safety of us and our people, we will not be drawn to pretend any cause wherein our judgement and conscience is not satisfied with; base thoughts, we hope no man can imagine will fall into our Royal breast; and that in all cases of this nature, which shall hereafter happen, we shall upon the humble Petition of the party, or address of our Iudges unto us, readily and really express the true cause of their Commitment or Restraint, so soon as with conveniency and safety the same is fit to be disclosed and expressed; and that in all Causes Criminal, of ordinary Iurisdiction, our Iudges shall proceed to the Deliverance or Bailment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of the Prisoner, according to the known and ordinary Rules of the Laws of this Land, and according to the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and those other Six Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes insisted upon, which we do take knowledge stand in full force, and which we intend not to abrogate and weaken, against the true intention thereof.

question, the season of the year being so far advanced, and our great Occasions of State not lending many more days for longer continuance of this Session of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>

Look into all the Petitions of former times, they never petitioned, wherein there was a saving of the Kings Soveraignty: I know that Prerogative is part of the Law, but Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power is no Parliamentary word: In my opinion it weakens <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta,</hi> and all our Statutes; for they are absolute without any saving of Soveraign Power: and shall we now adde it, we shall weaken the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Foundation of Law, and then the building must needs fall; take we heed what we yield unto, <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is such a fellow, that he will have no Soveraign: I wonder this Soveraign was not in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or in the Confirmations of it: If we grant this, by implication we give a Soveraign Power above all these Laws: Power in Law, is taken for a Power with force: The Sheriff shall take the Power of the County, what it means here, God onely knows: It is repugnant to our Petition, that is a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right, grounded on Acts of Parliament: our Predecessors could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> never indure a <hi>Salvo jure suo,</hi> no more then the Kings of old could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for the Church, <hi>Salvo honore Dei &amp; Ecclesiae</hi>: We must not admit of it, and to qualifie it is impossible: Let us hold our Priviledges accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law; that Power that is above this, it is not fit for the King and people to have it disputed further, I had rather for my part have the Prerogative acted, and I my self to lie under it, then to have it disputed.</q>

LEt us not go too hastily to the question,<note place="margin">Mr. Selden.</note> said Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>: If there be any Objections, let any propound them, and let others answer them as they think good: If it hath no reference to our Petition, what doth it here? I am sure all others will say it hath reference, and so must we: how far it doth exceed all examples of former times, no man can shew me the like: I have made that search that fully satisfies me, and I finde not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther besides 28 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> We have a great many Petitions, and Bills of Parliament in all ages, in all which we are sure no such thing is added: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> That Clause of the 28 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. it was not in the Petition, but in the Kings Answer.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Magna Charta</hi> there were no such Clauses, the Articles themselves are to be seen in a Library at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> in a Book of that time, upon which the Law was made. There was none in the Articles in King <hi>Iohns</hi> time, for these I have seen, there is no Saving. In the Statutes of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatio Chartarum,</hi> is a Saving <hi>les auncients Aids,</hi> that is, for <hi>file maryer, &amp; pur faire fitz Chivalier,</hi> and for ransom: and in the Articles of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the Original Charter, which I can shew, there those three Aids were named therein, and they were all known: In the 25. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. there is a Petition against Loans, there is no Saving, and so in others: As for that Addition in the 28. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. do but observe the Petitions after <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta,</hi> as 5 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. they put up a Petition, whereas in <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> it is contained, That none be imprisoned, but by due process of Law; those words are not in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and yet there is no Saving; and so in the 28. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. &amp; 36. &amp; 37. &amp; 42. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. all which pass by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Petition, and yet there is no Saving in them: And there are in them other words then are in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and yet no Saving.</p>
               <p>For that that Mr. Speaker said, The King was our heart, and ever shall be, but we then speak of the Kings Prerogative by it self, and we are bound to say so: But speaking of our Rights, shall we say we are not to be imprisoned, Saving by the Kings Soveraign Power? Say my Lands (without any Title) be seised in the Kings hand, and I bring a Petition of Right, and I go to the King and say, I do by no means seek your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Right and Title; and after that I bring a Petition or <hi>Monstrance de droit,</hi> setting forth my own Right and Title, and withal set down a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that I leave intire his Majesties Right, it would be improper. It was objected, That in the 28. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. in the end of <hi>Articuli super Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> which was a confirmation of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta de foresta,</hi> in the end there is a Clause, <hi>Savant le droit &amp; Segniory,</hi> the words are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in that Roll that is now extant, but the original Roll is not extant.</p>
               <p>In the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

In 28 E. 1. the Commons by Petition or Bill did obtain the Liberties and Articles at the end of the Parliament, they were extracted out of the Roll, and Proclaimed abroad; the addition was added in the Proclamation: in the Bill there was no <hi>savant,</hi> but afterwards it was put in: And to prove this, it is true, there is no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:35668:293"/>
Roll of that year, yet we have Histories of that time: In the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary at <hi>Oxford</hi> there is a Journal of a Parliament of that very year, which mentions so much, also in the publique Library at <hi>Cambridge</hi> there is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript that belonged to an Abby, it was of the same year 28 <hi>E.</hi> 1. and it mentions the Parliament and the Petitions, and <hi>Articulos quos petierunt sic confirmaverit Rex ut in fine adderet, Salvo jure Coronae regis,</hi> and they came by Proclamation in <hi>London</hi>; when the people heard this clause added in the end, they fell into execration for that addition; and the great Earls <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that went away satisfied from the Parliament, hearing of this, went to the King, and after it was cleared at the next Parliament. Now there is no Parliament Roll of this; of that time onely in one Roll in the end of <hi>E.</hi> 3. there is a Roll that recites it.</p>
               <p>The Lords afterwards at a Conference tendred Reasons to fortifie their addition: which were briefly reported; That the Lord Keeper said,</p>
               <p>THat the Lords were all agreed to defend and maintain the just Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the Subject, and of the Crown, and that the word (Leave) was debated amongst them; and thereby they meant to give no new, but what was before: for the words, <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> as he is a King, he is a Soveraign, and must have Power; and he said the words were easier then the <hi>Prerogative</hi>: As for the word (that) which is a relative, and referred to <hi>that Power</hi> that is for the safety of the People; and this, said he, can never grieve any man, being thus published, it is not Soveraign Power in general; but now in confutation of our Reasons, he saith, <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Charta</hi> was not with a Saving; but said he, You pursue not the words in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and therefore it needs an addition.</p>
               <p>As for the 28 of <hi>E.</hi> 3. he said there was a Saving, and an ill expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition cannot be made of this, and both Houses have agreed it in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance already; the Commons did it in a Speech delivered by our Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that we said we have not a thought to incroach on the Kings Soveraignty; and why may ye not add it in your Petition?</p>
            </q>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            <p>Upon this Report Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> readily spake his opinion in maner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <q>
               <p>IN our Petition of Right to the Kings Majesty, we mentioned the Laws and Statutes, by which it appeared, That no Tax, Loan, or the like, ought to be Levied by the King, but by common assent in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: That no Freeman ought to be imprisoned but by the Law of the Land: That no Freeman ought to be compelled to suffer soldiers in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his house. In the Petition we have expressed the breach of these Laws, and desire we may not suffer the like, all which we pray as our Rights and Liberties.</p>
               <p>The Lords have proposed an addition to this Petition, in these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We humbly present this Petition to your Majesty, not onely with a care of our own Liberties, but with a due regard to leave intire that</hi> Soveraign Power <hi>wherewith your Majesty is intrusted, for the Protection, Safety and Happiness of your People.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               </p>
               <p>And whether we shall consent unto this addition, is the subject of this days discourse: and because my Lord Keeper at the conference declared their Lordships had taken the words of the Petition apart, I shall do so too. The word (Leave) in a Petition, is of the same nature as (Saving) in a Grant or Act of Parliament, when a man grants but part of a thing, he
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:35668:293"/>
saves the rest; when he petitions to be restored but to part, he leaveth the rest: Then in the end of our Petition the word (Leave) will imply, that something is to be left of that, or at least with a reference to what we desire.</p>
               <p>The word (Intire) is very considerable, a Conqueror is bound by no Law, but hath power <hi>dare Leges,</hi> his Will is a Law; and although <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Conqueror, at first, to make his way to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the more easie, and the possession of it more sure, claimed it by Title; but afterward when there were no powerful pretenders to the Crown, the title of Conquest (to introduce that absolute Power of a Conqueror) was claimed, and that Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other Statutes mentioned in our Petition, do principally limit that Power. I hope it is as lawful for me to cite a Jesuit, as it is for Doctor <hi>Manwaring</hi> to falsifie him; <hi>Suares,</hi> in his first Book <hi>de Legibus,</hi> Cap. 17. delivered his opinion in these words: <hi>Amplitudo &amp; restrictio potestatis Regum circa ea quae per se mala vel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justa <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> non sunt, pendet ex arbitrio hominum &amp; ex ambigua conventione vel pacto inter reges &amp; regnum.</hi> And he further expresseth his opinion, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was so absolute a Monarch, that he might impose Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute without consent of his people, until about Two hundred years since, when it was concluded between him and his people, that without consent of his people by Proxies he should not impose any Tribute. And <hi>Suares</hi> opinion is, That by that agreement, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> are bound to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose no Tribute without consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
And this Agreement that Author calls a restraining of that Soveraign Power, the Statutes then mentioned in our Petition restraining that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power of Conqueror; if we recite those Statutes, and say we leave the Soveraign Power intire, we do take away that restraint which is the vertue and strength of those Statutes, and set at liberty the claim of the Soveraign Power of a Conqueror, which is to be limited and restrained by no Laws: This may be the danger of the word (Intire.)</p>
               <p>The next word delivered by the Lords as observeable, is the particle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>(That) because it was said, That all Soveraign Power is not mentioned to be left, but onely (that) with which the King is trusted for our Protection, Safety and Happiness: But I conceive this to be an exception of all Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power; for all Soveraign Power in a King, is for the Protection, Safety and Happiness of his People: If all Soveraign Power be excepted, you may easily judge the consequence, all Loans and Taxes being imposed by colour of that Soveraign Power.</p>
               <p>The next word is (Trusted) which is very ambiguous, whether it be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> meant trusted by God onely as a Conqueror, or by the people also as King, which are to govern also according to Laws <hi>ex pacto.</hi> In this point I will not presume to adventure further, onely I like it not, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the doubtful Exposition it admits. I have likewise considered the Proposition it self, and therein I have fallen upon the Dilemma, that this addition shall be construed either to refer unto the Petition, or not: if it do refer unto the Petition, it is meerly useless and unnecessary, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the judgement of this grave and great Assembly to add to a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this weight. If it hath reference unto it, then it destroys not onely the virtue and strength of our Petition of Right, but our Rights themselves; for the addition being referred to each part of the Petition, will necessarily receive this construction: That none ought to be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to make any Gift, Loan, or such like charge, without common consent or Act of Parliament, unless it be by the Soveraign Power, with which
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:35668:294"/>
the King is trusted for the Protection, Safety and Happiness of his People.</p>
               <p>That none ought to be compelled to sojourn or billet Soldiers, unless by the same Soveraign Power, and so of the rest of the Rights contained in the Petition: And then the most favorable construction will be, that the King hath an ordinary Prerogative, and by that he cannot impose Taxes or Imprison; that is, he cannot impose Taxes at his will, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them as he pleaseth; but that he hath an extraordinary and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Soveraign Power for the protection and happiness of his people, and for such purpose he may impose Taxes, or billet Soldiers, as he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and we may assure our selves, that hereafter all Loans, Taxes and Billeting of Soldiers, will be said to be for the Protection, Safety and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the People: Certainly hereafter it will be conceived, that an House of Parliament would not have made an unnecessary addition to this Petition of Right, and therefore it will be resolved, that the Addition hath relation to the Petition, which will have such operation as I have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> formerly declared, and I the rather fear it, because the late Loan and Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leting have been declared to have been by Soveraign Power for the good of our selves; and if it be doubtful whether this Proposition hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Petition or not, I know not who shall judge whether Loans or Imprisonments hereafter be by that Soveraign Power or not?</p>
               <p>A Parliament, which is made a Body of several Writs, and may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by one Commission, cannot be certain to decide this question. We cannot resolve that, that the Judges shall determine the words of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Kings Letter read in this House, expressing the cause of Commitment, may be such, that the Judges have not capacity of Judicature, no Rules of Law to direct and guide their judgements in Cases of that transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nature, the Judges then and the Judgements are easily conjectured; it hath been confessed by the Kings Councel, that the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> bindes the King, it bindes his Soveraign Power; and here is an Addition of Saving the Kings Soveraign Power: I shall endeavor to give some Answer to the Reasons given by the Lords.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               </p>
               <p>The first is, That it is the intention of both Houses, to maintain the Just Liberty of the Subject, and not to diminish the just Power of the King; and therefore the expression of that intention in this Petition, cannot prejudice us. To which I answer,</p>
               <p>First, That our intention was, and is, as we then professed, and no man can assign any particular in which we have done to the contrary; neither have we any way transgressed in that kinde in this Petition: and if we make this addition to the Petition, it would give some intimation that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> have given cause or colour of offence therein, which we deny, and which if any man conceive so, let him assign the particular, that we may give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereunto.</p>
               <p>By our Petition we onely desire our particular Rights and Liberties to be confirmed to us, and therefore it is not proper for us in it to mention Soveraign Power in general, being altogether impertinent to the matter in the Petition.</p>
               <p>There is a great difference between the words of the Addition, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the words proposed therein, for reason, viz. between just Power which may be conceived to be limited by Laws, and Soveraign Power, which is supposed to be transcendent and boundless.</p>
               <p>The second Reason delivered by their Lordships was, That the King is Soveraign; That as he is Soveraign, he hath power, and that <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="573" facs="tcp:35668:294"/>
Soveraign Power is to be left: for my part, I would leave it, so as not to mention it, but if it should be expressed to be left in this Petition, as it is proposed, it must admit something to be left in the King of what we pray, or at least admit some Sovergain Power in his Majesty, in these Priviledges which we claim to be our Right, which would frustrate our Petition and destroy our Right, as I have formerly shewed.</p>
               <p>The third Reason given from this Addition was, That in the Statute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of <hi>Articuli super Chartas,</hi> there is a Saving of the <hi>Seigniory</hi> of the Crown.</p>
               <p>To which I give these Answers, That <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was confirmed above thirty times, and a general Saving was in none of these Acts of Confirmation, but in this onely; and I see no cause we should follow one ill, and not thirty good Precedents, and the rather because that Saving produced ill effects that are well known.</p>
               <p>That Saving was by Act of Parliament; the conclusion of which Act is, that in all those Cases the King did well, and all those that were at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the making of that Ordinance did intend, that the right and <hi>Seigniory</hi> of the Crown should be saved: By which it appears that the saving was not in the Petition of the Commons, but added by the King; for in the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Kings will is not expressed.</p>
               <p>In that Act the King did grant and depart with to his People, divers Rights belonging to his Prerogative, as in the first Chapter he granted, That the People might choose three men which might have Power to hear and determine Complaints, made against those that offended in any point <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> though they were the Kings Officers, and to Fine and Ransome them: and in the 8.12. and 19. Chapter of that Statute, the King departed with other Prerogatives; and therefore there might be some reason of the adding of, that Soveraign, by the Kings Councel: But in this Petition we desire nothing of the Kings Prerogative, but pray the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of our proper and undoubted Rights and Priviledges; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no cause to adde any words which may imply a Saving of that which concerns not the matter in the Petition.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
The fourth Reason given by their Lordships was, That by the mouth of our Speaker we have this Parliament declared, That it was far from our intention to incroach upon his Majesties Prerogative, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not prejudice us, to mention the same resolution in an Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this Petition.</p>
               <p>To which I Answer, That that Declaration was a general Answer to a Message from his Majesty to us; by which his Majesty expressed, That he would not have his Prerogative straitned by any new Explanation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the rest of the Statutes: and therefore that expression of our Speakers was then proper, to make it have reference to this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there being nothing therein contained but particular Rights of the Subject, and nothing at all concerning his Majesties Prerogative.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Answer was to give his Majesty satisfaction of all our proceedings in general, and no man can assign any particular, in which we have broken it; and this Petition justifies it self, that in it we have not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended against the Protestation: and I know no reason but that this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> should be added to all our Laws we shall agree on this Parliament, as well as to this Petition.</p>
               <p>The last Reason given was, That we have varied in our Petition from the words of <hi>Magna Charta</hi>; and therefore it was well necessary, that a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving should be added to the Petition.</p>
               <p>I Answer, That in the Statute 5 <hi>E.</hi> 3.25 <hi>E.</hi> 3.28 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and other
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:35668:295"/>
Statutes, with which <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is confirmed: the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Explanation, differ from the words of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it self, the words of some of the Statutes of Explanation being, that no man ought to be apprehended, unless by Indictment, or due process of Law; and the other Statutes differing from the words of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> in many other particulars, and yet there is no Saving in those Statutes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> much less should there be any in a Petition of Right. There are the Answers I have conceived to the Reasons of their Lordships, and the Exposition I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> must be made of the proposed words, being added to our Petition. And therefore I conclude that in my opinion we may not consent to this Addition, which I submit to better Judgements.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Commons afterwards appointed Mr. <hi>Glanvile,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Martin,</hi> to manage another Conference to be had with the Lords, concerning the said matter, and to clear the Sense of the Commons in that point: the one argued the Legal, the other the Rational part, and though the matter deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by the length of it may seem tedious to the Reader, and some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters spoken of before repeated again; yet if the Reader observe the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Stile, as well as the subject Matter, perhaps it will be no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unto him.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Mr. Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viles Speech at a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of both Houses concerning Soveraign Power.</note>MY Lords, I have in charge from the Commons House of Parliament, (whereof I am a Member) to express this day before your Lordships some part of their clear sense, touching one point that hath occurred in the great Debate, which hath so long depended in both Houses.</p>
                        <p>I shall not need many words to induce or state the question, which I am <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to handle in this free Conference. The subject matter of our meeting is well known to your Lordships, I will therefore onely look so far back upon it, and so far recollect summarily the proceedings it hath had, as may be requisite to present clearly to your Lordships considerations, the nature and consequence of that particular wherein I must insist.</p>
                        <p>Your Lords may be pleased to remember, how that the Commons in this Parliament have framed a Petition to be presented to his Majesty, a Petition of Right rightly composed, relating nothing but truth, desiring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> nothing but Justice, a Petition justly occasioned, a Petition necessary and fit for these times, a Petition founded upon solid and substantial grounds, the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, sure Rocks to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a Petition bounded within due limits, and directed upon right ends, to vindicate some lawful and just Liberties of the free Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from the prejudice of violations past, and to secure them from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture innovations.</p>
                        <p>And because my following discourse must reflect chiefly, if not wholly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> upon the matter of this Petition: I shall here crave leave shortly to open to your Lordships the distinct parts whereof it doth consist, and those are four.</p>
                        <p>The first concerns Levies of Moneys, by way of Loans or otherwise, for his Majesties supply, Declaring that no man ought, and praying that
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:35668:295"/>
no man hereafter be compelled to make or yield any Gift, Loan, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, Tax, or such like Charge, without common consent by Act of Parliament.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The second is concerning that Liberty of Person, which rightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongs to the Free Subjects of this Realm, expressing it to be against the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> of the Laws and Statutes of the Land, that any Freeman should be imprisoned without cause shewed; and then reciting how this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Liberty amongst others hath lately been infringed, it concludeth with a just and necessary desire for the better clearing and allowance of this priviledge for the future.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third declareth the unlawfulness of billeting or placing Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Mariners to sojourn in Free Subjects houses against their wills, and prayeth remedy against that grievance.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The fourth and last aimeth at redress touching Commissions, to proceed to the Tryal and Condemnation of Offenders, and causing them to be executed and put to death by the Law Marshal, in times and places, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when and where, if by the Laws and Statutes of the Land they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served death, by the same Laws and Statutes also they might, and by none other ought to be adjudged and executed.</p>
                        <p>This Petition the careful House of Commons, not willing to omit any thing pertaining to their duties, or that might advance their moderate and just ends, did heretofore offer up unto your Lordships consideration, accompanied with an humble desire, That in your Nobleness and Justice you would be pleased to joyn with them in presenting it to his Majesty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that so coming from the whole Body of the Realm, the Peers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to him that is the Head of both, our Gracious Soveraign, who must crown the Work, or else all our labour is in vain; it might by your Lordships concurrence and assistance finde the more easie passage, and obtain the better answer.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordships, as your maner is in cases of so great importance, were pleased to debate and weigh it well, and thereupon you propounded to us some few amendments (as you termed them) by way of alteration, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that they were onely in matters of form, and not of substance; and that they were intended to none other end but to sweeten the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make it the more passable with his Majesty.</p>
                        <p>In this the House of Commons cannot but observe that fair and good respect which your Lordships have used in your proceedings with them, by your concluding or Voting nothing in your House, until you had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted it unto them; whereby our meetings about this business have been justly stiled Free Conferences, either party repairing hither disingaged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to hear and weigh the others Reasons, and both Houses coming with a full intention upon due consideration of all that can be said on either side, to joyn at last in resolving and acting that which shall be found most just and necessary for the honor and safety of his Majesty and the whole Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>And touching those propounded alterations, which were not many, your Lordships cannot but remember that the House of Commons have yielded to an accommodation, or change of their Petition in two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whereby they hope your Lordships have observed as well as ye may, they have not been affected unto words or phrases; nor over-much abounding in their own sense, but rather willing to comply with your Lordships in all indifferent things.</p>
                        <p>For the rest of your proposed amendments, if we do not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceive
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:35668:296"/>
your Lordships, as we are confident we do not, your Lordships of your selves have been pleased to relinquish them with a new overture, for one onely Clause to be added in the end or foot of the Petition, whereby the work of this day is reduced to one simple head, whether that Clause shall be received or not?</p>
                        <p>This yielding of the Commons in part unto your Lordships, of other points by you somewhat insisted upon, giveth us great assurance that our ends are one, and putteth us in hope, that in conclusion we shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> concur, and proceed unanimously to seek the same ends by the same means.</p>
                        <p>The clause propounded by your Lordships to be added to the Petition is this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>WE humbly present this Petition to your Majesty, not onely with a care for preservation of our Liberties, but with a due regard to leave intire that Soveraign Power wherewith your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is trusted for the Protection, Safety and Happiness of your People.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A clause specious in shew, and smooth in words, but in effect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence most dangerous, as I hope to make most evident; however coming from your Lordships, the House of Commons took it into their considerations, as became them, and apprehending upon the first Debate, that it threatned ruine to the whole Petition, they did heretofore deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver some Reasons to your Lordships, for which they then desired to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> spared from admitting it.</p>
                        <p>To these Reasons your Lordships offered some Answers at the last meeting; which having been faithfully reported to our House, and there debated, as was requisite for a business of such weight and importance, I must say truly to your Lordships, yet with due reverence to your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Commons are not satisfied with your Arguments; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have commanded me to recollect your Lordships Reasons for this Clause, and in a fair Reply to let you see the causes why they differ from you in opinion.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>But before I come to handle the particulars wherein we dissent from your Lordships, I will in the first place take notice yet a little further of that general wherein we all concur; which is, That we desire not (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do your Lordships) to augment or dilate the Liberties and Priviledges of the Subjects beyond the just and due Bounds; nor to incroach upon the Limits of his Majesties Prerogative Royal; and as in this your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships at the last meeting expressed clearly your own senses, so were your Lordships not mistaken in collecting the concurrent sense and meaning of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the House of Commons; they often have protested they do, and ever must protest, that these have been and shall be the Bounds of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, to demand and seek nothing but that which may be fit for dutiful and loyal Subjects to ask, and for a gracious and just King to grant; for as they claim by Laws some Liberties for themselves, so do they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Prerogative, a high and just Prerogative belonging to the King, which they intend not to diminish. And now my Lords, being assured, not by strained inferences, or obscure collections, but by the express and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> clear Declarations of both Houses, that our ends are the same; it were a miserable unhappiness if we should fail in finding out the means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish our desires.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="577" facs="tcp:35668:296" rendition="simple:additions"/>
My Lords, the Heads of those particular Reasons which you insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the last day where onely these:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. First you told us that the word (Leave) was of such nature, that it could give no new thing to his Majesty.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That no just exception could be taken to the words (Soveraign Power) for that as his Majesty is a King, so he is a Soveraign; and as he is a Soveraign, so he hath Power.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 3. That the Soveraign Power mentioned in this Clause, is not absolute or indefinite, but limited and regulated by the particle (That) and the word (Subsequent) which restrains it to be applied onely for Protection, Safety, and Happiness of the People, whereby ye inferred, there could be no danger in the allowance of such power.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That this Clause contained no more in substance, but the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of our meanings in this Petition, which we had formerly signified unto his Majesty by the mouth of Mr. Speaker, that we no way intended to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> incroach upon his Majesties Soveraign Power or Prerogative.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That in our Petition we have used other words, and of larger extent touching our Liberties, then are contained in the Statutes whereon it is grounded: In respect of which inlargement, it was fit to have some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, or implied Saving, or Narrative, Declaratory for the Kings Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power, of which Narrative ye alledge this Clause to be.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Lastly, whereas the Commons, as a main Argument against the Clause, had much insisted upon this, that is was unprecedented, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parliamentary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in a Petition from the Subjects, to insert a Saving for the Crown: your Lordships brought for instance to the contrary the two Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the 25 E. 1. commonly called, <hi>Confirmatio Chartarum,</hi> and 28 E. 1. known by this name of <hi>Articuli super Chartas,</hi> in both which Statutes there are Saving for the Kings.</p>
                        <p>Having thus reduced to your Lordships memories, the effects of your own reasons; I will now with your Lordships favor come to the points of our Reply, wherein I most humbly beseech your Lordships to weigh the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which I shall present, not as the sense of my self, the weakest Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our House, but as the genuine and true sense of the whole House of Commons, conceived in a business there debated with the greatest gravity and solemnity, with the greatest concurrence of opinions, and unanimity that ever was in any business maturely agitated in that House. I shall not peradventure follow the Method of your Lordships recollected Reasons in my answering to them, nor labor to urge many reasons. It is the desire of the Commons, that the weight of their Arguments should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> recompense (if need be) the smalness of their number. And in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, when you have heard me through, I hope your Lordships shall be enabled to collect clearly out of the frame of what I shall deliver, that in some part or other of my discourse there is a full and satisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, given to every particular reason or objection of your Lordships.</p>
                        <p>The Reasons that are now appointed to be presented to your Lordships are of two kinds, Legal and Rational, of which these of the former sort are allotted to my charge, and the first of them is thus.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> The Clause now under question if it be added to the Petition, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it must refer, or relate unto it, or else not; if it have no such refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is it not clear that it is needless and superfluous? and if it have such reference, is it not clear that then it must needs have an operation upon the whole Petition, and upon all the parts of it?</p>
                        <p>We cannot think that your Lordships would offer us a vain thing, and
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:35668:297"/>
therefore taking it for granted, that if it be added it would refer to the Petition: let me beseech your Lordships to observe with me, and with the House of Commons, what alteration and qualification of the same it will introduce.</p>
                        <p>The Petition of it self, simply and without this Clause, declareth abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the Rights and Priviledges of the Subject, in divers points; and amongst the rest touching the Levies of monies, by way of Loans or otherwise for his Majesties supply, That such Loans and other charges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the like nature, by the Laws and Statutes of this Land, ought not to be made or laid without common consent by Act of Parliament: But admit this Clause to be annexed with reference (to the Petition) and it must necessarily conclude and have this Exposition, That Loans and the like Charges (true it is ordinarily) are against the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, <hi>unless they be warranted by Soveraign Power,</hi> and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be commanded or raised without assent of Parliament, <hi>unless it be by Soveraign Power</hi>; what were this but to admit a Soveraign Power in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> King above the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdome?</p>
                        <p>Another part of this Petition is, That the free Subjects of this Realm ought not to be imprisoned without cause shewed: But by this Clause a Soveraign Power will be admitted, and left intire to his Majesty, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to control the force of Law, and to bring in this new and dangerous Interpretation, That the free Subjects of this Realm ought not by Law to be imprisoned without cause shewed, <hi>unless it be by Soveraign Power.</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>In a word, this Clause, if it should be admitted, would take away the effect of every part of the Petition, and become destructive to the whole: for thence will be the Exposition touching the Billeting of Soldiers and Mariners in free mens houses against their wills; and thence will be the Exposition touching the Times and Places for execution of the Law Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal, contrary to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm.</p>
                        <p>The scope of this Petition, as I have before observed, is not to amend our Case, but to restore us to the same state we were in before; whereas,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> if this Clause be received, in stead of mending the condition of the poor Subjects, whose Liberties of late have been miserably violated by some Ministers, we shall leave them worse then we found them; in stead of curing their wounds, we shall make them deeper. We have set bounds to our desires in this great Business, whereof one is not to diminish the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the King, by mounting too high; and if we bound our selves on the other side with this limit, not to abridge the lawful Priviledges of the Subject, by descending beneath that which is meet, no man we hope <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> can blame us.</p>
                        <p>My Lords, as there is mention made in the additional <hi>Clause of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power,</hi> so is there likewise of a trust reposed in his Majesty, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the use of Soveraign Power.</p>
                        <p>The word Trust is of great Latitude, and large extent, and therefore ought to be well and warily applied and restrained, especially in the Case of a King: There is a trust inseparably reposed in the Persons of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> but that trust is regulated by Law; for example, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Statutes are made to prohibite things not <hi>mala in se,</hi> but onely <hi>mala quia prohibita,</hi> under certain forfeitures and penalties, to accrue to the King and to the Informers, that shall sue for the breach of them: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons must and ever will acknowledge a Regal and Soveraign Prerogative in the King, touching such Statutes, that it is in his Majesties absolute and
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:35668:297"/>
undoubted Power, to grant Dispensations to particular persons, with the Clauses of <hi>Non obstante,</hi> to do as they might have done before those Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, wherein his Majesty conferring grace and favour upon some, doth not do wrong to others; but there is a difference between those Statutes, and the Laws and Statutes whereon the Petition is grounded: by those Statutes the Subject hath no interest in the penalties, which are all the fruit such Statutes can produce, until by Suit or Information commenced, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he become intituled to the particular forfeitures; whereas the Laws and Statutes mentioned in our Petition are of another nature; there shall your Lordships finde us to rely upon the good old Statute, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which declareth and confirmeth the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Common Laws of the Liberties of <hi>England:</hi> There shall your Lordships also finde us also to insist upon divers other most material Statutes made in the time of King <hi>E.</hi> 4. and <hi>E.</hi> 3. and other famous Kings, for explanation and ratification of the Lawful Rights and Priviledges belonging to the Subjects of this Realm, Laws not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Penalties upon Offenders, <hi>in malis prohibitis,</hi> but Laws declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or positive, conferring or confirming <hi>ipso facto,</hi> an inherent Right and Interest of Liberty and Freedom in the Subjects of this Realm, as their Birthrights and Inheritance descendable to their Heirs and Posterity; Statutes incorporate into the Body of the Common Law, over which (with reverence be it spoken) there is no Trust reposed in the Kings <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power or Prerogative Royal</hi> to enable him to dispense with them, or to take from his Subjects that Birthright or Inheritance which they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> have in their Liberties by vertue of the Common Law, and of these Statutes.</p>
                        <p>But if this Clause be added to our Petition, we shall then make a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous overture to confound this good destination touching what Statutes the King is trusted to controll by dispensations, and what not; and shall give an intimation to posterity, as if it were the opinion both of the Lords and Commons assembled in this Parliament, that there is a Trust reposed in the King, to lay aside by his <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> in some amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cases, as well of the Common Law, and such Statutes as declare or ratifie the Subjects Liberty, or confer Interest upon their persons, as those other Penal Statutes of such nature as I have mentioned before; which as we can by no means admit, so we believe assuredly, that it is far from the desire of our most Gracious Soveraign, to affect so vast a Trust, which being transmitted to a Successor of a different temper, might enable him to alter the whole frame and fabrick of the Commonwealth, and to dissolve that Government whereby his Kingdom hath flourished <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for so many years and ages under his Majesties most Royal Ancestors and predecessors.</p>
                        <p>Our next Reason is, That we hold it contrary to all course of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and absolutely repugnant to the very nature of a Petition of Right consisting of particulars, as ours doth, to clog it with a general <hi>Saving</hi> or Declaration to the weakning of the Right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and we are bold to renew with some confidence our Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there can be no Precedent shewed of any such Clause in any such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Petitions in times past.</p>
                        <p>I shall insist the longer upon this particular, and labour the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to clear it, because your Lordships were pleased the last day to urge against us the Statutes of 25 and 28 of <hi>E.</hi> 1. as arguments to prove the contrary, and seemed not to be satisfied with that which in this point we
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:35668:298"/>
had affirmed. True it is, that in those Statutes there are such <hi>Savings</hi> as your Lordships have observed; but I shall offer you a clear Answer to them, and to all other <hi>Savings</hi> of like nature that can be found in any Statutes whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>First in the general, and then I shall apply particular Answers to the particulars of those two Statutes, whereby it will be most evident, that those examples can no ways sute with the matter now in hand. To this end it will be necessary that we consider duely what that question is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which indeed concerneth a Petition, and not an Act of Parliament: This being well observed, by shewing unto your Lordships the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Petition for the Law, and the Law ordained upon such a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and opening truly and perspicuously the course that was holden in framing of Statutes before 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. different from that which ever since then hath been used, and is still in use amongst us, and by noting the times wherein these Statutes were made, which was about one hundred years before 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. besides the differences between these <hi>Savings</hi> and this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Clause; I doubt not but I shall give ample satisfaction to your Lordships, that the Commons as well in this, as in all their other Reasons, have been most careful to rely upon nothing but that which is most true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
                        <p>Before the second year of King <hi>H.</hi> 5. the course was thus: When the Commons were Suiters for a Law, either the Speaker of their House by word of mouth from them, the Lords House joyning with them, or by some Bill in writing, which was usually called their Petition, moved the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> King to Ordain Laws for the redress of such mischiefs or inconveniences as were found grievous unto the people.</p>
                        <p>To these Petitions the King made answer as he pleased, sometimes to part, sometimes to the whole, sometimes by denial, sometimes by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, sometimes absolutely, and sometimes by qualification. Upon these Motions and Petitions, and the Kings Answers to them, was the Law drawn up and Ingrossed in the Statute Roll to binde the Kingdom; but this inconvenience was found in this course, that oftentimes the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thus framed were against the sense and meaning of the Commons, at whose desires they were Ordained; and therefore in the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it tended to the violation of their Liberty and Freedom, whose right it was, and ever had been, that no Law should be made without their assent; they then exhibited a Petition to the King, declaring their right in this particular, praying that from thenceforth no Law might be made or Ingrossed as Statutes, by additions or diminutions to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Petitions, that should change their sense or intent, without their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> assent; which was accordingly established by Act of Parliament; ever since then the use hath been as the Right was before, that the King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the whole, or leaveth the whole of all Bills or Petitions exhibited for the obtaining of Laws.</p>
                        <p>From this course, and from the time when first it became constant and setled, we conclude strongly that it is no good Argument, because ye finde <hi>Savings</hi> in Acts of Parliament before the second of <hi>H.</hi> 5. that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those <hi>Savings</hi> were in the Petitions that begat those Statutes; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> if the Petitions for the two Loans so much insisted upon (which Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for any think we know, are not now extant) were never so absolute, yet might the King, according to the usage of those times, insert the Savings in his Answers, which passing from thence into the Statute Roll, do onely give some little colour, but are not proof at all that the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions also were with Savings.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="581" facs="tcp:35668:298"/>
Thus much for the general; to come now to the particular Statute of 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. which was a confirmation of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> with some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for the better execution of it, as common Law, which words are worth the noting.</p>
                        <p>It is true that Statute hath also a Clause to this effect, That the King or his Heirs from thenceforth should take no Aids, Taxes, or Prises of his Subjects, but by common assent of all the Realm, <hi>Saving</hi> the ancient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Aids, and Prises due and accustomed.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Saving</hi> if it were granted (which is not, nor cannot be proved) that it was as well in the Petition, as in the Act; yet can it no way imply that it is either fit or safe, that the Clause now in question should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our Petition: for the nature and office of a Saving, or Exception, is to exempt particulars out of a general, and to ratifie the Rule in things not exempted, but in no sort to weaken or destroy the general Rule it self.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
The body of that Law was against all Aids and Taxes and Prises in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and was a confirmation of the common Law, formerly declared by <hi>Magna Charta</hi>; the Saving was onely of Aids and Prises in particular, so well described and restrained by the words, <hi>Ancient and Accustomed,</hi> that there could be no doubt what could be the clear meaning and extent of that exception; for the Kings Right to those ancient Aids, intended by that Stature to be saved to him, was well known in those days, and is not yet forgotten.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
These Aids were three, from the Kings Tenants by Knights service, due by the common Law, or general Custom of the Realm; Aid to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som the Kings Royal Person, if unhappily he should be taken prisoner in the Wars; Aid to make the Kings Eldest Son a Knight, and Aid to marry the Kings Eldest Daughter once, but no more; and that those were the onely Aids intended to be saved to the Crown by that Statute, appeareth in some clearness, by the Charter of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> dated at <hi>Runningmede</hi> the 15 of <hi>Iune</hi> in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Reign, wherein they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are enumerated with an exclusion of all other Aids whatsoever. Of this Charter I have here one of the Originals, whereon I beseech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships to cast your eyes, and give me leave to read the very words which concern this point. These words (my Lords) are thus: <q>
                              <hi>Nullum scutigium vel auxilium ponatur in Regno nostro, nisi per commune Consilium Regni nostri, nisi ad Corpus nostrum redimendum, &amp; primogenitum filium nostrum militem faciendum, &amp; ad filiam nostram primogenitam semel maritandam, &amp; ad hoc non siat nisi rationabile auxilium.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Touching Prises, the other thing excepted by this Statute, it is also of a particular Right to the Crown so well known, that it needeth no description, the King being in possession of it by every days usage.</p>
                        <p>It is to take one Tun of Wine before the Mast, and another behinde the Mast, of every Ship bringing in above twenty Tuns of Wine, and here discharge them by way of Merchandise.</p>
                        <p>But our Petition consisteth altogether of particulars, to which if any general <hi>Saving</hi> or words amounting to one should be annexed, it cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> work to confirm things not excepted which are none, but to confound things included, which are all the parts of the Petition; and it must needs beget this dangerous Exposition, that the Rights and Liberties of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, declared and demanded by this Petition, are not theirs absolutely, but <hi>sub modo</hi>; not to continue always, but onely to take place when the King is pleased not to exercise that <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> wherewith this Clause admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:35668:299"/>
he is trusted for the protection, safety, and happiness of his People: And thus that Birthright and Inheritance, which we have in our Liberties, shall by our own assents be turned into a meer Tenancy at will and sufferance.</p>
                        <p>Touching the Statute of 28 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. <hi>Articuli super Chartas,</hi> the scope of that Statute among other things, being to provide for the better obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and maintaining of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> hath in it nevertheless two <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings</hi> for the King; the one particular, as I take it, to preserve the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Prices, due and accustomed, as of Wines and of other goods, the other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> general Seigniory of the Crown in all things.</p>
                        <p>To these two <hi>Savings,</hi> besides the former Answers, which may be for the most part applied to this Statute, as well as to the former; I adde these further Answers: The first of these two <hi>Savings,</hi> is of the same pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Wines which is excepted in the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. but in some more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for that here the word (Wines) is expresly annexed to the word (Prices) which I take for so much to be in Exposition of the former Law: And albeit these words (<hi>and of other goods</hi>) be added, yet do I take it to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but a particular <hi>Saving,</hi> or exception, which being qualified with the words (<hi>Ancient, due and accustomed</hi>) is not very dangerous, nor can be understood of Prices or Levies upon Goods of all sorts at the Kings will and pleasure, but onely of the old and certain Customs upon Wool, Woolfels and Leather, which were due to the Crown long before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Statute.</p>
                        <p>For the latter of the two <hi>Savings</hi> in this Act, which is of the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual nature, and subject to the more exception; it is indeed general, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> if we may believe the concurrent Relations of the Histories of those times, as well as those that are now Printed, as those which remain onely in Manuscripts, it gave distaste from the beginning, and wrought no good effect; but produced such distempers and troubles in the State, as we wish may be buried in perpetual oblivion; and that the like <hi>Saving</hi> in these and future times, may never breed the like disturbance: For from hence arose a Jealousie, That <hi>Magna Charta</hi> which declared the ancient Right of the Subject, and was an absolute Law in it self, being now confirmed by a lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Act with this Addition of a general <hi>Saving</hi>; for the Kings Right in all things by the <hi>Saving</hi> was weakned, and that made doubtful which was clear before: But not to depart from our main ground, which is, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings</hi> in old Acts of Parliament, before 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. are no proof that there were the like <hi>Savings</hi> in the Petitions; for those Acts let me observe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Lordships, and so leave this point, That albeit this Petition, whereon this Act of 28 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. was grounded, be perished; yet hath it pleased God that the very Frame and Context of the Act it self, as it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> drawn up, and entred upon the Statute Roll, and Printed in our Books, doth manifestly impart that this <hi>Saving</hi> came in by the Kings Answer, and was not in the Original Petition of the Lords and Commons; for it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in at the end of the Act after the words (<hi>le Roy vent</hi>) which commonly are the words of the Royal assent to an Act of Parliament. And though they be mixed and followed with other words, as though the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel and the rest who were present at the making of this Ordinance, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the same <hi>Saving</hi>; yet is not that Conclusive, so long as by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> form of those times, the Kings Answer working upon the materials of the Petition, might be conceived by some to make the Law effectual, though varying from the frame of the Petition.</p>
                        <p>The next Reason which the Commons have commanded me to use, for which they still desire to be spared from adding this Clause to their
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:35668:299"/>
Petition, is this: this offensive Law of 28 <hi>E.</hi> 1. which confirmed <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> with a <hi>Saving,</hi> rested not long in peace, for it gave not that satisfaction to the Lords or people, as was requisite they should have in a case so near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning them: and therefore about thirty three, or thirty four of the same Kings Reign, a later Act of Parliament was made, whereby it was Enacted, That all men should have their Laws and Liberties and free Customs, as largely and wholly as they had used to have at any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> time, when they had them best; and if any Statutes had been made, or any Customs brought in to the contrary, that all such Statutes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms should be void.</p>
                        <p>This was the first Law which I call now to minde, that restored <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta</hi> to the original purity wherein it was first moulded, albeit it hath been since confirmed above twenty times more by several Acts of Parliament, in the Reigns of divers most just and gracious Kings, who were most apprehensive of their Rights, and jealous of their Honors, and always without <hi>Savings</hi>; so as if between 28 and 34 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>Magna <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Charta</hi> stood blemished with many Savings of the Kings Rights or Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory, which might be conceived to be above the Law; that stain and blemish was long since taken away, and cleared by those many absolute Declarations and Confirmations of that excellent Law which followed in after ages, and so it standeth at this day purged and exempted now from any such <hi>Saving</hi> whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>I beseech your Lordships therefore to observe the circumstance of time wherein we offer this Petition to be presented to your Lordships, and by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> us unto his Majesty: Do we offer it when <hi>Magna Charta</hi> stands clogged with <hi>Saving</hi>? No, my Lords, but at this day when later and better confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have vindicated and set free that Law from all exceptions; and shall we now annex another and worse <hi>Saving</hi> to it by an unnecessary Clause in that Petition, which we expect should have the fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a Law? Shall we our selves relinquish or adulterate that which cost our Ancestors such care and labour to purchase and refine? No, my Lords, but as we should hold our selves unhappy if we should not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> amend the wretched estate of the poor Subject, so let us hold it a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness to impair it.</p>
                        <p>Whereas it was further urged by your Lordships, That to insert this Clause into our Petition, would be no more then to do that again at your Lordships motion and request, which we had formerly done by the mouth of our Speaker; and that there is no cause why we should recede from that which so solemnly we have professed. To this I answer and confess, it was then in our hearts, and so it is now, and shall be ever, not to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> incroach on his Majesties Soveraign Power. But I beseech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships to observe the different occasion and reference of that Protestation, and of this Clause.</p>

                           </gap>nswer to a general Message, which we received from his Majesty, warning us not to incroach upon his Prerogative; to which, like dutiful and loving Subjects, we answered at full, according to the integrity of our own hearts; nor was there any danger in making such an Answer to such a Message, nor could we answer more truly or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> more properly: But did that Answer extend to acknowledge a <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> in the King, above the Laws and Statutes mentioned in our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or controll the Liberties of the Subject therein declared and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? No my Lords, it hath no reference to any such particulars; and the same words which in some cases may be fit to be used, and were unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:35668:300"/>
to be omitted, cannot in other cases be spoken but with imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency at the least, if not with danger; I have formerly opened my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, proving the danger of this Clause, and am commanded to illustrate the impertinency of adding it to the Petition by a familiar Case, which was put in our House by a Learned Gentleman, and of my own Robe: The Case is this, Two Manors or lordships lye adjoyning together, and perchance intermixed, so as there is some difficulty to discern the true bounds of either; as there may be touching the confines where the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the Subject, and the Prerogative of the Crown do border each upon the other; to the one of the Manors the King hath clear Right, and is in actual possession of it; but the other is the Subjects: The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing misinformed that the Subject hath intruded upon his Majesties Manor, asketh his Subject whether he doth enter upon his Majesties Manor, or pretendeth any Title to it, or any part of it? The Subject being now justly occasioned, maketh answer truly to the King, that he hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, nor will intrude upon his Majesties Manor, nor doth make any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Claim or Title to it, or any part of it. This answer is proper and fair; nay it were unmannerly and ill done of the Subject not so to answer upon this occasion. Afterwards the King upon colour of some double or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle matter of Record, seiseth into his Highness hands upon a pretended Title, the Subjects Manor: The Subject then exhibiteth his Petition of Right, or to his Majesty, to attain restitution of his own Manor, and therein layeth down Title to his own Manor onely; were it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and absurd in this Case for him to tell the King that he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to make any Claim or Title to his Majesties Manors, which is not questioned? Doubtless it were. This Case rightly applyed, will fit our purpose well, and notably explain the nature of our Petition.</p>
                        <p>Why should we speak of leaving entire the <hi>Kings Soveraign Power,</hi> whereon we incroach not, while we onely seek to recover our own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Priviledges, which have been seised upon by some of the Kings Ministers? If our Petition did trench actually upon his Majesties Prerogative, would our saying that we intended it not, make the thing otherwise then the truth?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>My Lords, there needeth no Protestation or Declaration to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of that which we have not done; and to put in such a Clause, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not argue less then a fear in us, as if we had invaded it; which we hold sacred, and are assured that we have not touched either in our words, or in our intentions. And touching your Lordships observation upon the word (<hi>Leave</hi>) if it be not a proper word to give any new thing to the King, sure we are, it is a word as dangerous in another sense; for it may amount without all question, to acknowledge an old Right of <hi>Soveraign <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Power</hi> in his Majesty, above these Laws and Statutes whereon onely our Liberties are founded; a Doctrine which we most humbly crave your Lordships leaves freely to protest against.

                           </gap>s rational part, was enforc'd out of the last words of this addition, by which his Lordship said that they did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not leave intire all Soveraign Power, but that wherewith his Majesty is trusted for the Protection, Safety and Happiness of the People; as if his Lordship would infer, that Soveraign Power wherewith <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this place to be <hi>Terminum diminuentem,</hi> a Term of diminution or qualification, and in that consideration might induce us to accept it. But under his Lordships correction, we cannot so interpret it: For first, we are assured that there is no Soveraign Power wherewith his Majesty is trusted, either by God or man, but onely that which is for the Protection, Safety and Happiness of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> his people; and therefore that limitation can make no impression upon us: but we conceive it rather in this place to have the force <hi>Termini adau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentis,</hi> to be a Term of important advantage, against our Petition, a Term of restriction, and that wheresoever his Majesties Soveraign Power should be exercised upon us, in all and every the particulars mentioned in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:35668:301"/>
we should without further enquiry submit thereunto, as assuming and taking it <hi>pro concesso,</hi> it induced to our Safety and Happiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Since therefore (as the Petition is now conceived) it carrieth the form and face of a Picture, which representeth to the life the pressures and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the people, with the easie remedies; And therefore we hope that his Majestie casting upon it a gracious eye, will compassionate his poor Loyal Subjects, and afford a comfortable answer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> I do humbly pray your Lordships not to mar or blemish the grace and face of this Picture with this unnecessary addition; and unnecessary I prove it to be, according to that Rule, <hi>Expressio ejus quod tacite inest nihil operatur.</hi> And Soveraign Power, in cases where it hath place, and ought to be used, is always necessarily understood, and though not expressed, yet supplyed by reasonable intendment, or by the opinion of all Learned men.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, as it neither is nor can be by us expresly included, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this Petition, where the addition thereof would make such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the whole sense and substance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The Kings Soveraign Power and Prerogative is always able to save it self, and if it were not, we must without this addition save it to our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most powers, if we will save our Oath, and save our selves; the true state of the cause thus standing between your Lordships and us, the House of Commons doth not a little marvel upon what grounds your Lordships are so earnest to urge upon them this addition to be inserted into their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they nothing doubt but that the same proceeded out of a sollicitude and fear which your Lordships have, lest otherwise the simple and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> passage of this Petition might be construed hereafter in prejudice of his Majesties Soveraign Power: And this your Lordships sollicitude and fear proceedeth from your love, as the Poet saith,
<q>
                              <l>Res est solliciti plena timoris Amor.</l>
                           </q>
But I humbly pray your Lordships to examine with us, the grounds of this your sollicitude and fear, which grounds needs must be laid either upon the words of the Petition, or the intention of the Petitioners.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Upon the words there is no possibility to lay them, for therein is no mention made of the Soveraign Power; and were the words doubtful, as thus, We pray the like things be nor done hereafter under pretext of your Majesties Soveraign Power; yet in respect of the Protestations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, concomitant and subsequent to the Petition, such doubtful words ought reasonably to be interpreted onely of such Soveraign Power as was not appliable to the Cases wherein it was exercised; and of such So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power as should be justly practised: but there are no such doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> words, and therefore it followeth, that your Lordships fear and sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude must be grounded upon the intention of the Petitioners. Now your Lordships well know, that the House of Commons is not ignorant, that in a Session of Parliament, though it continue as many weeks as this hath done days, yet there is nothing <hi>Prius &amp; Posterius,</hi> but all things are held and taken as done at one time; if so, what a strange Collection was this, that at the same time the House of Commons should oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by a fearful adjuration to assist and defend all Priviledges and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> belonging to the King, and at the same time by a Petition (cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously conveyed) endeavor or intend to divest and deprive the King of some Prerogatives belonging to his Crown. If therefore such fear and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude can neither be grounded upon the words of the Petition, nor inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Petitioners, I humbly pray your Lordships to lay them aside;
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:35668:302"/>
as we do believe that the Proposition of this addition from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, was not onely excuseable, but commendable, as proceeding from your love: So now having heard our Reasons, your Lordships would rest satisfied, that our refusal to admit them into our Petition, proceedeth from the conscience of the integrity and uprightness of our own hearts, that we in all this Petition have no such end to abate or diminish the Kings just Prerogative. And so much in reply to that Rational part whereby my Lord Keeper laboured to perswade the entertainment of this Addition.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>This being done, it pleased the House of Commons to instruct and furnish me with certain Reasons which I should use to your Lordships, to procure your absolute conjunction with us in presenting this Petition, which albeit I cannot set forth according to their worth, and the Instructions given me by the House, yet I hope their own weight will so press down into your Lordships consciences and judgements, that without further scruple you will cheerfully vouchsafe to accompany this Petition with your right noble presence.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A personis.</hi> The first Argument wherewith I was commanded to move your Lordships, was drawn from the consideration of the Persons which are Petitioners, The <hi>House of Commons</hi>; a House whose temper, mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and moderation in this Parliament hath been such, as we should be unthankful and injurious to Almighty God, if we should not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his good hand upon us, upon our tongues, upon our hearts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, no doubt, by our late solemn and publique Humiliation and Prayers.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>This moderation will the better appear, if in the first place we may be remembred in what passion and distemper many Members of this House arrived thither, what bosoms, what pockets full of complaints and lamentable grievances the most part brought thither, and those every day renewed by Letters and Packets from all parts and quarters: You know the old Proverb, <hi>Ubi dolor ibi digitus, ubi amor ibi oculus,</hi> it is hard to keep our fingers from often handling the Parts ill affected, but yet our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration overcame our Passion, our Discretion overcame our Affection.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Moderation also will the better appear, if in the second place it be not forgotten how our Ancestors and Predecessors carried themselves in Parliaments, when upon lighter provocations less would not serve their turns, but new severe commissions to hear and determine offences against their Liberties, publique ecclesiastical Curses, or excommunications against the Authors or Actors of such violations, accusations, condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, executions, banishments. But what have we said all this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? we onely look forward, not backward: we desire amendment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> no mans punishment for ought done heretofore; nothing written by us in blood, nay, not one word spoken against any mans person in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure. The conclusion of our Petition is, that we may be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in time to come: and doth not this moderate Petition deserve your Lordships cheerful conjunction <hi>ex congruo &amp; condigno?</hi> If a Worm being trodden upon, could speak, a Worm would say, tread upon me no more I pray you: higher we rise not, lower we cannot descend, and thus much we think in modesty may well be spoken in our own commendation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thence to move your Lordships to vouchsafe us your noble company in this Petition, without surcharging it with this Addition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A tempore.</hi> Our next Argument is drawn <hi>a tempore,</hi> from the unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of the time. The wise Man saith, There is a time for all things under the Sun, <hi>tempus suum,</hi> and if in the wise mans judgement, a word
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:35668:302"/>
spoken in its due time be precious as Gold and Silver, then an unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time detracts as much from the thing, or word, done, or spoken: We hold (under your favors) that the time is not seasonable now for this Addition; it is true that of it self Soveraign Power is a thing always so Sacred, that to handle it otherwise then tenderly, is a kind of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, and to speak of it otherwise then reverently, is a kind of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy; but every vulgar capacity is not so affected, the most part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> men, nay, almost all men judge and esteem all things not according to their own intrinsick vertue and quality, but according to their immediate effects and operations, which the same things have upon them: Hence it is, that Religion it self receiveth more or less credit or approbation, as the Teachers or Professors are worse or better; yea, if God himself send a very wet harvest or seed-time, men are apt enough to censure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power: The Soveraign Power hath not now, for the present, the ancient amiable aspect, in respect of some late sad influences, but by Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Grace it will soon recover.</p>
                        <p>To intermix with this Petition any mention of Soveraign Power, <hi>rebus sic stantibus,</hi> when angry men say Soveraign Power hath been abused, and the most moderate wish it had not been so used, we hold it not seasonable, under your Lordships correction.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A loco.</hi> Our next Argument is drawn <hi>a loco</hi>: we think <hi>the place</hi> where your Lordships would have this Addition inserted (<hi>viz.</hi>) in the Petition, no convenient or seasonable place; your Lordships will easily believe, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this Petition will run through many hands, every man will be desirous to see and to read, what their Knights and their Burgesses have done in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon their complaints, what they have brought home for their five Subsidies; If in perusing of this Petition they fall upon the mention of Soveraign Power, they presently fall to arguing and reasoning, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting, what Soveraign Power is, what is the Latitude, whence the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and where the bounds? with many such curious and captious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions; by which course Soveraign Power is little advanced or advantaged; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for I have ever been of opinion, that it is then best with Soveraign Power when it is had in <hi>tacite veneration,</hi> not when it is profaned by publique hearings or examinations.</p>
                        <p>Our last Argument is drawn from our <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> to his Majesty, in consideration whereof we are fearful at this time to take this Addition into our Petition, lest we should do his Majesty herein some disservice: with your Lordships we make the great Councel of the King and Kingdom; and though your Lordships having the happiness to be near his Majesty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> know other things better, yet certainly the state and condition of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts for which we serve, their dispositions and inclinations, their apprehensions, their fears and jealousies, are best known unto us: and here I pray your Lordships to give me leave to use the Figure called <hi>Reticen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> that is, to insinuate and intimate more then I mean to speak: Our chief and principal end in this Parliament, is to make up all Rents and Breaches between the King and his Subjects, to draw them and knit them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> together, from that distance whereof the world abroad takes too much notice, to work a perfect union and reconciliation: how unproperly and unapt at this time this Addition will be in respect of this end, we cannot but foresee, and therefore shun it, and do resolve, that it is neither agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Persons of such Counsellors, of whom we are, nor answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Love and Duty which we owe to his Majesty, to hazard an end of such unspeakable consequence, upon the admittance of this Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:35668:303"/>
into our Petition, whereof (as we have shewed) the omission at this time can by no means harm the Kings Prerogative, the expression may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce manifold inconveniences: and therefore since this admittance of your Lordships Addition into our Petition, is incoherent and incompatible with the body of the same; since there is no necessary use of it for the saving of the Kings Prerogative; since the moderation of our Petition deserveth your Lordships cheerful conjunction with us; since this Addition is unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for the time, and inconvenient in respect of the place where your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Lordships would have it inserted; and lastly may prove a disservice to his Majesty: I conclude with a most affectionate Prayer to your Lordships<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to conclude with the House of Commons, in presenting this Petition to his Sacred Majesty, as it is, without this Addition.</p>

Now that which I have to say this day from my Lords, is to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> let you, know this fair proceeding is not a profession of words onely, but really and indeed concerning the Petition which hath been long in agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the weight of the cause required: since the last Conference my Lords have taken it into their serious and instant consideration, and at length are faln upon a Resolution which I am to acquaint you with.</p>
                        <p>The Lords have unanimously agreed with you <hi>in omnibus,</hi> and have voted that they will joyn with you in your Petition, with the onely alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the word (<hi>means</hi>) to be put in stead of the word (<hi>pretext</hi>) and for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the word (<hi>unlawful</hi>) to be put out, and in place thereof to adde (<hi>not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable</hi> by the Laws and Statutes of the Realm) which two alterations your selves consented unto.</p>

                        <p>The first is of the Time when this Doctrine of destruction was set forth; it was Preached in the heart of the Loan, and it was Printed in the beginning of that Term which ended in a <hi>Remittitur</hi>: So that you might guess there might be a double Plot, by the Law and Conscience, to set on fire the frame and estate of this Commonwealth: And one of these intailed Foxes was Mr. <hi>Manwaring.</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another note may be taken of the time, that is, the unseasonableness of it; for this Doctrine of the Loan (in case of necessity) was the year after an assent in Parliament to four Subsidies and three Fifteens, which might serve for a sufficient stopple for the Doctors mouth, to keep in his Doctrine of Necessity.</p>
                        <p>A second observation may be of the Means by which he seeks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy this Commonwealth; his means are Divinity, yea by his Divinity he would destroy both King and Kingdom.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>The King: for there can be no greater mischief to a Prince, then to put the opinion of Deity into his ears; for if from his ears ti should have passed to his heart, it had been mortal: You know how <hi>Herod</hi> perished. Now this man gives a participation of Divine Omnipotence to Kings, and though a part may seem to qualifie, yet all doth seem again to fill up that qualification, and very dangerously, if we remember that God saith of himself, <hi>I am a jealous God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He goes about to destroy the Kingdom and Commonwealth by his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Divinity; but do we finde in Scripture such a destroying Divinity? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I finde there, that <hi>God is a God of order, and not of confusion</hi>: and that <hi>the Son of God came to save, and not to destroy.</hi> By which it seems he hath not his Divinity from God, nor from the Son of God: And that we may be sure he went to Hell for Divinity, he names sundry Jesuits and Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with whom he consulted and traded for his Divinity. But not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Hell it self, the Jesuits are honester then he: for if he had not brought more hell unto them then he found with them, he had not found this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Divinity in them which he hath brought forth; yea in his quotations he hath used those shifts and falshoods for which Boyes are to be whipt in Schools, and yet by them he thinks to carry the Cause of a Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>But for a conclusion, to give the true Character of this man whom I never saw, I will shew it you by one whom I know to be contrary to him: <hi>Samuel</hi> we know all to be a true Prophet; now we read of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that <hi>he writ the Law of the Kingdom in a Book, and laid it up before the Lord.</hi> And this he did, as one of Mr. <hi>Manwarings</hi> own Authors affirms, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> King may know what to command, and the People what to obey; But Mr. <hi>Manwaring</hi> finding the Law of this Kingdom written in Books, tears it in pieces, and that in the presence of the Lord in a Pulpit, that the King may not know what to command, nor the People what to obey.</p>
                        <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Manwaring</hi> being contrary to a true Prophet, must needs be a false one, and the Judgement of a false Prophet belongs to him.</p>
                        <p>I have shewed you an evil Tree, that bringeth forth evil fruit; and now it rests with you to determine whether the following sentence shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> follow, <hi>Cut it down, and cast it into the fire.</hi>

These Mr. Speaker are our dangers, these are they do threaten us, and those are like that <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse, brought in cunningly to surprize us, in these do lurk the strongest of our enemies ready to issue on us, and if we do not now the more speedily expel them, these are the sign, the invitation to others.</p>
               <p>These will prepare their entrance, that we shall have no means left of refuge or defence; for if we have these enemies at home, how can we strive with those that are abroad? if we be free from these, no other can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> us: Our ancient English vertue, that old Spartan valor cleared from these disorders, being in sincerity of Religion once made friends with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, having maturity of Councels, sufficiency of Generals, incorruption of Officers, opulency in the King, Liberty in the People, repletion in Treasures, restitution of Provisions, reparation of Ships, preservation: of Men:</p>

                           <pb n="602" facs="tcp:35668:308"/>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> last one of the said Sermons, and upon the 29. day of the same Moneth the other of the said Sermons; both which Sermons he hath since published in print in a Book intituled <hi>Religion and Allegiance;</hi> and with a wicked and malitious intention to seduce and misguide the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Kings most excellent Majesty, touching the observation of the Laws and Customes of this Kingdom, and of the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects, to incense his Royal displeasure against his good Subjects so refusing, to scandalize, subvert and impeach the good Laws and Government of this Realm, and the Authority of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> High Court of Parliament, to alienate his Royal heart from his People, and to cause jealousies, sedition and division in the Kingdom. He the said <hi>Roger Manwaring</hi> doth in the said Sermons and Book per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the Kings most excellent Majesty,</p>
                        <p>First, that his Majesty is not bound to keep and observe the good Laws and Customes of this Realm, concerning the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subjects aforementioned: And that his Royal Will and Command in imposing Loans, Taxes and other Aids upon his people without common consent in Parliament, doth so far binde the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Consciences of the Subjects of this Kingdom, that they cannot refuse the same without peril of eternal damnation.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that those of his Majesties loving Subjects which refused the Loan aforementioned in such manner, as is before recited, did therein offend against the Law of God, against his Majesties Supreme Authority, and by so doing became guilty of Impiety, Dissoialty, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Disobedience, and liable to many other Taxes, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which he in the several parts of his Book doth most falsly and malitiously lay upon them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that authority of Parliaments is not necessary for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> raising of Aids and Subsidies, that the slow proceedings of such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies are not fit for the supply of the urgent necessities of the State, but rather apt to produce sundry impediments to the just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of Princes, and to give them occasion of displeasure and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.</p>
                        <p>All which the Commons are ready to prove, not only by the general scope of the same Sermons and Book, but likewise by several Clauses, Assertions, and Sentences therein contained; and that he the said <hi>Roger Manwaring</hi> by preaching and publishing the Sermons and Book afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> did most unlawfully abuse his holy function, instituted by God in his Church for the guiding of the Consciences of all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and chiefly of Soveraign Princes and Magistrates, and for the maintenance of the peace and concord betwixt all men, especially betwixt the King and his People, and hath thereby most grievously offended against the Crown and Dignity of his Majesty, and against the Prosperity and good Government of this State and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And the said Commons by protestation saving to themselves the Liberty of exhibiting at any time hereafter any other occasion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> or impeachment against the said <hi>Roger Manwaring,</hi> and also of replying to the answers which he the said <hi>Roger</hi> shall make unto any of the matters contained in this present Bill of Complaint, and of offering further proof of the premises, or of any of them, as the Cause according to the Course of Parliament shall require, do pray that the said <hi>Roger Manwaring</hi> may be put to answer to all and every the premises, and that

such proceeding, examination, trial, judgement, and exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment may be thereupon had and executed, as is agreeable to Law and Iustice.</p>

                        <p>The preamble consisted altogether of recital; first of the Inducements upon which the Commons undertook this complaint.</p>
                        <p>The second of those Laws and Liberties against which the offence was committed.</p>
                        <p>The third of the violation of those Laws which have relation to that offence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> From the connexion of all those recitals (he said) there did result three Positions, which he was to maintain as the ground-work and foundation of the whole Cause.</p>
                        <p>The first, that the form of Government in any State could not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered without apparent danger of ruine to that State.</p>
                        <p>The second, the Law of <hi>England,</hi> whereby the Subjects was exempted
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:35668:309"/>
from Taxes and Loans not granted by common consent of Parliament, was not introduced by any Statute, or by any Charter or Sanction of Princes, but was the Antient and Fundamental Law issuing from the first frame and constitution of the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The third, that this Liberty of the Subject is not onely most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and profitable for the People, but most honourable, most necessary for the King, yea in that point of supply for which it was endeavored to be broken.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>The form of Government is that which doth actuate and dispose every part and member of a State to the common good; and as those parts give strength and ornament to the whole, so they receive from it again strength and protection in their several stations and degrees.</p>
                        <p>If this mutual relation and intercourse be broken, the whole frame will quickly be dissolved, and fall in pieces, and in stead of this concord and interchange of support, whilest one part seeks to uphold the old form of Government, and the other part to introduce a new, they will miserably <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> consume and devour one another. Histories are full of the calamities of whole States and Nations in such cases. It is true, that time must needs bring some alterations, and every alteration is a step and degree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a dissolution; those things onely are eternal which are constant and uniform: Therefore it is observed by the best Writers upon this Subject, that those Commonwealths have been most durable and perpetual which have often reformed and recomposed themselves according to their first Institution and Ordinance; for by this means they repair the breaches, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> counterwork the ordinary and natural effect of time.</p>
                        <p>The second question is as manifest, there are plain footsteps of those Laws in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>he Government of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> they were of that vigor and force as to overlive the Conquest, nay to give bounds and limits to the Conqueror, whose victory gave him first hope; but the assurance and possession of the Crown he obtained by composition, in which he bound himself to observe these and the other antient Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, which afterwards he likewise confirmed by oath at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> from him the said Obligation descended to his Successors. It is true, they have been often broken, they have been often confirmed by Charters of Kings, by Acts of Parliaments; but the Petitions of the Subjects, upon which those Charters and Acts were founded, were ever Petitions of Right, demanding their antient and due Liberties, not suing for any new.</p>
                        <p>To clear the third Position (he said) may seem to some men more a Paradox, That those Liberties of the Subject should be so honorable, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> profitable for the King, and most necessary for the supply of his Majesty. It hath been upon another occasion declared, that if those Liberties were taken away, there should remain no more industry, no more justice, no more courage; who will contend, who will endanger himself for that which is not his own?</p>
                        <p>But he said he would not insist upon any of those points, nor yet upon other very important; he said, that if those Liberties were taken away, there would remain no means for the Subjects, by any act of Bounty or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Benevolence, to ingratiate themselves to their Soveragn.</p>
                        <p>And he desired their Lordships to remember what profitable Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives the Laws had appointed for the support of Soveraignty; as Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, Treasures trove, Felons-goods, Fines, Amercements, and other Issues of Courts, Wrecks, Escheats, and many more too long to
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:35668:309"/>
be enumerated; which for the most part are now by Charters and Grants of several Princes dispersed into the hands of private Persons; and that besides the antient Demeasnes of the Crown of <hi>England, William</hi> the Conqueror did annex, for the better maintenance of his Estate, great proportions of those Lands, which were confiscate from those English which persisted to withstand him, and of these very few remain at this day in the Kings possession: And that since that time the revenue of the Crown <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> had been supplied and augmented by Attainders, and other Casualties in the age of our Fathers, by the dissolution of Monasteries and Chantries, neer a third part of the whole Land being come into the Kings possession: He remembred further that constant and profitable Grant of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the Act of Tonnage and Poundage: And all these he said were so alienated, anticipated, overcharged with annuities and assignments, that no means were left for the pressing and important occasions of this time, but the voluntary and free gift of the Subjects in Parliament.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The hearts of the People, and their bounty in Parliament, is the onely constant Treasure and Revenue of the Crown, which cannot be exhausted, alienated, anticipated, or otherwise charged and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
                        <p>In his entrance into the second part he propounded these Steps, by which he meant to proceed.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To shew the state of the Cause, as it stood both in the Charge and in the Proof, that so their Lordships might the better compare them both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> together.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To take away the pretences of mitigations and limitations of his Opinions, which the Doctor had provided for his own defence.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To observe those circumstances of Aggravation, which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be annexed to his Charge.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. To propound some Precedents of former times, wherein though he could not match the offence now in question (for he thought the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had never been committed) yet he should produce such as should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> declare, how forward our Ancestors would have been in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, and condemning of such offences, if they had been then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                        <p>The Offence was prescribed in a double maner, First, by the general scope and intention, and by the matter and particulars of the Fact, whereby that intention was expressed.</p>
                        <p>In the description of the intention he observed six Points, every one of which was a Character of extreme malice and wickedness.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 1. His attempt to misguide and seduce the Conscience of the King.</item>
                           <item>2. To incense his Royal Displeasure against his Subjects.</item>
                           <item>3. To scandalize, impeach and subvert the good Laws and Government of the Kingdom, and Authority of Parliaments.</item>
                           <item>4. To avert his Majesties minde from calling of Parliaments.</item>
                           <item>5. To alienate his royal Heart from his People.</item>
                           <item>6. To cause Jealousies, Sedition, and Division in the Kingdom.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Of these particulars (he said) he would forbear to speak further, till he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> should come to those parts of the Fact, to which they were most properly to be applied.</p>
                        <p>The Materials of the Charge were contrived into three distinct Articles, the first of these comprehended two Clauses.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That his Majesty is not bound to keep and observe the good Laws and Customs of the Realm, concerning the right and liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:35668:310"/>
to be exempted from all Loans, Taxes, and other Aids laid upon them, without common consent in Parliament.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That his Majesties Will and Command in imposing any Charges upon his Subjects without such consent, doth so far bind them in their Consciences, that they cannot refuse the same without peril of eternal damnation.</p>
                        <p>Two kinds of Proof were produced upon this Article.</p>
                        <p>The first was from some assertions of the Doctors, concerning the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> power of Kings in general, but by necessary consequence to be applied to the King of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next kinde of Proof was from his Censures, and determinations upon the particular Case of the late Loan, which by necessity and parity of reason, were likewise applicable to all Cases of the like nature.
And lest by frailty of memory he might mistake the words, or invert the sense, he desired leave to resort to his Paper, wherein the places were carefully extracted out of the Book it self. And then he read each particular Clause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by it self, pointing to the Page for proof, which we here forbear to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, referring the Reader to the Book it self.</p>
                        <p>Then he proceeded and said, That from this evidence of the Fact doth issue a clear evidence of his wicked intention to misguide and seduce the Kings Conscience, touching the observation of the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, to scandalize and impeach the good Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Realm, and the Authority of Parliaments, which are two of those Characters of malice which he formerly noted, and now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thus: If to give the King ill Counsel, in some one particular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath heretofore been heavily punished in this high Court; how much more hainous must it needs be thought by ill Counsel to pervert and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Majesties Conscience, which is the soveraign Principle of all moral Actions, from which they are to receive warrant for their direction before they be acted, and Judgement for their reformation afterwards? If <hi>Scandalum magnatum,</hi> Slander and Infamy cast upon great Lords and Officers of the Kingdom, have been always most severely censured; how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> much more tender ought we to be of that Slander and Infamy, which is here cast upon the Laws and Government, from whence is derived all the Honor and Reverence, which is due to those great Lords and Magistrates?</p>
                        <p>All men (and so the greatest and highest Magistrates) are subject to pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and partialities, whereby they may be transported into overhard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Courses: Which Considerations may sometimes excuse, though never justifie the railing and evil speeches of men, who have been so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked; it being a true rule, That whatsoever gives strength and inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to the temptation in any sin, doth necessarily imply an abatement and diminution of guilt in that sin. But to slander and disgrace the Laws and Government, is without possibility of any such excuse, it being a simple act of a malignant Will, not induced nor excited by any outward provocation: the Laws carrying an equal and constant respect to all, ought to be reverenced equally by all. And thus he derived the Proofs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements, upon the first Article of the Charge.</p>
                        <p>The second Article he said contained three Clauses.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That these refusers had offended against the Law of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Against the supreme Authority.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By so doing, were become guilty of Impiety, Disloyalty, Rebellion, Disobedience, and lyable to many other Taxes.</p>
                        <p>For proof of all these (he said) he needed no other evidence then what
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:35668:310"/>
might be easily drawn from those places which he had read already; for what impiety can be greater, then to contemn the Law of God, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer humane Laws before it? what greater disloyalty, rebellion and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then to depress supreme Authority, to tye the hands and clip the wings of Soveraign Princes? Yet he desired their Lordships patience in hearing some few other places, wherein the Stains and Taint, which the Doctor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to lay upon the Refusers, might appear by the odiousness of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their comparisons, in which he doth labor to rank them.</p>
                        <p>The first Comparison is with Popish Recusants; yet he makes them the worst of the two, and for the better resemblance, gives them a new name of Temporal Recusants.</p>
                        <p>For this he alledgeth the 1. Sermon, Page 31, 32. and part of the fifth Consideration, by which he would perswade them to yield to this Loan.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, If they would consider what advantage this their Recusancy in Temporals, gives to the common adversary, who for disobedience in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Spirituals, have hitherto alone inherited that name: for that which we our selves condemn in them for so doing, and profess to hate that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which teacheth them so to do, that is, to refuse subjection unto Princes in Spirituals; the same, if not worse, some of our side now (if ours they be) dare to practise.</p>
                        <p>We must needs be argued of less Conscience, and more Ingratitude both to God and the King, if in Temporal things we obey not: They in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals deny subjection, wherein they may perhaps frame unto themselves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> some reasons of probability, that their offence is not so hainous, if we in Temporals shall be so refractory: what colour of reason can we possibly finde to make our defence withal, without the utter shaming of our selves, and laying a stain which cannot easily be washed out, upon that Religion which his Majesty doth so graciously maintain, and our selves profess?</p>
                        <p>The second Comparison is with Turks and Jews, in the 2. Sermon, Page 47. What a Paradox is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What a Turk will do for a Christian, and a Christian for a Turk, and a Jew for both, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the same and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> much less Christian men should deny to a Christian King.</p>
                        <p>The third Comparison is with <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram, Theudas</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> which is taken out of the second Sermon, Page 49. where he labors to deprive those refusers of all merit in their sufferings for this Cause.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Corah, Dothan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> whom for their murmurings God suddenly sunk into Hell fire, might as well alledge their sufferings had some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with that of the three Children, in the Babylonian Furnace; and <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> the two Incendiaries of the people in the days of <hi>Caesars</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> tribute, might as well pretend their Cause to be like the <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus he ended the second Article of the Charge, upon which he said were imprinted other two of these six Characters of malice formerly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: That is, a wicked intention to increase his Majesties displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his good Subjects so refusing, and to alienate his heart from the rest of his People: Both which were Points so odious, that he needed not to adde any further inforcement or illustration.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> The third Article conteined three Clauses.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That Authority of Parliament is not necessary for the raising of Aids, and Subsidies.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the slow proceedings of such Assemblies, are not fit to supply the urgent necessity of the State.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That Parliaments are apt to produce sundry Impediments to the just designs of Princes, and to give them occasion of displeasure and discontent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="608" facs="tcp:35668:311"/>
For proof of all which he alledged two places, conteining the two first of those six Considerations, which are propounded by the Doctor, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the refusers to yield to the Loan in the first Sermon, Page 26, 27.</p>
                        <p>First, if they would please to consider, that though such Assemblies as are the highest and greatest Representations of a Kingdom, be most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Honorable, and Necessary also to those ends to which they were at first instituted: yet know we must that ordained they were not to this end, to contribute any Right to Kings, whereby to challenge tributary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Aids and Subsidiary helps, but for the more equal imposing, and more easie exacting of that which unto Kings doth appertain by natural and original Law and Justice, as their proper inheritance annexed to their Imperial Crowns from their Birth. And therefore if by a Magistrate that is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, if upon necessity, extreme and urgent, such subsidiary helps be required, a proportion being held respectively to the ability of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons charged, and the sum and quantity so required surmount not too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably the use and charge for which it was levyed, very hard would it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be for any man in the World, that should not accordingly satisfie such demands, to defend his conscience from that heavy prejudice of resisting the Ordinance of God, and receiving to himself damnation; though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of those circumstances be not observed, which by the municipal Law is required.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, if they would consider the importunities that often may be urgent, and pressing necessaries of State, that cannot stay without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and apparent danger, for the motion and revolution of so great and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vast a Body as such Assemblies are, nor yet abide their long and pausing deliberation when they are assembled, nor stand upon the answering of those jealous and over-wary Cautions and Objections made by some, who wedded overmuch to the love of epidemical and popular Errors, and bent to cross the most just and lawful designs of their wise and gratious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; and that under the plausible shews of singular liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which if their Conscience might speak, would appear nothing more then the satisfying either of private humors, passions, or purposes.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>He said he needed not draw any Arguments or Conclusions from these places; the substance of the Charge appeared sufficiently in the words themselves, and to this third Article he fixed two other of these six Characters of malice, That it is his wicked intention to avert his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties minde from calling of Parliaments, and to cause Jealousies, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Divisions in the Kingdom: which he shortly inforced thus. If Parliaments be taken away, Mischiefs and Disorders must needs abound, without any possibility of good Laws to reform them; Grievances will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dayly increase without opportunity or means to redress them; and what readier way can there be to distractions betwixt the King and People, to tumults and distempers in the State, then this?</p>
                        <p>And so he concluded this third Article of the Charge.</p>
                        <p>The Limitations whereby the Doctor had provided to justifie (or at least to excuse) himself, were propounded to be three.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That he did not attribute to the King any such absolute Power as might be exercised at all times, or upon all occasions, according to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> own pleasure, but onely upon necessity, extreme and urgent.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the sum required, must be proportionable to the ability of the party, and to the use and occasion.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That he did not say, That the substance of the Municipal or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Laws might be omitted or neglected, but the Circumstances onely.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="609" facs="tcp:35668:311"/>
To these were offered three Answers, the first general, the other two particular. The general Answer was this, that it is all one to leave the Power absolute, and to leave the judgement arbitrary when to execute that Power; for although these limitations should be admitted, yet it is left to the King alone to determine, what is an urgent and pressing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, what is a just proportion both in respect of the ability, and of the use and occasion; and what shall be said to be a Circumstance, and what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the Substance of the Law; and the Subject is left without remedy: the legal bounds being taken away, no private person shall be allowed to oppose his own particular opinion in any of these points to the Kings Resolution; so that all these limitations, though specious in shew, are in effect fruitless and vain.</p>
                        <p>The first particular Answer applied to that limitation of urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, was taken from the case of <hi>Normandy,</hi> as it appears in the Comen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of <hi>Guilme Jermie</hi> upon the customary Laws of that Dutchy: they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> having been opprest with some grievances, contrary to this Franchise, made their complaint to <hi>Lewis</hi> the tenth, which by his Charter in the year 1314. acknowledging the Right and Custome of the Countrey, and that they had been unjustly grieved, did grant and provide that from thence forward they should be free from all Subsidies and Exactions to be imposed by him and his Successors, yet with this clause, <hi>Si necessitie grand ne le requiret:</hi> which small exception has devoured all these Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; for though these States meet every year, yet they have little or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> no power left, but to agree to such Levies as the King will please to make upon them.</p>
                        <p>The second particular Answer applied to the limitation and diminution of this Power, which may be pretended to be made by this word <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> as if he did acknowledge the King to be bound to the substance of the Law, and free onely in regard of the manner; whereas if the places be observed, it will appear that he intends by that word, <hi>the Assembly of Parliaments, and assent of the People,</hi> such Contribution which is the very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Substance of the Right and Liberty now in question.</p>
                        <p>The Circumstances of Aggravation observed to be annexed to this Cause were these.</p>
                        <p>The first from the place where these Sermons were preached; the Court, the Kings own Family, where such Doctrine was before so well believed, that no man needed to be converted. Of this there could be no end, but either Simoniacal, by flattery and soothing to make way for his own preferment, or else extreme malitious, to add new afflictions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to those who lay under his Majesties wrath, disgraced and imprisoned, and to enlarge the wound which had been given to the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The second was from the consideration of his holy Function: He is a Preacher of Gods Word; and yet he had endeavoured to make that which was the onely rule of Justice and Goodness, to be the warrant for violence and oppression. He is a Messenger of Peace, but he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to sow strife and dissension, not onely amongst private persons, but even betwixt the King and his People, to the disturbance and danger of the whole State: He is a Spiritual Father, but like that evil Father in the Gospel, he hath given his Children Stones in stead of Bread; in stead of Flesh he hath given them Scorpions. Lastly, he is a Minister of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but he hath acted the part of a Romish Jesuit; they labour our destruction by dissolving the Oath of Allegiance taken by the
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:35668:312"/>
People; he doth the same work, by dissolving the Oath of Protection and Justice taken by the King.</p>
                        <p>A third point of Aggravation was drawn from the quality of these Authors, upon whose authority he doth principally rely, being for the most part Fryers and Jesuits, and from his fraud and shifting in citing those Authors to purposes quite different from their own meanings.</p>
                        <p>Touching which it was observed, that most of his places are such as were intended by the Authors concerning absolute Monarchies, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by Laws or Contracts betwixt the King and his People; and in answer to all Authorities of this kinde were alledged certain passages of a Speech from our late Soveraign King <hi>Iames</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>he Lords and Commons in Parliament 1609.</p>
                        <p>In these our times we are to distinguish betwixt the state of Kings in their first original, and between the state of setled Kings and Monarchs that do at this time govern in Civil Kingdoms, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Every just King in a setled Kingdom is bound to observe the paction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> made to his People by his Laws, in framing his Government agreeable thereunto, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>All Kings that are not Tyrants or perjured, will be glad to bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within the limits of their Laws; and they that perswade them to the contrary are Vipers and Pests, both against them and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                        <p>It was secondly observed, that in the 27. page of his first Sermon he cites these words out of <bibl>
                              <hi>Suarez de legibus, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</bibl> 
                           <q>
                              <hi>Acceptationem <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> populi non esse conditionem necessariam ex vi Iuris naturalis aut gentium, neque ex Iure communi</hi>; the Jesuit adds, <hi>neque ex antiquo Jure Hispaniae</hi>
                           </q>; which words are left our by the Doctor, lest the Reader might be invited to enquire what was <hi>antiqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>m jus Hispaniae</hi>; and it might have been learned from the same Author in another place of that Work, that about two hundred years since, this liberty was granted to the People by one of the Kings, that no Tribute should be imposed without their consent; And the Author adds further, that after the Law introduced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and confirmed by Custome, the King is bound to observe it. From this place he took occasion to make this short digression, That the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> being powerful and wise Princes would never have parted with such a mark of absolute Royalty, if they had not found in this course more advantage then in the other, and the success and prosperity of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, through the valor and industry of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nation so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced since that time, do manifest the wisedom of that change.</p>
                        <p>The third observation of fraud, in perverting his Authors, was this,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> In the twentieth Page of the first Sermon he cites these words out of the same <hi>Suarez de legibus, li.</hi> 5. <hi>ca.</hi> 15. <hi>fol.</hi> 300. <hi>Tributa esse maximè naturalia, &amp; prae se ferre Justitiam, quia exiguntur de rebus propriis</hi>; This he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth in proof of the just right of Kings to lay Tributes. And no man that reads it doubts but that in <hi>Suarez</hi> opinion the Kings Interest and Propriety in the Goods of his Subjects is the ground of that Justice; But the truth is, that <hi>Suarez</hi> in that Chapter had distributed Tributes into divers kinds, of which he calls one sort <hi>tributum reale,</hi> and describes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it thus, <hi>Solent ita vocari pensiones quaedam quae penduntur regibus, &amp; principibus exteris &amp; agris, quae a principio ad sustentationem illis applicata fuerunt, ipsi vero in feodum aliis ea donarunt sub certa pensione annua, quae jure civili Canon appellari solet, quia certa regula &amp; lege praescripta erat</hi>; So that the issue is, this which <hi>Suarez</hi> affirms for justification of one kinde
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:35668:312"/>
of Tribute, which is no more then a Fee farm of rent due by reservation in the grant of Kings own lands; the Doctor herein, worse then a Jesuit, doth wrest to the justification of all kinds of Tribute exacted by Imposition upon the goods of the Subjects, wherein the King had no interest or propriety at all.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The last aggravation was drawn from his behaviour since these Sermons preached, whereby he did continue still to multiply and increase <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his offence, yea, even since the sitting of the Parliament, and his being questioned in Parliament; upon the fourth of <hi>May</hi> last he was so bold as to publish the same doctrine in his own parish Church of St. <hi>Giles</hi>; the points of which Sermons were these.</p>
                        <p>That the King had right to order all, as to him should seem good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mans consent.</p>
                        <p>That the King might require in time of necessity Aid; and if the Subjects did not supply, the King might justly avenge it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> That the Propriety of Estate and Goods was ordinarily in the Subject: but extraordinarily, (that is, in case of the Kings need) the King hath right to dispose them.</p>
                        <p>These Assertions in that Sermon he said would be proved by very good testimony, and therefore desired the Lords that it might be carefully examined, because the Commons held it to be a great contempt to the Parliament for him to maintain that so publikely which was here que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> They held it a great presumption for a private Divine to debate the Right and Power of the King, which is a matter of such a nature, as to be handled only in this High Court, and that with moderation and tenderness; and so he concluded that point of aggravation.</p>
                        <p>In the last place he produced some such precedents as might testifie what the opinion of our Ancestors would have been, if this case had fallen out in their time; And herein he said he would confine himself to the reigns of the first three <hi>Edwards,</hi> two of them Princes of great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> glory; He began with the eldest, <hi>Westm.</hi> 1. <hi>Ca.</hi> 33.</p>
                        <p>By this Statute 3. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. provision was made against those who should tell any false News, or devise, by which any discord or scandal may arise betwixt the King, his People, and great Men of the Kingdom.</p>

                        <p>To these temporal Precedents of antient times which were alledged, he added an Ecclesiastical Precedent out of a book called <hi>Pupilla Oculi,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> published for the instruction of Confessors, in the Title <hi>De partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantibus cum excommunicatis,</hi> fol. 59. All the Articles of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> are inserted with this direction, <q>
                              <hi>Hos articulos ignorare non debent quibus incumbit confessiones audire infra provinciam Cantuariensem</hi>
                           </q>.</p>
                        <p>He likewise remembred the Proclamation 8. <hi>Iac.</hi> for the calling in and burning of Doctor <hi>Cowel</hi>'s book, for which these reasons are given, For mistaking the true state of the Parliament of the Kingdom, and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental constitution and priviledges thereof: For speaking irreverently of the Common Law, it being a thing utterly unlawful for any Subject to speak or write against that Law under which he liveth, and which we are sworn and resolve to maintain.</p>
                        <p>From these Precedents he collected, that if former Parliaments were so careful of false rumors and news, they would have been much more tender of such doctrines as these, which might produce true occasions of discord betwixt the King and his People.</p>
                        <p>If those who reported the King would lay Impositions, and break <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his Laws, were thought such hainous offenders, how much more should this man be condemned, who perswaded the King he is not bound to keep those Laws? If that great King was so far from challenging any right in this kinde, that he professed his own sorrow and repentance for grieving his Subjects with unlawful charges: If Confessors were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to frame the Consciences of the People to the observance of these Laws, certainly such Doctrine, and such a Preacher as this, would have been held most strange, and abominable in all these times?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third general part was the conclusion or prayer of the Commons, which consisted of three Clauses.</p>
                        <p>First, they reserved to themselves liberty of any other accusation, and for this he said there was great reason, that as the Doctor multiplied his offences, so they may renew their accusations.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they saved to themselves liberty of replying to his Answer, for they had great cause to think that he who shifted so much in offending, would shift much more in answering.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they desire he might be brought to examination and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this they thought would be very important for the comfort of the present age, for security of the future against such wicked and malitious practises; And so he concluded, that seeing the cause had strength enough to maintain it self, his humble suit to their Lordships was, That they would not observe his infirmities and defects, to the diminution or prejudice of that strength.</p>

                        <p>But his Majesty saith ye had just cause to be sensible of the danger, considering how the estate of Christendom now stands in respect of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the multitude and strength of our Enemies, and weakness on our part. All which his Majesty knows very exactly, and in respect therereof cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this Parliament, the particulars his Majesty holds it needless to recite, especially to your Lordships, since they are apparant to all men; Neither will it be needfull to reiterate them to his Majesty, whose cares are most intentive upon them, and the best remedy that can be thought on therein is, if his Subjects do their parts. Therefore his Majesty gives you hearty thanks, and bad me tell you that nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hath been more acceptable to him all the time of this Parliament, then this dutiful and discreet carriage of your Lordships, which he professeth hath been a chief motive to his Majesty to suspend those intentions that were not far from a resolution.</p>

                        <p>I do utterly dislike that clause, <hi>as you tender the Kings Honour</hi>; That that must come to a thing of this nature, and it is strange to me, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dive into it; I leave it to your Lordships, for the time, It came out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> seven days after the Summons of Parliament, all knew the Parliament would descry this, but I hope it will now turn to good: I will not say it was kept secret.</p>

                  </gap>resh Debate in the House against the Duke.</note>The Debate was as hot as ever, and the crimes so frequently objected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> against the Duke, were brought in afresh, as if they had never been proposed in the House. One made a distinction that the Duke was <hi>The cause</hi> of some, and <hi>A. cause</hi> of other grievances. For the first, he instanced in the disaster of the Armies, the decay of Ports, Trade, Ships, and Mariners. For the second, he instanced in Religion. First, his Mother was a Recusant, and a fosterer of Recusants. Secondly, Papists have honour in his own employments, and Papists Captains are placed by him. And as for Arminians, <hi>York</hi> House is a place of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> consultation for <hi>Mountague</hi> and others, from whence is like to follow Innovation in Government.</p>
            <p>Another in pursuit of the Argument, that Papists were imployed by the Duke, named <hi>Dalbeer,</hi> as the man who betrayed our men at the Isle of <hi>Ree,</hi> where all was carried by the advice of private men, and some ill affected in Religion, and in assault before they came away, 500. men were lost, and in the Retreat <hi>Dalbeer</hi> was to make a Bridge, which did so intangle them, as they could make no defence: and all contrary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to the advice of the rest of the Commanders.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Philips</hi> was of opinion to have the Declaration run thus, <hi>We conceive the greatness and power of the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>is the chief cause of all these evils.</hi> We are not in a way of Charge, but of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="629" facs="tcp:35668:319"/>Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> were positively to name the Duke as the cause of our evils, for so said they he had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared in the last Parliament,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Elli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot.</hi>
               </note> since when the causes are multiplied, and he hath deserved nothing better of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>In this Debate there wanted not Mediators which did desire the House for their own ends and happiness, to be sparing in that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> kind. Sir <hi>Humphrey May</hi> put them again in mind of the Kings desire, that all personal aspersions might be forborn, that his Majesty will take it as an argument of their moderation and judgment, if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear in this.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> advised that the Remonstrance be so framed,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Henry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi>
               </note> as to make it passable to his Majesties judgment and affection: Let him be perswaded that it comes from a publick sence, and not from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ends. And he vindicated the Duke in point of Religion. 'Tis <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> true, said he, his Mother is a Recusant, but never any thing more grieved him, and never did a Son use more means then he to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert her, and he hath no power over her; and for his own Lady whom he found not firm in his Religion, he hath it used means to confirm her. As for Arminians, I have often heard him protest, and vow against these Opinions. It is true, many that have skill therein, may have some credit with him, and make use of his noble nature for their own ends. One particular I know well, that some Gentlemen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and Preachers of great esteem were questioned for a matter, wherein there was some error in the manner, of which they were presented; I told him of them, and that they were questioned, and he answered me, he would do the best he could for to countenance them.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard</hi> gave his judgement,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard.</hi>
               </note> that if the matter be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged home, it will proclaim the man lowder then we can in words. If we name excess of Power, and abuse of Power, it will reach to the Duke, and all others in future times: and to a Gentleman of honour nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is so dear as sense of Honour. I am witness, and do know that he did many great and good Offices to this House. If the forfeiture of my life could breed an Opinion, that ye should have no occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain at your next meeting, I would pawn it to you. Nor let any man say, it is fear makes us desist, we have shewed already what we dare do.</p>
            <p>And because the imployment of <hi>Dalbeer</hi> had given much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Thomas Jermin.</hi>
               </note> Sir <hi>Thomas Jermin</hi> stood up in his defence, and said he had given great evidence of his Trust and Fidelity. When the Count Palatine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> himself, and the Councel agreed to send a Party under Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> to make a head, and the King sent word to the Palatine to be present in Person, <hi>Dalbeer</hi> went along with him, with one more, and being in a Village in <hi>Germany,</hi> a Troop of fifty Horse met them. <hi>Dalbeer</hi> went to the Captain and said, we are in a Service, I will give you so many crowns to conduct us, which was done, and <hi>Dalbeer</hi> went along with him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> In conclusion, <hi>Iune the</hi> 13. it was Ordered upon the Question, that the excessive Power of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> is the cause of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Dangers to the King and Kingdom; And that this be added to the Remonstrance.</p>

And our fears and jealousies herein are not meerly conjectural, but arising out of such certain and visible effects, as may demonstrate a true and real Cause; For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the many good and wholesome Laws, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions made to prevent the increase of Popery within this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and notwithstanding your Majesties most gracious and satisfactory answer to the Petition of both Houses in that behalfe, presented to your Majesty at <hi>Oxford.</hi> We finde there hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> no good execution nor effect, but on the contrary (at which your Majesty out of the quick sense of your own religious heart cannot but be in the highest measure displeased) those of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion do finde extraordinary favors and respect in Court from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of great quality, and power whom they continually resort unto, and in particular to the Countesse of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who her self openly professing that Religion is a known favourer and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them that do the same, which we well hoped upon your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Answer to the aforsaid Petition at <hi>Oxford,</hi> should not have been permitted, nor that any of your Majesties Subjects of that religion justly to be suspected, should be entertained in the service of your Majesty, or your royal consort the Queen.

And as our fear concerning change or subversion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Religion is grounded upon the daily increase of Papists, the open and professed Enemies thereof for the Reasons formerly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. So are the hearts of your good Subjects no lesse perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when with sorrow they behold a daily growth and spreading of the faction of the Arminians, that being, as your Majesty well knows, but a cunning way to bring in Popery, and the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of those opinions, the common disturbers of the Protestant Churches, and incendiaries in those States wherein they have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> gotten any head, being Protestants in shew, but Iesuites in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which caused your Royal Father with so much pious wisdom, and ardent zeale, to endeavour the suppressing of them as well at home, as in the neighbour Countreys. And your gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty imitating his most worthy example, hath openly, and by your Proclamation declared your mislike of those persons, and of their opinions; who notwithstanding are much favoured and advanced, not wanting friends even of the Clergy near to your Majesty; namely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Doctor <hi>Neale</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Lawd,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> who are justly suspected to be unsound in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that way.

And further to encrease our feares concerning Innovation of Religion, we finde that there hath been no smal laboring to remove that which is the most powerful means
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:35668:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to strengthen and encrease our own Relgion, and to oppose both those, which is the diligent teaching and instruction of the people in the true knowledge, and worship of Almighty God. And therefore means have been sought out to depresse and discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance pious, and painful, and Orthodox Preachers, and how conformable soever, and peaceable in their disposition and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age they be, yet the preferment of such is opposed, and instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encouraged, they are molested with vexatious courses, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and hardly, permitted to Lecture. And in those places where are no constant preaching Ministers, whereby many of your good people (whose souls in this case we beseech your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to commiserate) are kept in ignorance, and are apt to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily seduced to error, and superstition: It doth not a little also encrease our dangers and fears this way, to understand the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable condition of your Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi>; where, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll, the Popish Religion is openly confessed, and practised in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> part thereof, Popish Iurisdiction being there generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised and avowed, Monasteries, Nunneries, and other supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Houses newly erected, re-edified and replenished with men and women of several Orders, and in a plentiful manner main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at <hi>Dublyn,</hi> and most of the great Towns, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the Kingdome; which of what ill consequence it may prove, if not seasonably repressed, we leave to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties wisdome to Iudge.

                        <p>And besides this feare of Innovation in Religion; we do in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> like faithful of charge of our duties, most humbly declare to your Majesty, that the hearts of your people are full of feare of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation and change of Government, and accordingly possessed with extreame griefe and sorrow; Yet in this point by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties late Answer to our Petition of Right touching our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:35668:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much comforted, and raised againe out of that sadnesse and discontent, which they generally had conceived throughout the whole Kingdome, for the undue courses which were the last year taken for raising of moneys by loanes, then which (whatever your Majesty hath been informed to the contrary) there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any moneys demanded, nor paid with greater grief and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral dislike of all your faithful Subjects; though many, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> partly out of feare, and partly out of other respects (yet most unwillingly) were drawn to yeeld to what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                        <p>The Billeting of Souldiers did much augment both their fears and grief, wherein likewise they finde much comfort upon your gracious Answer to our petition of Right, and to that we present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your Majesty concerning this particular. Yet we most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech your Majesty, that we may informe you, that the still <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> continuance, and late re-enforcing of those Souldiers, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their persons (many of them not being Natives of this Kingdome, nor of the same, but of an opposite Religion) the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of them upon the Sea Coast, where making head amongst themselves, they may unite with the Popish party at home if occasion serve, and joyne with an invading enemy to do extreame mischief; and that they are not yet dismissed, doth still minister cause of Iealousie in your loving Subjects; For that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Souldiers cannot be continued without exceeding great danger of the peace and safety of your Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The report of the strange and dangerous purpose of bringing in <hi>German</hi> Horse and Riders, would have turned our doubts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to despaire, and our feares into a certainty of confusion, had not your Majesties gracious message (for which we humbly give you thanks) comforted us, by the assurance of your Royal word, that they neither are, nor were intended by your Majesty, for any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> service in <hi>England</hi>; but that they were designed for some other forreigne employment. Yet the sight of the Privy Seale by which it seemeth they were to be leavied, the great summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which upon examinations we found to be paid for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, gave us just cause of feare, That much about the same time there was a Commission under the Great Seal granted unto the Lords, and others of the Privy Councel, to consider of other ways <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for raising of moneys, so particularly by impositions, gave as just cause to suspect, that whatsoever was your Majesties gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, yet there wanted not those that under some colourable pretence might secretly by this, as by other wayes, contrive to change the frame both of Religion and Government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by undermine the frame both of Religion and Government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by undermine the safety of your Majesty, and your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
                        <p>These men could not be ignorant that the bringing in of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for aid, hath been pernitious to most States, where they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> have been admitted, but to <hi>England</hi> fatal. We do blesse God that hath given your Majesty a wise understanding heart to discern of those courses, and that such power produceth nothing but weak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse, and calamity. And we beseech your Majesty to pardon the vehemencie of our expression, if in the Loyal and zealous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:35668:323" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we bear to your Majesty and your service, we are bold to declare to your Majesty, and the whole world, that we hold it far beneath the heart of any free English man to think that this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Nation should now stand in need of <hi>German</hi> Souldiers to defend their own King and kingdom.</p>
                        <p>But when we consider the course formerly mentioned; and these things tending to an apparent change of Government, the often breaches of Parliament, whereby your Majesty hath been depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the faithful Councel, and free Aids of your people, by taking off Tonnage and poundage, without graunt thereof by Act of Parliament, ever since the beginning of your Majesties Reigne to this present, The standing Commission granted to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to be general of an Army in the Land in the time of peace, the discharging of faithful and sufficient Officers and Ministers, some from Iudicial places, and others from the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and authorities which they formerly held in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> We cannot but at the sight of such an apparant desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as must necessarily follow these courses, out of the depth of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row lift up our cryes to heaven for help, and next under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our selves unto your sacred Majesty, who if you could hear so many thousands speaking together, do joyntly implore speedie help and Reformation,</p>
                        <p>And if your Majesty would be pleased to take a further view of the present state of your Realme, We do humbly pray you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> whether the miserable disasters, and ill successe that hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied all your late designes, and actions, particularly those of <hi>Cales,</hi> and the Isle of <hi>Ree,</hi> and the last expedition to <hi>Rochel,</hi> have not extreamlie wasted that stock of Honor that was left unto this kingdome, sometimes terrible to all other Nations, and now declining to contempt beneath the meanest.</p>

to particular persons for private Gain; Whereof we have seen a certificate, six Last sold sithence the 14th. of <hi>January</hi> last, and your Majesties store being unfurnished of powder, which by a contract made with <hi>Mr. Evelyn</hi> by advise of your Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to be supplyed monthly with twenty last at the rate of three pound, ten shillings, ten pence a Barrel; Your Majesty hath been forced to pay above seven pound a Barrel for powder to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> brought in from beyond Seas, for which purpose twelve thousand foure hundred pounds was impressed to <hi>Mr. Burlemack</hi> the last year, and that powder not so good as that by Contract your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty should have, by one third part; All which are most fearful and dangerous abuses. But what the poverty, weaknesse, and misery of your kingdome is now grown unto by decay of Trade, and destruction, and losse of Ships and Marriners, within these three years; we are almost afraid to declare; And could we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by any other means have been sure, that your Majesty should any other way have had a true Information thereof, We should have been doubtful to have made our weaknesse, and extreamity of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune in this kinde, to appear; But the importunate and most pitiful complaints from all the parts of the kingdome near adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sea in this kinde, would rend, as we think, the stoniest heart in the world with sorrow, and the sense we have of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable condition your Kingdome is in by reason thereof, especially, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for that we see no possible means (being now shortly to end this Session) how to help the same, adds such a weight of grief unto our sad thoughts, as we have not words to expresse it; But for your Majesties more exact information therein; We beseech you be pleased to peruse the Kalender of particulars which with the Remonstrance, we most humblie present unto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie.</p>
                        <p>One reason amongst many of this decay of Trade, and losse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ships and Marriners is: the not guarding of the narrow Seas, the regality whereof your Majestie hath now in a manner wholly lost, being that wherein a principal part of the Honor, and safety of this Kingdome heretofore consisted; And now having absolutely neglected it, the Town of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> doth so contiually rob and spoile your Subjects, that we can assure your Majesty (if some present and effectuall remedy be not forthwith provided) the whole Trade of this Kingdome, the shipping, marriners, and all belonging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thereunto, will be utterly lost and consumed. The principal cause of which evils and dangers, we conceive to be the excessive power of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the abuse of that power: And we humbly submit unto your Majesties excellent Wisdome, whether it be safe for your self, or your Kingdoms, that so great power as rests in him by Sea and Land, should be in the hands of any one Subject whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>And as it is not safe, so sure we are, it cannot be for your service, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it being impossible for one man to mannage so manie and weightie affaires of the Kingdome as he hath undertaken, besides the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary duties of those offices which he holds, some of which well performed, would require the time and industry of the ablest men both of Counsel and Action, that your whole Kingdome will
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:35668:324"/>
affoard, especially in these times of common danger.</p>
                        <p>And our humble desire is further, that your most excellent Majesty will be pleased to take into your Princely consideration, whether in respect the said Duke hath so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abused his power, it be safe for your Majesty and your Kingdom, to continue him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his great Offices, or in his place of nearness and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel about your sacred Person.</p>
                        <p>And thus in all humility, aiming at nothing but the honour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Almighty God, and the maintenance of his true Religion, the safety and happiness of your most excellent Majesty, and the preservation and prosperity of this Church and Common-wealth; We have endeavoured with faithfull hearts and intentions, and in discharge of the duty we owe to your Majesty and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to give your Majesty a true Representation of our present danger, and pressing calamities, which we humbly beseech your Majesty graciously to accept, and take the same to heart, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the safety and prosperity of your people, your greatest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and their love, your Richest Treasure. A rufull and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable spectacle we confess it must needs be, to behold those Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines in so fair an House, So many diseases, and almost every one of them deadly, in so strong and well tempered a body as this kingdom lately was. But yet we will not doubt, but that God hath reserved this Honor for your Majesty, to restore the safety and happiness thereof, as a work worthy so excellent a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Prince, for whose long life and true felicity, we daily pray, and that your fame and never dying Glory may be continued to all succeeding Generations.</p>

            <p>ON this very day the Duke signified unto the House, that he is informed that one Mr. <hi>Christopher Eukener</hi> of the House of Commons,<note place="margin">The Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to clear himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning some words.</note> hath affirmed that his Grace did speak these words at his own Table. <q>
                  <hi>Viz. Tush, it makes no matter what the Commons or Parliament doth, for without my leave and authority, they shall not be able to touch the hair of a Dogg.</hi>
               </q> And his Grace desired leave of their Lordships, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> might make his Protestation in the House of Commons concerning that Speech. And to move them, that he which spake it of him, being a Member of that House, might be commanded to justifie it, and his Grace heard to clear himself.</p>
            <p>Their Lordships considering thereof, ordered that the Duke shall be left to himself to do herein what he thinks best in the House of Commons. Whereupon the Duke gave their Lordships thanks, and protested up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his Honour, that he never had those words so much as in his thoughts. Tho which Protestation the Lords Commanded to be entred, that the Duke may make use thereof as need shall be.</p>
            <list>
               <head>The Duke also charged one Mr. <hi>Melvin</hi> for speaking words against him. Viz.</head>
               <item>First, That <hi>Melvin</hi> said, That the Dukes plot was, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be dissolved, and that the Duke and the King with a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Army of Horse and Foot, would war against the Commonalty, and that <hi>Scotland</hi> should assist him so that when war was amongst our selves, the Enemy should come in, for this Kingdom is already sold to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy by the Duke.</item>
               <item>2. That the Duke had a stronger Councel then the King, of which were certain Jesuites Scotishmen, and that they did sit in Councel every night, from one of the clock till three.</item>
               <item>3. That when the King had a purpose to do any thing of what conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> soever, the Duke could alter it.</item>
               <item>4. That when the Ordnance were shipt at St. <hi>Martins,</hi> the Duke caused the Souldiers to go on that they might be destroyed.</item>
               <item>5. That the Duke said he had an Army of 16000. Foot, and 1200. Horse.</item>
               <item>6. That King <hi>Iames</hi> his blood, and Marquess <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> with others cries out for vengeance to heaven.</item>
               <item>7. That he could not expect any thing but ruine of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</item>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <item>8. That Prince <hi>Henry</hi> was poisoned by Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> and he himself served with the same sauce, and that the Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> and others could say much to this.</item>
               <item>9. That he himself had a Cardinal to his Uncle or near Kinsman, whereby he had great intelligence.</item>

               <pb n="640" facs="tcp:35668:325"/>About the same time the Lord Keeper reported to the House of Lords what his Majesty said, touching the Commission of Excise. <hi>Viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Comis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for Excise cancelled.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That their Lordships had reason to be satisfied with what was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rightly told them by the Lords of the Councel, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was no more but a warrant of advice, which his Majesty knew to be agreeable to the time, and the manifold occasions then in hand, but now having a supply from the loves of his people, he esteems the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Commission useless; and therefore though he knows no cause why any jealousie should have risen thereby, yet at their desires he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it be cancelled, and he hath commanded me to bring both the Commission and Warrant to him, and it shall be cancelled in his own presence.</p>
            <p>The day following, the Lord Keeper reported that his Majesty had cancelled the Commission, and the Warrant for putting the Seal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and did there openly shew it, and a Message was sent to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Commons to shew them the said cancelled Commission and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>The Commons resume again the Debate upon the Bill of Tunnage and Poundage; Whereupon Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> said, Whereas the Kings Councel objected,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> concerning Tunnage and Poundage.</note> that 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> saith, It was Granted time out of mind to the King, I fear his Majesty is told so, and some body doth ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him so: But we may clear that, for not only 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> but also in the Statute of 1. <hi>Iac.</hi> the word time out of mind is, That whereas <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>H.</hi> 7. and other his Majesties Progenitors have had some Subsidy for the guarding of the Seas, And that there was never a King but had some Subsidie, in that sense it is indeed time out of mind. Yet is it a matter of free gift: for publique Bills the King saith, <hi>Le Roy se veult,</hi> for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of Right, <hi>Soit droit fait come est desire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Bill of Subsidies it is thus, the King heartily thanking the Subjects for their good wills; In all the Bills of Tunnage and Poundage is the very same Answer, save one, which was 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and but for that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> only mistake of the Clerk, it hath ever the same assent as the Bill of Subsidie.</p>
            <p>Upon this Debate it was Ordered that a Committee be appointed to draw a Remonstrance to his Majesty, of the peoples Rights, and of the undue taking of Tunnage and Poundage, and Impositions, without Act of Parliament, and to shew the Reasons why the House cannot in so short a time prepare that Bill.</p>

                        <p>And for the better manifestation thereof, may it please Your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Majestie to understand, that although Your Royal Predecessors the Kings of this Realm have often had such Subsidies, and Impositions Granted unto them, upon divers occasions, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the guarding of the Seas, and safeguard of Merchants; Yet the Subjects have been ever careful to use such Cautions, and Limitations in those Grants, as might prevent any claim to be made, that such Subsidies do proceed from duty, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> from the free gift of the Subject; And that they have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore used to limit a tune in such Grants, and for the most part but short, as for a year or two, and if it were continued longer, they have sometimes directed a certain space of Cessation, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, that so the right of the subject might be more evident. At other times it hath been Granted upon occasion of War, for a certain number of years, with <hi>Proviso,</hi> that if the War were ended in the mean time, then the Grant should cease; And of Course it hath been sequestred into the hands of some Subjects to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> imployed for the guarding of the Seas. And it is acknowledged by the ordinary Answers of your Majesties Predecessors in their Assent to the Bills of Subsidies of Tunnage and Poundage, that it is of the nature of other Subsidies, proceeding from the good will of the Subject; Uery few of your Predecessors

That although he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Commissions for collecting certain duties and Customes due by Law, yet he made no Commissions for receiving the Subsidie of Tunnage and Poundage, untill the same was granted unto him in Parliament. Since his time all the Kings and Queens of this Realm have had the like Grants for life by the free love and good will of the Subjects.

IT may seem strange that I came so suddenly to end this Session;<note place="margin">The K. ends this Session in person, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I give my assent to the Bills, I will tell you the cause, though I must avow, that I owe the account of my actions to God alone. It is known to every one, that a while ago the House of Commons gave me a Remonstrance, how acceptable, every man may judge, and for the merit of it, I will not call that in question, for I am sure no wise man can justifie it.</p>
                        <p>Now since I am truly informed, that a second Remonstrance is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> preparing for me to take away the profit of my Tunnage and Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, one of the chiefest maintenances of my Crown, by alleadging, I have given away my right thereto by my Answer to your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>This is so prejudicial unto me, that I am forced to end this Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion some few hours before I meant, being not willing to receive any more Remonstrances, to which I must give a harsh Answer. And since I see that even the House of Commons begins already to make false <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> constructions of what I granted in your Petition, least it be worse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in the Countrey, I will now make a Declaration concerning the true intent thereof.</p>
                        <p>The profession of both Houses in the time of hammering this Petition, was no ways to trench upon my Prerogative, saying they had neither intention or power to hurt it. Therefore it must needs be conceived, that I have granted no new, but only confirmed the Antient Liberties of my Subjects. Yet to shew the clearness of my intentions, that I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> neither repent, nor mean to recede from any thing I have promised you, I do here declare my self, that those things which have been done, whereby many have had some cause to expect the Liberties of the Subjects to be trenched upon, which indeed was the first and true ground of the Petition, shall not hereafter be drawn into example for your prejudice, and from time to time, in the word of a King, ye shal not have the like cause to complain. But as for Tonnage and Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, it is a thing I cannot want, and was never intended by you to ask, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> nor meant by me I am sure to grant.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, I command you all that are here to take notice of what I have spoken at this time, to be the true intent and meaning of what I granted you in your Petition; But especially, you my Lords the Judges, for you only under me belongs the interpretation of Laws, for none of the Houses of Parliament, either joint or separate, (what new Doctrine soever may be raised) have any Power either to make, or declare a Law without my consent.</p>

            <p>After this Speech ended, the Bill of Subsidie was delivered to the Speaker, standing at the Bar in the Lords House, who made a short Speech, and shewed, that it was the greatest gift that ever was given in so short a time. And so craving pardon for the errors of the House, and his own (which he knew to be very many) he desired the King to give his Royal Assent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="644" facs="tcp:35668:327"/>The King came so suddenly and unexpectedly to the House, that the Lords were not in their Robes, and the Commons had given no direction or Order for the Speaker to deliver the Bill of Subsidies, Neither was it brought down to the Commons House, as it was used, but the Bills were read, and the Bill for the Sabbath, for Recusants children, for Alehouse-keepers, for continuance of Statutes, for the Clergies Subsidie, for the Lay of Subsidie, all passed. But for the Bill for explanation of the Statutes 3. <hi>Iac.</hi> about Leases of Recusants Lands,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> The King said, that in this short time he had not time sufficient to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof, but he said he found many Errors therein, though the Title be faire, and if at the next meeting they would amend those Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, it should pass.</p>
            <p>Many private Bills passed also, and after they were all read, their Titles and the Kings Answer to them, which to the publique Bills was <hi>Le Roy le veult,</hi> to the private, <hi>Soit fait come il est desire.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> DOctor <hi>Manwarings</hi> Sermons intituled <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> were suppressed by Proclamation,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Manwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> Sermon supp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then a Proclamation came forth declaring the Kings pleasure for proceedings with Popish Recusants,<note place="margin">A Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This was seconded with another Proclamation commanding that diligent search be made for all Priests and Jesuites (particularly the Bishop <hi>Calcedon</hi>) and others that have taken Orders by authority from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>

which since have much troubled the quiet of the Church, he would take away occasion, by commanding all persons that had any of those Books in their hands to deliver them to the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, or if it be in either Universities to the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor thereof,<note place="margin">Preaching and Writing, <hi>pro</hi> &amp; <hi>con</hi> about un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> who were commanded to suppresse them.

            <p>But ere this Proclamation was published, the Books were for the most part vented and out of danger of seasure, and the suppressing of all writing and preaching in Answer thereunto, was (it seems by some) the thing mainly intended; for the several answers made by Doctor <hi>Featly,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Goad,</hi> in their parallels, by Master <hi>Burton,</hi> Master <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

            <p>And for bringing the Kings business to a speedy issue, it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, that the Bill of Tunnage and Poundage be prepared before the Parliament sit, in the same form as it passed to King <hi>Iames,</hi> adding words to give it from the first day of the Kings Reigne, and that the Bill be presented at the first sitting of the Parliament, and the Privy Councel of the House to declare that his Majesty caused it to be timely presented, to cut off all questions and debates, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> perswade them to a dispatch thereof, and that they will returne a speedy answer whether they will grant Tunnage and Poundage or not.</p>
            <p>They also took into consideration divers other matters, which

they apprehended the Parliament would insist upon, as proceeding to censure the actions of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> to accuse some of the Kings servants now living, upon common Fame, to cast personal asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in Parliament upon the Kings Councellors, or to charge them with giving ill counsel to the King, to handle questions touching mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, proper for his Majesty, and a Convocation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, to raise objections against his Majesties Speech the last day of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the last Session, as trenching upon the liberty of the Subject, in these and the like cases the Privy Councel of the House were to be instructed how to demean themselves, and to advise all fair and possible means to have a good agreement between his Majesty and his people.

This shews <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that lower natures being backt with the higher, increase in courage and strength; and certainly man being backt with omnipotency, is a kind of omnipotency, all things are possible to him that believeth, and where all things are possible; there is a kind of omnipotence; wherefore let us now by the unanimous consent and resolution of us all, make a vow and covenant, henceforth to hold fast, I say to hold fast, our God, and our Religion; And then may we from henceforth certainly expect prosperity on this Kingdom and Nation, and to this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Covenant let every man say, Amen.</p>

               <p>There is a jealousie conceived, as if we meant to dispute in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, it is our profession, this is not to be disputed, it is not in the Parliament to make a new Religion, nor I hope shall it be in any to alter the body of the truth, which we now professe, I must confess <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> amongst all those fears we have contracted, there ariseth to me not one of the least dangers in the Declaration that is made and publisht in his Majesties name concerning disputing and preaching, let not this my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bear the least suspition or jealousie of his Majesty, for if there be any misprision or Error, I hope it is those Ministers about him, which
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:35668:335"/>
not only he, but all Princes are subject unto, and Princes no doubt are subject to mis-informations, and many actions may be intitled to their Names, when it is not done by themselves. <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of <hi>Asia</hi> sent his Letters and missives to several Provinces, that if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any dispatches in his name, not agreeable to justice, <hi>Ignoto se litteras esse scriptas ideo<expan>

And now to the particular in the Declaration, we see what is said of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arminianism,</hi> our Faith and Religion is in danger by it, for like an Inundation it doth break in at once upon us. It is said, if there be any difference in Opinion concerning the season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able interpretation of the 39.

Priests; to which Mr. Secretary <hi>Cook</hi> replyed, the K. being merciful in case of blood, gave direction for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Reprieving the condemned Priest, but the House not willing to let this pass, appointed certain of their Members to go to the Lord chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and the rest of the Judges, who were there present at the Trial, to know why the Papers and Evidences which Mr. <hi>Long</hi> had to produce, were not made use of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="667" facs="tcp:35668:339"/>The Committee appointed to examine the Atturny-General, report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this answer:<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Robert Heath</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Priests.</note>
               <q>
                  <p>I did receive <hi>(said the Atturny)</hi> order touching some Persons taken in <hi>Clarkenwel,</hi> conceived to be Priests, from the Council-Board, and for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer myself to the Order.</p>
                  <p>And I conceive I did follow the directions of that Order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> I did my self cause them to be sent for from the several prisons where they were formerly committed, and I committed them all to <hi>Newgate,</hi> as the Order from the Council-Board directed; and I gave directions for Indictments to be drawn against them, as for being Priests; and I sent for, and conferred with the witnesses, and took their Informations: and I sent for <hi>Mr. Long</hi> who was formerly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that business, as I was advised to do by <hi>Mr. Secretary Cook,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him to take special care thereof at the Sessions. And I did not conceive, that by the Order I was directed to go thither my self; but if I had been so dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and had so conceived it, I should not have declined the service. I know not, nor never heard of any Lands conveyed to the use of these persons, or of any foundation there; but there was some mention made thereof in some of the papers delivered to me by <hi>Mr. Secretary,</hi> but so generally, as I know not how to enquire thereof; but I did take care to intitle the King to the goods, as the special directions to me was by the Order of the Board; and the Indictment failed to be found against all but one: and I gave warrant to the Treasurers remembrancer of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, for a special commission to that purpose; and I advised with <hi>Mr. Long,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> who were sit Commissioners for that purpose; and after with <hi>Mr. Scrivener:</hi> and a Commission was granted to Gentlemen of very good quality, and an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is found and returned accordingly, whereby the King is intitled to the goods.</p>
                  <p>I had warrant from his Majesty to bayl them: but for the manner of that, I must crave leave to acquaint the King therewith, before I answer any further.</p>
                  <p>I understood that an Indictment was preferred against three of them for Treason, and I did direct <hi>Mr. Long,</hi> that if the Indictment should not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for Treason, yet to tender them and all the rest the Oath of Allegeance, to bring them within the Kings mercy, upon a Premunire, if they should refuse the Oath: and I understood the Oath was ministred to them accordingly at that Sessions; and I understood after, that the Indictment was found against one of them onely to be a Priest, and that the other were quit. Therefore receiving an express commandment from the King for the bayling of them, I did conceive they were baylable, which otherwise of my self I would not have done: the Bonds I took, and keep them my self, for the surety, I refer my self to the bond, and understand that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> some of them were house-keepers in the Town.</p>
                  <p>I gave directions for Indictments to be drawn against them, but I gave no special directions, whether it should be drawn as against Iesuits or Priests, but left that to the care of <hi>Mr. Long;</hi> and did not then conceive there was any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the substance of the Indictment for Treason between Priests and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits.</p>
                  <p>I can give no special reason why I rather bound them to appear at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Table then at the Sessions, but only this, because I received my first directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> from the Council-Board.</p>
                  <p>When the Sessions was past, I did enquire of <hi>Mr. Long</hi> what was the success of these Indictments: who informed me, that one only was found guilty of being a Priest; and thereupon I gave order for the Commission before mentioned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of their goods.</p>

the 20 day of <hi>January</hi> last past; sithence which time the same hath been continued. And although in this time by the malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent dispositions of some ill affected persons of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, We have had sundry Iust Causes of offence and dislike of their proceedings; yet We resolved with patience to trie the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, which we the rather did, for that We found in that House a great number of sober and grave Persons, well-affected to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and Government, and desirous to preserve unity and peace in all parts of Our Kingdom. And therefore, having on the <hi>five</hi> and <hi>twentieth</hi> day of <hi>February</hi> last, by the uniform advice of our Privy-Council, caused both Houses to be adiourned until this present day, hoping in the mean time, that a better and more right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing might be begotten between Us and the Members of that House, whereby this <hi>Parliament</hi> might have a happy end and issue.</p>
                        <p>And for the same intent, We did again this day command the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> like Adiournment to be made, until the <hi>tenth</hi> day of this <hi>Month</hi>: It hath so happened by the disobedient and seditious carriage of those said ill affected persons of the House of Commons, That We, and Our Regal Authority and Commandment, have been so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemned, as our Kingly Office cannot bear, nor any former age can paralel.

            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5 <hi>Caroli. Anno</hi> 1629.</note>WHereupon all the Judges met at <hi>Sergeants-Inne</hi> by command from his Majesty, where Mr. <hi>Atturney</hi> proposed certain Questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the offences of some of the Parliament-men committed to the Tower, and other prisons: at which time one Question was proposed and resolved,<note place="margin">Questions propounded to the Judges concerning the imprisoned Members.</note> 
               <hi>viz. That the Statute of</hi> 4 H. 8.8. <hi>intituled,</hi> An Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
               <hi>Richard Strode, was a particular Act of a Parliament, and extended onely to</hi> Richard Strode, <hi>and to those persons that had joyned with him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Bill to the House of Commons concerning Tynners; And although the Act be private, and extendeth to them alone, yet it was no more then all other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-men by priviledge of house ought to have,</hi> viz. <hi>Freedom of speech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:35668:342"/>
those matters debated in Parliament by a Parliamentary course.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rest of the Questions Mr. <hi>Atturney</hi> was wished to set down in writing against another day.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Munday</hi> following, all the Judges met again, and then Mr. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney</hi> proposed these Questions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether if any Subject hath received probable Information of any Treason or treacherous attempt or intention against the King or State, that Subject ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not to make known to the King, or his Majesties Commissioners, when thereunto he shall be required, what Information he hath received, and the grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; to the end, the King being truly informed, may prevent the danger? And if the said Subject in such Case shall refuse to be examined, or to answer the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions which shall be demanded of him, for further inquiry and discovery of the truth, whether it be not a high contempt in him, punishable in the Star-Chamber, as an offence against the general Iustice and Government of the Kingdom?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The resolution and answer of all the Justices, That it is an offence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> punishable as aforesaid, so that this do not concern himself, but another, nor draw him to danger of Treason or contempt by his answer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether it be a good answer or excuse, being thus interrogated, and refusing to answer, to say,</hi> That he was a Parliament-man when he received this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and that he spake thereof in the Parliament-house; and therefore the Parliament being now ended, he refused to answer to any such Questions but in the Parliament-house, and not in any other place?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To this the Judges by advise privately to Mr. <hi>Atturney,</hi> gave this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Answer,
<q>That this excuse being in Nature of a Plea, and an errour in judgement, was not punishable until he were over-ruled in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner to make another answer; and whether the party were brought in <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> or by Information, for this Plea he was not to be punished.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether a Parliament-man committing an offence against the King or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil not in a Parliament way, might after the Parliament ended, he punished or not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> All the Judges <hi>una voce</hi> answered, He might, if he be not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for it in Parliament; for the Parliament shall not give priviledge to any <hi>contra morem Parliamentarium,</hi> to exceed the bounds and limits of his place &amp; duty. And all agreed, That regularly he cannot be compelled out of Parliament to answer things done in Parliament in a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary course; but it is otherwise where things are done exorbitantly, for those are not the Acts of a Court.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Whether if one Parliament-man alone shall resolve, or two or three shall covertly conspire to raise false slanders and rumours against the Lords of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Council and Iudges, not with intent to question them in a Legal course, or in a Parliamentary way, but to blast them, and to bring them to hatred of the people, and the Government in contempt, be punishable in the Star-Chamber after the Parliament is ended?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The Judges resolve that the same was punishable out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as an offence exorbitant committed in Parliament, beyond the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and besides the duty of a Parliament-man.</p>
            <p>There was another Question put by Mr. <hi>Atturney,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <hi>Whether if a man in Parliament, by way of digression, and not upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion arising concerning the same in Parliament, shall say, The Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and the Judges had agreed to trample upon the Liberty of the Subject, and the priviledges of Parliament, he were punishable or not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Judges desired to be spared to make any answer thereunto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it concerned themselves in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="674" facs="tcp:35668:343"/>The next day Mr. Atturny put the Judges another Case.</p>
            <p>It is demanded of a Parliament-man, being called <hi>Ore tenus</hi> before the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> being charged that he did not submit himself to examination for such things as did concern the King and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State, and were affirmed to be done by a third person, and not by himself, if he confess his hand to that refusal, and make his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and plead because he had priviledg of Parliament;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Court will not over-rule this plea as erronious, and that he ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to make a further answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note>It is the justest way for the King and the party not to proceed <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> because it being a point in Law, it is fit to hear Counsel before it be over-ruled; and upon an <hi>Ore tenus</hi> by the Rules of <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> Counsel ought not to be admitted; and that it would not be for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the King, nor the safety of the subject to proceed in that manner.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Stroud</hi> and Mr. <hi>Long</hi> brought upon a <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi>

And further: so it is, may it please your most excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that when your Majesty, upon the twenty fifth day of <hi>February,</hi> had by Sir <hi>Iohn Finch,</hi> Knight, then Speaker of the said house of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, signified your Royal pleasure to the said house, that the said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> house of Commons should be instantly adjourned until the second day of <hi>March</hi> then following, he the said Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot,</hi> and <hi>Denzil Holles</hi> Esquire, <hi>Benjamin Valantine</hi> Gent. <hi>Walter Longe</hi> Esquire, <hi>William Corriton</hi> Esquire, <hi>William Strode</hi> Esquire, <hi>Iohn Selden</hi> Esquire, Sir <hi>Miles Hobert,</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter Hayman,</hi> Knights, all Members at that time of the said Commons house, conceiving with themselves that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, being justly provoked thereto, would speedily dissolve that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; They the said Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot, Denzil Holles, Benjamin Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Walter Longe, William Corriton, William Strode, Iohn Selden,</hi> Sir <hi>Miles Hobert,</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter Hayman,</hi> and every of them, by unlawful Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracie and Combination between them in that behalf before had, did malitiously resolve, agree and conspire how and by what means before that Parliament should be dissolved, they might raise such false and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous rumours against your Majesties Government, and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours of Estate attending your person, that thereby as much as in them lyeth, they might disturb the happy Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by and under your Majesty, interrupt the course of traffique and trade, discourage your Merchants, and raise Jealousies and Suspitions in the hearts of your people, that the Sincerity of the true Religion professed and established in this Kingdom was neglected: and in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this their Resolution and Confidence aforesaid, the said Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot,</hi> with the privitie and consent of the said <hi>Denzil Holles,</hi> and all other the said confederates, did prepare a paper or writing, wherein he had written, or caused to be written, divers false and scandalous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Assertions touching your Majesties Government, and touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of divers of your Privy-Council, which he and they resolved, and conspired, and agreed, should be delivered into the said house of Commons, and there publickly read, to the wicked and seditious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purposes aforesaid, and not with any purpose or opinion that those things that were therein contained, if they, or any of them had been true, as indeed they were not, should or could be at that time entertained, or pursued in any legal or Parliamentary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> way, but meerly and onely to express and vent his and their own Malice and Dis-affection of your Majesty and your happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Your Royal pleasure in that behalf, for a present adjournment of the House, the greatest number of the Members of that House, in their duty and Allegeance unto your Majesty, were willing to have given a ready Obedience, as the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the Lords House, upon the very same day, upon the like signification made unto them of your Majesties pleasure, by your Lord Keeper of your Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> the Speaker of that House, had done: yet so it is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> May it please your most Excellent Majesty, That the said Sir <hi>Iohn Elly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,</hi> for the satisfying of his own malice, and disloyal affections to your Majesty, and by the confederacy and agreement aforesaid, and in a high contempt and disobedience unto your Majesties command afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and with set purpose to oppose your Majesties said command, did stand up, and several times offered to speak.

<q>We have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a short Declaration of our intentions, which I hope shall agree with the honour of the House</q>, and the Justice of the King: and with that he threw down a paper into the floor of the said House, desiring it might be read: and the said <hi>Denzil Holles, Benj. Valentine,</hi> and all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> other the Confederates aforesaid, in disobedience and high contempt of your Majesties said command, called and cryed out to have the same paper read.
But some others of the House spake to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it might not be read; and the House thereupon, by reason of the disorderly behaviour of the said Confederates, was much troubled, many pressing violently and tumultuously to have the said paper read, and others dutifully and obediently urging the contrary, to the great disquiet and discomfort of many well-affected Members of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> House. And the said <hi>William Corriton</hi> in this distemper demeaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so passionately and violently, that he then and there violently, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly, and unlawfully, assaulted and stroke <hi>Winterton,</hi> Gent. then being a Member of the said House: and divers of the Members of the said House being then desirous, and endeavoring to have gone out of the said House, the said Sir <hi>Miles Hobert</hi> did of his own head, lock the door of the said House, and kept the key thereof, and imprisoned the Members of the said House, being then in the said House against their wills, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that none of them could go out. And the said <hi>William Strode,</hi> for the further expressing of his malignity and undutifulness towards your Majesty, and in pursuance of the agreement and confederacy aforesaid, openly moved, and with much earnestness urged, that the said paper or declaration might be first read, to the end (as he then in great contempt of your Royal Majestie said) that we, meaning the Members of the
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:35668:345"/>
house, may not be turned off like scattered sheep, and sent home as we were last Sessions, with a scorn put upon us in print; meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the words which your Majesty in your own Person spake at the ending of the last Session, and caused the same to be printed: and the said <hi>Stroud</hi> in a very disorderly manner further moved, That all those who would have the said paper read, should stand up; which divers of them thereupon did do accordingly, and he the said <hi>Stroud</hi> amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did stand up; and in this heat of contention and height of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by the confederacy aforesaid to have the said paper read, the said Sir <hi>Peter Hayman</hi> with rough and reproachful words, reproved the said Speaker for being constant and resolute in his obedience to your Majesty, in not putting the reading of the said paper to the Question, as by all the said Confederates, with many Reasons and Arguments he was urged to do: and the said Sir <hi>Peter Hayman</hi> then further said, That the said Speaker was made an Instrument to cut up the Liberty of the Subjects by the roots. But when by no means the said Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> would be drawn to transgress your Majesties Royal command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, and lest the said paper should not be read, the said <hi>Iohn Selden</hi> moved, that the Clerk of the said House might read the same: and when the said <hi>Sir John Ellyot</hi> found that he and his Confederates aforesaid, could not procure the said paper to be read; he, the said Sir <hi>Iohn Ellyot,</hi> to the end he might not lose that opportunity to vent and publish those malitious and seditious Resolutions which he and his Confederates had collected, and prepared as aforesaid, took back the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> said paper again, and then immediately in the said house, said, <q>
                              <hi>I shall non express that by Tongue, which this paper should have done</hi>
                           </q>; and then spake these words.
<q>The miserable condition we are in, both in matters of Religion and Policy, makes me look with a tender eye both to the Person of the King, and to the Subjects:</q>
and then speaking of them whom he intended to be ill Instruments in this State, at whom he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally aimed, he said,
<q>There are amongst them some Prelates of the Church, the great Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> and his fellows; it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> what they have done to cast an aspersion upon the honor, and piety, and goodness of the King. These are not all, but it is extended to some others, who I fear in guilt of Conscience of their own desert, do joyn their power with that Bishop and the rest, to draw his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty into a jealousie of the Parliament; amongst them I shall not fear to name the great Lord Treasurer, in whose person I fear is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted all that which we suffer. If we look into Religion or Policy, I find him building upon the ground laid by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his great Master; from him I fear, came those ill Counsels which contracted that unhappy conclusion of the last session of Parliament; I find that not only in the affections of his heart, but also in relation to him; and I doubt not to fix it indubitably upon him: and so from the power and greatness of him, comes the danger of our Religion. For Policy, in that great Question of Tunnage and Poundage, the interest which is pretended to be the Kings, is but the interest of that person, to undermine the Policy of this Government, and thereby to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> weaken the Kingdom, while he invites strangers to come in to drive out Trade, or at least our Merchants to trade in strangers bottoms, which is as dangerous. Therefore it is fit to be declared by us, that all that we suffer, is the effect of new counsels, to the ruine of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State; and to make a protestation against all those men,
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:35668:345"/>
whether greater or subordinate, that they shall all be declared as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Enemies to the King and Kingdom, that will perswade the King to take Tunnage and Poundage without grant of Parliament; and that if any Merchants shall willingly pay those Duties without consent of Parliament, they shall be declared as Accessaries to the rest.</q>
Which Words of the said Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot,</hi> were by him uttered as aforesaid, falsly, and malitiously, and seditiously, out of the wickedness of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> own affections towards your Majesty, and your gratious and religious Government, and by the Confederacie, Agreement, and Privity of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And further: so it is, may it please your most excellent Majesty, That the disobedience of the said Confederates was then grown to that height, that when <hi>Edward Grimston,</hi> the Serjeant at Arms then attending the Speaker of that house, was sent for by your Majestie, personally to attend your Highness, and the same was made known in the said house, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the said Confederates notwithstanding at that time forcibly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully kept the said <hi>Edward Grimston</hi> locked up in the said house, and would not suffer him to go out of the house to attend your Majesty: and when also on the same day <hi>Iames Maxwel</hi> Esquire, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Usher of the Black Rod, was sent from your Majesty to the said Commons house with a message immediately from your Majesties

                              </note> it was voted and declared by the honourable house of Commons, That whosoever shall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel or advise the taking or levying of the Subsidie of Tonnage and Poundage, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> granted by Parliament, or shall be any Actor or Instrument therein, shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an Innovator in the Government, and a capital Enemy to the Kingdom and Commonwealth; and if any Merchant or person whatsoever shall voluntarily yeild or pay the said Subsidie of Tonnage and Poundage, not being granted by Parliament, they shall likewise be reputed Betrayers of the Liberties of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Enemies to the same, as may appear by the said Order upon Record.</p>
                           <p>In submission and obedience whereunto, the Petitioner first opposed and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the payment of Tonnage and Poundage (until they were setled by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and all other illegal Taxes; for which submission and obedience, in the years <hi>1628,</hi> and <hi>1629,</hi> the Petitioner had <hi>7060</hi> pounds of his Goods wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taken and detained from him by the late Kings Officers and Farmers of the Custome-house of <hi>London</hi> for pretended duties, and a heavy Sentence and Fine in the Star-Chamber, which was imposed upon him in the year <hi>1629.</hi> besides which losses, the Petitioner further suffered in his person by six whole years impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment in the Fleet, for not submitting to that Sentence and Fine: and in the year <hi>1637,</hi> nine moneths imprisonment in Newgate for withstanding ship-money: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by which losses and imprisonments, the Petitioner was put by the exercise of his calling, and was wounded in his credit and reputation.</p>
                           <p>Which sufferings the honourable house of Commons (upon the Petioners complaint in the year <hi>1640</hi>) taking into their grave considerations, were pleased to refer the examination thereof to a Committee of <hi>50</hi> Members, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were included the Committee for the Navy and Customs; who being well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the truth thereof, by oath, and other good sufficient proofs upon Record, drew up their Report, That the Petitioner ought then to have <hi>13680</hi> pounds in part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of Reparation, leaving the rest of those Reparations to the further judgement of the honourable House, as by the annexed Copy of that report may further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                           <p>In pursuit of which report, the Parliament then levied and received from the old Farmers and Officers of the Customs <hi>50</hi> thousand pounds for wrongs and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses done to the Petitioner (chiefly) and other Merchants, intending first to
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:35668:350" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give to the Petitioner satisfaction out of the same, because he was the first man that opposed the pretended duties, and the greatest sufferer.</p>
                           <p>Whereupon, in the year <hi>1642.</hi> the Petitioner was chosen Alderman, and in the year <hi>1644.</hi> Sheriff of the City of <hi>London:</hi> which places the Petitioner earnestly endeavoured to shun; but such were the earnest importunities, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive encouragements of divers Members of the honourable House, (who then desired to have the Petitioner in place of trust, for his former service to the Commonwealth) that the Petitioner was constrained to accept not onely of the place of Alderman, but further underwent the office and charge of Sheriff of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which stood the Petitioner in <hi>4000</hi> pounds that year.</p>
                           <p>But notwithstanding the aforesaid promises and intents of the Parliament to give the Petitioner satisfaction, such were the great compulsive exigents, and urgent necessities of those times, caused by the publick distractions, that the said monies were converted to the publick use; therefore the Parliament desired the Petitioner to have a little patience, promising him speedy satisfaction as well for the forbearance as for the principal debt: but the distractions continuing, and the Petitioner had neither interest nor any part of his principal, the Parliament in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the year <hi>1648</hi> in part of satisfaction, setled the Petitioner in the office of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor and Check in the Custom-house of <hi>London,</hi> then worth at least <hi>600</hi> pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> but the Petitioner having enjoyed that place onely eight months, was causlesly outed by sinister information of intruders, who have enjoyed that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and divided the profit thereof between them ever since that intrusion.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, the late King by Privy Seal, owes to the Petitioners wife (who is the Relict of Mr. <hi>Thomas Ferrer</hi>) for Linen Cloth <hi>5000</hi> pounds, and for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> money lent <hi>1200</hi> pounds, for which she was assigned satisfaction out of the Customs of Tobacco; besides, she was further assigned out of Sir <hi>Thomas Dawes</hi> Office <hi>100</hi> marks <hi>per annum:</hi> all which debts likewise lie wholly unsatisfied, to the Petitioners great prejudice.</p>
                           <p>Besides the aforesaid losses, hinderances, expences, sufferings, and forbearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the profit of the said Office, the Petitioner from time to time hath laid out himself for the common good, in acting, lending, spending, (and serving) when others refused; exposed himself to that eminent danger at <hi>Branford,</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> leading out a Troop of Horse for the Priviledges, Liberties and Rights of the City of <hi>London</hi> and Commonwealth, insomuch, that thereby, and for want of his satisfaction aforesaid, the Petitioner having consumed his Estate, hath been constrained to sell and morgage some part of his Lands to pay Creditors, and to maintain his Family, having a Wife and nine Children; and is likely to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for obeying the Parliaments Commands, unless by the justice and commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this honourable Assembly he be speedily relieved and righted, for that ever since the said reported sum, the Petitioner from time to time hath made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his humble addresses to the supreme powers for the time being, for satisfaction thereof; and to be restored to the said Office, but could not prevaile.</p>
                           <p>The Petitioner therefore humbly prays, That he may not perish for acting for the publick good according to the Declaration of Parliament, but that now after 26 years suffering, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of twelve years in fruitless and wearisome waitings, this honourable Assembly would now be pleased to take the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> sufferings of the Petitioner into their grave consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, for some speedy course for the Petitioners satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to pay his Debts, and redeem his Lands, by ordering him the one moyety of his Debt in ready money out of the dayly customs of <hi>London,</hi> (from whence his first losses and

            <p>
               <hi>Trinity,</hi> 5. <hi>Car. Banco Regis.</hi> The first day of this Term upon a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to Sir <hi>Allen Apsley</hi> the Lieutenant of the Tower,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> brought upon a <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi>
               </note> to bring here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the body of <hi>Iohn Selden</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> with the cause of Detencer: he returned the same cause as was in Mr. <hi>Stroods</hi> Case. And Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> of the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi> of Counsel with Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> moved, that the Return was insufficient in substance; therefore pray'd, that he might be bayled: and said, that it was a matter of great consequence both to the Crown of the King, and to the Liberty of the Subject. But as for the difficulty of Law contained in it, he said (under favour) the Case cannot be said <hi>Grand.</hi> And so proceeded to his Argument (which for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> before mentioned, we have postponed) and concluded, that the Prisoner ought to be bailed.</p>
            <p>The same day Sir <hi>Miles Hubbord, Benjamin Valentine, Denzil Holles,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> were at the Bar upon the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> directed to several Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And their Counsel were ready at the Bar to have argued the Case for them also. But because the same Return was made for them as for Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> they all Declared, they would rely on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by Mr. <hi>Littleton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Some few days after, <hi>Sir Robert Heath</hi> the Kings Atturney General argued, that this Return was good; and that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and the rest of the parties ought not to be bailed; and that within the Return there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears good cause of their commitment, and of their detaining also. He said, The Case is great in expectation &amp; consequence, and concerns the Liberty of the Subject on one part, whereof the Argument is plausible; and on the other part it concerns the safety and Soveraignty of the King, which (he said) is a thing of greater weight; and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of both pertains to you the Judges, without flighting the one, or too much elevating the other: and so proceeded to his Argument (of which more at large hereafter) and concluded, that the Prisoners ought to be remanded.</p>
            <p>When the Court was ready to have delivered their opinions in this great business, the Prisoners were not brought to the Bar according to
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:35668:351"/>
the Rule of the Court. Therefore Proclamation was made, for the keepers of the several Prisons to bring in their Prisoners; but none of them appeared, but the Marshal of the Kings Bench: who informed the Court, that Mr. <hi>Strood</hi> who was in his custody, was removed ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday, and put in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> by the Kings own warrant; and so it was done with the other Prisoners, for each of them was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of his prison in which he was before. But notwithstanding, it was pray'd by the Counsel for the Prisoners, that the Court would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their opinion as to the matter in Law: but the Court refused to do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that, because it was to no purpose; for the Prisoners being absent, they could not be bailed, delivered, or remanded.</p>
            <p>The evening before, there came a Letter to the Judges of this Court from the King himself, informing the Court with the Reasons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prisoners were not suffered to come at the day appointed for the resolution of the Judges.

                  <p>we Greet you well: Whereas by our special command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we have lately removed <hi>Sir Miles Hubard, Walter Long,</hi> and <hi>William Stroud</hi> from the several prisons where they were formerly committed, and have now sent them to our Tower of <hi>London;</hi> understanding there are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious constructions made thereof, according to the several apprehensions of those who discourse of it, as if we had done it to decline the course of Iustice: We have therefore thought fit to let you know the true Reason and occasion thereof; as also, why we commanded, those and the other Prisoners should not come before you the last day: We (having heard how most of them a while since did carry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> themselves insolently and unmannerly both towards us and your Lordships) were and are very sensible thereof; and though we hear your selves gave them some admonition for that miscariage, yet we could not but resent our Honour, and the Honour of so great a Court of Iustice so far, as to let the world know how much we dislike the same: And having understood that your Lordships and the rest of our Iudges and Barons of our Court of Common Pleas and Exchequer (whose advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and judgments we have desired in this great business, so much concerning our Government) have not yet resolved the main Question, we did not think the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> presence of those Prisoners necessary; and until we should find their temper and discretions to be such as may deserve it, we were not willing to afford them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Nevertheless, the respect we bear to the proceedings of that Court, hath caused us to give way, that <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Valentine</hi> should attend you tomorrow, they being sufficient to appear before you, since you cannot as yet give any resolute opinion in the main point in Question.</p>

Divers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> other matters he proposed to the said Judges by way of advice, and seemed well contented with what they answered, though it was not to his minde; which was, That the offences were not capital, and that by the Law the prisoners ought to be bailed, giving security to the good behaviour: whereupon the King told them, That he would never be offended with his Judges, so they dealt plainly with him, and did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer him by Oracles and Riddles: both these Judges did at that time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> what good office they could to bring the King on to heal this breach.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> notwithstanding his said Oath taken to remain in his proper person, within his Bayliffwick, unless he were licensed by his Majestie, he the said Defendant did make his personal appearance in the Commons house of Parliament, at the City of <hi>Westminster</hi> in the County of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesex,</hi> and did, during the most part of the said Parliament, continue in and about the City of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and did attend in the Parliament as a Citizen for the said City of <hi>Bath:</hi> during all which time he likewise was and continued high Sheriff for the said County of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Wilts,</hi> and had no particular license from his Majesty to the contrary. Upon consideration whereof, as also of the the particular causes and reasons of the Defendants Demurrer and Plea formerly exhibited unto the said Information, the benefit whereof was by order of the Court reserved unto the Defendant to be debated and considered of at the hearing of this cause, and of divers other matters now urged for the Defendant, both to have justified his the said Defendants atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in Parliament, and his not residence in person in the County <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whereof he was then Sheriff; and amongst other things, that it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonged to the house of Parliament to judge of the justness or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justness of the said Election; and upon grave and mature consideration thereof had and taken by the Court, their Lordships did not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the said Demurrer and Plea, and other the Arguments and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons used by the Defendant and his Council to be of no weight or strength, but also to be in opposition and derogation of the Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Court; the reasons moved and urged for the Defendants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> or justification being clearly answered, and the charges of the Information made good by Mr. <hi>Atturney General,</hi> and others of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Counsel learned. And therefore the whole Court were clear of opinion, and did so declare,
<q>That the said Defendant, who at that time, as high Sheriff, had the custody and charge of the County of <hi>Wilts</hi> committed unto him by his Majesty, and had taken his Oath
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:35668:354"/>
according to the Law to abide in his proper person within his Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffwick during all the time of his Sheriffwick as aforesaid, and whose trust and imployment did require his personal attendance in the said Countie, had not onely committed a great offence in violating the said Oath so by him taken, but also a great misdemeanor in breach of the trust committed unto him by his Majesty, and in contempt of his Majesties pleasure signified unto him by and under his Highness great Seal, when he granted unto him the said Office of Sheriffwick <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> aforesaid.</q>
For which said several great Offences in breach of his said Oath, neglect of the trust and duty of his Office, and the great and high contempt of his Majesty, their Lordships did hold the said Defendant worthy the sentence of the Court; the rather, to the end that by this example the Sheriffs of all other Counties may be deterred from committing the like offences hereafter, and may take notice that their personal residence and attendance is required within their Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffwicks during the time of their Sheriffwick. The Court therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thought fit, ordered, adjudged, and decreed, That the said Defendant should stand and be committed to the prison of the Tower, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main during his Majesties pleasure, and also pay a Fine of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Marks to his Majesties use; and further, make his humble submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and acknowledgement of his offence both in the Court of Star-Chamber, and to his Majesty, before his thence enlargment.</p>

               <note place="margin">Arguments concerning Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot.</hi>
               </note>The same Term Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> argued in the kings Bench for Sir <hi>Iohn <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Elliot</hi> against the Information preferred against him (amongst others) by Sir <hi>Robert Heath</hi> the kings Atturney General; and the same day the Atturney General argued in maintenance of the said Information: the Judges also the same day spake briefly to the Case, and agreed with one Voyce, <q>
                  <hi>That the Court, as this Case is, shall have Jurisdiction, although that these offences were committed in Parliament, and that the imprisoned Members ought to answer</hi>

<q>
                  <hi>That though this Question be now newly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet it is an ancient Question with him; for it had been in his thoughts these eighteen yeers. For this Information there are three Questions in it:</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>1.</hi> Whether the matters informed be true or false: and this ought to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Iury or Demurrer.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>2.</hi> When the matters of the Information are found or confessed to be true, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Information be good in substance.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>3.</hi> Admit that the offences are truly charged, if this Court hath power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them: and that is the sole Question of this day.</item>
                  </list>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And it seems to me, that of these offences, although committed in Parliament, this Court shall have jurisdiction to punish them. The Plea of the Defendents here to the jurisdiction being concluded with a Demurrer, is not peremptory unto them, although it be adjudged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> against them; but if the Plea be pleaded to the jurisdiction which is found against the Defendant by verdict, this is peremptory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="697" facs="tcp:35668:354"/>In the discussion of this point, I decline these Questions:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>If the matter be voted in Parliament, when it is finished, it can be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and examined in another Court.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>If the matter be commenced in Parliament, and that ended, if afterward it may be Questioned in another Court.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I question not these Matters, but I hold, That an Offence committed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> criminally in Parliament, may be questioned elsewhere, as in this Court; and that for these Reasons:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Quia interest Reipublicae ut malesicia non maneant impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita: <hi>and there ought to be a fresh punishment of them. Parliaments are called at the Kings pleasure, and the King is not compellible to call his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if before the next Parliament, the party offending, or the witnesses die, then there will be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Secondly, <hi>The Parliament is no constant Court; every Parliament mostly consists of several men, and by consequence they cannot take notice of matters done in the foregoing Parliament; and there they do not examine by oath, unless it be in Chancery, as it is used of late time.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, <hi>The Parliament cannot send Process to make the offenders to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the next Parliament; and being at large, if they hear a noise of a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, they will</hi> fugam facere, <hi>and so prevent their punishment.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Fourthly, <hi>Put the case that one of the Defendants be made a Baron of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> now he cannot be punished in the House of Commons, and so he shall be unpunished.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It hath been objected, <hi>That the Parliament is the Superior Court to this, therefore this Court cannot examine their proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this I say,</hi> That this Court of the Kings Bench is a higher Court then the Justices of Oyer and Terminer, or the Justices of Assize: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But if an offence be done where the Kings Bench is; after it is removed, this offence may be examined by the Justices of Oyer and Terminer, or by the Justices of Assize. We cannot Question the Judgments of Parliaments, but their particular offences.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obj. <hi>It is a Priviledge of Parliament, whereof we are not competent Iudges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>To this I say,</hi> That <hi>Privilegium est privata lex, &amp; privat legem.</hi> And this ought to be by grant prescription in Parliament, and then it ought to be pleaded for the manner, as is 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8 <hi>Dy.</hi> as it is not here pleaded. Also we are Judges of all Acts of Parliament: as, 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. Ordinance made by the King and Commons is not good, and we are Judges what shall be said a Session of Parliament, as it is in <hi>Plowden</hi> in <hi>Patridges Case.</hi> We are Judges of their lives and lands, therefore of their Liberties. And 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> (which was cited by Mr. Atturney) it was the opinion of <hi>Dyer, Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Welsh; Brown</hi> and <hi>Southcot,</hi> Justices, That offences committed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may be punished out of Parliament. And 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.19. it is good Law. And it is usual neer the end of Parliaments to set some petty pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment upon offenders in Parliament, to prevent other Courts. And I have seen a Roll in this Court, in 6 <hi>H.</hi> 6. where judgment was given in a writ of annuity in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and afterwards the said judgment was
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:35668:355"/>
reversed in Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi>; upon which judgment, Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was brought in this Court, and reversed.</p>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But it hath been objected, <hi>That the offence is not capital, therefore it is not examinable in this Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though it be not capital, yet it is criminal, for it is sowing of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the destruction of the Commonwealth. The Question now is not between us that are Judges of this Court and the Parliament, or between the King and the Parliament; but between some private <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Members of the House of Commons and the King himself: for here the King himself questions them for those offences, as well he may. In every Commonwealth there is one supereminent Power which is not subject to be questioned by any other; and that is the King in this Commonwealth, who, as <hi>Bracton</hi> saith, <hi>solum Deum habet ultorem.</hi> But no other within the Realm hath this Priviledge. It is true, that that which is done in Parliament by consent of all the house, shall not be questioned elsewhere; but if any private Members <hi>exuunt personas judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> &amp; induunt malefacientium personas, &amp; sunt seditiosi,</hi> is there such San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony in the place, that they may not be questioned for it elsewhere? The Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> as the Case hath been put, being Embassadour here, practised matters against the State. And it was resolved, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Legatus sit Rex in alieno solo,</hi> yet when he goes out of the bounds
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:35668:355"/>
of his Office, and complots with Traytors in this Kingdom, that he shall be punished as an offender here. A Minister hath a great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge when he is in the Pulpit; but yet if in the Pulpit he utter speeches which are scandalous to the State, he is punishable: so in this Case, when a Burgess of Parliament becomes mutinous, he shall not have the Priviledge of Parliament. In my opinion, the Realm cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist without Parliaments, but the behaviour of Parliament-men ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to be Parliamentary. No outragious speeches were ever used against a great Minister of State in Parliament, which have not been punished. If a Judge of this Court utter scandalous speeches to the State, he may be questioned for them before Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer, because this is no judicial act of the Court.</p>
               <p>But it hath been objected:
<q>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> That we cannot examine Acts done by a higher Power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I put this Case: When a Peer of the Realm is arraigned of Treason, we are not his Judges, but the high Steward, and he shall be tryed by his Peers: But if errour be committed in this proceeding, that shall be reversed by errour in this Court; for that which we do, is <hi>Coram ipso Rege.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> It hath been objected:
<q>
                     <hi>That the Parliament-Law differs from the Law by which we judge in this Court in sundry Cases.</hi> And for the instance which hath been made, <hi>That by the Statute none ought to be chosen Burgesse of a Town in which he doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, but that the usage of Parliament is contrary.</hi> But if Information be brought upon the said Statute against such a Burgess, I think that the Statute is a good warrant for us to give judgement against him.</q>
               </p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <p>And it hath been objected:
<q>That there is no President in this matter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But there are sundry Presidents by which it appears that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath transmitted matters to this Court, as 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. there being a question between a great Peer and a Bishop, it was transmitted to this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Court, being for matter of behaviour: and although the Judges of this Court are but inferiour men, yet the Court is higher: for it appears by the 11 <hi>Eliz. Dy.</hi> That the Earl Marshal of <hi>England</hi> is an Officer of this Court; and it is always admitted in Parliament, That the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament hold not in three Cases, to wit, <hi>in case of Treason; secondly, in case of Felony, and in suit for the peace</hi>; and the last is our very case.

            <p>
               <hi>Crook</hi> argued to the same intent (but I did not well hear him:) he said, <hi>That these offences ought to be punished in the Court, or no where; and all manner off offences which are against the Crown, are examinable in this Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath been objected:
<q>That by this means none will adventure to make his complaints in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
            </p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
            <p>That is not so, for he may complain in a Parliamentary course, but not falsely and unlawfully, as here is pretended; for that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully, cannot be in a Parliamentary course.</p>
            <p>It hath been objected:
<q>That the Parliament is a higher Court then this is.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And it is true: But every Member of Parliament is not a Court; and if he commit offence, he is punishable here. Our Court is a Court of high jurisdiction, it cannot take cognizance of real Pleas; but if a real Plea comes by Error in this Court, it shall never be transmitted. But this Court may award a <hi>grand Cape,</hi> and other Process usual in real Actions: But of all capital and criminal causes we are originally competent Judges, and by consequence of this matter. But I am not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the opinion of Mr. Atturney General, that the word <hi>proditore,</hi> would have made this Treason. And for the other matters, he agreed with the Judges.<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> Therefore by the Court, the Defendants were ruled to plead further: and Mr. <hi>Lenthal</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> was assigned of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel for them.</p>
            <p>Inasmuch as the Defendants would not put in other Plea the last day of the Term,<note place="margin">Judgment pronounced.</note> judgment was given against them upon a <hi>nihil dicit</hi>; which judgment was pronounced by <hi>Iones</hi> to this effect:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The matter of the Information now by the confession of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants is admitted to be true, and we think their Plea to the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction insufficient for the matter and manner of it. And we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by will not draw the true Liberties of Parliament-men into Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to wit, for such matters which they do or speak in Parliamentary manner. But in this case there was a conspiracy between the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants to slander the State, and to raise sedition and discord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King his Peers and People; and this was not a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> course. All the <hi>Iudges</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> except one, have Resolved the Statute of 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. to be a private Act, and to extend to <hi>Strood</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But every Member of the Parliament shall have such Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as are there mentioned; but they have no Priviledge to speak at their pleasure. The Parliament is an high Court, therefore it ought not to be disorderly, but ought to give good example to other Courts.

                           </note> yet for the satisfaction of the minds and affections of Our Loving Subjects, We have thought good to set down thus much by way of Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that We may appeare to the world in the truth and sincerity of Our Actions, and not in those Colours, in which We know some turbulent and ill-affected spirits (to masque and disguise their wicked intentions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dangerous to the State) would represent Us to the publick view.</p>
                        <p>We assembled our Parliament the 17th. day of <hi>March,</hi> in the third yeer of Our Reigne, for the safety of Religion, for securing Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Subjects at home, and Our friends and Allies abroad. And therefore at the first sitting down of it, We declared the miserable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted estate of those of the reformed Religion, in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and other parts of Christendome; the distressed extremities of Our dearest Uncle, the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> chased out of a great part of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the strength of that Party which was united against Us; That (besides the Pope and the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and their antient confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates) the French King professed the rooting out of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; That, of the Princes and States on Our party, some were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run, others diverted, and some disabled to give assistance. For which, and other important motives, We propounded a speedy supply of Treasure, answerable to the necessity of the Cause.</p>
                        <p>These things in the beginning were well resented by the House of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Commons, and with much alacrity and readinesse, they agreed to grant a liberall aid: But before it was brought to any perfection, they were diverted by a multitude of Questions, raised amongst them, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their Liberties and Priviledges, and by other long disputes, that the Bill did not passe in a long time; and by that delay, Our affairs were put into a far worse case then at the first; Our Foraigne Actions then in hand being thereby disgraced and ruined, for want of timely help.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> In this, as We are not willing to derogate from the merit and good intentions of those wise and moderate men of that House, (to whose forwardnesse We attribute it, that it was Propounded and Resolved so soon); so We must needs say, that the delay of passing it when it was resolved, occasioned by causlesse jealousies, stirred up by men of another temper, did much lessen both the reputation and reality of that Supply. And their spirit, infused into many of the Commissioners and Assessors in the Country, hath returned up the Subsidies in such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> a scanty proportion, as is infinitely short, not onely of Our great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ons, but of the presidents of former Subsidies, and of the intentions of all well-affected men in that House.</p>
                        <p>In those large Disputes, as We permitted many of Our high prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives to be debated, which in the best times of Our Predecessors had never been questioned, without punishment or sharp reproof; so We
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35668:358"/>
did endeavour to have shortned those debates, for winning of time, which would have much advantaged Our great affairs, both at home and abroad. And therefore both by speeches and messages, We did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten declare Our gratious and clear resolution, to maintain, not onely the Parliament, but all our People, in their antient and just liberties, without either violation or diminution; and in the end, for their full satisfaction and security, did by an Answer, framed in the form by themselves desired, to their Parliamentary Petition, confirm their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and just Liberties and Rights, which We resolve, with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and justice, to maintain.</p>
                        <p>This Parliament, howsoever besides the setling Our necessary sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and their own liberties, they wasted much time in such procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, (blasting Our Government, as We are unwilling to remember) yet We suffered them to sit, untill themselves desired Us to appoint a time for their Recesse, not naming either Adjournment or Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereupon by advice of Our Councill, We resolved to prorogue and make a Session; and to that end prefixed a day, by which they might (as was meet in so long a Sitting) finish some profitable and good Lawes; and withall gave order for a gratious Pardon to all Our Subjects: which, according to the use of former Parliaments, passed the Higher House, and was sent down to the Commons. All which being gratiously intended by Us, was ill-entertained by some disaffected persons of that House, who by their artifices, in a short time raised so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> much heat and distemper in the House, for no other visible cause, but because We had declared Our resolution to Prorogue, as Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill advised, and not to Adjourn, as some of that House (after Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution declared, and not before) did manifest themselves to affect; that seldome hath greater passion been seen in that House, upon the greatest occasions. And some glances in the House, but upon open ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors abroad, were spread, That by the Answer to the Petition, We had given away, not onely Our Impositions upon Goods, exported and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> imported, but the Tunnage and Poundage, (whereas in the debate and hammering of that Petition, there was no speech or mention in either House concerning those Impositions, but concerning Taxes and other charges within the Land; much lesse was there any thought thereby to debar Us of Tunnage and Poundage, which both before and after the Answer to that Petition, the House of Commons, in all their speeches and treaties, did professe they were willing to grant). And at the same time, many other misinterpretations were raised of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that Petition and Answer, by men, not well distinguishing between well ordered liberty, and licentiousness; as if by Our Answer to that Petition. We had let loose the reynes of Our Government. And in this distemper, the House of Commons, laying aside the Pardon, (a thing never done in any former Parliament) and other businesse, fit to have been concluded that Session, some of them went about to frame and contrive a Remonstrance against Our receiving of Tunnage and Poundage, which was so far proceeded in, the night before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> time, for concluding the Session, and so hastned by the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thereof, that they meant to have put it to the Vote of the House the next morning, before We should prorogue the Session. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding Our gratious favours in that Session, afforded to Our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so ill requited, and such sinister straines made upon Our Answer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35668:358"/>
to that Petition, to the diminution of Our profit, and (which was more) to the danger of Our Government: We resolved to prevent the finishing of that Remonstrance, and other dangerous intentions of some ill-affected persons, by ending the Session the next morning, some few hours sooner then was expected; and by Our Own Mouth to declare to both Houses the cause thereof; and for hindring the spreading of those sinister interpretations of that Petition and Answer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to give some necessary directions, for setling and quieting Our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, untill another Meeting; which we performed accordingly the six and twentieth of <hi>Iune</hi> last.</p>
                        <p>The Session thus ended, and the Parliament risen, that intended Remonstrance gave Us occasion to look into the businesse of Tunnage and Poundage. And therefore, though Our necessities pleaded strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Us, yet We were not apt to strain that point too far, but resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to guide Our Self by the practise of former Ages, and examples <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Our most noble Predecessors; thinking those counsels best warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which the wisdom of former Ages, concurring with the present occasions, did approve; and therefore gave order for a diligent search of Records: upon which it was found, That although in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holden in the first yeer of the reigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, the Subsidy of Tunnage and Poundage was not granted unto that King, but was first granted unto him by Parliament in the third yeer of his Reigne; yet the same was accounted and answered to that King, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from the first day of his Reigne, all the first and second yeers of his Reigne, and, untill it was granted by Parliament. And that in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Subsidy of Tunnage and Poundage was not onely enjoyed by every of those Kings and Queens, from the death of each of them deceasing, untill it was granted by Parliament unto the Successor; but in all those times (being for the most part peacable, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not burdened with like charges and necessities, as these modern times) the Parliament did most readily and cheerfully, in the beginning of every of those Reignes, grant the same, as a thing most necessary for the guarding of the Seas, safety and defence of the Realm, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the Royall Dignity. And in the time of our Royall Father of blessed memory, he enjoyed the same a full yeer, wanting very few daies, before his Parliament began; and above a yeer before the Act of Parliament for the grant of it was passed. And yet when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was assembled, it was granted without difficulty. And in Our Own time, We quietly received the same three years and more, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting with patience, in severall Parliaments, the like grant thereof, as had been made to so many of Our Predecessors; the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons still professing, That multitude of other businesses, and not want of willingnesse on their part, had caused the setling thereof to be so long deferred. And therefore finding so much reason and necessity, for the receiving of the ordinary Duties in the Custom-house, to concur <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> with the practice of such a succession of Kings and Queens, famous for Wisdom, Justice, and Government; and nothing to the contrary, but that intended Remonstrance, hatched out of the passionate brains of a few particular persons; We thought it was so far from the wisdom and duty of a House of Parliament, as We could not think, that any moderate and discreet man, (upon composed thoughts, setting aside
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35668:359"/>
passion and distemper) could be against receiving of Tunnage and Poundage; especially since We do, and still must, pursue those ends, and undergo that charge, for which it vvas first granted to the Crovvn; It having been so long and constantly continued to Our Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, as that in four severall Acts of Parliament for the granting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and Our blessed <hi>Father.</hi> It is in expresse tearms mentioned, to have been had and enjoyed by the severall Kings, named in those Acts, time out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> minde, by authority of Parliament. And therefore upon these reasons, We held it agreeable to Our Kingly Honour, and necessary for the safety and good of Our Kingdom, to continue the Receipt thereof, as so many of Our Predecessors had done. Wherefore when a few Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants (being at first but one or two), fomented, as it is well known, by those evill spirits, that would have hatched that undutifull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, began to oppose the payment of Our accustomed Duties in the Custom-house, We gave order to the Officers of Our Customs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to go on, notwithstanding that opposition, in the receiving of the usuall Duties; and caused those, that refused, to be warned to attend at the Councill-board, that by the wisdom and authority of Our Councill, they might be reduced to obedience and duty; where some of them, without reverence or respect to the honour and dignity of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, behaved themselves with such boldnesse and insolency of speech, as was not to be endured by a far meaner Assembly, much lesse to be countenanced by a House of Parliament, against the Body of Our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Councill.</p>
                        <p>And as in this We did, what in reason and honour was fit for the present, so Our Thoughts were daily intentive upon the re-assembling of Our Parliament, with full intention on Our part, to take away all ill-understanding between Us and Our people; whose loves, as We desired to continue and preserve, so We used Our best endeavours, to prepare and facilitate the way to it. And to this end, having taken a strict and exact survey of Our Government, both in the Church and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Common-wealth, and what things were most fit and necessary to be reformed: We found in the first place, that much exception had been taken at a Book, entituled, <hi>Appello Caesarem,</hi> or, <hi>An Appeal to Cesar</hi>; and published in the year 1625. by <hi>Richard Montague,</hi> then Batchelor of Divinity, and now Bishop of <hi>Chichester</hi>; and because it did open the way to those schisms and divisions, which have since ensued in the Church, We did, for remedy and redresse thereof, and for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the consciences of Our good people, not onely by Our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Proclamation, call in that Book, which ministred matter of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but to prevent the like danger for hereafter, re-printed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, established in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory; and by a Declaration before those Articles, We did tie and restrain all opinions to the sense of those Articles, that nothing might be left for private fancies and innovations. For, We call God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, before whom We stand, that it is, and alwaies hath been, Our hearts desire, to be found worthy of that Title, which We account <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the most glorious in all our Crown, <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> Neither shall We ever give way to the authorising of any thing, whereby any <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation</hi> may steal or creep into the Church; but to preserve that unity of Doctrine and Discipline, established in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whereby the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath stood and flourished ever since.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:35668:359"/>And as we were carefull to make up all breaches and rents in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at home, so did We, by Our Proclamation and Commandment, for the execution of Lawes against Priests, and Popish Recusants, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie all waies and approaches against that forraigne Enemy; which if it have not succeeded according to Our intention, We must lay the fault where it is, in the subordinate Officers, and Ministers in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Country, by whose remisnesse, Jesuites and Priests escape without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension; and Recusants, from those convictions and penalties, which the Law and Our Commandment would have inflicted on them. For We do professe, That, as it is Our duty, so it shall be our care, to command and direct well; but it is the part of others, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ministeriall office. And when We have done Our office, We shall account Our Self, and all charitable men will account Us inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, both to God and men. And those that are negligent, We will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> esteem as culpable both to God and Us; and therefore will expect, that hereafter they give Us a better account.</p>
                        <p>And, as We have been careful for the setling of Religion, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting the Church; so were We not unmindfull of the preservation of the just and antient Liberties of Our Subjects, which we secured to them by our gratious Answer to the Petition in Parliament, having not since that time done any act whereby to infringe them. But Our care is, and hereafter shall be, to keep them entire and inviolable, as We <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> would do Our Own Right and Soveraignty, having for that purpose enrolled the Petition and Answer in our Courts of Justice.</p>
                        <p>Next to the care of Religion, and of Our Subjects Rights, We did Our best for the provident and well-ordering of that aid and supply, which was granted us the last Session, whereof no part hath been wastefully spent, nor put to any other use, than those for which it was desired and granted; as upon payment of Our Fleet and Army: wherein Our care hath been such, as We chose rather to discontent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Our dearest Friends and Allies, and Our nearest Servants, than to leave Our Souldiers and Marriners unsatisfied, whereby any vexation or disquiet might arise to our People. We have also, with part of those monies, begun to supply our Magazines, and stores of Munition, and to put Our Navy into a constant form and order. Our Fleet likwise is fitting, and almost in a readinesse, whereby the Narrow Seas may be guarded, Commerce maintained, and Our Kingdome secured from all forraign attempts. These acts of Ours might have made this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in all good minds, that We were carefull to direct Our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells, and dispose Our actions, as might most conduce to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Religion, honour of Our Government, and safety of Our People. But with mischievous men once ill-affected, <hi>seu bene, seu male facta premunt</hi>; and whatsoever once seemed amisse is ever remembered; but good endeavours are never regarded.</p>
                        <p>Now all these things that were the chief complaints the last Session, being by Our Princely care so seriously reformed, the Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assembled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the 20th of <hi>Ianuary</hi> last. We expected, according to the candor and sincerity of our own thoughts, that men would have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themselves for the effecting of a right understanding between Us and Our People. But some few malevolent persons, like Empericks and lewd Artists, did strive to make new work, and to have some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease on foot, to keep themselves in request, and to be employed and entertained in the cure. And yet to manifest how much offences have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35668:360"/>
been diminished, The Committees for Grievances, Committees for Courts of Justice, and Committees for Trade, have, since the sitting down of the Parliament, received few Complaints, and those such, as they themselves have not thought to be of that moment or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with which Our Ears should be acquainted.</p>
                        <p>No sooner therefore was the Parliament set down, but these ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected men began to sow and disperse their jealousies, by casting out some glances and doubtfull speeches, as if the Subject had not been so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> clearly and well dealt with, touching their liberties, and touching the Petition answered the last Parliament. This being a plausible Theam, thought on for an ill purpose, easily took hold on the minds of many, that knew not the practice. And thereupon the second day of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, a Committee was appointed to search, whether the Petition and our Answer thereunto were enrolled in the Parliament Role, and in the Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and in what manner the same was done. And a day also was then appointed, on which, the House being resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> into a Committee, should take into consideration those things, wherein the liberty of the Subject had been invaded, against the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right. This, though it produced no other effect of moment or importance, yet was sufficient to raise a jealousie against our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, in such as were not well acquainted with the sincerity and clearnesse of them. There followed another of no lesse skill; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Our proceeding, before the Parliament, about matters of Religion, might have satisfied any moderate men of Our zealous care <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thereof, (as we are sure it did the most) yet, as bad stomachs turn the best things into their own nature, for want of good digestion; so those distempered persons have done the like of Our good intents, by a bad and sinister interpretation: For, when they did observe, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honest and religious minds in that House, did complain of those dangers that did threaten the Church; they likewise took the same word in their mouth, and their cry likewise was, <hi>Templum Domini, Templum Domini,</hi> when the true care of the Church never came into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their hearts: and what the one did out of zeal unto Religion, the other took up as a plausible Theam, to deprave Our Government, as if We, Our Clergy, and Councill, were either senslesse or carelesse of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this wicked practise hath been, to make Us seem to walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Our people, as if We halted before God.</p>
                        <p>Having, by these artifices, made a jealous impression in the hearts of many; and a day being appointed to treat of the Grant of Tunnage and Poundage, at the time prefixed, all expresse great willingnesse to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> grant it. But a new strain is found out, that it could not be done, without great perill to the right of the Subject, unlesse We should disclaim any right therein, but by grant in Parliament; and should cause all those Goods to be restored, which, upon commandment from Us, or Our Councill, were stayed by our Officers, untill those Duties were paid, and consequently should put Our Selves out of the possession of the Tunnage and Poundage, before they were granted; for else, it was pretended, the Subject stood not in fit case to grant it. A fancy and cavill raised of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> purpose to trouble the businesse; it being evident, that all the Kings before named did receive that Duty, and were in actuall possession of it, before, and at the very time, when it was granted to them by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And although We, to remove all difficulties, did from Our Own Mouth, in those clear and open tearms, that might have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35668:360"/>
any moderate and well-disposed minds, declare, That it was Our meaning, by the gift of Our people, to enjoy it, and that we did not challenge it of right, but took it <hi>de bene esse,</hi> shewing thereby, not the right, but the necessity, by which We were to take it, (wherein We descended, for their satisfaction, so far beneath Our self, as We are confident, never any of Our Predecessors did the like, nor was the like ever required or expected from Them). Yet for all this, the Bill of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Tunnage and Poundage was laid aside, upon pretence, they must first clear the right of the Subject therein; under colour whereof, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the complaints, not onely of <hi>Iohn Rolles,</hi> a Member of their House, but also of <hi>Richard Chambers, John Fowkes,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> against the Officers of Our Customs, for detaining their goods, upon refusall to pay the ordinary Duty, accustomed to be paid for the same. And upon these complaints, they send for the Officers of the Customes, enforcing them to attend day after day, by the space of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a month together; they cause them to produce their Letters Patents under Our Great Seal, and the Warrants made by Our Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, for levying of those Duties. They examine the Officers upon what questions they please, thereby to entrap them for doing Our service and commandment. In these and other their proceedings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause We would not give the least shew of interruption, We endured long with much patience both these, and sundry other strange and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant incroachments and usurpations, such as were never before at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in that House.</p>
                        <p>We are not ignorant, how much that House hath of late years en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to extend their priviledges, by setting up generall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees for Religion, for Courts of Justice, for Trade, and the like; a course never heard of untill of late: So as, where in former timos the Knights and Burgesses were wont to communicate to the House such businesse, as they brought from their Countries; now there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chairs erected, to make enquirie upon all sorts of men, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> complaints of all sorts are entertained, to the unsufferable disturbance and scandall of Justice and Government, which having been tolerated a while by Our Father, and Our Self, hath daily grown to more and more height; insomuch that young Lawyers sitting there, take upon them to decry the opinions of the Judges; and some have not doubted to maintain, That the Resolutions of that House must bind the Judges, a thing never heard of in Ages past. But, in this last assembly of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they have taken on them much more then ever before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> They sent messengers to examine Our Atturney Generall, (who is an Officer of trust and secrecy) touching the execution of some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of Ours, of which, without Our leave first obtained, he was not to give account to any but Our Self. They sent a captious and directory message to the Lord Treasurer, Chancellor, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the Exchequer, touching some judiciall proceedings of theirs in Our Court of Exchequer.</p>
                        <p>They sent messengers to examine upon sundry questions, Our two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Chief Justices, and three other of Our Judges, touching their judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all proceedings at the Gaol-Delivery at <hi>Newgate,</hi> of which, they are not accountable to the House of Commons.</p>
                        <p>And whereas Suits were commenced in Our Court of Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, against <hi>Richard Chambers, John Fowks, Bartholomew Gilman,</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Phillips,</hi> by Our Atturney Generall, for great misdemeanours;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35668:361"/>
they resolved, that they were to have priviledge of Parliament against us for their persons, for no other cause, but because they had Petitions depending in that House; and (which is more strange) they resolved, that a Signification should be made from that House, by a Letter, to issue under the hand of their Speaker, unto the Lord Keeper of Our Great Seal, that no attachments should be granted out against the said <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Fowks, Gilman,</hi> or <hi>Phillips,</hi> during their said priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whereas it is far above the power of that House, to give directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to any of Our Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to stop Attatchments against any man, though never so strongly priviledged; the breach of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge being not in the Court that grants, but in the Party or Minister that puts in execution such Attachments. And therefore, if any such Letter had come to the Lord Keeper, as it did not, he should have highly offended Us if he had obeyed it. Nay, they went so far, as they spared not the honour of Our Councill-board, but examined their proceedings in the case of Our Customers, interrogating what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this or that man of Our Councill said, in direction of them in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse committed to their charge. And when one of the Members of that House speaking of our Counsellors, said, We had wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell; and another said, that the Councill and Judges sought to trample under feet the liberty of the Subject; and a third traduced Our Court of Star-Chamber, for the Sentence given against <hi>Savage,</hi> they passed without check or censure by the House. By which may appear, how far the Members of that House have of late swollen beyond the rules <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of moderation, and the modesty of former times; and this under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of priviledge and freedom of speech, whereby they take liberty to declare against all authority of Councill and Courts at their pleasure.</p>
                        <p>They sent for Our Sheriff of <hi>London</hi> to examine him in a cause, whereof they had no jurisdiction; their true and antient jurisdiction extending onely to their own Members, and to the conservation of their priviledges, and not to the censure of forrain persons and causes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which have no relation to their priviledges, the same being but a late innovation. And yet upon an enforced strain of a Contempt, for not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to their satisfaction, they commit him to the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> using that outward pretext for a cause of committing him, the true and inward cause being, for that he had shewed himself dutifull to Us and Our commandements, in the matter concerning Our Customs.</p>
                        <p>In these innovations (which We will never permit again) they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> pretended indeed Our service; but their drift was, to break, by this means, through all respects and ligaments of Government, and to erect an universall over-swaying power to themselves, which belongs onely to Us, and not to them.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, in their proceedings against Our Customers, they went about to censure them as Delinquents, and to punish them, for staying some goods of some factious Merchants, in Our Store-house, for not paying those Duties which themselves had for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>erly paid, and which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Customers, without interruption, had received of all other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, many years before, and to which they were authorised, both by Our great Seal, and by severall directions and commandements from Us and Our Privy Councill.</p>
                        <p>To give some colour to their proceedings herein, they went about
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35668:361"/>
to create a new priviledge, (which We will never admit) That a Parliament-man hath priviledge for his goods against the King; the consequence whereof would be, That he may not be constrained to pay any Duties to the King, during the time of priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is true, they would have this case to have been between the Merchants, and Our Farmers of Our Customs, and have severed them from Our interest and commandment, thereby the rather to make them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> lyable to the censure and punishment of that House. But on the other side, We holding it both unjust and dishonorable, to with-draw Our self from Our Officers, in any thing they did by Our commandement, or to disavow any thing that we had enjoyned to be done; upon <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 23d of <hi>February,</hi> sent a message unto them by Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi> thanking them for the respect they had shewed, in severing the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of Our Farmers from Our Own interest and commandment. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse, We were bound in honour to acknowledge a truth, that, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> what was done by them, was done by our expresse commandement and direction; and if for doing thereof Our Farmers should suffer, it would highly concern Us in honour. Which message was no sooner delivered unto them, but in a tumultuous and discontented manner, they called, <hi>Adjourn, Adjourn</hi>; and thereupon, without any cause gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on Our part, in a very unusuall manner, adjourned, untill the <hi>Wednesday</hi> following.</p>
                        <p>On which day, by the uniform wisdom of Our Privy Council, We cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> both Houses to be adjourned until the second day of <hi>March</hi>; hoping that in the mean time, a better and more right understanding might bee begotten between Us, and the Members of that House, whereby the Parliament might come to a happy Issue.</p>
                        <p>But understanding by good advertisment, that their discontent did not in that time digest, and passe away; We resolved to make a second adjournment, untill the tenth of <hi>March</hi>; which was done, as well to take time to Our Self, to think of some means to accommodate those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> difficulties, as to give them time to advise better; and accordingly, We gave commandment for a second adjournment in both Houses, and for cessation of all businesse till the day appointed; which was very duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obeyed in the Higher House, no man contradicting or questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it. But when the same commandment was delivered in the House of Commons by their Speaker, it was streight-waies contradicted; and although the Speaker declared unto them, it was an absolute right and power in Us to adjourn, as well as to prorogue or dissolve; and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and readd unto them divers presidents of that House, to warrant the same; yet Our commandment was most contemptuously disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and some rising up to speak, said, They had businesse to do before the House should be adjourned. <note n="*" place="margin">Here are the passages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Members de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment in the House, mentioned in this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Whilst the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> lived, he was intituled to all the distempers and ill events of former Parliaments; and therefore much endeavour was used to demolish him, as the onely wall of separation between Us and Our people. But now he is dead, no alteration was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> found amongst those envenomed spirits, which troubled then the blessed harmony between Us and Our Subjects, and continue still to trouble it. For now under the pretence of publick care of the Common-wealth, they suggest new and causlesse fears, which in their own hearts they know to be false; and devise new Engines of mischief, so to cast a blindnesse upon the good affections of Our people, that they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35668:362"/>
may not see the truth, and largenesse of Our heart towards them. So that now it is manifest, the Duke was not alone the mark these men shot at, but was onely as a near minister of Ours, taken up, on the By, and in their passage to their more secret designes; which were onely to cast Our Affairs into a desperate condition, to abate the powers of Our Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to bring Our Government into obloquy; that, in the end, all things may be over-whelmed with Anarchy and Confusion.</p>
                        <p>We do not impute these dysasters to the whole House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> knowing that there were amongst them many religious, grave, and well-minded men; but the sincerer and better part of the House was over-born, by the practises and clamours of the other, who, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of their duties, and taking advantage of the times, and Our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, have enforced Us to break off this Meeting; which, had it been answered with like duty on their parts, as it was invited and begun with love on Ours, might have proved happy and glorious, both to Us and this whole Nation.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have thus declared the manifold causes We had, to dissolve this Parliament, whereby all the world may see, how much they have forgotten their former engagements at the entry into the War, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves being perswaders to it; promising to make Us feared by Our enemies, and esteemed by Our friends. And how they turned the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities grown by that War, to enforce us to yield to Conditions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with Monarchy.</p>
                        <p>And now that Our People may discern, that these provocations of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> evill men (whose punishments we reserve to a due time) have not changed Our good intentions to Our Subjects, We do here professe to maintain the true Religion and Doctrine, established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> without admitting or conniving at any back-sliding, either to Popery or Schism. We do also declare, That vve will maintain the antient and just rights and liberties of Our Subjects, with so much constancy and justice, that they shall have cause to acknowledge, That under Our government and gratious protection, they live in a more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> happy and free estate, then any subjects in the Christian world. Yet let no man hereby take the boldnesse to abuse that liberty, turning it to licentiousnesse; nor misinterprett the Petition, by perverting it to a lawlesse liberty, wantonly or frowardly, under that or any other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to resist lawfull and necessary authority. For as We will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Our Subjects in their just liberties, so We do and will expect, that they yield as much submission and duty to Our Royal preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and as ready obedience to Our authority and commandments,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as hath been performed to the greatest of Our Predecessors.</p>
                        <p>And for Our Ministers, We vvill not that they be terrified by those harsh proceedings, that have been strained against some of them. For, as we will not command any thing unjust or dishonourable, but shall use Our authority and prerogatives for the good of Our People; so we will expect, that Our Ministers obey Us, and they shall assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, We will protect them.</p>
                        <p>As for Our Merchants, We let them know, We shall alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to cherish and enlarge the Trade of such as be dutifull, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out burthening them beyond what is fitting: but the Duty of Five in the Hundred, for guarding of the Seas, and defence of the Realm, to which we hold Our selves still obliged, (and which Duty hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without interruption so many succession of Ages) We hold
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35668:362"/>
no good or dutifull Subject will deny it, being so necessary for the good of the whole Kingdom. And if any factious Merchant vvill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front Us, in a thing so reasonable, and vvherein we require no more, nor in no other manner, than so many of Our Predecessors have done, and have been dutifully obeyed: Let them not deceive themselves, but be assured, that We shall find honourable and just means to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Our Estate, vindicate Our Soveraignty, and preserve the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vvhich God hath put into Our Hands.</p>
                        <p>And now having laid down the truth and clearnesse of Our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, all wise and discreet men may easily judge of those ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and jealous fears, that are malitiously and vvickedly bruited abroad; and may discern, by examination of their own hearts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (in respect of the free passage of the Gospel, indifferent and equall administration of Justice, freedom from oppression, and the great peace and quietnesse which every man enjoyeth under his own Vine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and Fig-tree) the happinesse of this Nation can be parallel'd, by any of Our neighbour-Countries; and if not, then to acknowledge their own blessednesse, and for the same be thankfull to God, the Author of all goodnesse.</p>

                        <head>A Proposition for His Majestie's Service, to bridle the Impertinency of Parliaments. Afterwards questioned in the Star-Chamber.</head>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">A Proposition presented to the King how to keep in awe this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>THe Proposition for your Majestie's service containeth two parts: the one, to secure your State, and to bridle the impertinency of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Parliaments: the other, to increase your Majestie's Revenue, much more then it is. Touching the first, having considered divers means, I find none so important, to strengthen your Majesties Regall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, against all oppositions and practises of troublesome spirits, and to bridle them; than to fortifie your Kingdome, by having a Fortresse in every chief Town, and important place thereof, furnished with Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Munition,<note place="margin">First to have a Fortresse in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Town.</note> and faithfull Men, as they ought to be, with all other circumstances fit for to be digested in a businesse of this nature; orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> withall the trained Souldiers of the County to be united in one dependency with the said Fort, as well to secure their beginning, as to succour them in any occasion of suspect; and also to retain and keep their Armes for more security, whereby the Countries are no lesse to be brought in subjection than the Cities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and consequently the whole Kingdom; your Majesty having by this course the power thereof in your own hands. The reasons of the suggests are these: 1. That in Policy, it is a greater tye of the People <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by force and necessity, then meerly by love and affection; for by the one, the Government resteth alwaies secure; but by the other, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the people are contented. 2. It forceth obstinate subjects to be no more presumptuous, than it pleaseth your Majesty to permit them. 3. That to leave a State unfurnished, is, to give the Bridle thereof to the Subject; when, by the contrary, it resteth onely in the Prince's hands. 4. That modern Fortresses take long time in winning, with such charge and difficulty, as no Subjects in these times have means <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> probable to attempt them. 5. That it is a sure remedy against Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and popular Mutinies, or against forraigne powers; because they cannot well succeed: when by this course the apparent means is taken away, to force the King and Subject upon a doubtfull fortune of a set Battle, as was the cause, that moved the pretended invasion against the land, attempted by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the year 1588. 6. That your Majestie's government is the more secure, by the people's more subjection; and by their subjection, your Parliament must be forced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> consequently to alter their style, and to be conformable to your will and pleasure; for their words and opposition import nothing, where the power is in your Majesties own hands, to do with them what you please; being indeed the chief purpose of this discourse, and the secret intent thereof, fit to be concealed from any English at all, either Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors of State or other.</p>
                        <p>For these, and divers other weighty reasons, It may be considered in this place, to make your Majesty more powerfull and strong, some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> orders be observed, that are used in fortified Countries, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof imports as much as the States themselves, I mean, in times of doubt or suspect, which are these. <hi>Imprimis,</hi> That none wear Arms or Weapons at all, either in City or Country, but such as your Majesty may think fit to priviledge, and they to be inrolled.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35668:363"/>
2. That as many high-waies as conveniently may be done,<note place="margin">Secondly, To cause high-waies to be made through such Townes.</note> be made passable through those Cities and Townes fortified, to constrain the passengers to travell through them. 3. That the souldiers of Fortresses be sometimes chosen of another Nation,<note place="margin">Thirdly, To choose the Souldiers of such Fortres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, no Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the place.</note> if subject to the same Prince; but howsoever, not to be born in the same Province, or within forty or fifty miles of the Fortresse, and not to have friends or correspondency <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> near it. 4. That at all the Gates of each walled Town be appointed Officers, not to suffer any unknown passengers to passe, without a Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, shewing from whence he came, and whither to go. And that the Gates of each City be shut all night,<note place="margin">4. To let none passe through such places without a Ticket.</note> and keyes kept by the Mayor or Governour. 5. Also Inn-keepers to deliver the names of all unknown passengers that lodge in their houses; and if they stay suspitiously at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time,<note place="margin">5. To have the names of all lodgers taken by Inkeepers.</note> to present them to the Governour: whereby dangerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons seeing these strict courses, will be more wary of their actions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and thereby mischievous attempts will be prevented. All which being referred to your Majestie's wise consideration, it is meet for me withall to give you some satisfaction, of the charge and time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what is purposed, that you may not be discouraged in the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the one, or prolongation of the other; both which doubts are resolved in one and the same reason, in respect that in <hi>England,</hi> each chief Town commonly hath a ruinated Castle, well seated for strength, whose foundation and stones remaining, may be both quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> repaired for this use, and with little charge and industry made strong enough, I hope, for this purpose, within the space of one year; by adding withall Bulwarks and Rampiers for the Ordnance, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of Fortification. The Ordnance for these Forts may be of Iron, not to disfurnish your Majestie's Navy, or be at a greater charge then is needfull.</p>
                        <p>To maintain yearly the Fort,<note place="margin">The expence of these Forts.</note> I make account in ordinary pay, three thousand men will be sufficient, and will require forty thousand pound <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> charge <hi>per Annum,</hi> or thereabouts, being an expence that inferiour Princes undergo, for their necessary safety. All which prevention added to the invincible Sea-force your Majesty hath already, and may have, will make you the most powerfull and obeyed King of the world. Which I could likewise confirm by many examples, but I omit them for brevity, and not to confuse your Majesty with too much matter. Your Majesty may find by the scope of this discourse, the means shewed in generall to bridle your Subjects, that may be either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> discontent or obstinate. So likewise am I to conclude the same intent particularly, against the perversnesse of your Parliament, as well to suppresse that pernitious humour, as to avoid their oppositions against your profit, being the second part to be discoursed on: and therefore have first thought fit,<note place="margin">To impose an oath on the Subjects.</note> for better prevention thereof, to make known to your Majesty the purpose of a generall Oath your Subjects may take, for sure avoiding of all rubs, that may hinder the conclusion of these businesses. It is further meant, that no subject upon pain of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> may refuse the same Oath, containing onely matter of Allegiance, and not scruples in points of Conscience, that may give pretence not be denyed. The effect of the Oath is this, That all your Majestie's Subjects do acknowledge you, to be as absolute a King and Monarch within your Dominions, as is amongst the Christian Princes; and your Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative as great: whereby you may and shall of your self, by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie's Proclamation, as well as other Soveraign Princes doing the

How necessary the dangerous supremacy of Parliament's usurpation is to be prevented, The example of <hi>Lewes</hi> the Eleventh King of <hi>France,</hi> doth manifest, who found the like opposition as your Majesty doth; and by his wisdom suppressed it.

The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in offering the afore-said Oath, may require some policy, for the easier passage at first, either by singular or particular tractation; and that so near about one time over the Land, as one Government may not know what the other intendeth; so it may passe the easier, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> no time of combination or opposition.

it down in my Instructions; it will save your Majesty at least One hundred thousand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> to make it pain of death, and confiscation of goods and lands, for any of the Officers to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen You, which now is much to be feared they do, or else they could not be so rich; and herein to allow a fourth part benefit to them that shall find out the cousenage.

The summe of all this account amounteth unto two Millions, or Twenty hundred thousand pounds <hi>per Annum</hi>: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it be but one Million and a Half, as assuredly your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty may make by these courses set down, yet it is much more then I promised in my Letter for your Majesties service.

Lastly, to conclude all these discourses, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this course used for your profit, That it is not onely the means to make you the richest King that ever <hi>England</hi> had, but also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the safety augmented thereby to be most secure, besides what shewed in the first part of this Discourse; I mean, by the occasion of this Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and raising of monies, your Majesty shall have cause and means to imploy in all places of the Land so many Officers and Ministers, to be obliged to you for their own good and interest, as nothing can be attempted against your Person or Royall State over land, but some of them shall in all probability have means to find it out, and hinder it. Besides, this course will detect many disorders and abuses in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> publick Government, which were hard to be discovered by men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. To prohibite gorgeous and costly apparell to be worn, but by persons of good quality, shall save the Gentry of the Kingdom much more mony, then they shall be taxed to pay unto your Majesty.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> reports it to be the opinion of <hi>Markham,</hi> in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. and <hi>Forrescue</hi> in his Book, <hi>de laudibus Legum Angliae, cap.</hi> 18. And the reason given is, because no action of false imprisonment lies against the King if the Imprisonment be wrongfull; and the King cannot be a wrong doer. The Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is, That no free-man be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35668:366"/>
imprisoned, but by the Law of the Land. And it appears by these Books, that it is against the Law of the Land that the King should imprison any one.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Admit that this be onely a signification and notification given by the King himself of the commitment of the prisoner; yet it seems, that that signification is of no force, 1. Because the words are general &amp; uncertain, — <hi>for notable contempts</hi>— There are in the Law many contempts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> severall natures; there are contempts against the Common law, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Statute-law; contempts in words, gestures, or actions. And it appears not to the Court of what nature these contempts were. —<hi>Notable</hi>— Every contempt which is made to the King is notable. —<hi>Against Our Government</hi>— Contempt which is committed in a Court of Record or Chancery, is a contempt against the Government of the King, to wit, because they disobey the King when he commands them by his Writs, <hi>C.</hi> 8. 60. <hi>a. Beechers</hi> case. The last two words of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Return are, —<hi>For stirring up of sedition against Us</hi>— which words likewise are indefinite and generall. I find not the word [<hi>Sedition</hi>] in our Books, but taken adjectively, as seditious books, seditious newes, &amp;c. in the Statute of 1<hi>st.</hi> and 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mary, cap.</hi> 3. the words are, <hi>If any person shall be convicted, &amp;c. for speaking, &amp;c. any false, seditious, or slanderous newes, saying of the tayles of the Queen, &amp;c. he shall lose his ears, or pay 100 l.</hi> There the penalty imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> such Sedition is but a Fine, <hi>C.</hi> 4. Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s case 13. where Sedition is defined to be <hi>seorsum itio,</hi> when a man takes a course of his own. And there it is said, that the words, —<hi>maintain sedition against the Queen's proceedings</hi>— shall be expounded according to the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all the words, and the intent of the parties. So that it is plain, that there is a sedition that is onely finable, and which is no cause of imprisonment without bail: And what the sedition is that is here intended, cannot be gathered out of the words, they are so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> —<hi>against Us</hi>— those words are redundant, for every sedition is against the King.</p>
                        <p>Upon the generality and incertainty of all the words in the Return, he put these cases, 18. <hi>E.</hi> 3. A man was indicted, <hi>quia furatus est equum,</hi> and doth not say <hi>Felonic,</hi> and therefore ill, 29. <hi>ass.</hi> 45. A man was indicted that he was <hi>communis latro,</hi> and the indictment held vitious, because too generall. So here, the offences are returned generally. But there ought to be something individuall, <hi>C.</hi> 5.57. <hi>Specot</hi>'s case, <hi>quia <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> schismaticus inveteratus,</hi> is no good cause for the Bishop to refuse a Clerk, for it is too generall, and there are schisms divers kinds, 38. <hi>E.</hi> 3.2. Because the Clerk is <hi>criminosus,</hi> it is no good cause for the Bishop to refuse him, 8 and 9 <hi>Eliz. Dy.</hi> 254. The Bishop of <hi>N.</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth one, because he was a haunter of Taverns, &amp;c. for which, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other crimes, he was unfit, held that the last words are too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and incertain, 40. <hi>E.</hi> 3.6. In the tender of a marriage, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of the heir, he ought to alledge a certain cause of refusall, Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> issue may be taken. <hi>C.</hi> 8.68. <hi>Trollop</hi>'s case, to say, That the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is excommunicated for divers contumacies, shall not disable him, without shewing some cause in speciall of the excommunication, upon which the Court may judge whether it were just or no.

For the second Warrant, the Return is, — <hi>for stirring up sedition against Us and Our Government.</hi> Sedition is not any determined offence within our Law; our Law gives definitions or descriptions of other offences, to wit, of Treason, Murder, Felony, &amp;c. but there is no crime in our Law called Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is defined by a Civilian to be <hi>Seditio,</hi> or <hi>Secessio, cum pars rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae contra partem infurgit;</hi> so that sedition is nothing but division. <hi>Braeton</hi> and <hi>Glanvill</hi> have the word [<hi>Seditio</hi>] generally.

And that Statute speaks not of Sedition, nor the Statute of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 10. which makes some things Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which are not contained within the said Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3.

Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s case <hi>[Seditious]</hi> is referred to doctrine. There are offences more high in their nature than sedition, which were not treason, unlesse so declared by act of Parliament.

Insurrection of villains and others is not made treason, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> proves, that before this Act it was not treason.

By the Statute of 3 and 4 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>chap.</hi> 5. to assemble people to alter the Lawes, is made treason, if they continue together an houre after Proclamation made. This as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of people was sedition at the Common Law; and the very as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, if they after dissolve upon Proclamation made, is not treason by the said Statute. By the Statute of 14 <hi>Eliz. chap.</hi> 1. it is made Felony, malitiously and rebelliously to hold from the Queen any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> &amp;c. but because this relates not to the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. it is not treason. 2. It seems clearly, that this Case is within the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Right, in which <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Statutes of 25, and 28 <hi>E.</hi> 3. are recited. The grievance there was, That divers have been imprisoned without any cause shewed, to which they might make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer according to the Law. And upon this Return, nothing appears to be objected to which he might answer. It appears not what that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Act, which is called <hi>Sedition,</hi> was. This is the very grief intended to be remedied by this Statute: To this he cannot answer according to Law. It appears not whether this were a seditious act, trespasse, or slander, or what it was at all. The words are, —<hi>Sedition against the King</hi>— This helps not, for every offence is against the King, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Crown and dignity; that which disturbs the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is against the King, seditious doctrine is sedition against the King, as is before said. In 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>vide Postrat. fol.</hi> 19. the Lords <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and Commons desire the King, that <hi>William de la Pool</hi> may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for divers treasons, and sundry other heinous crimes; and the Petition held not good, because too generall: Whereupon they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit particular Articles against him.

a tender point, the right whereof is great, just, and inviolable. The prerogative of the King is an high point, to which every subject ought to submit.

                        <p>For the first, it hath been objected, that the commitment here was by the Lords of the Privy Councill, and the signification of this cause is by the King himself. But I say, that there is a further matter in the Return; for the Lords of the Councill do it by the command of the King, and they onely pursue this command. I will not dispute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Lords of the Councill have power to commit an offender or no, it is common in experience, 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6.28. <hi>Poign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </hi> case is expresse in it. And in the Petition of right it is admitted, that they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. And this is not alledged there for a grievance, but the grievance there, was, because the particular charge of commitment was not shewed. Some Books have been objected to prove, that the King, though in person, cannot commit any person, 16 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>F. Monstrance de faits</hi> 182. But the authority of that Book vanisheth, if the case be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> put at large, which was in trespasse for cutting of Trees. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant said, That the place where, &amp;c is parcell of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> whereof the King is seised in Fee, and the King commands us to cut. And the opinion of the Court was, that this is no plea, without shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a specialty of the command of the King. And there the whole Court saies, That if the King command me to arrest a man, whereby I arrest him, he shall have trespasse or imprisonment against me, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be done in the presence of the King. That the following <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> words are to be understood, as the principal case was of one command of the King by word, and then such command by word to arrest a man is void. And 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7.4. was objected, <hi>Hussey</hi> saies, that <hi>Markham</hi> said to King <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. that he cannot arrest a man for suspition of Treason or Felony, because if he do wrong, the party cannot have his action. To this I say, That the Book there is to be understood of a wrongfull arrest, for there is spoken of an action of false imprisonment; and a wrongfull arrest cannot be made by the King.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. It stands not with the dignity of the King to arrest any man; <hi>C.</hi> 4. 73. The King makes a Lease for years, rendring rent, with condition of re-entry for non-payment; he shall take advantage of the condition without any demand; and the reason there given, is, that a <hi>decorum</hi> and conveniency might be observed. So it is not befitting for the King
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35668:368"/>
in person to arrest any man, but the King may command another to do it. <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de acquirendo rerum Dominio, fol.</hi> 55. sayes, That the Crown of the King is to do justice and judgment, and <hi>facere pacem,</hi> without which, the Crown it self cannot subsist. Severall constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be made upon those severall words, —and the last words— <hi>facere pacem</hi>— imply, that the King hath a coercive power. <hi>Britton f.</hi> 1. amongst the <hi>Errata.</hi> The King said in person, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Because we are not sufficient in person to do every thing, We divide the charge into many parts. We are the peoples Iustice, and a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice implies one that hath power to do justice in every kind, to wit, by imprisonment, or otherwise. 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7.7. <hi>C.</hi> 11.85. it is said, That the King is the chief Iustice.

                           </gap>, is not used towards the Subject as imprisonment for any fault, but is rather an arrest or restraint to avoid further inconveniencies, 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7.8. A Iustice of Peace may arrest men riotously assembled, for prevention of further mischief. And the Book also saies, That he may leave his servants there to arrest men, for safeguard of the peace. It is a case well known, that if a house be set on fire, every man may pull down the next house, for prevention of greater mischief; so it seems concerning the Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the State, they ought to be restrained and supprest, lest others should be stirred up by them to the same combustion, 22 <hi>ass.</hi> 56. and 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4.45. in false imprisonment the Defendant justifies, because the Plantiff was mad and out of his wits, and that he had done some harm, and that he had bound and beat him to avoid further harm, which might have happened by his madnesse: And the justification was held good. So it is in matter of Government, to avoid commotions, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> King ought to use his coercive power against those that are enraged The objection was, that this course was against the Petition of Right. But I answer, That this case is out of the words of that Petition; the words of the Petition were, —Whereas by the Statute called, The great Charter, and by the Statute of 28 <hi>E.</hi> 3. no free-man may be taken or imprisoned— yet against the tenour of the said Statute, &amp;c. divers of your subjects have of late been imprisoned, without any cause shewed; and when for their deliverance, &amp;c. they were brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> before the Iustices by Writs of <hi>Habeas corpus,</hi> there to undergo and receive as the Court should order, and their Keepers commanded to certifie the cause of their deteyner, and no cause was certified, but that they were detained by your Majesties speciall command, signified by the Lords of your Council; and yet were returned back to severall prisons, without being charged with any thing to which they might make answer according to Law. These last words are observable, —Without being charged with any thing, to which they might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> make answer— These words do not refer to the Return of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus,</hi> for the cause returned therein cannot be traversed, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 54. but the Court took it as true. But the setting forth of the cause, and the answer to the same cause, is to be upon other proceedings, to wit, upon the indictment for the offence, or otherwise. And there is great difference between the return of a Writ to which a man may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35668:369"/>

And upon shewing of the grievance, as above, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is, that no free-man, in any <hi>such</hi> manner as before is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, be imprisoned or detained, <hi>(such)</hi> and it hath relation to such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, which is mentioned in the premises. And imprisonment mentioned in the premises of the Petition is, where no cause at all was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> mentioned; then where any cause is shewed, is out of the Petition, and that <hi>[such]</hi> is the word relative, appears by <hi>C.</hi> 11, 62. where many cases are put to the same purpose; which see.</p>
                        <p>The third objection was, That the Return was generall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. The Counsell on the other side had divided the words of the Return, but that is to offer violence thereunto; for an exposition shall not be made by fractions, but upon the whole matter. For the first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> words, —<hi>notable contempts</hi>— It hath been said, that the addition of the word <hi>[notable]</hi> is but to make a flourish: But I say, That <hi>[nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble]</hi> is not the emphasis of the Return, but it onely expresseth the nature of the offence; and yet <hi>[notable]</hi> is a word observable by it self in the Law, and implyes, that the thing is known and noted. By 27 <hi>E.</hi> 1. Sheriffs shall be punished, that let notorious offenders to bayl; and by the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. a notorious or common thief shall not make his purgation: and 26 <hi>E.</hi> 3.71. in a trespasse for fals imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Defendant said, That the Plantiff came into the Town of <hi>Huntington,</hi> and because he was seen in the company of <hi>R. de Thorby,</hi> who was a notorious thief, he, as Bailiff of <hi>Huntington,</hi> took him upon suspition. I confesse, that —<hi>for contempts</hi> —is generall, yea it is <hi>genus generalissimum,</hi> and within the Petition of Right; but the words are, —<hi>against Our Self</hi>— It hath been said, That this might be by irreverent words or gestures. — <hi>and Our Government</hi>— It hath been said, that this might be by contempt to the Kings Writ,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or by <hi>Retraxit,</hi> as <hi>Beechers</hi> case is. To this I answer, That those words which are spoken to one purpose, ought not to be wrested to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and this is against the common meaning of the words, <hi>C.</hi> 4. Thou art a murderer, the Defendant shall not afterwards explain it to be a murderer of Hares, for the highest murder is intended. So here, the highest Government is intended.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It hath been objected, that — <hi>for stirring up of sedition against Us</hi>— may perhaps be but an offence Finable: But those words <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> joyned with the former words, shew this to be an offence of the highest nature; sedition is a speciall contempt. And although sedition in it self may be but a generall offence, yet here it is — <hi>Sedition against Us and Our Government</hi>—, which makes it particular. It hath been confessed by one that argued on the other side, that there is a generall in a particular. <hi>C.</hi> 4. <hi>Hollands</hi> case, there is the most generall, and there is generall in particular, as the State Ecclesiasticall. 3<hi>ly.</hi> There is more particular, as Colledges,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Deans, and Chapters. This being in a case of Return upon <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi> no precise certainty is required.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35668:369"/>
required here as in Indictment or Count, because the party ought to answer unto them; nor so much certainty is required in this as in a Bar. And the Return is not incertain; for, as it is said in <hi>Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> 202. and 193. a thing is incertain, where it may be taken indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, one way or the other. But where the intendment the one way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the intendment the other way, it is not uncertain, as it is here. The words are, —<hi>for notable contempts against Us and Our Government, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> &amp; for stirring up of sedition against Us</hi>— Here is certainty of intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one way.

                           </gap> this Return here is, &amp; yet good. The Writ concerning the taking of an Apostate is general, <hi>Quod spreto habitu Ordinis</hi>; and yet there are more sorts of Apostasies. In the Writ concerning the amoving of a Leper, the words are generall, and yet it appears by <hi>F. N. B.</hi> that there are two kinds of Lepers, one outward, and the other inward; and for the latter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Writ concerning amoving a Leper. So the Writs concerning the burning of an Heretick, and concerning the examining of an Idiot, are general; and yet there are sundry kinds of Hereticks and Idiots also. But it hath been objected, that <hi>[Sedition]</hi> is not a Law-tearm nor known in the Law, of which the Iudges can take no notice; but the words to expresse offences of this nature, are, Murder, Treason, Felony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. and that no Indictment of Sedition generally was ever seen. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, Perhaps it is true, that no Indictment was ever seen made, because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the form of an Indictment is precise, words of art are required therein, as appears in <hi>Dyer</hi> 69.261. <hi>C.</hi> 4. <hi>Vaux</hi>'s case; yet in 5 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Dyer.</hi> 69. it is said, that <hi>Furatus</hi> implies <hi>Felonicè cepit,</hi> although the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath been objected. In a Return, words by Periphrasis are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. The Warrant of a Iustice of Peace to apprehend <hi>I.

Out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which it may be gathered, that a man may be Indicted for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creancy. And it seems likewise, that an Indictment of sedition may be good, for in some cases it is Treason. I agree, <hi>Peaks</hi> case, which hath been obiected, that for these words, <hi>[seditious fellow]</hi> no action lies; and so is <hi>C.</hi> 4.19. <hi>b.</hi> because those words do not import an act to be done, but onely an inclination to do it; but if a man say such words of another, which import that he hath made sedition, they are actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as it was resolved in <hi>Phillips</hi> &amp; <hi>Badby</hi>'s case, 24 <hi>Eliz.

I agree, the case of 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Sir <hi>John Garboyls</hi> case, &amp; 42. <hi>E.</hi> 3. for in those cases, sedition was only taken adjectively, and shewes an inclination onely to do a seditious act, &amp; in such sense sedition may be applyed to other offences then treason.

And in this sense, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is no stranger in our Law; and such sedition which severs the people from the King is Treason.</p>

Perhaps the sedition mentioned in this Return is high treason, and yet the King may make it an offence Finable, for he may prosecute the offendor in what course he pleaseth; and if it be treason, then the prisoners are not baylable, by the Statute of <hi>Westm.</hi> But, suppose that it is but a Fina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offence, yet by the said Statute, those which are imprisoned for open and notorious naughtinesse shall not be bayled; the same naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is there intended high and exorbitant offence?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

Out of which case I observe two things: First, that the Iudge of this Court did cause a man to be apprehended, upon complaint made to the

The Counsell on the other side have made fractions of this Return, and divided it into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall parts, whereas the genuine construction ought to have been made upon the entire Return; for no violence ought to be offered to the Text. 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4.20. In false imprisonment, the Defendant did iustifie, and alledged severall reasons of his justification; to wit, because a man was killed, and that this was in the County of <hi>S.</hi> and that the common voice and fame was, that the Plaintiff was culpable. And this was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> held a good plea, although <hi>Bryan</hi> did there object, That the plea was double or treble; and the reason was, because twenty causes of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make but one entire cause; and indivisible unity in this ought not to be divided. So <hi>C.</hi> 8.66. <hi>Crogates.</hi> In an action of trespasse, the Defendant justifies for severall causes; and held good, because upon the matter, all of them make but one cause. <hi>C.</hi> 8.117. It is said, That it is an unjust thing, unlesse the whole Law be looked into, to judge and answer, by propounding any one particular thereof; and if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the exposition of a Law, it is uncivill in a Return to make fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of it, in the construction thereof especially, it being a Return for Information, and not for Accusation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Although the Counsell on the other side have taken this case to be within the Petition of Right, yet this is <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> to take that for granted which is the question in debate. He said, That he would not offer violence to the Petition of Right, to which the King had assented, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and which shall really be performed. But the question here is, Whether this Return be within it? and the Iudges are keepers, not masters of this pledge; and it seems, that this Return is out of the letter and meaning of the said Statute.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He said, That this was the actuall commitment of the Lords of the Privy Councill, and the habituall or virtuall commitment of the King. But because upon these two matters he put no case, nor gave any reason, but what had been put or given in the Argument of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> grand <hi>Habeas corpus, Mich.</hi> 3 <hi>Caroli.</hi> and afterwards in the House of Commons, which was reported to the Lords in the painted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (all which Arguments I heard) I have here omitted them. And for the great respect which the Law gives to the commands of the King, he put these cases, 7 <hi>H.</hi> 3. Attachment of waste against the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Dower, and the waste was assigned in the taking of fish out of a pond, and the carrying them away. The Defendant pleaded, That her second husband, by the command of the Lord the King, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> took all the fish out of the said pond to the use of the Lord the King, and held a good justification; which proves, that the command of the King there to her husband excused her of the said waste And yet it is clear, that Tenant in Dower is liable to an action of waste, for waste done in the time of her second husband: But contrary is it, where a woman is Tenant for life, and took a husband, who made waste and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35668:371"/>

For the particulars of the Return, it is — <hi>for notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts against the Government</hi>— But as to that it hath been said,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that the King hath sundry governments, to wit, Ecclesiasticall, Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, &amp;c. and it is not shewn, against which of them. This is but a cavilling exception; they might as well have excepted to this Return, because it is not shewen, that these contempts were after the last gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Pardon; that had been a better exception. The last words of the Return are, —<hi>raising sedition against Us</hi>— But as to this it hath been said, That <hi>Seditio</hi> is not a word known in the Law, and is alwaies taken either Adverbially or Adjectively, and is not a Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> To this he said, That although it is not a Substantive for the preservation, yet it is a Substantive for the destruction of a Kingdom. And he said, that he found the word <hi>[Seditio]</hi> in the Law, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of it likewise, which is, <hi>seductio populi.</hi> But it is not ever found to be taken in a good sense; it is alwaies ranked and coupled with treason, rebellion, insurrection, or such like, as it appears by all those Statutes which have been remembred on the other side.

But, under favour, for the difficulty of Law contained in it, the case cannot be said Grand. In my Argument, I will offer nothing to the Court, but that which I have seen with these eyes, and that which in my understanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> (which is much subject to mistakes) can receive no sufficient answer.</p>
                           <p>I will divide my argument into four severall heads.</p>

                           <p>For the first of these heads, 1. I will admit, that the King may commit a man. 2. That a man committed by the King is not replevisable by the Sheriff, but he is baylable by this Court, notwithstanding the Statute of <hi>Westm.</hi> 1 <hi>C.</hi> 15. And that he shall not be baylable, is against the Petition of Right; I

will not dispute it, for it is established by the Answer of the King to the said Petition. And the Arguments made to this purpose in the said Parliament, and in the Painted Chamber before both the Houses, are recorded in Parliament, to which every one may resort. But I will lay as a ground of my following Argument, that as offences are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of two natures, Capitall, or as Trespasses; so they are punished in two manners, to wit, Capitally, or by Fine or Imprisonment. For the offences of the first nature, as Treasons, and the like, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment is imposed upon the offender, onely for Custody; but for misdemeanors of the second nature, imprisonment is imposed upon him for a Punishment. Then this is my ground, That no free-man that is imprisoned, onely for misdemeanours before conviction, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in prison without bayle, if it be offered, unlesse it be in some particular cases, in which the contrary is ordained by any particular Statute.</p>

For the Warrant of the Privy Councill, which signifies the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the King to commit the prisoner; perhaps this was a good ground of the commitment, but it is no ground for the detaining of the prisoner without bail; and this the King himself hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as the antient Right of the Subject in the Petition of Right, wherefore it is not now to be disputed.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. For the Warrant of the King, as it is certified by this Return, there is not any sufficient cause contained within it, for the detaining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the prisoner in prison; for the Law being, as I have declared above, that for a misdemeanour, before conviction, no free-man may be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned before conviction, without bayl or mainprize, The sole question now is, If this Return contain within it any capitall offence; or if one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a trespasse or misdemeanour, and then the party is baylable: And for the disquisition hereof, I will consider the Return, 1. As it is divided in severall parts; 2. I will consider all those parts of it together. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 1. As it is severed in parts. The first part of it, <hi>[for notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts by him committed against Our Self and Our Government]</hi> For <hi>[contempts]</hi> all contempts are against the King, mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and against his Government. <hi>[Notable]</hi> this is all one with notorious and manifest, as appears by the Statute of <hi>Westm.</hi> 1 <hi>chap.</hi> 15. and 26 <hi>E.</hi> 3.71. which hath been remembered. And <hi>[Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble]</hi> is but an emphaticall expression of the nature of the thing, and alters it not. <hi>[Against Us]</hi> All riots, routs, batteries, and trespasses, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> are against Us, and against Our Crown and Dignity; contempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Court of Iustice, is a contempt against Us. But if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn were made here, that he was committed for a contempt made in Chancery, the party shall be bailed, as it was resolved in this Court in <hi>Michael Apsley's</hi> case, and in <hi>Ruswel's</hi> case, 13 <hi>Jac.</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn is too generall. <hi>C.</hi> 11.98. In it, the nature of the offence ought to be expressed, that the Court may iudge thereof. And <hi>[contempts]</hi> here is <hi>indilivi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>luum vagum</hi>; therefore for them, before conviction, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> party cannot be imprisoned without bayl or mainprize.</p>
                           <p>The second part of the Return is, <hi>[And for stirring up of sedition against Us]</hi> The other-side said, that <hi>[Seditio]</hi> is ever taken in the worst sense. That is true. But hence it followes not, that the party that commits it is not baylable. Every small offence is taken in the worst sense, as the stealing of an Apple, and the like; but such kind of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35668:372"/>
offendors shall not be committed without bayl. To examine the nature of this offence, which is called <hi>[Sedition]</hi> it ought to be understood, as this Return is, either as Trespasse, or as high Treason, for it cannot be intended to be petty-treason; for, petty-treason is so called, in respect of the offence done to any particular subject; but in respect of the King, it is but as a felony, therefore the Indictments for the same are, Felonious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and traiterously. And here the words are, —<hi>sedition against Us</hi>— so of necessity it ought to be intended of an offence, that more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> concerns the King. For the discussing of this matter, First, I will consider in what sense and signification this word <hi>[Seditio]</hi> is used. 2. How it shall be expounded here by the relation thereof to the King. 3. What sense these words <hi>[against Us]</hi> shall have here.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. For Sedition; it is not found in the division of offences in our Law, but as it is mingled and coupled with other offences. No In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment of Sedition onely was ever seen, nor can be shewen; routs, riots, and unlawfull assemblies, are much of the same nature with it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and do well expresse the nature of Sedition. The English word is drawn from the word <hi>[Seditio]</hi> in Latine, and the derivation of it is, as hath been observed, <hi>Se-itio,</hi> or, <hi>Seorsum-itio</hi>; and the seditious (as one saies) take a diversion, and draw others: It is used in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in Poets, Histories, and Orators, for a tumult, or hurly-burly, or uprore, or confused noise, —<hi>Seditioque recens dubioque susurro, in Liv. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 44. And in <hi>Tacitus</hi> it is taken for mutiny in an Army,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when the Army is alwaies repining at the Captain. In the Italian Language, which is the elder son of Latine, sedition and discord is all one. <hi>Numb. cap.</hi> 20.3. the Latine Translation is, <hi>Versi in seditione</hi>; the English is, <hi>chode,</hi> or <hi>murmured. Numb.</hi> 26.9. the Latine is, <hi>In seditione Corah</hi>; the English is, <hi>In the company of Corah, Numb.</hi> 27. 3. the Latine is, <hi>Nec fuit in seditione eorum</hi>; the English is, <hi>In the company or assembly of them. Judg.</hi> 12.1. the Latine Translation is, <hi>Facta est ergo seditio in Ephraim</hi>; the English Translation is, <hi>The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> men of Ephraim gathered themselves together.</hi> In the New Testament, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.40. <hi>Seditio</hi> in the <hi>Latine</hi> is translated <hi>uprore,</hi> or <hi>meeting. Act.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Facta est ergo seditio, &amp;c.</hi> and it is translated <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention</hi> and <hi>disputation. Act.</hi> 24.5. <hi>Tertullus</hi> the Orator accuseth <hi>Paul</hi> for moving <hi>sedition</hi>; and the subsequent words are, <hi>A ring-leader of the sect of the Pharisees</hi>; so that his sedition there was but a schism: And the words there are in a manner the very same with ours here; there it was, <hi>for moving</hi>; here, <hi>for stirring of sedition. Seditio,</hi> as an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> approved Author, saies, imports, <hi>discordiam,</hi> to wit, when the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one body fight one against another. The Lord of <hi>St. Albans,</hi> who was lately the Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and was a Lawyer, and great States-man likewise, and well knew the acceptation of this word <hi>[Sedition]</hi> in our Law, hath made an Essay of Sedition, and the Title of the Essay is, <hi>Of Seditions and Tumults:</hi> the whole Essay deserves the reading. And there is a Prayer in the Letany, —<hi>From sedition and heresie, &amp;c.</hi> So that there Sedition is taken as a kind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of Sect.</p>
                           <p>This being the naturall signification of the word, then the next la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour shall be to see, if any thing in our Law crosse this exposition. And it seems clearly, that there is not. 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.

And this is not made trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by the said Statute, although the said Statute be now repealed by the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 4. 1 and 2 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar. c.</hi> 3. which is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

And in an Indictment upon the said Statute, (which see <hi>Cook's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, f.</hi> 352.353.) there are the words —<hi>rebellionem &amp; seditionem movere</hi>; and yet it is but felony, 35 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. made against seditious Sectaries. Also there are certain Books and Authorities in Law, which expresse the nature of this word Sedition, <hi>C.</hi> 4.13. the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                              <hi>Cromwell's</hi> case. In an action for those words, You like of those that maintain seditions against the Queens proceedings, the Defendant pleaded, That he intended the maintenance of a seditious Sermon; and this was adjudged a good plea and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ustification. From which it followes, that the Seditious Sermon mentioned in the Declaration, and the maintaining of sedition against the Queen, is all of one signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for if they might have been taken in a different sense, the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; had not been good. <hi>Phillips</hi> and <hi>Badby</hi>'s case, which is in <hi>C.</hi> 4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 19. <hi>a.</hi> which was objected by Serjeant <hi>Berkley,</hi> makes strongly for me; for there an action upon the case was brought by a person, for those words, <hi>[Thou hast made a seditious Sermon, and moved the people to sedition this day]</hi> And although it were there adjudged that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lay, yet the reason of the Iudgment is observable, which was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the words scandalize the Plaintiff in his profession; which imply, that if they had not scandalized him in his profession, no action would have lain. And ordinary words, if they scandalize a man in his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> are actionable; as to say to a Iudge, that he is a corrupt man; or to a Merchant, that he is a Bank-rupt; although if they were spoken to another man, they would not bear an action. And although the Book say, that no act followed there; yet if the matter objected had been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the very will had been punishable, and, by consequence, a great slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But it is observed, that words which imply an inclination onely to sedition, are not actionable, as, Seditious knave; but inclination to treason is treason, therefore words which imply it are actionable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> And also for divers words, an action upon the case will lye, which induce not treason or felony; as, for calling a woman Whore, by which she loseth her marriage, and such like. Then sedition is no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in it self, but the aggravation of an offence; and no Indictment (as I have said afore) was ever seen of this singly by it self. <hi>Tr.</hi> 21. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>roll.</hi> 23. Sir <hi>John Garbut's</hi> case, which was put before by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>

the Indictment was in prejudice of his Crown, and in manifest sedition, and yet the offence there was but a Robbery. It is true, that upon his arraignment he stood mute, therefore the Roll is, that he was put to penance, that is, so strong and hard pain; and this proves, that it was not treason; for if a man arraigned of treason stand mute, yet the usuall judgment of treason shall be given on him. And it is true also, that he cannot have his Clergy, because <hi>insidiator viarum</hi> was in the Indictment; which if it was, outs the party of his Clergy, untill the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 2. as is observed in <hi>C.</hi> 11. <hi>Alexander Poulter</hi>'s case. And upon the same <hi>Roll</hi> of 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. there are four other Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the same nature, where <hi>[Seditiosè]</hi> is contained in them. <hi>Anno</hi> 1585, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> sent a Letter (which I have seen by the hands of the noble Antiquary, Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>) to the Maior of <hi>London,</hi> for the suppressing of divers seditious Libels, which were published against her Princely Government; and yet in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the Letter it appears, that they were onely against the Earl <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and this was to be published onely by Proclamation in <hi>London.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>numb.</hi> 11. and 13. The Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> preferred a Petition to the King in Parliament, in which he confesseth, that he had not kept his Majesties Laws as a liege subject; and also confesseth the gathering of power, and the giving of Liveries: Wherefore he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned the worship of the King (for so are the words) for his grace. The King, upon this Petition, demanded the opinion of the Lords of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Parliament, and of the Iudges assistant, if any thing contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the said Petition were treason, or no; and it was resolved by them all, that nothing as it is mentioned in the said Petition was treason, but great misdemeanors; and yet truly, though not fully there mentioned, it was a great rebellion and insurrection. But they adjudged according to the said Petition, as you are now to judge upon the Return, as it is made here. In <hi>Mich.</hi> 33 <hi>Eliz. Cawdry</hi>'s case, Sedition and Schism were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> described, As schism is a separation from the unity of the Church, so sedition is a separation from the unity of the Common-wealth. And an Author saies, that a seditious person differs from a schismatick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the one opposeth the spirituall truth, the other the temporall: And as schism of it self is not heresie, so sedition without other adjuncts is not treason. <hi>Bracton f.</hi> 112, 113, 118. hath been objected, that he makes sedition treason: I will grant to them, <hi>Hengham</hi> also, who is to the same purpose; for in those Books it is called, <hi>Seditio Regis &amp; Regni.</hi>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> To them I answer, 1. That they are obscure. For, what signifies <hi>sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Regis,</hi> or <hi>tumultus Regis</hi>? shall it be the same thing in sense with <hi>seditio contra Regem</hi>? It seems, that the said Authors neither remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Law nor Language. 2. Although they reckon sedition amongst the crimes <hi>lesae Majestatis,</hi> yet that is not to be regarded, for they are obsolete Authors, and are not esteemed as Authors in our Law, as it is in <hi>Pl.</hi> 356. and <hi>C.</hi> 8.35. but they may be used for ornament, and they are good marks to shew to us, how the Law was then taken, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> not to declare how the Law is at this day; they are no binding autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and if they be, yet we have them of our side likewise: For in his 14 Book <hi>Glanvill</hi> saies, That a man accused of such a crime shall be bayled, and that the Accuser shall give pledges. And <hi>Bracton</hi> saies, That if no accuser appears, they shall be set at liberty. And <hi>Hengham</hi>
                              <pb n="33" facs="tcp:35668:373"/>
reckons amongst the crimes <hi>laesae Majestatis,</hi> the breach of the Peace, and so does <hi>Glanvil</hi> also. <hi>Fleta,</hi> who was a follower of <hi>Bracton,</hi> and transscribes much <hi>verbatim</hi> out of him, calls Sedition, <hi>Seductionem</hi> of the Lord the King. And 12 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. the Statute of <hi>Rutland,</hi> which prescribes Lawes for <hi>Wales,</hi> enacts, That the Sheriff shall enquire in his Turn, <hi>de seductoribus Domini Regis</hi>; and it is not apparent, whether he intend those which seduce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the King, or his People. And in latter times, <hi>Seditio</hi> is called <hi>Sedutio.</hi> In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> being a great and potent Peer, and the King standing in awe of him, caused him, with twenty four others of great quality, to enter in an obligation of twenty thousand pound (which Obligation is in the hands of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>) unto Him, that if the said Earl knew Treason, Sedution, Losse, &amp;c. to be intended to the King, that he should reveal it. 3.

And also he shewes divers Treasons against the King, as, the deflouring of the Kings eldest Daughter, &amp;c. but not a word of Sedition. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that Sedition imports a greater offence than Tumult, yet there is no colour to say, that it is Treason; for, 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. is a flat Barre (that I may use the <hi>Inner-Temple</hi> phrase) to any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thing to be treason, which is not contained in it, unlesse it be made treason by any speciall Act afterwards, and 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. does not make it Treason. <hi>Stamford</hi> cites <hi>Glanvill,</hi> and <hi>Bracton,</hi> and other antient Books, to shew what, was Treason before the said Statute, and what not: And be saies, That it was a great doubt what shall be said Treason; saving that all agree, that any thing that tends to the death of the King was Treason. 3<hi>ly.</hi> Now examine the words, —<hi>against Us</hi>— those words make not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the crime more heinous, as the case is. I agree, that if the words had been —<hi>Sedition to take away the life of the King</hi>— it would have been treason; yea, the very thought of treason is treason, (though none can judge thereof till it be produced in act) 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6.47. <hi>b.</hi> by

                              <hi>Newton,</hi> 13 <hi>Jac. B. R. John Owen's</hi> case, the writing of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereby he intended the death of the King, was treason; but it is not expressed, that the raising of this sedition was with such intent, whereby this differs from all the cases which can be put, in which there is such an intent of the death of the King. Also this, Raising of sedition against Us, shall not be intended treason; for if it had been so, the King would have so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest it by the word Treason: For, as in his gracious dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he will not extend a fault beyond the magnitude thereof, so he will give to every offence the true and genuine name. If the Return had been, —<hi>against Our Person</hi>— it had been more certain, that it concerned the King immediately; this, may be against any point of his Government. And the proper and naturall signification of the words, —<hi>against Us</hi>— is as much as, Against Our Authority, Our superintendency, against Our Peace, Crown, and Dignity, which are the usuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> words in every Indictment of Felony. Every breach of the Peace is against the King. The usuall Return upon every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Writ out of this Court, is, That the party be before Us; and contempt to this Court is, Contempt against Us, and it is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sedition to the King. Contempts to the Court of Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, are Contempts against Us; and upon them, Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of rebellion issue; and if the parties are brought in upon such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Commissions, yet they are baylable untill their conviction. The King styles himself, <hi>Us,</hi> in Writs; and every disobedience to any Writ may be said, <hi>Sedition against Us.</hi> Routs, riots, illoyall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, may well be said and called, <hi>Sedition against Us</hi>: And for such offences, a man shall not be restrained of his liberty upon an <hi>[it may be]</hi> Such a Return is necessary, by which the Court may be truly informed of the offence. For the Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> is, to submit and receive what the Court shall ordain. And this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Return of this nature is not to be compared to Writs which are generall, and make a brief narration of the matter, and are pursued and explained by subsequent declarations. And yet I urge not, that the Return ought to be as certain as an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for an Indictment of Murder is not good, if it lack the word <hi>Murdravit.</hi> But the Return upon an <hi>Habeas corpus, q. d. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecit I. S.</hi> upon prepensed malice, is good; for the nature of the thing is expressed, although the formall word be wanting; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> out of the Return, the substance of the offence ought alwaies to appear, which appears not here. But it hath been said by the other side, That, let the cause in the Return be as it will, yet is it not traversable, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6.54. and I confesse it. But as <hi>C.</hi> 11. <hi>James Baggs</hi> case is, the Return ought to have certainty so much in it, that, if it be false, the party grieved may have his action upon the case. And the grievance complained of in the Petition of Right is, that upon such Return no cause was certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that is, no such cause upon which any Indictment might be drawn up; for we never understand, that the party shall be tryed upon the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> but that upon the matter contained within it, and Indictment shall be made, and he shall have his try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all upon it. And yet it is clear, and it hath been agreed of all
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35668:374"/>
hands, in the Argument of the grand <hi>Habeas corpus, Mich.</hi> 3. <hi>Car.</hi> in this Court, that if the cause be certified upon the Return of the <hi>Habeas corpus,</hi> that the Court may judge of the legality of that cause. 2. Consider the parts of this Return, as they are coupled together, —<hi>for notable contempts by him committed against Our Self and Our Government, and for stirring of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against Us</hi>— Upon the entire Return, the King joynes sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with notable contempts, so that it is as much as if he had said, that <hi>Sedition</hi> is one of the notable contempts mentioned in the first part of the Return, so that he makes it but a contempt. For the generality and incertainty of the Return, I refer my self to the cases put by Mr. <hi>Ask,</hi> and I will not waive any of them. True it is, if the Return had been, that it was for Treason, he had not been bailable but by the discretion of the Court, and such Return would have been good; but it is not so of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                              <hi>Gard.</hi> 157. Treason is applyed to a petty offence, to the breach of trust by a Guardian in <hi>Socage</hi>; but it is not treason. And so sedition is of far lesse nature then treason, and is oftentimes taken of a trespasse; it is not treason of it self, nor <hi>seditiosè</hi> was never used in an Indictment of treason. It was not treason before the 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. nor can it be treason; for 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. is a flat Barre (as I have said before) to all other offences to be treason, which are not contained within the said Act, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by any Statute afterwards. And there are offences which are more heinous in their nature then sedition is, which are not treason, as Insurrections, &amp;c. which see in the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. 5 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. 17 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. and by 3 and 4 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. the assembly of twelve persons to attempt the alteration of any Law, and the continuance together by the space of an hour, being commanded to return, is made treason; which Act was continued by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of 1 <hi>Mar. cap.</hi> 12. and 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 16. but now is expired by her death, and is not now in force, (although the contrary be conceived by some) which I pray may be well observed. By the Statute of 14 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. rebellious taking of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of the King is made treason, if they be not delivered &amp;c. which shewes clearly, that such taking of Castles in its nature was not treason. But the said Statute is now expired; and also all Statutes, creating new treasons, are now repealed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> But, for a conclusion of this part of my Argument, I will cite a case, which, I think expresse, in the point, or more strong then the case in question. And it was <hi>M.</hi> 9. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>roll.</hi> 39. <hi>B. R. Peter Russells</hi> case; he was committed to prison by the Deputy-Iustice of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> because he was accused by one <hi>William Solyman</hi> of sedition, and other things touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King: And hereupon a Commission issued out of the Chancery, to enquire, if the said <hi>Peter Russell</hi> behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> well or seditiously against the King, and by the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition it was found, that he behaved himself well. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> out of this Court, his body was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, but no cause. But the said Inquisition was brought hither out of Chancery, and for that no cause of his caption
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35668:375"/>
was returned, he prayed Delivery; but the Court would not deliver him, till it knew the cause of his Commitment: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (taking no regard of the said Inquisition) they now send a Writ to the now Iustice of <hi>Wales,</hi> to certifie the cause of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment. And thereupon he made this Return, That the foresaid <hi>Peter Russell</hi> was taken, because one <hi>William Solyman</hi> charged him, that he had committed divers seditions against the Lord the King; and for that cause he was detained, and for no other. And because the Return <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> mentions not what sedition in speciall, he was bayled, but not dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And I desire the baylment of the prisoner onely, and not his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. I desire that the case be well observed. In the said case, there was an actuall sedition against the King; here is onely a stirring up of sedition. The words of the said Award are, <hi>Videtur curiae</hi>; which are the solemn words of a Iudgment, given upon great deliberation. There it was, —<hi>for other things concerning Us</hi>— This is all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> one as if it had said, —<hi>for other things against Us</hi>— Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the King, and, Against the King, are all one, as appears by 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>de Clero, Stamf.</hi> 124. <hi>Westm.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>Bracton, f.</hi> 119. 14 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. And the words of the Iudgment in the said case, were not, —<hi>dimittitur</hi>— but,—<hi>ideò dimittendus</hi>— which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the right of the party to be bayled. The said case in some things was more particular then our case, and more strong; for, there was an Accuser to boot, which wants in our case. There, true it is, that he was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> committed by the Iustice of <hi>Wales,</hi> and here by the King himself; but this makes no difference, as to this Court: for, be the commitment by the King himself, or by any other, if it be not upon just cause, the party may be bayled in this Court. And for the Inquisition, which is mentioned, it was no Tryall in the case; nor did the Court give any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thereto. To detain the prisoner by the command of the King sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is against the Petition of Right; but it being coupled with the cause, the cause is to be considered, and the truth of the cause is to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> intended, as well where it is mentioned, to be by an inferiour Iudge, as where by the King himself, for it is traversable neither in the one nor other. And 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>roll.</hi> 37. <hi>B. R.</hi> and 1 <hi>H.</hi> 8 <hi>roll.</hi> 8. <hi>Harrisons</hi> case resolv'd, that a man committed by the command of the King, is baylable. And 33 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was resolved by all the Iustices of <hi>England,</hi> which I have viewed in chief Iustice <hi>Andersons</hi> Book, under his own hand, and it was produced in Parliament, That all men committed by the Privy Councill are baylable, if the commitment be not for high treason. In all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cases of commitment, an accuser is understood. Suppose that the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation mentioned in <hi>Russel's</hi> case of sedition, had been an accusation of treason, then the Iudges ought not to have bayled him of right, and no man will say, but that the said accusation was a good cause to commit him. But the discovery of the offence ought to be afterward in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, I come to the objections which have been made on the contrary.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> It was objected, That this was a case of great consequence. I confesse it, but this consequence is not to the King; for if it be truly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, then they might have returned Treason, and then the party was not to be bayled of right, till there should be a failer of prosecution; as was lately in <hi>Melvins</hi> case, who was bailed for lack of prosecution, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn being for high treason.</p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <pb n="37" facs="tcp:35668:375"/>2<hi>ly.</hi> It was objected, that there can be no conviction, as this case is, therefore there ought to be coercive power to restrain the prisoner. This is strange newes to me, that there shall be any offence, for which a man cannot be convict. And if there can be no conviction, it hence followes, that there is no offence; and if there be no offence, there ought by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to be no imprisonment.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 3<hi>ly.</hi> The case of 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7.8. hath been objected, that a Iustice of Peace may commit Rioters, without bayl. I confesse it, for this is by force of a Statute which ordains it.</p>
                           <p n="4">4<hi>ly.</hi> It hath been objected, That if a house be on fire, it is lawfull to pull down the neighbours house, for the prevention of further mischief; and the cases of 22 <hi>ass.</hi> and 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. that every man may justifie the coercion of a mad-man. I answer, That these cases are true, for of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and no other evasion: but here, bayl is proffered, which is body for body. Fire is swift, and cannot be punished, and no caution can be obtained thereof. But observe the true inference and consequence of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this Argument, If my house be on fire, my neighbours house must be pulled down; Mr <hi>Selden</hi> is seditious, <hi>ergo,</hi> Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> his neighbour must be imprisoned.</p>
                           <p n="5">5<hi>ly.</hi> It hath been objected out of <hi>Br. Treason,</hi> 24. 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> That the said Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. is taken largely, and that the detaining of a Castle or Fortresse is treason. To this I answer, That the bare detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Castle is not treason, unlesse it be with intention of the death <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the King; but the taking of a Castle is treason. And the case there meant by <hi>Brook</hi> is <hi>Constables</hi> case, <hi>Dy.</hi> 128. And I confesse, 13 <hi>Eliz. Dy.</hi> 298. Doctor <hi>Story</hi>'s case, that conspiracy to invade the Kingdom, is treason; for this cannot be without great danger of the death of the King; for, —<hi>arma tenenti, Omnia dat qui justa negat</hi>— and all those Indictments were, that they intended the death of the King, but no such intention is expressed here.</p>
                           <p n="6">6<hi>ly.</hi> It hath been objected, That this case is out of the Petition of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Right, because in this Return there is a cause shewed. But the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance whereupon the Petition of Right was framed, was, where no cause was returned. It is true, that the grievance goes no further, but where no cause was returned, for, that was the grievance at that time. But the words of the Petition of Right are further, —<hi>without being charged with any thing, to which they might make answer by the Law</hi>— which implies, that such cause ought to be contained in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, which being put into an Indictment, the party may have his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thereto.</p>
                           <p n="7">7<hi>ly.</hi> It was objected, that the Return shall not be construed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by fractions. I answer, That we need not make such an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; for the joynt-construction thereof makes more for us, then the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall, as is shewed before.</p>
                           <p n="8">8<hi>ly.</hi> That a generall Return is sufficient, and it need not have tearms of Art in it, as an Indictment ought to have. For answer, I confesse it; but I affirm, as above, that a Return ought to be so particular, that the nature of the offence ought to appear out of it: And it is not to be compared to generall Writs, as, <hi>Apostatâ capiendo, Idiota exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando, Leproso amovendo,</hi> and the like: for those Writs are good enough, because they contain the very matter. And although it hath been said, that there are two kinds of Lepers, yet I never heard but of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35668:376"/>
one. And the Writ, <hi>de Haeretico comburendo,</hi> is generall, and good, because it is but a Writ of Execution upon a Iudgment, given by the Spirituall power. But because they might not meddle with the blood of any man, the execution is by the Secular power.</p>
                           <p n="9">9<hi>ly.</hi> It hath been objected out of 30 <hi>ass. p.</hi> 19. that the King would have one drawn and hanged, for bringing in into <hi>England</hi> the Buls of the Pope. But the Book answers it self, for he was not drawn and hanged.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                           </p>
                           <p n="10">10<hi>ly.</hi> The Statute of <hi>Westm.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. was objected. But as oft as that Statute is objected, I will alwaies cry out, <hi>The Petition of Right, the Petition of Right!</hi> as the King of <hi>France</hi> cryed out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>France, France!</hi> when all the severall Dominions of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> were objected to him.</p>
                           <p n="11">11<hi>ly.</hi> A curious distinction hath been taken by Serjeant <hi>Davenport,</hi> between stirring <hi>To</hi> sedition, and stirring <hi>Up</hi> sedition; for the first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an inclination onely to do it, the second implies an act done.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> But this is too nice, for if a man stir up sedition, or to sedition, if it be with intention of the death of the King, the one and the other is treason.</p>
                           <p n="12">12<hi>ly.</hi> The opinion of <hi>Fortescue</hi> in 31 <hi>H.</hi> 6.10. <hi>b.</hi> hath been objected, That for an offence done to the Court, a man may be committed before conviction. To this I answer, 1<hi>st.</hi> That the Book does not say, That he shall be committed without bayl. 2<hi>ly.</hi> The offence being done in face of the Court, the very view of the Court is a conviction in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Law.</p>
                           <p n="13">13<hi>ly.</hi> There was objected the 24 of <hi>E.</hi> 3.23. Sir <hi>Thomas Fitchet</hi>'s case, who, for going armed in the Palace, was committed by this Court, without bayl or mainprize; which seems to be the strongest and hardest case that hath been objected. But the answer to it is clear, and undeniable, for the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. is, That if any one come armed before the Iustices, he shall forfeit his Armour, and shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned during the Kings pleasure; so that by the expresse purview of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Statute, such a man is not baylable. So my conclusion remains firm, notwithstanding any of those objections, That the prisoner here being committed before conviction of any offence, (it being not possible to understand this offence treason) is baylable. And that he is baylable here, I will offer two other reasons: 1<hi>st.</hi> The Return here is for sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and there is an information in the Star-chamber against the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, for seditious practises against the King and his Government.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> I will not affirm, that they are the same offence, but there is some probability that they are the self-same; and if they be the same offence, then the sedition here intended is not treason, and so the party is bayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 2<hi>ly.</hi> This Prisoner was ready at this Bar the last Term, and here was a Grand-Iury at Bar the last Term, and here was the Kings Counsell present, who are most watchfull for the King; and yet an Indictment was not preferred to them against this Prisoner. Which things induce me to be of opinion, that the offence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> here mentioned in this Return is not treason, or so great as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the other side. I will remember one case which perhaps may be objected, (and yet I think they will not object it) and so conclude, 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. Parliament Roll 14. in the printed Statute, <hi>c.</hi> 3. and 5. where it appears, that divers questions were propounded by the King
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35668:376"/>
to <hi>Tresilian</hi> and <hi>Bealknap,</hi> the two chief Iustices, and to the other Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices: one of which questions was, How they are to be punished, who resisted the King in exercising his royall power, &amp;c? And the answer of the Iudges was, <hi>una voce,</hi> that they are to be punished as traitors; and 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 21. this opinion was confirmed. But afterwards in 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 3. and 4. and 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. in the Parliament-Roll, <hi>numb.</hi> 66, 67 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Iudges were questioned for their opinion, in Parliament. They answered, That they were threatned and enforced to give this opinion, and that they were in truth of the contrary opinion. And <hi>Bealknap</hi> said, That he acquainted and protested to the Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> aforehand, that his opinion was alwaies to the contrary. But the Parliament was not content with these excuses, but they were all adjudged Traitors; and <hi>Tresilian</hi>'s end is known to all, and <hi>Bealknap</hi> was banished; for his Wife in 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. brought a Writ, without naming her husband, because he was banished. And the said Statute of 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed. Therefore upon the whole matter I conclude, that the Prisoner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ought to be bayled.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>On the same day, Sir <hi>Miles Hubbart,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Valentine,</hi> and <hi>Densill Hollis</hi> Esquires, were at Bar, upon an <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the severall Prisons; and their Counsell was ready at the Bar to have argued the case for them also: But because the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn was made as above, they said, That all of them would rely upon this Argument made by Mr. <hi>Littleton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The case of the grand <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> for Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and others,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Sir Rob. Heath, the Kings At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against Mr. Selden.</hi>
                           </note> was now argued by <hi>Heath,</hi> the Kings Atturney Generall, That this Return was good, and that the parties ought not to be bayled:</p>
                        <q>
                           <p> And that within the Return there appears good cause of their commitment, and of their detaining also. The case is great in expectation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence: and concerns the liberty of the Subject on the one part, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Argument is plausible; and on the other part it concerns the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> safety and soveraignty of the King, which is a thing of great weight. The consideration of both pertaines to you the Iudges, without sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the one, or too much elevating the other. The Return, which now is before you, is entire; but I will first consider it as divided in parts. First, The first Warrant, which is that of the Lords of the Privy Councill, is generall, that it was by the command of the Lord the King: and this in former times was held a very good Return, when due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and reverence was given to Government; but, <hi>Tempora mutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> 
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And this Return is no way weakened by any latter opinion; for notwithstanding that the first commitment of a man may be generall: for if upon the Return, the true cause should be revealed to the Gaoler, by this means, faults should be published and divulged before their punishment, and so the complices of the fact will escape; and it is not fit that the Gaoler, which is but a ministeriall Officer, should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the secrets of the cause. But when the cause is returned in Court, more certainty is requisite; for then (as it hath been objected) something ought to be expressed to which the party may answer, and upon which the Court may ground their Iudgment. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it hath been much insisted upon the Petition of Right; but the Law is not altered by it, but remains as it was before. And this will appear upon the view of all the parts of the Petition. 1<hi>st.</hi> The occasion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35668:377"/>
of the Petition, and the grievance is shewed in these words, <hi>Divers of your Subjects have been of late imprisoned, without any cause shewed, &amp;c.</hi> But in this Return there is a cause shewed, to which the parties may answer. Then secondly, the prayer of the Petition is, That no free-man, in any such manner as before is mentioned, be imprisoned or detained; that is, such manner of imprisonment, the ground whereof doth not appear. Then the answer of the King to the Petition was in sundry words, 2 <hi>Jun.</hi> 1628. in these words, <hi>The King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> willeth, that right be done according to the Lawes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of the Realm, &amp;c.</hi> Which answer gave not satisfaction. And afterwards his answer was in a Parliamentary-phrase, <hi>Soit droit fait come est desire.</hi> But afterwards on the 26 of <hi>June,</hi> 1628. the King expressed his intention and meaning in the said An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. It must needs be conceived, that I have granted no new, but onely confirmed the antient liberties of My Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, &amp;c. A Petition in Parliament is not a Law, yet it is for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and dignity of the King, to observe and keep it faithfully; but it is the duty of the people not to stretch it, beyond the words and intention of the King. And no other construction can be made of the Petition, then to take it as a Confirmation of the antient liberties and rights of the Subjects. So that now the case remains in the same quality and degree, as it was before the Petition. Therefore we will now consider, how the Law was taken before the Petition, and for the discussing thereof, we will examine the second part of the Return, and in it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> two things, 1<hi>st.</hi> if the Return, as it is now made, shall be intended for true: 2. admit that it is true, if there be any offence contained within it, which is good to detain the Prisoners. For the first, It is clear, that the cause shall be intended true which is returned, though in truth it be false; and so are 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6.44. and <hi>F. Corpus cum causa,</hi> 2. and <hi>C.</hi> 11. <hi>Baggs</hi> case. 2<hi>ly.</hi> It seems, that there is such a crime contained in this Return which is a good cause for detaining the Prisoners. It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is true, that it was confidently urged in Parliament, in <hi>tertio Caroli,</hi> that generall Returns, that were committed by the command of the Lord the King, are not good; and that those Arguments remain as Monuments on record, in the Upper House of Parliament; but I will not admit them for Law. But I will remember what was the opinion of former times, 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6.52. by <hi>Newton,</hi> a man committed by the command of the King, is not replevisable. And the opinion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be intended of a Replevin made by the Sheriff, because the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> case there is upon a Return in this Court. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6.28. <hi>Poyning</hi>'s case, where the Return was, That he was committed by the Lords of the Councill, and it was admitted good. It is true, that this opinion is grounded upon <hi>Westm.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. but I will not insist upon it. But the constant opinion hath alwaies been, that a man committed by the command of the King, is not baylable. In 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6.44. it is said, That if one be taken upon the Kings suit, the Court will not grant a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeas.</hi> The contrary opinion is grounded upon <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> is a generall Law, and literally hath no sense to that purpose; and it is contrary to the usuall practise in criminall causes, in which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment is alwaies lawfull untill the tryall, although it be made by a Iustice of Peace, or Constable. And that a man committed by the command of the King, or Privy Councill, is not baylable, he cited
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35668:377"/>
1 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> Sir <hi>John Brocket</hi>'s case. 8 <hi>Jac.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Cesar</hi>'s case. 12. <hi>Jac. James Demetrius</hi>'s case. 43 <hi>Eliz. William Rinch</hi>'s case. And in the case <hi>M.</hi> 36 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and 4 and 5 <hi>Eliz. Richard Thimelby</hi>'s case. And said, that there are innumerable presidents to this purpose. <hi>M.</hi> 21 and 22 <hi>Eliz.</hi> upon the return of an <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> it appears, that <hi>Michael Page</hi> was committed by the command of the Lord the King, but was not delivered; and after was arraigned in this Court, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and lost his hand. And at the same time, <hi>Stubbs</hi> was committed by the command of the Lord the King, for seditious words and rumors, and he lost his hand also upon the same tryall. <hi>M.</hi> 17 and 18. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Upon <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> for <hi>John Loan,</hi> it was returned, That he was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for divulging sundry seditious writings, and he was remanded. And 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7 <hi>roll.</hi> 6. <hi>Rugs</hi> case; and <hi>roll.</hi> 13. <hi>Chase</hi>'s case, where the Return was, that they were committed by the command of the Lord the King, and they were not delivered; and this was also the opinion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in this Court, <hi>M.</hi> 3. <hi>Car.</hi> And after the said time the Law is not altered, and so I hope neither are your opinions. But to consider the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cause mentioned in the Return, I will not rely upon the first part of the words, although they be of great weight, but onely upon the last words, —<hi>for stirring up of sedition against Us</hi>— But it hath been objected, that <hi>Sedition</hi> is not a word known in the Law: But I marvell, that the signification of the word is not understood, when it is joyned with the words —<hi>agains Us</hi>— this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ought to be understood, Sedition against the King, in his politick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. <hi>[Sedition]</hi> hath sundry acceptations, according to the subject handled, as it appears <hi>C.</hi> 4. Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s case, which hath been cited. If it be spoken of a man, that he is seditious; if it be of a company in <hi>London,</hi> it shall be understood sedition in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; if it be spoken of a Souldier, it shall be taken for mutinous. Mr. <hi>Littleton,</hi> who argued this case very well, said, That <hi>Tacitus</hi> 
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> useth this word, and it is true; and he saies, That there are two manners of Seditions, <hi>Seditio armata, &amp; togata</hi>; and the last is more dangerous then the former. But couple it with the subsequent words here, <hi>[against Us]</hi> the interpretation and sense thereof is easie, <hi>&amp; loquendum ut vulgus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> shewes the acceptation of this word in divers places of Scripture, and I will not reject them, for they make for me: 20 <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. the Latine is, —<hi>populi versi sunt in seditionem</hi>; and it is Englished —<hi>murmuring</hi>— <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but clearly it was high treason against their Governour, and God himselfe. 26 <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. <hi>in seditione Corah</hi>— it is manifest, that that was a great Insurrection. 12 <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. <hi>Facta est ergo seditio in Ephraim, The Ephramites rose against Jephta</hi>; and he at the same time was their Iudge and Governour, so it was the heighth of Insurrection. It is true, that in 15 <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Facta est seditio</hi>; and in some Translations it is, <hi>Orta est repughantia non parva,</hi> for it may be taken in severall senses. 19 <hi>Acts</hi> 40. the Town-Clerk there knew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> not how to answer for <hi>this daies sedition,</hi> or insurrection; and no doubt he was in great perill, for it was a great insurrection; and I wish the greater ones were as circumspect as he was. 24 <hi>Act.</hi> 5. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus accused Paul of sedition,</hi> and doubtlesse it was conceived a great offence, if you consider the time and other circumstances, for they were Heathens and Romans. And although he in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35668:378"/>
truth taught the Gospell of God, yet he was taken for a pestilent fellow, and as a perswader to shake off Government. <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Corona, c.</hi> 2. rancks Sedition amongst the crimes <hi>laesae Majestatis.</hi> But it hath been objected, that if it be a capitall offence, it ought to be felony or treason. To this I say, That it cannot be felony, but it may be treason, for any thing that appears. It is true, that by the statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. treasons are declared, and nothing shallbe said treason, which is not comprised within the said Statute, unlesse it be declared so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by Act of Parliament. But upon indictment of treason, such sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this may be given in evidence, and perhaps will prove trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And the Return is not, That he was seditious, which shewes onely an inclination; but that he stirred up sedition, which may be treason, if the evidence will bear it. In divers Acts of Parliament, notice is taken of this word <hi>[Seditio]</hi> and it is alwaies coupled with Insurrection or Rebellion, as appears by the Statutes of 5 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. 17 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8. 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 9. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 14. 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 1 and 2 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar. c.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 7. 13 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. 23 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. 27 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. and 35 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. all which were cited before, and they prove, that <hi>[Sedition]</hi> is a word well known in the Law, and of dangerous consequence, and which cannot be expounded in good sense. Wherefore the nature of the offence, I leave it to the Court. But out of these Statutes it appears, that there is a narrow difference between it and treason, if there be any at all.</p>
                           <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> As to the Objections which have been made, I will give a short <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> answer to them.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. It was objected, That every imprisonment is either for custody or punishment, the last is alwaies after the judgment given for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and if it be but for custody, the party upon tender of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient mainpernors is baylable. I confesse, that this difference is true, but not in all respects; for I deny, that a man is alwaies baylable, when imprisonment is imposed upon him for custody: For, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is for two intents, the one is, that the party which had offended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> should not avoid the judgment of Law; the second is, that he shall not do harm in the interim during his tryall; and the Law is carefull in this point. But it hath been said, That although the party be bayled, yet he is imprisoned. I deny that, for so is 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4.6. If the party come not at the day, the Bayl shall be imprisoned; but yet the Bayl shall not suffer the same punishment which ought to have been inflicted upon the party; as if it were for treason, the Bayl shall not answer for the fault,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but onely for the body. Serjeant <hi>Berkley</hi> did well call a seditious man an Incendiary to the Government; and, as <hi>commune incendium,</hi> is to be restrained of his liberty. And he put 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. and 22. <hi>ass.</hi> 56. that a mad-man may be restrained, to prevent the hurt he would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise do himself and others. A seditious man is as a mad-man in the publick State of the Common-wealth, and therefore ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained. And it appears by the Writ, <hi>de Leproso amovendo,</hi> that a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is to be removed, and in a manner imprisoned, for the contagion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of the disease; and this is for the safeguard of others, lest his Leprosy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect others. The application is easie. And by the Statute of 1 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 33. is restrained to keep within doors; &amp; if he go abroad, any man may iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the killing of him. The infection of sedition is as dangerous, as any of these diseases, therefore it is not safe to let seditious men to bayl, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35668:378"/>
at libertyty, &amp; in dangerous cases, the wisest way is, to make all safe. In all cases of this nature, much is left to the discretion of the Court. The case of <hi>M.</hi> 9 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>roll.</hi> 39. <hi>Russell</hi> hath been objected, to be in the point; I have viewed the Record of that case, and although it be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally, yet it is not materially to this purpose; for the commitment was by a Iustice of <hi>North Wales,</hi> upon the accusation of an accuser; and it was within a short time after the Statute of 5 <hi>E.</hi> 3. by which it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ordained, That none should be imprisoned upon the accusation of one accuser: But here the detainment is by the King himself, for stirring up of sedition. And there the Return was, That he was accused of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Undecencies, where the latter word doth qualifie the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And there issued a Writ of good behaviour, (as the use was) to enquire of the truth of the offence; and it was found, that there was no such offence: and then upon the same Return again he was set at liberty; so that the case there was speciall, and the manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> speciall. And I desire, that one thing may be observed, that <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell</hi> came in here upon the <hi>Habeas corpus,</hi> 20 <hi>Sept.</hi> but was not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered untill <hi>Hillary</hi> Term following. And for 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s case which was objected, that the generall accusation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers treasons was not legall. That is true, because it was in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and in the nature of an accusation; and being in a Court of Iustice, it had been unjust to condemn a man before his Tryall; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and yet this Court, upon probability of a fault, doth oft-times restrain a man before conviction. But it hath been objected in this case, They have been a long time imprisoned, and no proceedings against them, It is well known, that there have been some proceedings against them. and they declined them; and also more then three months is requisite for the preparation of such proceedings, and the King intends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against them in convenient time. And some that were offendors in the same kind are already delivered, to wit, Mr. <hi>Coryton,</hi> and Sir <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                              <hi>Peter Hayman.</hi> Therefore if any injury be done to the prisoners, they themselves are the cause of it, for not submitting themselves to the King. And for the instance which Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> used of the Iudges in 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. although they suffered for their opinions given to the King, I desire, that the time when their opinion was delivered may be considered, to wit, in the time of <hi>R.</hi> 2. and the time when they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to wit, in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 4. And it was the saying of a noble Gentleman, the Lord <hi>Egerton,</hi> That <hi>Bealknap</hi> suffered rather by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> potency of his enemies, then the greatnesse of his offence: And yet it is to be confessed, that they might have given better counsell; but there was no time to dispute of the justnesse of their counsell, when the sword was in the hands of the Conquerour.</p>
                           <p>It hath been relyed upon the resolution of all the Iustices of <hi>England</hi> in 34 <hi>Eliz,</hi> which resolution is now registred in the Upper House of Parliament, at the request of the Commons, in <hi>tertio Caroli Regis</hi>; but I leave it to you, as that Resolution shall sway your judgments. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> said Resolution is, That the cause ought to be certified in the generality or specialty; and here the generall cause is certified at least, if the special be not so; upon the whole matter, the baylment of these prisoners is left to your discretion; and I have shewed to you the discretion of your predecessors. And if any danger appear to you in their baylment, I am confident that ye wil not bayl them, if any danger may ensue; but first
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35668:379"/>
ye are to consult with the King, and he will shew you where the danger rests. Therefore upon the whole matter I pray, that they be remanded.</p>

            <p>When the Court was ready to have delivered their opinions in the grand <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> for Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and others, the Prisoners were not brought to the Bar, according to the Rule of the Court; Therefore Proclamation was made, for the Keepers of the severall prisons, to bring in their Prisoners; but none of them appeared but the Marshall of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> who said,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that Mr. <hi>Stroud</hi> that was in his custody, was removed yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and put in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> by the Kings own Warrant; and so it was done with the other Prisoners; each of them was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of his Prison, in which he was before. But, this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, it was prayed by the Counsell of the Prisoners, that the Court would deliver their opinion for the matter in Law. But the Court refused to do that, because it is to no purpose; for, the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being absent, they could not be bayled, delivered, or remanded.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

            <p>Note, The last day of the Term, a Letter came to the Court from the King himself; the effect whereof was, to inform the Court of the reasons, wherefore the Prisoners were not suffered to come at the day appointed, for the resolution of the Iudges.</p>

And <hi>Jones</hi> Iustice said, that so it was done in the case which had been often remembered to another purpose, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wit, <hi>Russell's</hi> case in 9 <hi>E.</hi> 3. To which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> answered, (with whom all the other Prisoners agreed in opinion) That they have the Sureties ready for the bayl, but not for the good behaviour; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that the bayl might first be accepted, and that they be not urged to the other.</p>

                  <hi>An Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exhibited in the King's Bench against Sir Iohn Eliot and others.</hi>
               </note>Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> the Kings Atturney-generall, exhibited Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in this Court against Sir <hi>John Eliot</hi> Knight; <hi>Denzill Hollis,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and <hi>Benjamin Valentine,</hi> Esquires: the effect of which was, That the King that now is, for weighty causes, such a day and year, did summon a Parliament, and to that purpose sent his Writ to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of <hi>Cornwall</hi> to chuse two Knights, by vertue whereof Sir <hi>John Eliot</hi> was chosen, and returned Knight for <hi>Cornwall.</hi> And that in the same manner, the other Defendants were elect Burgesses of other places for the same Parliament. And shewed further, that Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> was chosen for one of the Citizens of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Speaker of the House of Commons. And that the said <hi>Eliot,</hi> publickly and malitiously in the House of Commons, to raise sedition between the King, his Nobles and People, uttered these words, <hi>That the Councill and Judges had all conspired, to trample under-foot the Liberties of the Subjects.</hi> He further shewed, that the King had power
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35668:379"/>
to call, adjourn, and dissolve Parliaments: And that the King, for divers reasons, had a purpose to have the House of Commons adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and gave direction to Sir <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n Finch,</hi> then the Speaker, to move as adjournment, and if it should not be obeyed, that he should forthwith come from the House to the King. And that the Defendants, by confederacy afore-hand, spake a long and continued Speech, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was recited <hi>verbatim,</hi> in which were divers malitious and seditious words, of dangerous consequence. And to the intent that they might not be prevented of uttering their premeditate speeches, their intention was, that the Speaker should not go out of the Chair till they had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them; the Defendants, <hi>Hollis</hi> and <hi>Valentine,</hi> lay violent hands upon the Speaker, to the great afrightment and disturbance of the House. And the Speaker being got out of the Chair, they by violence set him in the Chair again; so that there was a great tumult in the House. And after the said speeches pronounced by Sir <hi>John Eliot, Hollis</hi> did recapitulate them. And to this information, the Defendants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> have put in a plea to the Iurisdiction of the Court, because these offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are supposed to be done in Parliament, and ought not to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in this Court, or in any other, but in Parliament. And the Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Generall moved the Court, to over-rule the plea to the Iurisdiction; And that, he said, the Court might do, although he had not demurred upon the plea. But the Court would not over-rule the plea, but gave day to joyne in Demurrer this Tearm. And on the first day of the next <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Tearm, the Record shall be read, and within a day after shall be argued at Barre. But <hi>Hyde,</hi> chief Iustice, said to the Counsell of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, So far light we will give you. This is no new question, but all the Iudges of <hi>England,</hi> and Barons of the Exchequer, before now, have oft been assembled on this occasion, and have with great patience heard the Arguments on both sides; and it was resolved by them all with one voice, That an offence committed in Parliament, criminally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or contemptuously, the Parliament being ended, rests punishable in an other Court. <hi>Jones,</hi> It is true, that we all resolved That an offence committed in Parliament against the Crown, is punishable after the Parliament, in another Court; and what Court shall that be, but the Court of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> in which the King by intendment sitteth? <hi>Whitlock,</hi> The question is now reduced to a narrow room, for all the Iudges are agreed, That an offence committed in Parliament against the King or his Government, may be punished out of Parliament. So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that the sole doubt which now remains, is, Whether this Court can pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it. And <hi>Crook</hi> agreed, That so it had been resolved by all the Iudges, because otherwise there would be a failer of Iustice. And by him, If such an offence be punishable in another Court, what Court shal punish it but this Court, which is the highest Court in the Realm for criminall offences? And perhaps not onely criminall actions committed in Parliament are punishable here, but words also.</p>

An appeal of treason was exhibited against the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and others, and there the advice of the Sages of the one Law and the other being required; but because the appeal concerned persons which are Peers of the Realm, which are not tryed else-where then in Parliament, and not in an inferiour Court, 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>numb.</hi> 18.

And if a Iustice of Peace, the first finder, a Iuror, or Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, shall not be punished in such cases; <hi>à fortiori,</hi> a Member of the House of Commons shall not, who, as 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7.4. is a Iudge. 27 <hi>ass. p.</hi> 44. may be objected, where two were indicted of conspiracy, because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they maintained one another; but the reason of the said case was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Maintenance is matter forbidden by the Law; but Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary accusation, which is our matter, is not forbidden by any Law. <hi>C.</hi> 9.56. there was conspiracy, in procuring others to be indicted. And it is true, for there it was not his duty to prefer such accusation. (2) The accusation was extra-judicial, and out of Court; but it was not so in our case. (3) Words spoken in Parliament, which is a superiour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Court, cannot he questioned in this Court, which is inferior. 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3.19. and <hi>Stamford,</hi> 153. will be objected, where the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> was arraigned in this Court, because he departed the Parliament without license; there is but the opinion of <hi>Scroop,</hi> and the case was entred, <hi>P.</hi> 3. <hi>E.</hi> 3.19. And it is to be observed, that the plea of the Bishop there, was never over-ruled. From this I gather, that <hi>Scroop</hi> was not constant to his opinion, which was suddain, being in the same Term in which the plea was entred; or if he were, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> yet the other Iudges agreed not with him; and also at last the Bishop was discharged by the Kings Writ. From this I gather, that the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Court was against the King, as in <hi>Pl.</hi> 20. in <hi>Fogassas</hi>'s case, where the opinion of the Court was against the King, the party was discharged by privy Seal. 1 and 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, where an Information in this Court was preferred against Mr. <hi>Ployden,</hi> and other Members of the House of Commons, for departing from the House without license. But in that case I observe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> these matters, (1.) That this information depended during all the life of the Queen, and at last was <hi>sine die,</hi> by the death of the Queen. (2.) In the said case, no plea was made to the Iurisdiction of the Court, as here it is. (3.) Some of them submitted themselves to the Fine, because it was easie, for it was but 53. 4<hi>d.</hi> But this cannot be urged as a president, because it never came injudgment, and no opinion of the Court was delivered therein. And it is no argument, that because at that time they would not plead to the jurisdiction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> we now cannot if we would. (4) These offences were not done in the Parliament House, but else-where by their absence, of which the Country may take notice; but not of our matters being done in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament. And absence from Parliament, is an offence against the Kings Summons to Parliament. 20 <hi>R.</hi> 2. Parliament-Roll 12. <hi>Thomas Hacksey</hi> was indicted of high-treason in this Court, for preferring
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35668:381"/>
a Petition in Parliament, but 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>num.</hi> 90. he preferred a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have this Iudgment voided, and so it was, although that the King had pardoned him before. And 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>numb.</hi> 104. all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons made Petition to the same purpose, because this tends to the destruction of their priviledges. And this was likewise granted, 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Strood</hi>'s case, That all condemnations imposed upon one, for preferring of any Bill, speaking, or reasoning in Parliament, are void. And this hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alwaies been conceived to be a generall Act, because the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> prayers, time, words, and persons are generall, and the answer to it is generall; for a generall act is alwaies answered with, <hi>Le Roy voit,</hi> and a particular Act with <hi>Soit droit fait al partyes.</hi> And 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6.17.18. A generall Act is alwaies inrolled, and so this is.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> For the second matter, the contempt to the command of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, 18 <hi>Jac.</hi> it was questioned in Parliament, Whether the King can adjourn the Parliament, (although it be without doubt that the King can prorogue it) And the Iudges resolve, that the King may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> adjourn the House by Commission; and 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was resolved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. But it is to be observed, that none was then impeached for moving that question. (2) It is to be observed, that they resolve, that the adjournment may be by Commission, but not resolved, that it may be by a verball command, signified by another; and it derogates not from the Kings prerogative, that he cannot so do, no more then in the case of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8.8. that he cannot grant one acre of land by parol. The King himself may adjourn the House in person, or under the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Seal, but not by verball message, for none is bound to give credit to such message; but when it is under the great Seal, it is <hi>Teste Meipso.</hi> and if there was no command, then there can be no contempt in the disobedience of that command. (3) In this no contempt appears by the Information, for the Information is, That the King had power to adjourn Parliaments. Then put case the command be, that they should adjourn themselves; this is no pursuance of the power which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he is supposed to have. The House may be adjourned two waies, to wit, by the King, or by the House it self; the last is their own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act, which the King cannot compell, for, <hi>Voluntas non cogitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> For the third matter, which is the Conspiracy: Although this be supposed to be out of the House, yet the Act is legall; for, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the House may advise of matters out of the House; for the House it self is not so much for consultations, as for proposition of them. And 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6.34. is, that Enquests which are sworn for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> King, may enquire of matters else-where. (2) For the Conspiracy to lay violent hands upon the Speaker, to keep him in the Chair; The House hath priviledge to detain him in the Chair, and it was but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and softly, and other Speakers have been so served. (3) The King cannot prefer an Information for trespasse, for it is said, The King ought to be informed by a Iury, to wit, by indictment or presentment. (4) This cannot be any contempt, because it appears not, that the House was adjourned; and if so, then the Speaker ought to remain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in the Chair, for without him, the House cannot be adjourned. But it may be objected, that the Information is, That all these matters were done malitiously and seditiously. But to this I answer, That this is alwaies to be understood according to the subject matter, 15 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 4. and 18 <hi>H.</hi> 8.5. A wife that hath title to have Dower, agrees with an
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35668:381"/>
other to enter, (which hath right) that she against him may recover her Dower. This shall not be said <hi>Covin,</hi> because both the parties have right and title. (2) It will be objected, That if these matters shall not be punishable here, they shall be unpunished altogether, because the Parliament is determined. To this I say, That they may be punished in the subsequent Parliament, and so there shall be no failer of right. And many times matters in one Parliament, have been continued to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> another, as 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>numb.</hi> 16. the Lord <hi>Barkley</hi>'s case, 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>numb.</hi> 185.21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16.6 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>numb.</hi> 45, 46.8 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>numb.</hi> 12. Offences in the Forrest ought to be punished in Eyre, and Eyres oftentimes were not held, but every third year. <hi>C.</hi> 9. <hi>Epistle,</hi> and 36 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. A Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may be every year. Errour in this Court cannot be reversed but in Parliament. And yet it was never objected, that therefore there shall be a failer of Right. 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. If a new case of treason hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which is doubtfull, it shall not be determined till the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> So in <hi>Westm.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 28. where a new case happens, in which there is no Writ, stay shall be made till the next Parliament. And yet in these cases, there is no failer of Right. And so the Iudges have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies done in all difficult cases; they have referred the determination of them to the next Parliament, as appears by 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3 6, 7.1 <hi>E.</hi> 3.8.33 <hi>H.</hi> 6.18.5 <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>Dower.</hi> 145. the case of Dower of a Rent-charge. And 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> the Iudges refuse to deliver their opinions concerning the union of the two Kingdoms. The present case is great, rare, &amp; without president there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not determinable but in Parliament. And it is of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; for (1) by the same reason, all the Members of the House of Commons may be questioned. (2) The parties shall be disabled to make. their defence, and the Clerk of Parliament is not bound to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close those particulars. And by this means, the debates of a great Councill shall be referred to a petty Iury. And the parties cannot make justification, for they cannot speak those words here which were spoken in the Parliament, without slander. And the Defendants have not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> means to compell any to be witnesses for them; for the Members of the House ought not to discover the counsell of the House: So that they are debar'd of justification, evidence, and witnesse. Lastly, by this means, none will adventure to accuse any offender, in Parliament, but will rather submit himself to the common danger; for, for his pains he shall be imprisoned, and perhaps greatly fined: And if both these be unjust, yet the party so vexed can have no recompence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The Court.</hi> The question is not now, whether these matters be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and whether true or false. But, admitting them to be offences, the sole question is, Whether this Court may punish them; so that a great part of your Argument is nothing to the present question.</p>

And of them, some are capitall, some not capitall, as assault, conspiracy, and such like, which have not the punishment of life &amp; death. Publick crimes capitall, are such as are against the Law of Nature, as treason, murder; I will agree, that if they be committed in Parliament, they may be questioned else-where out of Parliament.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1<hi>st.</hi> Because these offences are justifiable, being but the bringing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Speaker to the Chair, which also perhaps was done by the Uotes of the Commons; but if these matters shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ustified in this Court, no tryall can be; for upon issue of his own wrong, he cannot be tryed, because Acts done in the House of Commons are of Record, as it was resolved in the Parliament, 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> and 16 <hi>H.</hi> 7.3 <hi>C.</hi> 9.31. are, that such matters cannot be tryed by the Country. And now they cannot be tryed by Record, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dy.</hi> 32. is, an inferiour Court cannot write to a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And no <hi>Certiorari</hi> lies out of the Chancery, to send this here by <hi>Mittimus,</hi> for there never was any president thereof; and the Book of the House of Commons, which is with their Clerk, ought not to be divulged. And <hi>C. Littl.</hi> is, that if a man be indicted in this Court for Piracy committed upon the Sea, he may well plead to the jurisdiction of this Court, because this Court cannot try it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2<hi>ly.</hi> It appears by the old Treatise, <hi>de modo tenendi Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> that the Iudges are but assistants in the Parliament; and if any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> words or acts are made there, they have no power to contradict or controul them. Then it is incongruous, that they, after the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dissolved, shall have power to punish such words or acts, which at the time of the speaking or doing, they had not power to contradict. There are superiour, middle, and more inferiour Magistrates; and the superiour shall not be subject to the controle of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. It is a Position, that <hi>in pares est nullum imperium, multò mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in eos qui majus imperium habent. C. Littl.</hi> saies, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is the supream Tribunal of the Kingdom, and they are Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the supream Tribunal; therefore they ought not to be questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by their inferiours. (3) The offences objected do concern the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament, which priviledges are determinable in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not else-where, as appears by the presidents which have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> been cited before. (4) The common-Law hath assigned proper Courts for matters, in respect of the place and persons; 1<hi>st.</hi> for the place, It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by 11 <hi>E.</hi> 4.3. &amp; old Entries, 101. that in an <hi>Ejectione firme,</hi> it is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> good plea, that the land is antient demeasne, and this excludes all other Courts. So it is for land in <hi>Durham,</hi> old Entries, 419. for it is questiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there, &amp; not out of the County. 2<hi>ly.</hi> For persons, <hi>H.</hi> 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>roll.</hi> 93<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> old Entries, 47. If a Clerk of the Chancery be impleaded in this Court, he may plead his priviledge, and shall not answer. So it is of a Clerk
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35668:382"/>
of the Exchequer, old Entries, 473. then much more when offences are done in Parliament, which is exempt from ordinary jurisdiction, they shall not be drawn in question in this Court. And if a man be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in this Court, he may plead Sanctuary, 22 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Keilw.</hi> 91. and 22. and shall be restored, 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3.60. The Abbot of <hi>Bury</hi>'s case is to the same purpose. (5) For any thing that appears, the House of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Commons had approved of these matters, therefore they ought not to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be questioned in this Court. And if they be offences, and the said House hath not punished them, this will be a casting of imputation upon them. (6) It appears by the Old Entries, 446, 447, that such an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> one ought to represent the Borough of St. <hi>Jermans,</hi> from whence he was sent; therefore he is in nature of an Ambassadour, and he shall not be questioned for any thing in the Execution of his office, if he do nothing against the Law of Nature or Nations, as it is in the case of an Ambassadour. In the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi>

But if he commit a civill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which is against the Municipall Law onely, he cannot be questioned for it, as <hi>Bodin. de Republica,</hi> agrees the case. Upon the Statute of 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 15. for tryall of Pirats, 13. <hi>Jac.</hi> the case fell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> out to be thus. A Iew came Ambassador to the United Provinces, and in his journey he took some Spanish ships, and after was driven upon this coast; And agreed upon the said Statute, that he cannot be tryed as a Pyrat here by Commission, but he may be questioned <hi>civiliter</hi> in the Admiralty: For, <hi>Legati suo Regi soli judicum faciunt.</hi> So Embassadors of Parliament, <hi>soli Parliamento,</hi> to wit, in such things which of themselves are justifiable. (7) There was never any president, that this Court had punished offences of this nature,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>

And it appears by 41 <hi>ass. p.</hi> 12. that if a Bill of Disceit be brought in this Court, where it ought to be by Writ, This matter may be pleaded to the Iurisdiction of the Court, because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it is <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> and <hi>contra pacem.</hi> It appears by all our Books, that informations ought not to be grounded upon surmices, but upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Record, 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7.5.6 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Dy.</hi> 74.

            <p>Now I will remove some objections which may be made.</p>

               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note>Where the King is Plaintiff, it is in his election to bring his Action in what Court he pleases. This is true in some sense, to wit, That the King is not restrained by the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, Quod com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munia placita non sequantur Curiam nostram</hi>; for he may bring his <hi>Quare impedit</hi> in <hi>B. R.</hi> And if it concerns <hi>Durham,</hi> or other County Palatine, yet the King may have his Action here; for the said Courts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are created by Patent, and the King may not be restrained by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by his own Patent, to bring his Action where he pleaseth. But the King shall not have his Action where he pleaseth against a prohibition of the Common Law, as 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Keilw.</hi> 6. the King shall not have a Formedon in Chancery. And <hi>C.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s case, If the King will bring an Information in an inferiour Court, the party may plead to the Iurisdiction. So where the Common Law makes a prohibition, the King hath not election of his Court.</p>
            <p>The Information is <hi>contra formam Statuti,</hi> which Statute, as I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> conceive,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> is intended the Statute of 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 6. and 11 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 11. which gives power to this Court to punish an assault, made upon the servant of a Knight of Parliament. But our case is not within those Statutes, nor the intent of them; for it is not intendible, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would disadvantage themselves, in point of their priviledge. And this was a trespasse done within the House by Parliament-men amongst themselves. And <hi>Crompton's Jurisdiction of Courts, f.</hi> 8. saith,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> That the Parliament may punish trespasses done there.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note>Presidents have been cited of Parliament-men, imprisoned and punished for matters done in Parliament. To this I say, That there is <hi>Via juris,</hi> and <hi>via facti</hi>; and <hi>via facti</hi> is not alwaies <hi>via juris, C.</hi> 4.93. Presidents are no good directions, unlesse they be iudiciall.</p>

               </note> wrongs shall be unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. To this I answer, That a mischief is oft-times rather sufferable then an inconvenience, to draw in question the priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By the antient Common Law, as it appears by 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3.23. and 21 <hi>ass.</hi> if an Infant bring an appeal, the Suit shall be stayed during his infancy, because the party cannot have his tryall by Battail against the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Infant; but the Law is now held otherwise in the said case. And in some cases, criminall offences shall be dispunished, 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dy.</hi> 40. appeal of murder lies not for murder done in severall Counties.</p>
            <p>This Court of <hi>B. R.</hi> is <hi>coram ipso Rege,</hi>

               </note> the King himself by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment is here in person. And as it is said, <hi>C.</hi> 9.118. it is <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Regni Tribunal,</hi> of ordinary Iurisdiction. But to this I say, that the Parliament is a transcendent Court, and of transcendent ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction; It appears by 28 <hi>ass. p.</hi> 52. that the style of other Courts is <hi>coram Rege,</hi> as well as this is, as <hi>coram Rege in Cancellaria, coram Rege in Camera</hi>; and though it be <hi>coram Rege,</hi> yet the Iudges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> give the Iudgment. And in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 3. in this Court, some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were <hi>coram Rege</hi>; others, <hi>Coram Hugone de Bigod.</hi>

            <p>The privileges of Parliament are not questioned,<note place="margin">6. <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> but the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and misdemeanours of some of them. But to this I say, That the distinction is difficult and narrow in this case, where the offences ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected are iustifiable: and if they be offences, this reflects upon the House which hath not punished them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The cases of 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3.19. and 1 and 2 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi> have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </note> But for the last it is observable, that no plea was pleaded to the Iurisdiction, as it is in our case. And if a Parliament-man or other, which hath priviledge, be impleaded in forraign Court, and neglect his plea to the Iurisdiction, the Court may well proceed, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7.14. 36 <hi>H.</hi> 6.34 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 13. <hi>Jac.</hi> In this Court the Lord <hi>Norreys,</hi> that was a Peer of Parliament, was indicted in this Court for the murder of one <hi>Bigoo,</hi> and pleaded his pardon. And there it was doubted, how the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Court should proceed against him, (for he by the Law ought to have his Tryall by his Peers) And it was resolved, that when he pleads his pardon, or confesseth his fault, thereby he gives iurisdiction to the Court, and the Court may give Iudgment against him. So that these cases, where it was not pleaded to the Iurisdiction, can be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in our case.</p>
            <p>The priviledge here is not claimed by Prescription or Charter,<note place="margin">8. <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not good. But I say, that notwithstanding this, it is good; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for where the common-Law outs a Court of Iurisdiction, there needs no charter or prescription, 10 <hi>H.</hi> 6.13. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Keilw.</hi> 189. <hi>Br. n. c.</hi> 515.

               </note> the Kings Atturney, the same day argued on the other side, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> but briefly. First, he answered to the objections which had been made.</p>
            <p>First, he said, That Informations might well be for matters of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nature, which are not capitall; and that there are many presidents of such Informations. (But note that he produced none of them)</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>y.</hi> It hath been obiected, That they are a Councill, therefore they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ought to speak freely. But such speeches which here are pronounced,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35668:384"/>
prove them not Counsellors of State, but Bedlams; the addition of one word would have made it Treason, to wit, <hi>Proditoriè.</hi> But it is the pleasure of the King to proceed in this manner, as now it is. And there is great difference between Bills and Libells, and between their proceedings, as Counsell and as Mutinous.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3<hi>ly.</hi> That it would be of dangerous consequence; for by this means, none would adventure to complain of grievances. I answer, They may make their complaints in Parliamentary manner, but they may not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> move things, which tend to distraction of the King and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4<hi>ly.</hi> These matters may be punished in following Parliaments. But this is impossible, for following Parliaments cannot know, with what minde these matters were done. Also the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is not a Court of Iustice of itself. The two Houses are but one Body, and they cannot proceed criminally to punish crimes, but onely upon their Members by way of imprisonment; and also they are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a Court of Record. And they have forbid their Clerk to make entry of their Speeches, but onely of matters of course; for many times they speak upon the suddain, as occasion is offered. And there is no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the King should expect a new Parliament. The Lords may grant Commissions to determine matters, after the Parliament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but the House of Commons cannot do so. And also a new House of Commons consists of new Men, which have no conusance of these offences. 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. The Bishop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> for words spoken in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that the King had not right to the Crown, was arraigned in this Court of high-treason; and then he did not plead his priviledge of Parliament, but said, That he was <hi>Episcopus unctus, &amp;c.</hi>

But this is but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act, although it be in print; for <hi>Rastall</hi> intitles it by the name of <hi>Strode</hi>; so the title, Body, and proviso of the Act are particular.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>ly.</hi> That this is an inferiour Court to the Parliament, therefore,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> &amp;c. To this I say, That, even sitting the Parliament, this Court of <hi>B. R.</hi> and other Courts, may judge of their priviledges, as of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-man put in execution, &amp;c. and other cases. It is true, that the Iudges have oft-times declined to give their iudgment, upon the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of Parliament, sitting the Court. But from this it followes not, that when the offence is committed there, and not punished, and the said Court dissolved, that therefore the said matter shall not be questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Court.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7<hi>ly.</hi> By this means the priviledges of Parliament shall be in great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> danger, if this Court may judge of them. But I answer, That there is no danger at all; for this Court may judge of Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 8<hi>ly.</hi> Perhaps these matters were done by the Uotes of the House; or, if they be offences, it is an imputation to the House to say, that they had neglected to punish them. But this matter doth not appear. And if the truth were so, these matters might be given in evidence.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 9<hi>ly.</hi> There is no president in the case, which is a great presumption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of Law. But to this I answer, That there was never any president of such a fact, therefore there cannot be a president of such a judgment. And yet in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was resolved by <hi>Brown</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many other Iustices, that offences done in Parliament may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of Parliament, by imprisonment or otherwise. And the

case of 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3.19. is taken for good Law by <hi>Stamf.</hi> and <hi>Fitzh.</hi> And 22 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> accord directly with it. But it hath been objected, that there was no plea made to the Iurisdiction. But it is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that <hi>Ployden,</hi> that was a learned man, was one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the said Information depended during all the Reigne of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> during which time there were four Parliaments, and they never questioned this matter.</p>
            <p>But it hath been further objected, That the said case differs from our case, because that there the offence was done out of the House, and this was done within the House. But in the said case, if license to depart be pleaded, it ought to be tryed in Parliament, as well as these offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces here. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And the same day the Iudges spake briefly to the case, and agreed with one voice, That the Court, as this case is, shall have Iurisdiction, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> although that these offences were committed in Parliament.</p>
