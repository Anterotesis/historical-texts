            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. How to make Granads to cast with mens hands.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving taught how to make Granads for the Morter, which by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of that most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull instrument may be transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very farre over waters, walls, or bulwarks, working strange and rude executions or effects, I will now shew how it shall bee easie to make two or three sorts of Granads to bee cast out of mens hands, the effects whereof are no lesse to bee esteemed then the other, chiefly in assaults,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10323:29"/>
whether it be for the offendants or defendants. The chiefest and of greatest operation is made of any kind of brickle mettle as the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their fabrication is not much different from the other, onely more rounder and lesser, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ones hauing a long neck to seem for the Port fire, as doth appeare by the figure A, and first of all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nad is to be filled with fine gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and afterward fill the neck with a slow composition as followeth. Take 1. pound of gunpowder dust, two ounces of charcoale d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ust three ounces of saltpeter, al these well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together, fill the portfire requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but this mixture must be well beaten into the port-fire, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nads being thus finished, they may be kept a yeare, ten yeares, yea twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10323:29"/>
if need be. It is to be noted that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hese granads must not be freed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a man is ready to cast them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way even in the same instant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<figure/> the port-fire being consumed, the granad breaks in divers pieces, and each piece sufficient to kill ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man or beast, and therefore the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10323:30"/>
handling of them is somewhat dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. The second manner of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nad to bee cast out of the hand, is made also of brickle mettle, but hath no necke for a Portfire, but is onelie round, hauing in one side a hole as appears by the figure B, and at this hole it is to be filled with drie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and then is to bee put into this hole to stop it, cotten wieke made as followeth. Take good Gunpowder and steepe it in faire water, and being dissolved, take the cotten wieke and steep it in the Gunpowder dissolued, which done, hang it out to drie; but let it be doubled eight or ten times, to the end that it may the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the powder, and being drie, cut it in such pieces as you shal need, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the one end into the Granad at the hole, and then put that Granad
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10323:30"/>
into another pot a little bigger then the Granad, as appeareth by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure C, so that you may put a little drie powder round about the lesser Granad betweene the pots and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nad, then cover the mouth of the last earthen pot either with leather or such like stuffe; and bind it round about with wyre, but first put the wire through pieces of match about halfe a foot of length as may appear by D, and when you desire to make vse of this sort of granad, set on fire euery end of these pieces of match, and cast the pot away, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling either vpon the ground, or anie souldiers Armour, you shall see the earth-pot breake, the Granad split, and worke such furious effects, eyther at a breach or anie approch. The third sort of Granad is made
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10323:31"/>
much like to either of those prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, except onely it may bee made double or single, of glasse or of earth onely shall be needfull to be made very thicke, and if it be to be made single, the portfire ought to be either of wood or of pastboord, and well glued in, and this last sort may work great effects. Now having somwhat largely treated of the morter, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nads, and of their vse, I will speake a little of other oyly fireworkes very pernicious and noysome to all assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10323:62"/>
for the ayre, or for the ground, haue such strength and force, that beeing once kindled and cast into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they will consume themselues there, and not rise vp swimming as those which are made artificially for the water as followeth. To make good rockets for the water, the calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the mould ought to bee one inch of diameter, and in length eight inches, the breech to enter one inch, hauing no broach; the rowler for the cartoush shall be three quarters of an inch of diameter, and the charger shal be somewhat lesser then the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toush being ready to bee filled as the others. Of two sorts of compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you shall make one as followeth (if you desire to make a great fierie tayle appeare vpon the water, Then take one pound of salt-peter, halfe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10323:62"/>
a pound of powder-dust, halfe a pound of brimstone-dust, and two ounces of charcoale-dust: but if you desire to haue it to burne cleere like a candle vpon the water, then take one pound of salt-peter, halfe a pound of brimstone-dust, and three ounces of powder-dust, all these must be well mingled together, as all other compositions) and with either of these compositions, fill your cartoush, and ioyne to the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end a saucisson, and then couer it all with melted pitch, rosine, grease, or painting, to hinder the water from spoiling the paper: and to make it float and swim vpon the water, bind a rode about two foot long to it as to the others for the ayre. Now if that you desire that this Rocket
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10323:63"/>
charge his actions vpon the water, swimming now vpon the water, and now vnder the water, put here and there powder dust, powre to the quantity of halfe a spoonefull as you charge it; also may you make it change colour, now red and then white fire, onely changing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in filling it, and so the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious may adde many changes and diuersities as they shall thinke fit: but if you are to make a great number for a great fireworke, then the plainest are the best, onely filling therewith the first composition; but they must be filled two or three fingers breadth with fine powder dust, to make them flye farre off, or else they must be made like rockets for the aire, and afterward charge them foure inches with composition made for water;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:10323:63"/>
but to be the more certaine, it is best for those who haue great works, to make to trie one or two before they finish many, that the better they may attaine their designes, which with eie they may accomplish, if the rules prescribed be obserued; for as I think there is not one rule neglected apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the fabrication of these fireworkes prescribed; and now I will set downe the manner how to make all sorts of ballouns and flying saucissons, which are absolutelie the beautifullest parts of fire-works for pleasure, and after them I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a braue fireworke for pleasure with the manner how to place, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and range euerie peece and part thereof, to make their play in order.</p>

adorne very much a fireworke, and being ill applied they spoyle all. And to make them, you must make wheels of wood as bigge as you pretend to make Girondells, and vnto those wheeles bind fast rockets of a meane bignesse, binding the mouth of one towards the tayle of the other, and so continuing vntill you haue filled your wheele quite round, which done, couer them with paper pasted very curiously about them, that the one taking fire, they take not fire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, but the mouth of one shall be left vncouered and ready primed, fit to take fire, the which ending shal giue fire backward to the next, and so one to the other, euery one his turne: there may bee bound fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie Lances to these Girondells ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpright, or neere overthwart,

may put two or three rankes in one balloune, as appears by the figure C, or one ranke of serpents, and over them many Starres; all these things being thus disposed within the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toush, let it be choaked at the other end; and then prime the ballouns with cotten wieke steeped in gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder as the stoupel before spoken of; but this cotten must be well fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the end of the port-fire with strong packe-thread, which done, charge the balloune in your morter, as is taught in the 6. chap. of the first Treatise; and you may shoot it when you please.

build and dispose any manner of artificiall fireworke great or little: and to begin, you must first cause to be built a scaffold trianguler, square,
