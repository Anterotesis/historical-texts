            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Hinderſon,</hi> and as Politick Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, <hi>Morthamer,</hi> and <hi>Newlant</hi> with 21. Ships and Pinnaſſes, with about 3000. men, both Souldiers and Mariners; which came the 25. of <hi>August,</hi> upon the road before the ſaid Citie, and preſently landed their Forces, where they found the enimie in order to defend the Citie; yet after a ſmall skirmiſh, wherein we loſt three or foure men, and as many more were wounded, the enimes retired. At the riſing of the Moone, our men marched towards the Citie, which they found wholy forſaken, finding in it no more but ſome few men, that were drunk, without any oppoſition; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that this is a great Victorie, becauſe the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> can get no <hi>Negros</hi> or <hi>Black-Moors</hi> to labour in the Mines in the Weſt-Indies, whether-wards they have yeerly ſent from that place about 15000. which they buy there for a ſmall price, and are ſold here in <hi>Brazeil,</hi> for 400 or 500. gilders one <hi>Negro</hi>; and in the Weſt-Indies they are ſold yet for a higher price: out of which trade the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> hath yeerly had a great treaſure, which he muſt miſſe now, becauſe he had for every <hi>Negro,</hi> ten Cruſa cuſtome, beſides other great Revenews. This Victory is both here and in <hi>Angola</hi> counted higher than any other, that the Company obtained here before, in regard of the great traffick, that falls there, and the great profits it will afford, and I doe not doubt, but the Company ſhall bee furniſhed from thence with all ſorts of Commodities.</p>
               <p>Upon a good hope of this deſign, we had ſent after the Fleet already in <hi>August,</hi> two Ships more with two hundred foot with fire-locks, which came thither in very good and due time. Wee are now buſie to ſend thither-wards two luſty Ships with Victuals and Merchandiſe to begin the trade; it comes us well to paſſe, that we have taken two
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62783:3"/>
prizes, which were bound for that place with goods, that are much deſired there, which gives a double advantage unto us. The Admirall <hi>Iol</hi> is departed from thence, or was upon his departure, with a good number of Souldiers and Ships, and going out upon another exploit; unto which I pray God to give his bleſſing. The Vice-Admirall <hi>Lichtart</hi> towards with Colonell <hi>Coin,</hi> if God pleaſeth, are to goe to Sea within theſe eight or tenne dayes, with ſixteen Saile of Ships and Pinnaſſes, well manned, upon another exploit, I hope that by Gods aſſiſtance, they will have good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; yet the place which they aime at, for divers reaſons I muſt conceale: here underneath I have ſet to it that ſame, what wee have obtained, ſo ſarre as is yet known.</p>
               <p>The Citie of <hi>Loando de S.

Paulo,</hi> together with five Caſtles, the manner as followeth. Our Forces comming upon the heigth of the ſaid Citie of <hi>Loando</hi> in ſight of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>Kaſſoone,</hi> the Inhabitants perceived our Fleet; they gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together about twenty five thouſand <hi>Negros</hi> or <hi>Black-Moores</hi> &amp; ſome thouſand white, to reſiſt our Forces; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our Forces would loſe no time and occaſion, but came up with the whole Fleet, and landed betwixt the Caſtles and the Citie: thoſe within the Citie ſeeing the ſtout and valourous comming on of our men, grew faint-hearted, and betook themſelves to flight, excepting three Companies, which ſeemed to ſtand to it and to make ſome oppoſition, againſt which was commanded the young <hi>Gyſelinck</hi> with ſome Troupes with fire-locks, who after ſome charges given, put them likewiſe to flight; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our Forces marched on, and found the Citie and Caſtles wholy forſaken, and thereupon our men took pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently poſſeſſion of a great and fair Citie, containing about five thouſand great and faire Stone-houſes leſſe or more, in the bigneſſe of the City of <hi>Olinda,</hi> together with five Caſtles, and ſeven Batteries; whereupon ſtood planted about one hundred and thrity Peeces of Ordnance, amongſt which are ſixty Braſſe Peeces. Before the Citie lay about
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62783:4"/>
twenty, both great and ſmall Ships, of which our men took poſſeſſion in like manner. The Inhabitants have taken along with them all their moneys and beſt goods, leaving onely behind them ſome houſhold-ſtuffe, which they could not take along with them; In the taking of the ſaid City, we loſt no more but ſeven men in all. Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Hinderſon</hi> received again ſome hurt in his broken legge; and commandeth now in the ſaid Citie with twelve Companies. This is truly a great Victory for the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in regard that ſo little blood was ſhed, for which we cannot give ſufficient thanks unto God Almightie. The Admirall <hi>Houtebeen</hi> with twelve or fourteen Ships is gone towards N. N. what ſucceſſe hee will have there, time will ſhew. Yeſterday the Vice-Admirall <hi>Lichtart</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Colonell <hi>Coin,</hi> and twelve Saile of Ships is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gone to Sea upon an exploit, but whether, time will ſhew: to morrow or next day after are to goe for <hi>Holland</hi> three Ships, and then I ſhall write unto you at large, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>A Copy of <hi>John Coulombels</hi> letter ſent from <hi>Fernambuck,</hi> to <hi>Philip Biſhop,</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing date the 14. of <hi>October,</hi> 1641.</head>
               <p>As for news, I muſt let you know, that our Fleet, which under our Admirall <hi>Houtebeen</hi> went from hence the 19. of <hi>May</hi> laſt paſt, arrived ſafely the 15. of <hi>Aug.</hi> neer the Citie of <hi>Loundo de S. Paulo</hi> in <hi>Angola,</hi> where they obtained a glorious victory, taking the ſaid City with 2000. men, and in the City were above 3000. armed men together with 30000. Negros. The City is fortified with five Caſtles, and divers Batteries; but aſſoon as they ſaw our forces aſhore, they betook themſelves to flight, and are retired about 9-leagues off from the ſaid City upwards into the Country; but now they begin to deſire a paſſe, that they may return into the City, which is granted them with condition, that they ſhould deliver over the half part of their goods. It is an exceeding great victory, which was obtained without any ſhedding of bloud, and is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62783:6"/>
of great importance, for the Company; for it is certain, that within the ſpace of 6. yeers, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath had from that Country about 76000. Negros, and every Negro is ſold heer for 5. or 600. Gilders, you may now reckon up the profit. There is made ready again another Heer, which is to go to Sea, under the Vice Admirall <hi>Liehthart,</hi> there deſigne is not known.</p>
