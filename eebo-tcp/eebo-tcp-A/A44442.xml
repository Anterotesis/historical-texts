            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Will you ſee how they are three? The firſt is in the firſt words, <hi>Be not deceived:</hi> this ſtirs up our watchfulneſs, and incites us to a perfect ſurvey of our wayes, that ſo ſophiſtry and deceit creep not in upon us at unawares to abuſe us. The ſecond is in the next words, <hi>God is not mocked:</hi> this on the contrary abates
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61696:3"/>
in us ſome conceit which might ariſe; as if that craft and ſubtilty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> could go beyond God, and ſo put ſome device, ſome trick upon him. For there have not been wanting ſome wicked miſcreants, who have gone about to try if they could play ſome ſuch feat with God. The wife of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> diſguiſeth her ſelf, and comes to <hi>Ahiah</hi> the Prophet; but all in vain, for the Prophet ſtraightway diſcovers her; <hi>Come in,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou wife of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>why feigneſt thou thy ſelf to be another woman?</hi> We all know that they were devils, and not gods which the Gentiles worſhipt; yet ſo jealous hath God been in this behalf, that he would not ſuffer ſuch an abuſe, though put upon the Devil himſelf, to eſcape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> To this purpoſe we have in our Books a notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a wicked Thracian, who coming to the Oracle, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whether he ſhould find his Horſe, yea or no; he received an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he ſhould: at which breaking out into ſcorn and laughter, Lo, ſaith he, what a god you worſhip; I never had horſe to loſe, how then ſhall I find him? But ſee what followed; falling after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the hands of <hi>Attalus</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> whom he had grievouſly offended, the King brings him to the top of an high Cliffe, which was called by the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Horſe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thence he caſt him off and ſplit him to pieces; and there he found his horſe he enquired for. There is your ſecond leſſon. The third is in the laſt words, <hi>What a man ſowes that ſhall he reap</hi>; and in this we learn, That let the pretences of our actions be never ſo fair, yet God, firſt or laſt, will pull off their diſguiſe and mask, and ſhew them to the world for ſuch as indeed they are. We read of one <hi>Phryne,</hi> a beautiful Harlot, that feaſting one day amongſt her Companions, in the end they fell upon a ſport, wherein it was agreed, whatſoever one did all the reſt muſt follow and do the ſame. It being now come to <hi>Phrynes</hi> lot to command, ſhe calls for water and waſhes her face; which when all the reſt had done,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they all appeared wrinkled, ugly and deformed, (for they were but painted) but ſhe her ſelf ſeemed much the fairer. Beloved, <hi>Ludit in humanis divina potentia rebus.</hi> It is a ſport, and as it were a kind of recreation to God to diſcover falſe play, to waſh off the colour and paint from diſguiſed actions, and openly expoſe them to the laughter and ſcorne of Men and Angels. <hi>Deus &amp; vocatus &amp; non vocatus aderit</hi>; ſo the Oracle told the Grecians before the Peloponeſian War. There is no action whatſoever, but God, whether he be looked for yea or no, will be at one end of it; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſuch as it is, he will return it upon the head of him that did it. Thus have you theſe words as they contain three leſſons. Would you ſee in the ſecond place how they are but two? Put the two firſt clauſes together, and they will yield you this one leſſon, That it is but an error to think that God is a party capable of mockage &amp; illuſion; no art, no finenes can circumvent or abuſe him.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61696:3"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And ſo ſhall that which erewhile was your third and laſt leſſon, be your ſecond, and all be two. Would you ſee how all theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but one? Look then upon the laſt words, and what is lodged up in them; for that is it which the Holy Ghoſt points out unto you; and whatſoever you find beſides that, it comes along with this onely by way of ſervice and complement, to uſher it in. Yet with your leave, I will entertain theſe parcels of Scripture as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did his gueſts, and take them for three; neither will I uſe any curious diviſion, but I will take them up as they lie, and now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> begin with the firſt, <hi>Be not deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. How you render theſe words, either thus, <hi>Be not deceived</hi>; or thus, <hi>Deceive not your ſelves,</hi> it is not a point greatly material. To deceive our ſelves, or ſuffer another to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, arrive both at one point. Seldom or never was any man deceived by another, who did not firſt deceive himſelf. Your own every dayes experience you have one with another gives evidence to the truth of this; for when we ſpeak with any man whom we find to have been abuſed or over-reached, we evermore blame him, either for ſome negligence, or ſome forgetfulneſs, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſome indiſcretion and over-ſight; which we would never do, if we did not take it for a ruled caſe, that every mans own error is the onely way that lets in another to abuſe him. When <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth, Jonathans</hi> lame ſon, came to <hi>David</hi> to excuſe himſelf for not attending him in his flight, <hi>My ſervant deceived me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and thy ſervant is lame.</hi> Indeed if we were either lame or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, had we ſome invincible impediment, againſt which it avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to ſtrive, this might be ſome Apology for us when we are deceived: but it fares with us no other wayes than it did with <hi>Sampſon</hi> when his wife betrayed him; <hi>Had you not ploughed with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> my heifer,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you had never found my riddle.</hi> He that finds himſelf betrayed, if he well examine himſelf, he ſhall find he hath an Heifer, ſomething or other that is near and dear unto him, which not carefully watched doth him many times ill offices. He therefore that is deceived let him lay the blame no where but on himſelf; for in doing otherwiſe, we do but as little children do, who beat the ground when they themſelves are fallen. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Be not deceived, ſeems to be a Precept of great weight; yea, ſo great, as it may be doubted whether it be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fit to be given to men. He that will be ſure to be deceived in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, had need be omniſcienr, and know all things; which is a property of God alone: for, as for men, firſt, it is moſt true which <hi>Columella</hi> obſerves, <hi>Quicunque ſunt habiti mortalium ſaepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiſſimi, multa ſciſſe dicuntur, non omnia</hi>; the wiſeſt of men that ever lived were never taken to know all things, but many things. And ſecondly, ſuch things as they do know they know
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61696:4"/>
but imperfectly, and in part. Now either of theſe is enough to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> overthrow all poſſibility of this precept, of not being <hi>deceived; for it cannot be but we ſhould be deceived in what we know not.</hi> That it was a great Precept the Apoſtle knew well, and as it ſeems to be, purpoſed that we ſhould know it too. For, for this end, I may well think, hath he in this place almoſt parallell'd God and Man; or, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks in the 8. <hi>Pſal. He hath made him little leſſe then God.</hi> For that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that mockery, which here he denies <hi>can</hi> befall God, is nothing elſe but that deceit which here he teaches ought not to befall us. He might have changed the words without any wrong to the ſenſe, and placed them thus; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>Be not you mocked, for God is not deceived.</hi> For whatſoever deceives a man, that may properly be ſaid to mock and abuſe him. So that one and the ſame thing is here averred both of God and of us; onely there is this difference, in God it is a neceſſity, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mockt, he cannot be deceived; in Man it is a duty, he ought not to be mockt, he ought not to be deceived. No exception therefore is it to the precept, that it ſeems to be proper to God. When <hi>Rachel,</hi> repining that ſhe bare no child, came in a whining and diſcontented humour to <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Give me children, elſe I die</hi>; He anſwered, <hi>Am I like God, who hath withheld from thee the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fruit of the womb?</hi> and with this anſwer he both reproved her, and excuſed himſelf. But, beloved, if any man ſhould reply upon our bleſſed Apoſtle, and tell him, Am I like God, that I ſhould look not to be deceived? this cannot excuſe him; For behold, as if he had purpoſely meant to have taken this objection away, the Apoſtle joyns together both God and us, and tells us, as God cannot, ſo we muſt not be deceived.</p>
            <p>Now that we may the better ſee what is lockt up in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we will conſider firſt who they are to whom this precept of Chriſtian infallibility is given, together with the means how we may attain it; for I will blend and mix them both together. And ſecondly, what things they are in which a Chriſtian man may ſafely ſuppoſe (or rather know) himſelf to be infallible. For though the Apoſtle gives this precept of not being deceived, onely with relation to that one leſſon which here he teaches, yet pertains <hi>it to as many more as every Christian</hi> is bound to learn; for the aſſurance that we have of our Chriſtian doctrine, and every point of it, conſiſts not in opinion, is not founded upon probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> like to the winds, ſubject to mutability and change; it muſt be a moſt certain, moſt infallible acknowledgment, which nothing in heaven, earth and hell can any way infringe. Firſt therefore of the perſons unto whom this precept of infallibility is given, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the way by which they may attain unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61696:4"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Infallibility hath been for a long time paſt the ſubject of great diſpute and quarrel in the Church; for ſince there was no other likelyhood, but as amongſt other men, ſo amongſt Chriſtians, doubts, debates, diſſentions would ariſe, men alwayes have thought it a thing very equitable, that, by the providence of God, there ſhould in ſome part of the Church, or in ſome perſon, reſide a power of clearing ſuch doubts, and ſetling ſuch ſcruples as many times poſſeſs the minds of moſt Chriſtians. Now to appoint ſuch a judge, and not to give him infallibility in his deciſion, but to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> permit him to wander and miſtake in his ſentence, this peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were not to mend, but onely to change and ſupplant one er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by bringing in another. An infallibility therefore there muſt be; but men have marvellouſly wearied themſelves in ſeeking to find out where it is. Some have ſought it in General Councils, and have conceived that if it be not there to be found, it is for certainty fled out of the world. Some have tied it to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the Biſhop of that See. Every man finds it, or thinks he finds it, accordingly as that faction, or part of the Church upon which he is fallen, doth direct him. Thus, like the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> men of <hi>Sodom</hi> before <hi>Lots</hi> door, men have wearied themſelves, and have gone far and near to find out that which is hard at hand. We ſee many times a kind of ridiculous and joculary forgetfulneſs of many men, ſeeking for that which they have in their hands; ſo fares it here with men who ſeek for infallibility in others, which either is, or ought to be, in themſelves: As <hi>Saul</hi> ſought his fathers aſſes whilſt they were now at home; or as <hi>Oedipus,</hi> in the Tragedie, ſent to the Oracle to enquire the cauſe of the plague in <hi>Thebes,</hi> whereas himſelf was the man. For, Beloved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> infallibility is not a favour impropriated to any one man, it is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> duty alike expected at the hands of all; all muſt have it. St. <hi>Paul, when he gives this precept,</hi> directs it not to Councils, to Biſhops, to Teachers and Preachers, but to all of the Galatian Churches, and in them to all of all the Churches in the world. Unto you therfore and to every one, of what ſex, of what rank or degree, and place ſoever, from him that ſtudies in his Library to him that ſwears at the Plough-tayl, belongs this precept of S. <hi>Paul, Be not deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which command that you may the better conceive and drink in, let us ſee what it is that a man muſt do who reſolves to obey <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Apoſtle, and not to be deceived: It is not much; I compriſe it all in two words, <hi>What</hi> and <hi>Wherefore.</hi> Firſt, you muſt know <hi>what</hi> it is that is commanded you: ſecondly, <hi>wherefore,</hi> that is, upon what authority, upon what reaſon. It is reported of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that being ſick, when his Phyſician came to adminiſter to him, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him a reaſon of his action, and told him, that he would be cured like a man, and not like a beaſt. Deceit and error are the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61696:5"/>
diſeaſes of the mind; he that ſtrives to cure it upon bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> brings you indeed a Potion, or rather a Drench, which, for ought you know, may as well ſet on and increaſe as remove the error: but when he opens his authorities, when he makes you to conceive his grounds and reaſons, then and not before he cures your error. They that come and tell you what you are to believe, what you are to do, and tell you not why, they are not <hi>Medici,</hi> but <hi>Veterinarii,</hi> they are not Phyſicians, but Leaches: and if you ſo take things at their hands, you do not like men, but like beaſts. I know this is ſomething an hard Doctrine for the many to hear, neither is it uſually taught by the common Teachers; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, one part you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to yield unto, namely to take at our hands what it is you are to believe or do; but the other part you ſtifly refuſe: To know the grounds and reaſons of what you do, or of what you believe, this you remit to us; <hi>non veſtrum onus, bos clitellas?</hi> to require this at your hands, were as improper as if we ſhould clap the ſaddle on the back of the oxe. And for this you have your reaſons too, as you think; you are men whoſe time is taken up in your Trades and Callings, you are unlearned, unread, of weak and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſhallow underſtandings; it is therefore for you not onely modeſty, but even neceſſity, to ſubmit your ſelves to better judgement; and for enquiry into the reaſons and cauſes of commands, this, as a little too ſpeculative, you are content ſhould lye upon your Teachers: <hi>Felix qui potuit rerum cognoſcere cauſas</hi>; They are men born underhappier Stars then ordinary who attain to the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Reaſons and Cauſes of things. Beloved, all this I know, yet I muſt ſtill go on, and require the performance of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles precept, <hi>be not deceived</hi>; which is a point of perfection which you ſhall never arrive at, except you forgoe theſe pretences. Saint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>Hierom</hi> tells us, that it was a precept of <hi>Pythagoras, Oneratis ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perponendum opus, deponentibus non communicandum</hi>; Where you find a man laden, there to increaſe his burthen, and never to go about to eaſe him which would lay his burthen down: which he he interprets, <hi>ad virtutem incedentibus augmentanda praecepta, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes ſe otio relinquendos</hi>; The meaning, ſaith he, of that precept was, To men that go on in virtue and induſtry you muſt ſtill give, and add new precepts, new commands; but idle perſons muſt be forſaken. Beloved, it falls me by lot this day to act <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his part; The burthen of this precept laid upon you by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Apoſtle I told you conſiſted of two parts, <hi>What,</hi> and <hi>Why:</hi> That part of your burthen which contains <hi>What,</hi> I ſee you will willingly take up; but that other which comprehends <hi>Why,</hi> that is either too hot or too heavy, you dare not meddle with it; But I muſt add that alſo to your burthen, or elſe I muſt leave you for idle perſons: For without the knowledge of <hi>Why,</hi> of the true

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> grounds or reaſons of things, there is no poſſibility of not being deceived. Your Teachers and Inſtructors, whom you follow, they may be wiſe and learned, yet may they be deceived: But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they be not deceived, yet if you know not ſo much, you are not yet excuſed. Something there is which makes thoſe men not to be deceived; if you will be ſure not to be deceived, then know you that as well as they. Is it divine authority that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them from being deceived? you muſt know that as well as they: Is it ſtrength of reaſon? you muſt know it as well as they. For ſtill in following your Teachers you may be deceived (for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ought you know) till you know they are not deceived; which you can never know, untill you know the grounds and reaſons upon which they ſtand: for there is no other means not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but to know things your ſelves.</p>
            <p>I will put on this Doctrine further, and convince you by your own reaſon. It is a queſtion made by <hi>John Gerſon,</hi> ſometimes Chancellor of <hi>Paris, Quorſum mihi mea conſcientia, ſi mihi ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum alienam conſcientiam vivendum eſt &amp; moriendum?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath God given me the light of reaſon and conſcience, if I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> muſt ſuffer my ſelf to be led and governed by the reaſon and conſcience of another man? Will any of you befriend me ſo far as to aſſoile this queſtion? For I muſt confeſſe I cannot. It was the ſpeech of a good husbandman, <hi>Non ſatis eſt agrum poſſidere velle, ſi colere non poſſis</hi>; It is but a folly to poſſeſſe a piece of ground, except you till it. And how then can it ſtand with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that a man ſhould be poſſeſſor of ſo godly a piece of the Lords paſture, as is this light of underſtanding and reaſon, which he hath endued us with in the day of our creation, if he ſuffer it to lie untill'd, or ſow not in it the Lords ſeed? Needs muſt our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> reaſon, if it be ſuffered thus to lie fallow, like the Vineyard of the ſluggard in the Poverbs, quickly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and be over-run with bryers and thornes. Think we that the neglect of theſe our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſhall eſcape unpuniſhed with God? Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> tells us, that the man that is utterly devoid of all education, and hath nothing but his reaſon to be guided by, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch an one, if he doth offend, ſhall not eſcape unpuniſhed, becauſe he hath not uſed thoſe common notions ingrafted by God in his heart, to that end for which they were given. How <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> much ever then ſhall that mans puniſhment be, who in this great means of education, amids ſo many, ſo plain, ſo eaſie waies of cultivation of our reaſonable faculties, yet neglects all, and lets them lye fallow, and is content another ſhould have his wits in keeping?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61696:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>It were a thing worth looking into, to know the reaſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> why men are ſo generally willing, in point of Religion, to caſt themſelves into other mens armes, and leaving their own reaſon, relie ſo much upon another mans. Is it becauſe it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and humility to think another mans reaſon better then our own? Indeed I know not how it comes to paſs, we account it a vice, a part of envy, to think another mans goods, or another mans fortunes to be better then our own; <hi>vicinum pecus gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius uber habet</hi>: and yet we account it a ſingular virtue to eſteem our reaſon and wit meaner then other mens. Let us not miſtake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our ſelves; to contemn the advice and help of others, in love and admiration to our own conceipts, to depreſs and diſgrace other mens, this is the foul vice of pride: on the contrary, thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to entertain the advice of others, to give it its due, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly to prefer it before our own, if it deſerve it, this is that gracious virtue of modeſty: but altogether to miſtruſt and relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh our own faculties, and commend our ſelves to others, this is <hi>de ingenio ſuo peſſimè mereri,</hi> nothing but poverty of ſpirit and indiſcretion. I wil not forbear to open unto you what I conceive to be the cauſes of this ſo generall an error amongſt men. Firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> peradventure the dreggs of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are not yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently waſht from the hearts of many men. We know it is the principall ſtay and ſupporter of that Church, to ſuffer nothing to be inquired into which is once concluded by them. Look through <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy, jumenta ſunt, non homines,</hi> they are not men, but beaſts, and <hi>Iſſachar</hi>-like patiently couch down under every burthen their ſuperiors lay upon them. Secondly, a fault or two may be in our own Miniſtery; Thus to adviſe men (as I have done) to ſearch into the reaſons and grounds of Religion, opens a way to diſpute and quarrell, and this might breed us ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> trouble and diſquiet in our Cures more then we are willing to undergo; therefore to purchaſe our own quiet, and to baniſh all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, we are content to nouriſh this ſtill humour in our hearers; as the <hi>Sibarites,</hi> to procure their eaſe, baniſht the Smiths, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Trade was full of noiſe. In the mean time we do not ſee that peace which ariſeth out of ignorance is but a kind of ſloth, or morall lethargie, ſeeming quiet becauſe it hath no power to move. Again, may be the portion of knowledge in the Miniſter himſelf is not over-great; it may be therefore good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy for him to ſuppreſſe all buſie enquiry in his auditory, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſo increaſe of knowledge in them might not at length diſcover ſome ignorance in him. Laſt of all, the fault may be in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves, who becauſe they are loth to take pains (and ſearch into the grounds of knowledge is evermore painfull,) are well content to take their eaſe, to gild their vice with goodly names, and call their ſloth modeſty, and their neglect of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61696:6"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> filiall obedience. Theſe reaſons, Beloved, or ſome of kin to theſe, may be the motives unto this eaſineſs of the people, of entertaining their Religion upon truſt, and of the neglect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the grounds of it.</p>
            <p>To return therefore, and proceed in the refutation of this groſſe neglect in men of their own reaſon, and caſting themſelves upon others wits; Hath God given you eyes to ſee, and legs to ſupport you, that ſo your ſelves might<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The man in the Goſpel who had bought a Farm, excuſes himſelf from going to the Marriage-ſupper, becauſe himſelf would go and ſee it: But we have taken an eaſier courſe; we can buy our Farm, and go to ſupper too, and that only by ſaving our paines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to ſee it; we profeſs our ſelves to have made a great purchaſe of Heavenly Doctrine, yet we refuſe to ſee it, and ſurvey it our ſelves, but truſt other mens eyes, and our ſurveyors: and wot you to what end?

Yet notwithſtanding this ſingular weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and this large and reall exception which we have againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> I verily perſwade my ſelf, that if the beſt and ſtrongeſt ground of moſt mens Religion were open'd, it would appear to be nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Antiquity,</hi> what is it elſe (God onely excepted) but mans Authority born ſome ages afore us? Now for the Truth of things, time makes no alteration; things are ſtill the ſame they are, let the time be paſt, preſent, or to come. Thoſe things which we reverence for Antiquity, what were they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> at their firſt birth? were they falſe? time cannot make them true; were they true? time cannot make them more true. The circumſtance therefore of time, in reſpect of Truth and Error, is meerly impertinent. Yet thus much muſt I ſay for Antiquity, that amongſt all theſe amphoterizing and halting proofes, if Truth have any advantage againſt error and deceit, it is here. For there is an Antiquity which is proper to Truth, and in which Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror can claim no part; but then it muſt be <hi>antiquitas antiquiſſima,</hi> moſt ancient. This cannot be but true, for it is God, and God is Truth. <hi>All other parts of Antiquity deceit and falſhood will lay claim <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to as well as Truth. Moſt certain it is, Truth is more ancient then error; for error is nothing elſe but deviation and ſwerving from the Truth. Were not Truth therefore first there could be no error, ſince there could be no ſwerving from that which is not.</hi> When therefore Antiquity is pleaded for the proof of any concluſion commended to you for true, be you carefull to know whether it be <hi>antiquiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> whether it be moſt ancient, yea or no: If it be ſo, then is it an invincible proof, and pleads for nothing but the Truth; if otherwiſe, though it be as ancient, I ſay not as <hi>Inachus,</hi> but as Satan himſelf, yet it is no proof of Truth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Univerſality</hi> is ſuch a proof of Truth as Truth it ſelf is aſhamed of; for univerſality is nothing but a quainter and a trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer name to ſignifie the multitude. Now humane Authority at the ſtrongeſt is but weak, but the multitude is the weakeſt part of humane Authority; It is the great Patron of error, moſt eaſily
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61696:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> abuſed, and moſt hardly diſ-abuſed. The beginning of error may be, and moſtly is, from private perſons, but the <hi>maintainer</hi> and <hi>continuer</hi> of error is the multitude. <hi>Ubi ſingulorum error fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerit publicum, ſingulorum errorem facit publicus:</hi> It is a thing which our common experience and practice acquaints us with, that when ſome private perſons have gain'd Authority with the multitude, and infuſed ſome error into them, and made it publick, the publickneſs of the error gaines Authority to it,<note place="margin">Private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get errors in the multitude, and make them publick, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them begets them again in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and enterchangeably prevailes with private perſons to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. The moſt ſingular and ſtrongeſt part of humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is properly in the wiſeſt and moſt virtuous; and theſe I trow are not the moſt univerſall. If Truth and goodneſs go by univerſality and multitude, what mean then the Prophets and holy men of God every where in Scripture ſo frequently, ſo bitterly, to complain of the ſmall number of good men, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of God and Truth? Neither is the complaint proper to Scripture, it is the common complaint of all that have left any Records of Antiquity behind them. Could wiſhing do any good, I could wiſh well to this kind of proof; <hi>Sed nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam it a bene crit rebus humanis, ut plures ſint meliores,</hi> It will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> never go ſo well with mankind that the moſt ſhall be the beſt: The beſt that I can ſay of argument and reaſon drawn from uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality and multitude, is this, ſuch reaſon may perchance well ſerve to <hi>excuſe an error,</hi> but <hi>it can never ſerve to warrant a Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Councels and Synods, and conſent of Churches, theſe indeed may ſeem of ſome force, they are taken to be the ſtrongeſt weapons which the Church had fought with; yet this is ſtill humane Authority after another faſhion: let me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> add one thing, that the Truth hath not been more relieved by theſe, then it hath been diſtreſſed. At the Councel at <hi>Nice</hi> met 38 Biſhops to defend the Divinity of the Sonne of God: But at <hi>Ariminum</hi> met well near 600 Biſhops to deny it. I ask then, what gain'd the Truth here by a Synod? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the eye of reaſon it more endanger'd it; for it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the advantage that error had among the multitude above the Truth; by which reaſon Truth might have been greatly hazarded. I have read, that the Nobility of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fancy or other, thought fit, that all ſervants ſhould wear a kind of garment proper to them, that ſo it might be known who were ſervants, who were free-men: But they were quickly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this conceit; for perceiving in what multitudes ſervants were in moſt places, they feared that the ſingularity of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be an item to them to take notice of their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and to know their own ſtrength, and ſo at length take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61696:9"/>
of it againſt their Maſters. This device of calling Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was but like that fancy of the Roman Gentleman; for many times it might well have proved a great means to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered the Truth, by making the enemies thereof to ſee their own ſtrength, and work upon that advantage; for it is a ſpeedy way to make them to ſee that, which for the moſt part is very true, that there are more which run againſt the Truth than with it.</p>

            <p>Yet one word more, to fit my Text to my Auditors; a thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> here ſomewhat the more difficult, becauſe of the manner of the phraſe, <hi>recordare quòd recepiſti, Remember thou haſt received:</hi> For memory is of things paſt, and <hi>recepiſti</hi> is not of things in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of things already received by us. But we are yet in expectation, what ſhall befall us we know not; as yet therefore I cannot ſay as our Saviour doth, <hi>this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares</hi>; let that time never be: for, ſhould we ſtay to hear from <hi>Abraham</hi> a <hi>recordare, Remember,</hi> it would be too late then to preach unto you: yet we muſt find a way to apply this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to us, even for the preſent; and indeed it is not hard to do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it. I have read in my Bookes of a painter, who being deſired to picture an horſe wallowing in the duſt, painted him galloping; and being required why he did ſo, he anſwer'd, turn the picture, and it will be as you would have it. Beloved, I come this day to give you a <hi>cave, beware</hi>; not a <hi>recordare remember</hi>; to adviſe you that you beware how you receive your good things in your life, not to remember you that you have done ſo. And this will I do without any wrong to my Text, for do but turn the picture, that which ſeems to gallop will wallow; do but alter the time, and <hi>recordare, remember,</hi> will immediately become <hi>cave, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> beware. Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, that expectation and memory are but the ſame thing; for what memory is in regard of things paſt, that expectation is in regard of things to come. Expectation is but memory antedated, and memory is expectation whoſe date is out. As it is betwixt expectation and memory, ſo ſtands the caſe betwixt <hi>recordare, remember</hi> and <hi>cave, beware<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cave</hi> is but <hi>recordare</hi> antedated; what <hi>recordare</hi> is in regard of things paſt, that is <hi>cave</hi> in regard of things to come. Let us then turn me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory into <hi>warineſs and prevention, and exprobration into counſel and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> admonition;</hi> and forthwith you ſhall ſee, that <hi>recordare quae recepiſti,</hi> remember that thou haſt received, will become <hi>cave ne recipias,</hi> beware that thou receive not; and ſo the Text will exactly fit us. So come I to the words, <hi>Son, remember, &amp;c.</hi> I will branch them into two parts; firſt, a preface, in the firſt word, <hi>Fili, Sonne.</hi> Secondly, the body of the words themſelves, <hi>Remember thou hast received, &amp;c.</hi> The words we will further divide, if need

            </p>
            <p>I have heard that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a great Scholar; what portion of clerkſhip he hath otherwiſe and upon other occaſion expreſt, I know not; ſure I am that here he hath ſhewed us a wondrous piece of his Rhetorick: For, two things moſt contrary, ſweetneſſe and bitterneſs, compaſſion and exprobration, in two or three words ſo ſtrangely coucht and mixt together I have not lightly found, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li &amp; recordare, Son, remember</hi>; two words near in ſite and place,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but in ſenſe and power infinitely diſtant: <hi>Son,</hi> a word of bowells, mercy, ſweetneſs; a word in which nature and cuſtom hath ſumm'd up and concluded all which lies diſperſed in all the names of goodneſs. Contrarily, <hi>Remember,</hi> a word (as here it lies) of bitterneſs, of ſarcaſme, of exprobration: For unto this miſerable man here in torments what could have been more irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, then to be twitted with, and conſtrained to remember, his ſometime happineſs? Could he have learnt the art of oblivion, and quite forgotten that ever he was happy, his miſery had yet been ſomewhat leſs. Never to have taſted happineſs abates a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> great part of miſery; but <hi>fuiſſe felicem,</hi> were there no other miſery, yet this were miſery enough, to have been happy. It was obſerved of <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour, that when he made a preface of mercy, it was a certain note he would uſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſeverity: Shall we conceive ſo of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that to his <hi>Fili</hi> he added a <hi>recordare,</hi> to his preface of mercy he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes a ſentence of harſhneſs and ſeverity, ſo to add miſery to the enough already miſerable, and increaſe his woe? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Reverence to ſo great a man muſt teach us well to weigh what we ſpeak or what we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> think. Certainly thus to ſuppoſe were much to wrong ſo excellent a perſon. If we ſhall a little inquire of the learned, whence it comes that <hi>Abraham</hi> uſeth this gracious compellation of <hi>Son</hi> unto a damned ghoſt; ſome will tell us, that he doth it by way of retaliation: The man with whom he ſpeaks had called him Father, out of complement therefore and formality he calls him <hi>Son.</hi> But this carries a countenance of Courtſhip and levity. Others will ſay that he calls him by the name of <hi>Son,</hi> becauſe indeed he was ſo, though by the fleſh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which proves the weaker ſide. But this had been unpro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> neither from it could we have raiſed, for our uſe, any inſtruction. Others have thought that <hi>Abraham</hi> did this out of his naturall goodneſs, and that he therefore uſed this gentle compellation of <hi>Fili, Son,</hi> to one utterly caſt off, and to be now for ever left under the eternall wrath of God, to teach us this leſſon, That in all caſes, how deſperate ſoever, unto all perſons,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61696:11"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> though never ſo forlorn, unto the greateſt delinquent, how ſinfull ſoever, yet ſtill we muſt open ſome window, at leaſt ſome ſmall crevis, to let our goodneſs ſhine through. St. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> was the man that told me thus, and I muſt confeſs I believed him. <hi>Me natura miſericordem, Patria ſeverum, crudelem nec Patria nec natura eſſe volunt,</hi> ſaith the great Roman Orator; Nature hath made me good, but my Country and the publick good made me to be ſevere, but neither nature nor my Country permit me to be cruell. <hi>Abraham</hi> here hath well expreſſed this, for, <hi>Fili</hi> and <hi>Recordare, Son, Remember,</hi> they are no other then <hi>natura</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>Patria: Fili</hi> comes from his bowells and naturall goodneſs; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordare</hi> is but occaſion'd out of his duty to God and publick good: to teach us ſtill to temper our neceſſary ſeverity with ſome goodneſs; for, meer ſeverity is nothing elſe but cruelty, which neither God nor nature requires at our hands. The maſter of the feaſt in the Goſpel, when he came in to his gueſts, and ſaw one there without a wedding-garment, though he ſaw he was conſtrain'd to pronounce a ſharp and ſevere doom, yet he uſeth <hi>Abrahams</hi> method, <hi>Amice, friend</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how comest thou hither? Fili, Amice, Son, friend</hi>; Here is the true art of chiding, this is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the proper ſtyle wherein we ought to reprove. A fair pattern for us, Beloved, who in no caſe more miſtake our ſelves then in this duty of check and reproof; <hi>qui ita objurgamus quaſi oderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> who are wont ſo to chide as if we hated, who think foul words to be but ornaments of ſpeech, and enchaſe our diſcourſe with bitter language as with pearles, and never think we reprove except we be contumelious.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the ancient Roman inſcriptions which are preſerved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> unto poſterity, I find one written upon a Roman Gentleman, where amongſt other his commendations it is recorded, <hi>Neſcivit quid eſſet maledicere,</hi> he knew not how to ſpeak contumeliouſly to any man: and I have heard it reported of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, that famous King of <hi>Spain</hi> in our own memory, that he ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully could contain himſelf, that in his whole life he never gave any man a harſh word. And indeed I have often wonder'd with my ſelf whether there were (not any neceſſary uſe, for that I know there is not,) but any uſe at all of opprobrious and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling language: If there be, it muſt be either in reproof, or in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> adminiſtration of juſtice; if there be a third thing, my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience is too narrow to prompt me with it. But neither reproof, nor chaſtiſement of juſtice require it, but are beſt performed without it. It cannot therefore ſtand either with our judgement or with our goodneſs to make any uſe of ſo uſeleſs, of ſo unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſuperfluity. <hi>It hath been obſerved of the ancient Corniſh Language, that it afforded no formes of Oathes,</hi> no phraſes to ſwear
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61696:12"/>
in. I ſhould never think our language the poorer, if it were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> deſtitute of all formes and phraſes of reviling and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeech. And what then can we conceive why any man ſhould delight in the uſe of vile language? for it is ſo uſeleſs and ſo unprofitable a vice, that except a man did love a vice for its own ſake, he can give no reaſon why he doth affect it. On the contrary, the oppoſite quality is, firſt, a moſt welcome virtue; for nothing more ingratiates us with men then that bleſſing of <hi>Nepthali, eloquia pulchritudinis,</hi> gracious language, <hi>quae nè illos quidem quos damnat offendit.</hi> Secondly, it is ſo cheap a virtue; Good words are afforded at the ſame price that evill are. Laſtly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it is a prevailing and a winning virtue, even in civil actions. <hi>I know you have heard the parable of the Northwind and the Sun; the wind with all his raging and bluſtring could not make the wayfaring man lay down his cloak; but when the Sun had diſplayed his beames, ſent forth his heat, and wrought a while upon him, he makes him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the ſhade and unbrace himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved, as we much deſire to be the ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> the faithfull, ſo let us no leſs deſire to be ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> the good:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And if we will be the ſons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then let us follow our Saviours counſel, and do the works of <hi>Abraham</hi>; let us ſtrive on all occaſions ſome way or other to expreſs our goodneſs, and uſe no more ſeverity then we muſt needes. <hi>Abraham</hi> could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe this poor man of his pain, he could not ſo much as procure a mitigation of it, he found no means to provide him a drop of cold water; yet he found a way to expreſs his goodneſs, and affords him a <hi>Fili.</hi> Love, you ſay, will creep where it cannot go; it will expreſs it ſelf in ſmall matters, where greater will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.

Though it do no ſervice to the party for whom it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet it doth him ſervice that affords it: For, in all our actions we muſt conſider not onely what is good for others, but what becomes us to do, though no benefit accrue to others.</p>
            <p>The Pſalmiſt tells us, that <hi>the mercy of God is over all his works</hi>; and I infer, therefore over his works of judgement too. And who knowes then whether or no the very damned ſpirits have not ſome taſt of his goodneſs? Let us imitate God and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and love we our goodneſs ſo well, that even the moſt unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving creature may have ſome experience of it. If we cannot relieve him, yet it ſhall be ſome part of goodneſs to give him a <hi>Fili,</hi> to give him good words; that, as Gods, ſo our mercy too may be over all our works. The very faults of men though they deſerve correction, yet withall they deſerve pity; and therefore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61696:12"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> though they demand juſtice, yet they exclude not goodneſs, but even naturally call for it. <hi>Horace</hi> the Poet tells us of a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who having a good faculty in painting a Cypreſſe-tree, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted on all occaſions to ſhew his skill there; inſomuch that being requeſted to expreſs a ſhipwrack, he askt if he ſhould paint withall a Cypreſs-tree. Beloved, let our occaſions be as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as the Sea and a Cypreſſe-tree, yet, if we love our art of goodneſs as well as he did his art of painting the Cypreſs, <hi>erit locus etiam huic cupreſſo,</hi> there will be room enough to expreſs it, if we ſhall be willing to lay hold of the occaſion. So from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the preface I come to the words, <hi>Remember thou haſt received thy good things, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may remember I beg'd leave of you ere while, for the better uſe and application I am to make of them, to change the words; and as the crafty Steward in the Goſpel, who advis'd the creditor to take his book, and inſtead of an hundred to write down fifty; ſo I adviſed you inſtead of <hi>recordare,</hi> Remember, to write <hi>cave,</hi> beware. For, as the Apothecary, when he finds himſelf at a loſs, and cannot procure the drug he would have, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> takes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> as they call it, another drug or Simple that ſhall be of the ſame, or the like force to cure the diſeaſe; ſo fares it with me, who now am to cure a ſpirituall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in you; <hi>Recordare,</hi> as it lies in my Text, can never cure you: If it could, then might our rich man here have hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Heaven; for <hi>Abraham</hi> applies to him long agoe. For your uſe therefore, I am conſtrain'd to lay by <hi>Recordare,</hi> Remember, and take in <hi>Cave,</hi> Beware, for an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> becauſe it ſerves beſt for the cure I have in hand: That therefore you may not hereafter, when it is too late, hear from <hi>Abraham, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Recordare quòd recepiſti, Remember thou haſt received,</hi> let me intreat you this day, whileſt it is yet time to hear from me, <hi>Cave ne recipias,</hi> Take heed thou receive not thy good things in thy life: For, practiſe but this <hi>cave,</hi> and you ſhall never hear of <hi>Recordare</hi>; but if <hi>Cave</hi> come not in time, you muſt unavoidably expect a <hi>Recordare.</hi> Read we therefore our Text thus, <hi>Cave,</hi> Beware thou receive not thy good things. Now Beloved, this word <hi>Cave,</hi> beware, though in place and ſituation it reflect onely upon the word, <hi>recipias,</hi> receive, yet indeed it hath immediate influence upon every word I read. Firſt, here is the word, <hi>recipias,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> receive, heres a <hi>Cave</hi> put upon that to your hand: In ſome ſenſe therefore or other you may not receive the good things of this life, otherwiſe why is it caſt in this mans diſh that he received them? The next word is, <hi>tua bona,</hi> thy good things: <hi>thy,</hi> put a <hi>Cave</hi> there too; for indeed they are not thine. When we call the things of the world <hi>ours,</hi> ours is but a word of uſurpation;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61696:13"/>
we peradventure may be ſome emphyteuticaries, or farmers, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> uſufructuaries; but the propriety is in another perſon. The next word is <hi>bona,</hi> good things, <hi>good</hi>; put a <hi>Cave</hi> there too: adviſe well how you call them <hi>good.</hi> Were our rich man askt, what now he thought? I perſwade my ſelf he would paſs another cenſure of them; for how good ſoever they were in themſelves, yet to him they were not good. I have heard of a ſtatue of <hi>Venus</hi> ſo cunningly framed, that as men came toward it it ſeemed to ſmile, but as they turn'd from it it ſeemed to frown. The things of this life are ſomewhat akin to the ſtatue of <hi>Venus</hi>; as they come toward you they ſmile upon you, they are good; but as you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> turn from them, or they from you, many times they frown, they look with another countenance. The next word is <hi>things, good things</hi>; put a <hi>Cave</hi> there too. Take heed how thou cal'ſt them things; for indeed they are not things, <hi>but nothings.</hi> The laſt word is, <hi>thy life; Life,</hi> put a <hi>Cave</hi> there too. Take heed how thou call this preſent ſtate of things <hi>thy life.</hi> Nature taught <hi>Euripides</hi> the Poet to ask this queſtion, <hi>Who knowes whether to live be to die, and to die to live?</hi> But grace taught St. <hi>Paul</hi> to anſwer it, <hi>Now we live not, for our life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> So I return to reſume the words again, and to conſider a little more largely of them, <hi>Cave ne recipias,</hi> Take heed you receive not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quid Audio?</hi> What is this I heare? Muſt I not receive the good things of this life? If either right of patrimony and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance devolve them to me, or ſome caſuall providence of God caſt them upon me, or my labour and induſtry wooe and win them, muſt I bid defiance, and ſhut the doores againſt them? Is this precept here like to the command of old <hi>Euclio</hi> in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> who wills his ſervant to keep his doores ſhut, and open to none, <hi>ne ſi bona quidem fortuna venerit,</hi> no though good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune her ſelf ſhould come and knock? Beloved, here I am <hi>in bivio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to this queſtion; It is reported of <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the famous Philoſopher, that travelling over ſome parts of <hi>Africk,</hi> with his ſervants over-laden with gold, when they complained of their burthen, and told him that they were ſo loaded they ſhould never reach their journies end; he bad them lay down their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and take up ſo much as they thought themſelves conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently enabled to bear, and leave the reſt <hi>proximo occupanti,</hi> to the next that came that way. From this example I draw my anſwer; Wouldſt thou know whether thou ſhouldſt receive the good things of the world? Try thy ſtrength; art thou able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front occaſions, to converſe amongſt men, to wreſtle with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61696:13"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and take no foile? In a word, Art thou able, with the three in <hi>Daniel,</hi> to go through the fire, and come out untoucht? Do as <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> ſervants did, take up thy gold, receive the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that offer themſelves, entertain them, welcome them. On the contrary, art thou weak, or ſuſpecteſt thou thy ſtrength? will feares, or hopes, or pleaſures over-maſter thee? canſt thou not touch pitch but thou muſt be defiled with it? Then do as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtippus</hi> ſervants did, leave thy gold behind thee; theſe goodly glittering things, refuſe them, though they drop into thy lap. Briefly, two waies is this queſtion anſwered: Haſt thou ſtrength of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> mind? receive them; haſt thou not? refuſe them. The firſt is the wiſeſt way, the ſecond is the ſafeſt; He that receives them not doth well, but he that receives them doth better. I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the firſt; <hi>Receive them.</hi> I know that this ſeems a riddle unto you, for my Text ſeems to command you not to receive them; and I have told you that one way to put this precept in uſe, is to receive them. This is true, receive them we may, but yet ſo as if we received them not. Many of the Saints of God, yea <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf received large portions of the good of this world: And how then ſhall they, with <hi>Abraham</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> himſelf, avoid this bitter exprobration of <hi>Recepiſti, thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> but that ſome way or other even they that have received them may juſtly be ſaid not to have received them? <hi>J. Caeſar</hi> when he had conſidered of his eſtate, and ſumm'd it up, and found for how great a ſumme he was in debt, beyond what he was worth, he merrily ſaid, <hi>Tantum me oportet habere ut nihil habeam,</hi> So much muſt I have that I may give every man his own, and my ſelf have nothing. As <hi>Caeſar</hi> found a way to have much, and yet to have nothing; ſo thou muſt find out a way to receive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> much at the hands of God, and yet to have received nothing: For whatſoever it be that thou haſt received from God, thou art but in debt for it, thou art but intruſted with it; look what it is thou haſt, and ſay unto thy ſelf as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did, So much I have that I may have nothing. In debt I ſay thou art for all thou haſt; and wilt thou know who are thy creditors? even every man that needs thee. The hungry man begs at thy gate, he is thy creditor, thou art in debt to him for his dinner: The naked man in the ſtreets <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is thy creditor; thou art in debt to him for his garment: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he poore oppreſſed priſoner, he is thy creditor; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thou art in debt to him for his relief: The wronged captive he is thy creditor; thou art in debt to him for his redemption. Be then like the widowes oyle in the Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> run as long as there is a veſſel to receive thee; pay all theſe thy debts, and leave thy ſelf nothing, and lo, thou haſt found the wonderfull art of receiving much at the hands of God, and yet receiving nothing. Had our rich man here done thus, he had never heard of <hi>Recepiſti,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61696:14"/>
thou haſt received</hi>; for, to receive here is not to take that which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God offers, but to impropriate, to enjoy alone the gifts of God, either by diſpending them on thy ſelf, or thy vanities, or locking them up, and neither enjoying them thy ſelf, nor ſuffering any other ſo to do; by making them <hi>bona tua,</hi> and placing thy felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them; this is to receive. Thou ſitteſt at thy full table, and crams thy ſelf with meats and drinks, whilſt <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſterves at thy gate, <hi>recepiſti</hi>; thou cladſt thy ſelf with ſuperfluous and gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy apparell, whilſt thy naked Brother freezes in the ſtreet, <hi>rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisti</hi>; thou refeſheſt thy ſelf with dainty reſtoring Phyſick, whilſt the ſick indeed periſheth for want of care, <hi>recepiſti.</hi> Take heed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> every vanity, every ſuperfluity, every penny that thou haſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent to the prejudice of him that wants, when the time comes, ſhall cry out unto thee, <hi>Recepiſti, thou haſt received.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>recepiſſe, ſed non tibi,</hi> to have received, but not unto thy ſelf, to have ſpent thy ſelf for others good; he that doth thus, to him there can be no more objected a <hi>Recepiſti,</hi> then there can unto the Sun that he received his beames, which he hath communicated to the world; or to the fountain that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its ſprings, wherewith it hath water'd the earth for which it was given.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>Erewhile, when I conſidered the words in particular, I adviſed you to put a <hi>Cave</hi> upon the word, <hi>thy; thy good things</hi>: for indeed here is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, here is the ground of all abuſe and error, that we take upon us think and call any thing ours. For now we think, by and by we may infer, <hi>May we not do with our own what we list?</hi> we think we are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, no action of account lies againſt us, we fear no <hi>recepiſti.</hi> Beloved, there is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the uſe of that word then you are aware of; <hi>Ours, Mine,</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a groſs, a craſs, a ſecular term, eaſily taken up by wordlings, by better men not ſo eaſily. When <hi>Laban</hi> had overtaken <hi>Jacob,</hi> and began to chide with him, <hi>Theſe daughters,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are my daughters, theſe children are my children, theſe cattell are my cattell, and all that thou ſeeſt is mine. Jacob</hi> had done enough to ſtyle them his, he had bargain'd, he had ſerved, he had watcht, he had ſweat, he had freezed for them; and yet he would not take up that word, nor count any thing his. <hi>Nabal,</hi> a man of the ſame letters, and of the ſame garb and quality with <hi>Laban,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> ſent unto him to require relief of him, ſpeakes in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſame <hi>Sibboleth; Shall I take,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my bread, and my water, and my fleſh, which I have killed for my ſhearers, and give it unto men whom I know not?</hi> Neither is it any wonder that they thus ſpeak; for this is the language which they learnt of their Father, of their Prince, of their God, even the Prince which ruleth in the aire, the God of this world, the devil; for, he ſetting upon our Saviour in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61696:14"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Goſpel, courts him in the ſame manner; for, ſhewing him all the Kingdomes of the earth, and the glory of them, he tells him, <hi>All this is mine, and to whom I will I give it.</hi> He lies, I doubt not, when he thus ſpake, (but that's no marvell;) yea and all thoſe who take up the dialect, are no whit truer of their word. If the tongues of the children of Light have ſometimes tript that way, and fallen upon ſome of the ſame language, it is but out of contagion, an errour of converſation, ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who converſing with the Egyptian Courtiers, learnt of them to ſwear by the life of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> For, as walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in the Sun diſcolours us, ſo walking in ſpirituall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will bring upon us ſwarth and blackneſſe. But the ſonnes of God in their better thoughts ſpeak in another dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: when <hi>David</hi> had with great providence, with great hazard of perſon, treaſured up much for the uſe of the houſe of the Lord, and was now come to dedicate it, and offer it up unto God, he dares not ſay, <hi>Mine,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the Holy Ghoſt is pleaſed here to uſe the phraſe to the rich man, and call them <hi>bona tua, thy good things,</hi> this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is but by an Ironie and ſcorne; for, as they were originally, ſo ſtill continue they to be Gods, if abuſe do not alter the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, for it is abuſe onely that makes them be called <hi>ours:</hi> as the Poet told his friend, <hi>Quem recitas meus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> The Book, my friend, you read is mine; <hi>Sed malè dum recitas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit eſſe tuus,</hi> but if once you read it amiſſe, its now <hi>yours,</hi> and no longer <hi>mine.</hi> We read in the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that the Gold and Silver which was in <hi>Jerico</hi> was all Gods, and was to be brought into his Treaſury; but when <hi>Achan</hi> had once <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> purloin'd a part of it, and endeavour'd to turn it to unlawfull ends, God ownes it no longer, but it is brought forth and burnt, and buried with him, and no more thought worthy to be imployed in holy uſe. Parallel to this is there a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example in Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>; for, he writing of the Monks of <hi>Egypt,</hi> reports of one of them, that labouring with his hands, and living without ſcandall, at length he dyes: And when the brethren came to do their laſt duty to him, they found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, as my Author tells me, <hi>centum aureos,</hi> which was of our money about fifty pounds; and muſing much to find <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there ſuch a ſumme, and long conſulting what to do, at length they all agreed in this, they took the party and laid him in his grave, and laid his money by him, with this Farewell, <hi>Argentum tuum tecum in perditionem,</hi> Thy money periſh with thee. It ſeems therefore that things abuſed either to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity and wantonneſſe, or to covetous and unprofitable ends, are no longer fit for God, or good mens ſervice; therefore they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61696:15"/>
periſh with the abuſers. Uſe them as God requires, and they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> remain ſtill Gods; <hi>non recepiſti,</hi> thou haſt not received them, they are not thine: abuſe them once to folly or avarice, God ownes them not; <hi>recepiſti,</hi> thou haſt received them, and made them <hi>tua bona,</hi> thy good things, by abuſing them.</p>
            <p>Yet that we may deſcend a little more particularly into this queſtion of propriety, wouldſt thou know indeed what it is <hi>quod poſſis dicere jure, meum eſt,</hi> of which thou maiſt juſtly ſay unto thy ſelf, it is <hi>mine?</hi> Examine thy ſelf, find out thine own meaſure, ſo much as thou needeſt is <hi>thine,</hi> the reſt thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> art but entruſted withall for others good. That part of the beam of light which ſhines in thine eye is thine, all the reſt is anothers; that which thou eateſt to ſuffice thine hunger is thine, all the reſt is thy neighbours; that water which thou drinkeſt of thy well, is thine, all the reſt is <hi>occupantis.</hi> If thy Barnes and Store-houſes, thy Wardrobes, thy Treaſuries, impriſon and detain any thing, thou art but a common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and offendeſt againſt a common profit. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> It is the bread of the hungry that thou detaineſt, it is the garment of the naked which thou lockeſt up in thy Wardrobe, it is the ſhooe of the bare foot that rots by thee, it is the poores money, and the talent of thy Lord which thou hideſt under the ground; look how many thou haſt not furniſht, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haſt thou wronged. It is well that the providence of God hath left in common the light, the heat, the influence of Heaven, <hi>&amp; omnibus undamque auramque patentem</hi>; for if ſome men had their will, even theſe ſhould ſuffer incloſure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> neither ſhould we freely enjoy the benefit of light and aire. For, I know not how it falls out, that whereas there are two pages, two parts of every account, the receipt and the expence, there is a reigning madneſs amongſt men to increaſe their receipts, whileſt in the mean time they are ſecure of their expence; whereas it is the expence that moſt concernes us; for what we ſhall receive is in the care and will of our maſter, but all our care and providence is ſeen in our expence. Now I know not how it comes to paſſe, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſeem to leſſen the reputation of thrift and good husbandry with God, and therefore they treaſure and lock up their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, as if they thought to clear their accounts, and ſave themſelves from a <hi>recepiſti,</hi> by returning God his own again. But the account with God is in one circumſtance very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that with men; the Steward that hath received his

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Lords money, when he comes to his audit, if he repay what he hath not expended, he hath his acquittance, and all is well: But in our great audit with God there is no refunding, all muſt be diſpended. Could we pay back again our Lords money which we have not laid out, yet ſtill the account depends, ſtill we are in danger of a <hi>recepiſti</hi>; for nothing cleares our accounts with God but pariation of expences with receipts, Gods account muſt have no remain. Secular thrift is ſeen in ſaving, but divine thrift is beſt ſeen in ſpending: whether therefore thou ſpendeſt amiſſe, or whether thou ſaveſt amiſſe, thou art ſtill liable to a <hi>Recepiſti.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat then remaines but that we take that counſel which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> gives us, <hi>Tanquam defunctus omni terreno te abdica negotio: contemne vivens quae poſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem habere non poteris.</hi> As if you were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> men already dead, ſequeſter and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate your ſelves from earth and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: Scorn that whileſt you live which you cannot be owners of when you are dead. If we were to make choice of ſome friend and companion whom we would endear unto us, with whom, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes, we were to take ſweet counſel together, and walk in every place as friends; if we could undoubtedly foreſee that after all our expreſſions of love and courteſie to him, at the laſt he would forſake us, would we admit him into our boſome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> partake him of our counſel, and make no end at being at coſt, and beſtowing favours on him? Beloved, not onely meats and the Belly, of which here St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, but even all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things of the world, which we wooe with ſo much affection, purchaſe with ſo much labour, retain with ſo much fear, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with ſo much expence; all theſe, if at length they betray us not, if they abuſe us not, if they pay us not home with eternall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61696:17"/>
infamy and death, yet we know for certain that at laſt they will,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they muſt forſake us. What madneſs then is it to entertain with the expence of ſo much affection, ſo much time, ſo much labour, ſuch unthankfull gueſts? But let us fall off from this ſo generall a ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>Theſe words which I have read ſeem to come towards us, like the man that rid upon the pale horſe, in the 6. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and hell followed him. Here are <hi>meats and the belly,</hi> the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and the beaſt, the horſe and the rider; but death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction follow them at the heeles, it behoves you to take heed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> how you entertain them. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> was coming out of <hi>France,</hi> and now advancing towards <hi>Rome,</hi> the Senate and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſend him word, that if he would be welcome there, he muſt diſmiſſe his companies and followers. Beloved, here now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe themſelves unto you <hi>meats and the belly</hi>; let their welcome be no other then <hi>Caeſars</hi> entertainment, let them diſmiſſe their followers; if you admit them upon other termes, be ſure you ſhall entertain with them death and deſtruction. There is in the Roman Story a ſtrange relation of the <hi>Equus Seianus,</hi> a horſe of one <hi>Seius,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> excellent for ſhape, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and pace, but unfortunate; never any man owned him but came to ruine; <hi>Seius,</hi> his firſt maſter is beheaded; next <hi>Dolabella</hi> periſhes in a battel; <hi>Caſsius</hi> the next, he murthers himſelf at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi</hi>; and <hi>Antony,</hi> his laſt maſter, dyed a miſerable death. The belly is indeed the true <hi>Equus Seianus,</hi> no man ever entertain'd him but it ruin'd him; for, ſtill the laſt ſhot, the laſt reckoning can never be diſcharged but by the death of the entertainer. The Ark of God, though whileſt it was abroad in the Land of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> it plagued every one that medled with it, yet when it was at home in its own Land it brought a bleſſing to him that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> gave it houſe room: But as for the belly and meats, it ſeems they have no proper country, no home, no place gaines a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by them; for even in this world, which is their native ſoil, they muſt be deſtroyed; and as for the true <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, there they have no place at all.</p>
            <p>I will not ſtudy out, as the manner is, any curious diviſion of theſe words. The Holy Ghoſt hath here joyn'd the belly and meats together, and God hath entail'd deſtruction unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them both. Thoſe whom God and the holy Spirit hath thus tyed I will not go about to divide: <hi>Pereant res perditae; Belly, Meats and deſtruction,</hi> all here go hand in hand, and let them ſo go undivided. And no marvel, for to keep the belly within bounds there is nothing of power ſufficient but deſtruction. <hi>The tongue</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>James,) is an unruly evill.</hi> Beloved, the tongue
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61696:17"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is not a more unruly evill then the belly; it is the fourth daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the horſe-leech, unſatiable, evermore crying, give, give; a rigorous creditor, which every day receives, and every day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a tribute of meats and drinks, and pleaſures, and the like: which way ſhall we go about to tame it? Firſt, it is not reaſon that can rule it: It was the ſaying of old <hi>Cato, Venter non habet aures,</hi> The belly hath no eares; now it is a vain thing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perſwade with that which hath no eares. Secondly, it is not time that can over-maſter it; for <hi>Vitia ventris non modò non minuit aetas, verùm etiam auget</hi>; The vice and evil of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> intemperance in meats and drinks, is no way moderated, it is exaſperated and increaſed by age. Thirdly, it is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of coſt and large expence that can reſtrain it; for it is a ſolemn maxime in the ſchool of gluttony, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, A near and hard and hucking chapman ſhall never buy good fleſh. The belly and money eaſily part; <hi>Eſau</hi> will forgoe his birth-right, his honor, rather then loſe his dinner. <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> reports of a captain, one <hi>Hugucchio,</hi> that loſt two Townes, onely becauſe he would not break his meal; for, being invited to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick feaſt, and receiving tidings of a revolt intended he neglected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and let ſlip the occaſion, onely becauſe he was loth to loſe his ſhare of a liberall dinner. Fifthly, it is not policy nor wiſdom that can over-reach it. <hi>Solomon,</hi> the moſt politick and wiſeſt man that ever was, proſtitutes his learning, wit, wiſedom, and all, to that baſe and ſordid appetite. Sixthly, it may be ſickneſs and fear of death may ſeem to ſpeak to the belly with ſome autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and bear ſome hand over it. <hi>Demades</hi> the Orator was wont to ſay of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they never came to conſult of peace, <hi>niſi atrati,</hi> but in blacks and mourning; by which he meant, that that people, till war had brought ſome extreme inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> upon them, and ſwept away their citizens, their friends, their kindred, would never think of peace. As the <hi>Athenians</hi> did by peace, ſo do we by temperance; we never bethink our ſelves, or conſult of moderate diet, <hi>niſi atrati,</hi> but in blacks and mourning, when our folly and intemperance hath caſt us into ſome diſeaſe, and affrighted us with fear of death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet even this, though it be the ſtrongeſt, cannot much prevail with the Belly; for how many do we ſee that in the midſt of their ſickneſs and of death yet cannot forget their trenchers? As they have been wont, <hi>molliter valere,</hi> to be dainty in the time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of health, ſo will they endeavour <hi>delicatè aegrotare,</hi> to be delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their ſickneſs; <hi>vinum aut frigidam concupiſcunt, &amp; delicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum patrocinium in accuſationem non merentis ſtomachi habent,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi>; they deſire to pleaſe their intemperance with meats and drinks which hurt them, and put off the fault of a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton appetite with pretence of a weak ſtomach. When <hi>Philoxenus</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61696:18"/>
the Epicure had fallen deſperately ſick upon glutting himſelf on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a delicate and coſtly fiſh, perceiving he was to dye, he calls for the remainder of his fiſh, and eats it up, and dies a true martyr to his belly. By this time you ſee, I hope, why it pleaſed God thus to yoke the belly and meats with death and deſtruction. Other paſſions in us find ſomething that can ſubdue them, that can root them out: Fear and Anger they will yield to time and reaſon; Luſt will abate with age and abſtinence; onely the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant appetite to meats and drinks is unconquerable, except it be by death, or extreme ſickneſs, which is the way to death. This <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is a devil which no faſting, no prayer can caſt forth, not time, nor reaſon can extinguiſh. The Leſſons therefore which I will raiſe from theſe words ſhall not ſpring from any diviſion of them; I will conſider them all in a lump, and out of this, that God hath irrevocably and without reprieve, doom'd both belly and meats unto deſtruction, I will fall to conſider of ſuch reaſons as ought to be of force with us to wean our heart and love from theſe things, which muſt at length moſt certainly periſh.</p>
            <p>Yet ere I paſs away to that part of my meditations, give me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> leave to make this quere, whence it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> paſſes this ſentence of deſtruction upon the belly? Shall not the belly run the ſame fortune with the reſt of its fellow-members? When all the reſt of the body ſhall be raiſed from the grave to immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſhall the belly alone lye rotting for ever in the duſt? Or, if it riſe again, wherein then doth this ſentence of deſtruction ſtrike at the belly more then any other part? for, it were no good congruity to expound it of the common mortality in which all the members have alike their ſhare. For anſwer; At that laſt and great and joyfull day, when all that are in the monuments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſhall hear the voice of God, theſe bodies of ours (every ſeed his own body) ſhall come out of their graves, with all their parts entirely as now they are; altered indeed, I confeſs, in quality, in agility, in glory and ſplendor, in impaſſibility, but in ſubſtance, and in all eſſentiall properties numerically the ſame. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction therefore which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſentences the belly unto, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes not the ſubſtance, (for in this reſpect the head, the hands, the belly, the feet, all the members are in like ſtate) but onely the uſe. The reſt of the members of our body ſhall not onely riſe the ſame in ſubſtance, but ſhall remain the ſame in function <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and uſe: Theſe feet ſhall ſupport us, with theſe hands ſhall we handle the Word of life, with theſe eyes ſhall we ſee him, with this tongue, theſe lips, and no other, ſhall we praiſe and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie him for ever: But the belly, and ſuch parts as in uſe depend from it, ſhall indeed riſe and remain the ſame in ſubſtance, but their function and uſe ſhall for ever ceaſe; for, it is not onely
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61696:18"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> true which our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>they ſhall neither marry, nor be given in marriage</hi>; but neither ſhall we hunger, nor thirſt, nor receive nouriſhment, nor concoct, nor digeſt; which all are the proper uſes of the belly in the time of our mortality. Ariſe therefore ſhall our members from the duſt and rottenneſs, and though not all <hi>quoad uſum,</hi> for uſe and function, yet all <hi>quoad complementum corporis,</hi> to make the body entire and complete. And ſo I come to fall upon thoſe meditations at which I but now pointed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meats for the belly.</hi> Eating was the way by which ſin firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> came into the world: I think I may ſay the firſt eating begat the firſt ſin. If I miſtake, the ancient Fathers of the Church have led me into error; for, in their Homilies &amp; Exhortations unto Faſting, nothing is more frequent with them than to fall foul upon our firſt Parents, becauſe they brake their faſt too timely, and amiſs, where they ſhould not. So that it ſeems eating and ſin are twins, born at the ſame time, and at the ſame birth. Had <hi>eating</hi> bred no other ſin but this, yet this one, which was the provoker of Gods wrath, which expelld' us from Paradiſe, which brought a curſe upon our ſelves, and all the world beſide, which had laid us for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ever in duſt and rottenneſs, if the Son of God had not come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to redeem us; this one I ſay had been enough to have taken from us all appetite to meats, and bound us to a perpetual faſt. For, if <hi>Ahab</hi> fell down upon his bed, and refuſed his meat, becauſe <hi>Naboth</hi> would not give him his Vineyard, how much more might our firſt Parents have bound themſelves to a perpetual ſullenneſs and abſtinence, that thus by eating loſt a far fairer Garden than that of <hi>Naboth?</hi> But, Beloved, as Sin and Eating were born to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo, like loving twins, they walk on hand in hand; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> look to the next ſin, to that of <hi>Cain,</hi> and ſee if eating have not a hand in that too; for, whence came it that <hi>Cains</hi> Sacrifice was not accepted? <hi>Malè diviſit,</hi> ſay the Ancients; and ſome have thought that the Hebrew Text ſaith ſo too, he made an ill divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion betwixt God and himſelf; for whereas <hi>Abel</hi> brought of the fatteſt and the beſt, and offered them to God, <hi>Cain</hi> thought worſe and meaner were fit enough for God; the beſt he kept for his own diet. Go we forward, and take notice of the ſins which drew the floud upon the world, and we ſhall find that <hi>eating</hi> was not behind in helping them on. The Scriptures point out two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſins unto us, <hi>Oppreſsion</hi> and <hi>Luſt:</hi> Intemperate luſt is the inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companion of intemperate eating; <hi>Nunquam vidi continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem quem non vidi abſtinentem,</hi> Seldom have you ſeen one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent that is not abſtinent. We have thus far ſurveyed one world, and the ſins of it, and we have found that eating is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the firſt ſin, the next, the laſt; all thrive by the favour of intemperance in meats, or drinks, or both. But now
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61696:19"/>
we have a new world, clean waſht; what is it which now brings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſin upon <hi>Noah,</hi> the father of the ſecond world? even the ſame in a manner which brought it upon <hi>Adam,</hi> the father of the firſt; <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned by eating, <hi>Noah</hi> by drinking: <hi>Eating, Drinking,</hi> no great matter to chooſe, both are <hi>gula,</hi> both are the intemperance of the mouth, and taſt, and belly; and both intended here by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> under the name of <hi>Meats. Veriſimile non eſt ut quis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiam gulam Deo immolet, aquis ſobrius, cibis ebrius,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian:</hi> As therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> acknowledged a drunkenneſs in <hi>meats,</hi> ſo is there gluttony in <hi>wines</hi> and <hi>drinks.</hi> So then, as by the mouth and belly ſin comes into the new world, ſo it goes on; for,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the ſin next ſpecified in Scripture is that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the five Cities: Would you know what ſins they were? the Prophet will tell you, <hi>Idleneſſe and fulneſſe of bread:</hi> He adds not Luſt, for he needs not; that followes naturally upon the former, <hi>tanquam va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra vibiam.</hi> Idleneſs, fulneſs, and luſt, they are a threefold cord, twiſted by the devil, and hardly untwined and ſevered by any man. <hi>Mens enim otioſi nihil aliud cogitare novit niſi de eſcis &amp; ventre,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caſsianus; The mind of an idle perſon runs upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his belly and meats.</hi> No ſooner were the Jews freed from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Egyptian bondage, and now began to be at leiſure, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, <hi>Agape in cacabis fervet, fides in culinis calet, ſpes in ferculis ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet</hi>; All their meditations are fixt upon the fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their devotion is ſpent upon Onions and Garlick, and thoſe other Egyptian Deities. Now, the belly once filled, you need not doubt what follows: <hi>Repletus venter facilè deſpumat in libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem; A full belly eaſily diſſolveth and diſchargeth it ſelf by luſt. Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon,</hi> diſpoſed to trifle away ſome of his ſpare time, writes an idle diſcourſe, which he calls his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his Banquet; where, after much impertinent talk, for the cloſe and upſhot of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he brings in, for the farther chearing up of his company, two young boyes acting <hi>Bacchus</hi> going to bed to <hi>Ariadne</hi>; which they did in ſo groſs, ſo unſeemly, ſo looſe a manner, that by and by (ſaith my Author) all that were married haſted home to their wives, and the unmarried vowed they would not continue long ſo. Lo here the true iſſue of intempeſtive comeſſation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potation; for ſurfet and luſt dwell never far aſunder. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had forbidden the Romans <hi>Rioting and drunkenneſſe,</hi> he immediately addes unto them, <hi>cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and wantonneſs; Appendices ſcilicet gulae, laſciviae &amp; luxuriae,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> upon thoſe very words doth note; <hi>Wantonneſſe and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> luxury are the complement of riot and intemperance.</hi> By all this which I have delivered I ſuppoſe by this time that your ſelves can conclude, what care and watch we ought to hold over our meats and drinks; for, if eating were the door which firſt admitted ſin, if it hath been a perpetual fomenter &amp; nouriſher of ſin, we can
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61696:19"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> do no leſs than to <hi>ſet a watch upon the door of our lips,</hi> not onely to beware what goes out, but what likewiſe goes in there. Unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fencers will be ſure ſtill to remove their ward there where they have once received a blow, though they ſuffer ſome other part to lie open: It were a great ſhame for us, if having ſo long combated with the Devil, and received ſo many blows by incau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous eating, we ſhould not have ſo much wit as young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful fencers have, remove our ward thither. Yet I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring certain reaſons, farther to move you to keep dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ward about the action.</p>
            <p>And firſt, the error and intemperance of eating is cloſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, it is not ſo eaſily diſcovered, and ſo moſt-what eſcapes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. This ſecurity, as it is a great enticer to the vice, ſo ſhould it ſtir us up the more to be watchful over it. The vice of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs preſently betrayes it ſelf, <hi>crimen vultu inceſſuque fatetur ebrius:</hi> The gate, the look, the ſpeech, the colour of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, all theſe betray the drunkard, and lay him open to ſhame and reproof. Hence it is that fits of Surfet upon meats are moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtoln, no eye ſees them; ſurfet upon beer or win not ſo. As <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it hath been ſaid of unskilful Phyſicians, under whoſe hands ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Patients miſcarry, <hi>that the earth hides their faults</hi>; ſo may it be ſaid of thoſe who offend in meats, the earth many times hides their faults; ſome ſudden, ſome ſharp diſeaſe brings them to their grave, where the cauſe lies hidden till the reſurrection: in the mean time ſome ordinary caſualty, or the will of God, gives countenance to what is done. Again, it is not a thing hard to be diſcovered, that there is a partiality in men in their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of theſe vices; many men are oft-times very angry with full cups, who can be patient enough at full-fraught tables. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> tells us, that thoſe that delighted in pleaſing ſmells are not to be ranged among intemperate perſons: I muſt confeſs I think he was deceived; for, to be over-indulgent, over-ſtudious to pleaſe any one ſenſe whatſoever, I ſay not onely the Taſte and Touch, but the Eye with gawdy ſhews, the Smell with fragrant and coſtly perfumes, the Ear with dilicate Airs in Muſick, is truly vanity and intemperance. The reaſon of his error was, that he meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vices by the ſenſible inconvenience that follows upon them. Divines diſtinguiſh of the Sacrament; ſome there be, ſay they, <hi>quae imprimunt characterem, which leave a mark behind them</hi>; others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> leave none at all. This diſtinction fits the vices well; but <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> knew it not: Some vices leave a character, a mark, by which you may eaſily diſcover them; others are more cloſe, their way is like the way of <hi>a ſerpent over a ſtone, or the way of a bird in the air,</hi> they leave no track, no footſtep behind them. Sin in meats is very often committed, but it is not often diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61696:20"/>
you cannot trace it, it many times leaves no character to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it. Now, Beloved, (and this was the reaſon why I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all this) by ſo much the more ought we to be wary in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing this vice, by how much it is retired and uneſpied; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what the Apoſtle hath told us, that <hi>Some mens ſins are open before hand, going before unto judgment; and ſome follow after.</hi> Open ſins, ſins that leave a character, theſe go before unto judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but ſins that are otherwiſe ſhall not be hidden.</p>
            <p>Secondly, another reaſon perſwading us to keep watch cover the vice of eating, is, that we have no law to reſtrain it; for table,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for diet, no man hath any law but his money or his credit. Let our exceſs be never ſo great, let the ſurfet be never ſo apparent, yet is there no Magiſtrate to chaſtiſe it. This neglect opens a way to the practice of the ſin, and makes men believe that the vice is lawful. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> complained much that there was no law to reſtrain the errors of Phyſicians, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, excepting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſome ſmall diſgraceful report when a fault was eſpied. Errors of diet have not ſo much as this to reſtrain them; yet to make a law in this behalf there is cauſe and ground enough. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt reip. ne quis re ſua malè utatur</hi>; It is a rule warranted by all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> reaſon, that it concerneth the publick good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth that no man make ill uſe of what is his. The want of laws is it which hath given entrance to ſuch monſters of luxury and prodigality of whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpake, <hi>Quibus deus venter eſt, &amp; culina templum, &amp; aqualiculus altare, &amp; ſacerdos coquus, &amp; ſanctus Spiritus nidor, &amp; condimenta chariſmata, &amp; ructus prophetia eſt: Whoſe god is their belly, the kitchin is their temple, the dreſſer is their altar, the cook is their prieſt, &amp;c.</hi> What examples are extant every where of this kind of men? <hi>Auguſtinus Chieſsius,</hi> a Banker,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a Money-merchant at <hi>Rome,</hi> at the Chriſtning of his ſon enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth upon the River of <hi>Tibris,</hi> and all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Ambaſſadors, with the Nobles of the City, with all exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and curious fare, diſht out in coſtly plate; and upon the change of every Service, (and they were not a few) all the meats, plate and all, all was caſt away into the River, and new and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier ſtill ſupplied in the room. But what need I ſeek ſo far as <hi>Rome?</hi> our own Kingdom will yield us examples. Search but our own Records, conſult but with the Author <hi>De praeſulibus Angliae, Of the Prelates of England,</hi> and ſee what a prodigious Dinner is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there deſcribed, at the Conſecration of one of the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury; &amp; horum tamen nihil Gallion curae erat,</hi> yet was there found none of the <hi>Gallions,</hi> none of the Magiſtrates of the times, that took it to heart, or once thought to chaſtiſe it. Yet had the ancient Romans (to the ſhame of Chriſtians) their <hi>Leges ſumptuarias,</hi> ſuch laws as gave reſtraint to riot and exceſs at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> But what ſpeak I of the laws of men? The firſt poſitive law that ever God himſelf made was <hi>lex ſumptuaria,</hi> a law confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Adam</hi> in his diet and eating. From this Act of God we may obſerve theſe two things; Firſt, the neceſſity of circumſcribing and giving bounds to that action. Secondly, which is the beſt and fitteſt time to enact this law. And firſt, for the neceſſity; it hath been by vertuous men evermore thought, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and firſt ſtep to vertue is, <hi>ventri bellum indicere,</hi> to bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the belly, and betimes to begin to check it. <hi>Primum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ineundum certamen eſt adverſus gaſtrimargiam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caſsianus</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The firſt ſtroke which is to be given in this our warfare againſt the fleſh, is to be directed againſt the belly. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was wont to command his ſouldiers, <hi>faciem ferire,</hi> to ſtrike at the face; the laws of our ſpiritual warfare give us another rule. Men by the light of nature have ſeen thus much; it was the counſel of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Firſt, and above all things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be ſure to make your ſelf maſter of your belly.</hi> See you not what men do in the beſieging of Cities? they cut off all convoy of victual, and that done, they know the place cannot long hold out. He that intends a leaguer, and purpoſes to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> maſter of his body, let him be ſure to cut off all unneceſſary convoys of meats and drinks, and the ſiege cannot laſt long. Secondly, I told you there was another thing obſervable in this action of God, and that is the time in which he gave this law. <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> brother to <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen,</hi> had a conceit, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> remained in Paradiſe forty dayes, and that the law concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eating was not given til the very later end of this time; &amp; that that part of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> diſputation <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Once was I alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, but the Law came, ſin revived, and I was dead,</hi> was to be underſtood in the perſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> for that part of the forty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dayes wherein he ſuppoſed that the law concerning eating was not given. Beloved, I know no ground, no warrant for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; the Scriptures tell me that <hi>Adam,</hi> immediately upon his creation was brought into Paradiſe; that immediately upon his entrance into Paradiſe the Commandment concerning eating was layed upon him; no footſtep of any longer date of time is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was the purpoſe of God that <hi>Adam</hi> from his very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhould be a ſubject of obedience; wherefore he leaves him not an hour to his own diſcretion, but reſolves to make trial of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his obedience in the very firſt action which in courſe of Nature he was to do. Betimes, immediately upon his firſt creation, in his infancy as it were, he thinks good to ſet bounds to his diet. Nature leads the hand to the mouth; and hence it is, that Infants, whatſoever you put in their hands they preſently put it to their mouths. This proneneſs therefore of nature God reſtrains at the very beginning; to leave unto us an example to do the like by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61696:21"/>
thoſe whoſe education is committed to our charge; for from neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of this proceeds the greateſt part of the miſcarriage of youths in their luxurious and riotous courſes. <hi>Ante palatum eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quàm os inſtituimus,</hi> We ſeaſon their palats, and teach them to know delicate meats, before they can give plain accent to any ſyllable. From the liberty they ſee we take they learn to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious; from our full tables they learn to riot; from our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample they learn to love evil before they know what good is. Hence is the world filled with complaints, Fathers of Children for their luxury, Children of Fathers for their ill example; for,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it is but juſt that evil example ſhould return upon the head of him that gave it. <hi>Petrus Crinitus,</hi> a great Clerk in the dayes of our Grandfathers, thought it fit (forſooth) when he was now old, to do as <hi>Socrates</hi> did, under colour of free teaching to converſe with youths in the ſtreets, in the Teniſcourts, in Taverns and Compotations: But this error coſt him dear; for being on a time in a youthful meeting, one of his petulant Convivators poured a cup of cold water on his head; which affront he took ſo heavily that he went home and died. Let Parents and Tutors take heed what behaviour they uſe with thoſe who are committed to their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> charge; for let them make account they will <hi>frigidâ perfundere,</hi> firſt or laſt they will pour a cup of cold water upon their heads, to their grief and ſhame. To conclude then this point; Find we no law made to reſtrain the vice of eating? let us remember what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>A good man is a law unto himſelf:</hi> let every man be his own Magiſtrate, and let him lay upon himſelf this law, <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſuperfluum vetitum eſto,</hi> Whatſoever is ſuperfluous in meats and drinks let it be taken as forbidden. And ſo I paſs away unto another point.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>A third inducement unto the vice of eating, of which we ought carefully to beware, is this; we ſee that the cuſtom of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous eating preſcribes upon us occaſions: for, I know not how, generally all the world over, it is become one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pieces of State and Ceremony. No ſolemn day, no triumph, no publick joy, no great buſineſs, but eating muſt be the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and moſt ceremonious part. Coronations of Kings, Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations of Biſhops, Academical Acts and proceedings, Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into Maioralties and Offices, Marriages, Chriſtnings, Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, caſual ſalutation betwixt private friends, expreſſions of love,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Careſſing and much-making, the chief ſolemnity, the crown of all theſe is ſuperfluous eating: As if our life were like to one of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> or <hi>Plautus</hi> Comedies, no Scene of it muſt paſs without an eating and gormondizing paraſite. <hi>Quid hoc aliud eſt quàm inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare hominum cupiditates per ſe incitatas?</hi> What is this but to adde oyle unto the fire; to ſet afire thoſe deſires and luſts in men
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61696:21"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which are already too much inflamed? <hi>Pliny,</hi> conſidering with himſelf the nature of the Element of Fire, how rapacious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring a thing it is, and quickly conſumes whatſoever it layes hold of; what ſtore of it there was in the world; how it was in every houſe, in every mans hand; how it was above us in fiery Meteors, and beneath us in Fountains in the bowels of the earth; began to marvel with himſelf that all the world was not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with fire. He that ſhall conſider with himſelf how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a thing ſuperfluous eating is, how it exhauſts and waſtes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> mens eſtates, how it deſtroyes our health; and withall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how common it is with all men, of all eſtates, and how it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixes it ſelf with all occaſions, all actions, might marvel, as well as <hi>Pliny</hi> did at fire, why by means of it the world was not long ſince deſtroyed. All this perchance might yet be tolerable; for we have medled yet but with the world: Now St. <hi>John</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the world of three Elements and principles, <hi>the luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eye, and the pride of Life.</hi> Superfluous eating is one of theſe three, or at leaſt a part of one of them. But what ſhall we ſay when we find it <hi>in Dei rebus,</hi> when we ſhall find it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> made a part of Religion and the Service of God?</p>
            <p>The world is apt upon all occaſions to fall upon unneceſſary comeſſation and compotations, the Church needs not ſtrike in to ſet it forward, and make feaſting a part of Religion, and bring the Church and the Kitchin together. And yet we ſee it doth; for when we celebrate the memorial of any Saint, the birth or death of any Apoſtle or Martyr, do we not call this ſolemnity their Feaſt, and ſo accordingly ſolemnize it with exceſs of cheer? I have often wondred upon what diſcretion it is that Chriſtians <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> have thought fit to celebrate the memorials of Saints with feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Why ſhould times of greateſt ſeriouſneſs be managed with feaſting, which is one of the greateſt vanities? <hi>Stultum eſt nimia ſaturitate honorare velle Martyrem, quem conſtat Deo placuiſſe jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis; It is a fooliſh thing,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Hierom, for any man to think he honours the Saints with eating, who are known to have pleaſed God beſt by faſting.</hi> The ancient Ethnicks were wont to celebrate their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their feaſts of ſobriety and faſting in the honor of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who was their god of riot and drunkenneſs. Upon the like fancy I think (elſe I know not whence it ſhould come) have Chriſtians <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> enterpriſed to appoint feaſts of exceſs in the honor of the Saints, who are known to be, I ſay not Gods, but, preſidents and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all temperance and abſtinence. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is wont, even to this day, when ſhe gets the reliques and aſhes of any of the Saints, to lap them up in ſilk and coſtly ſtuff, and ſhrine them in ſilver and gold; whereas, whne the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were on earth, and their bodies the living Temples of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61696:22"/>
the Holy Ghoſt, they would have thought themſelves much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> wronged if any ſuch coſtly ornaments ſhould have been employed about them. Shall we think we honour them when we lodge their dead bones in ſtately Sepulchres, whoſe glory it was in their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to dwell in poor cells, and grots, and caverns of the earth? Since their departure from us to heaven, have they altered their judgment, and learned there to approve and admire that which here in earth they thought their chief vertue to contemn? <hi>Scilicet nostros mores templis immittimus,</hi> We think that God and the Saints are like our ſelves, and taken with that which pleaſeth us: For, whether or no to expend theſe things in honour of God, be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſign of our love to him, I know not; but this I know, that it is a moſt certain ſign, and a betrayer of our love to thoſe things. For, Beloved, if we had no love unto them, if we bare them no reſpect, would we think we honour'd God by offering that to him which we our ſelves contemn? <hi>Macchiavel,</hi> writing the life of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio Caſtracano,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Luca,</hi> tels us, that he delighted himſelf much in often feaſting; and being reproved for it by ſome friends of his, he gave them this anſwer, <hi>If feaſting were not a good thing, men would not honour God and the Saints ſo much with it.</hi> Lo here, Beloved, the natural conſequence of Church-feaſts; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they are nothing elſe but an Apology for luxury: For when the Miniſters of God ſhall out of theſe and the like places reprove ſuperfluity of diet, the people have their anſwer ready, If this were a fault, then why is Chriſt and his Saints thus honoured with it?</p>
            <p>This ſplendor of feaſting and eating in memory of the Saints hath a little dazel'd the eyes of ſome great perſons; St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> although a great Clerk, and ſingular contemner of ſecular ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> yet we ſee in what a ſtrange paſſion he was when he wrote his book againſt <hi>Vigilantius.</hi> And what, think you, might be the cauſe of ſo much heat? Underſtand you muſt, that there was a cuſtom in the Church, in ſundry places, for men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, young and old, of all qualities and conditions, upon the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils of the Martyrs, to come together by night, and meet in Church-yards, and there eat and drink upon the Tombs of the Martyrs. This corruption <hi>Vigilantius</hi> had reproved: And good cauſe I think he had ſo to do; <hi>Nox, vinum, mulier,</hi> when men, women, maids, ſhall meet together by night in Church-yards to eat and drink, I think your own diſcretion will eaſily ſuggeſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> unto you what fruits were like to come. It ſeems the Churches found ſome which they liked not well of; for by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent theſe kinds of meetings have been long ſince laid down; and in ſome Churches expreſs Canons by Synods have been made to decry them. Yet the maintenance of this was that great matter
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61696:22"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which caſt St. <hi>Hierom</hi> into ſo great choler. Yet theſe men have brought feaſts into the Militant Church; what ſhall we think of thoſe who have brought feaſting into the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant?</p>
            <p>There was an error in the Church, very ancient and very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, called the error of the <hi>Millenaries</hi>; which aroſe immediately after the Apoſtles times, and ſtrongly prevailed with almoſt all the Fathers of the Church before the Nicene Council: Theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> men taught, that there would be a time when our Saviour ſhould come from Heaven, and raiſe out of the duſt all thoſe that were his, and reign with them here on earth a thouſand years, in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, in all ſecular pomp imaginable. Would you know what b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſings theſe men did expect in that imaginary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Let <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> tell it you, who was one of the great Patrons of that error, and lived within two hundred yeares of Chriſt: He bringing in our Saviour diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his Diſciples concerning the ſtate of that Kingdom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other inſtances of great happineſſe there to be found, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> makes him report this, <hi>There ſhall be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in a field ten thouſand vines, every vine ſhall have ten thouſand branches, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry branch ten thouſand ſtalks, every ſtalk ten thouſand cluſters, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cluſter ten thouſand grapes, and every grape</hi> (viginti quinque metretas) <hi>five and twenty pottles of wine.</hi> More to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe doth that Father ſpeak; by which he evidently betrayed what a childiſh groſs conceit he had of the ſpiritual Kingdome of Chriſt, which he took to be like <hi>Mahomets</hi> Paradiſe, and meaſured out the Kingdome of Heaven by meats and drinks; which, above all things in the world that carry any neceſſity in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them, are the moſt vain.</p>
            <p>Again, for the better countenance of this outward jollity in the Church, I ſee ſome men have attempted to entitle our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt himſelf unto it; for, Firſt, it is eſpied in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that our Saviour is often found at feaſts. Now for the reſt, that which the Scripture cannot do, Tradition ſhall help us out in; for, in the Second place, Tradition will inſtruct us, that the ſeamleſſe Coat which he wore was of a precious ſtuff and admirable texture. Thirdly, Tradition will tell us that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he had a ſilver cup, wherein at his laſt Supper he gave the Wine; and that this cup is to be ſeen at this day in ſome one of the Pariſh-Churches of <hi>Rome.</hi> Fourthly, in the publick Treaſury of the Common-wealth of <hi>Genoa,</hi> there is a Charger made of an holy Emerald; a very rich and precious piece: If we conſult with Tradition, that will tell us, (and the whole Common-wealth of <hi>Genoa</hi> doth believe it) that this was the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61696:23"/>
diſh wherein our Saviour Chriſt had his diet ſerved. Thus, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we who ſhould frame the world to fit Chriſt, have framed a Chriſt to fit the world: And if we hearken but a little to the belly, the iſſue of all will be this; not onely the World, but the Church, Religion, Heaven, Chriſt himſelf, will turn to good-fellowſhip. If the world joyn with the belly and meats, it doth what becomes it; <hi>Habent enim qualitatem ſymbolam,</hi> they ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize all three; for, as God ſhall deſtroy both it and them, ſo muſt this world paſs away, and the form of it; onely let Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and the Churches hope be immortality. Give me leave to conclude with the very words with which I began; What then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> remains but that we take the counſel which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> gives us? <hi>Tanquam defunctus, &amp;c.</hi>

We uſually obſerve, that if we would know things what they are by nature and of themſelves, we muſt conſider their firſt actions and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> operations, which voluntarily flow from them before that either Art or Cuſtom hath altered them. Beloved, will you know the truth of what I but now ſpake, that God of himſelf and by his nature is onely good? then obſerve his firſt actions into which his own nature carried him. Number all his acts from the Creation till the Fall of Man, and you ſhall find in them nothing but good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When he created this beautiful frame of Heaven and Earth,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61696:24"/>
Men and Angels, in that wonderful order, who counſelled him?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or what moved him thus to do? He was of himſelf all-ſufficient and needed nothing, why then did he thus break out into action? certainly becauſe he was good: For, goodneſs <hi>otium ſui naturá non patitur; hinc cenſetur, ſi agatur.</hi> Goodneſs is a reſtleſs thing, alwayes in doing, and it loſes his nature if it be idle: It is like a fountain, it cannot ſtay it ſelf in it ſelf, it muſt find vent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe it ſelf. Even ſo, Beloved, God, becauſe he was good, could not contain himſelf within himſelf, but his goodneſs forced him to break out, to communicate himſelf, to give being unto other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> things, that ſo he might have as it were fellows and companions to take part with him in thoſe excellencies which were in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. There goes in our books a ſaying of one whoſe name I do not well remember, that ſaid, <hi>He would not be in Heaven were he to live there himſelf alone.</hi> God ſeems to have been of this mans mind, &amp; to have thought Heaven it ſelf unpleaſant, till he had provided him companions. Secondly, when he had created man, he leaves him not, as the Oſtridge doth her young, upon the ſhore, but he takes him to himſelf, and places him in a place of pleaſure. This was no doubt a further argument of his goodneſs. Thirdly, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he created an helper for him, he did ſo becauſe he ſaw <hi>it was not good for man to be alone.</hi> Fourthly, that he gave him a law by which he was to order his ſteps, this was yet a farther degree of goodneſs: For, thinking it not enough that man ſhould enjoy onely earthly pleaſures, he ordained him a law, by obſervation of which, as the Angels by <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, he ſhould aſcend up to ſupernatural and heavenly bliſs. Hitherto, Beloved, whilſt all that he is he is of himſelf, his countenance is fair as the Sun in its ſtrength; no frown, no wrinkle in his forehead: But look upon him after this, when mans folly had wrought him againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his nature into another mould, when he had been provoked by the ſin of our firſt Parents and their rebellious Off-ſpring, and he is now no more himſelf. We may ſay of him as <hi>Naomi</hi> ſpeaks of herſelf in the Book of <hi>Ruth, Call him no more Naomi</hi> (that is, Pleaſant) <hi>but call him Mara</hi> (that is, Bitter) <hi>for he hath dealt very bitterly with us.</hi> He is now no more that God that made us, but he is that God that we have made: <hi>Fecimus enim, non accepimus ſeverum,</hi> for we received him a Creator, a good, a calm and a gentle God; but we have made him a deſtroyer, a fierce, a ſtern, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and angry God. <hi>Marcion</hi> the Heretick, conſidering with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> himſelf the wonderful mildneſs of our Saviour in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and the great ſeverity of God in the Old, fell upon this conceit, that there were two Gods, one courteous and mild, the Author of the New; the other fierce and malignant, the Author of the Old Teſtament.

Thus doth he viſit, not ſingle perſons, but whole Nations, with famine and peſtilence, with the ſword, with fire, with Earth-quakes, and the like, which, like the rain in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he makes to fall upon the good and bad. Now, Beloved, in this part of Gods judgment there lies a depth which many men do ſtand amazed at, and which well deſerves our further medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For, what ſhall we think? ſhall we ſuppoſe, that when theſe general and unreſpective judgments of God, by famine, or ſword, or the like, befall whole Cities and Nations, that there are no righteous perſons amongſt them? that all that bear alike part of them are alike ſinners? this common charity will not permit. Or ſhall we think that the Providence of God makes no difference, but is like <hi>Davids</hi> Sword, <hi>which devours one as well as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the other?</hi> that every man let his life be what it will, gather he little or gather he much, yet he muſt have his omer full? that <hi>There is one event</hi> (as the Wiſeman ſpeaks) <hi>to the righteous and to the wicked, to the clean and to the unclean, &amp; to him that ſacrificeth not: as is the good ſo is the ſinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he that ſweareth as he that feareth an oath?</hi> But this ſeems not to ſtand with Gods Juſtice; for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> urges God with this, and God

replies not to him; <hi>Wilt thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deſtroy the righteous with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the ſinner? ſhall not the judge of Heaven and Earth do right?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, at this depth of Gods judgments I now ſtand, to ſee if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure it be any way foordable, if by the grace of God I may find a paſſage through for your and my own inſtruction. Search therefore we will, ſo far as Chriſtian ſobriety ſhall give us leave, how it comes to paſs that it is a juſt thing with God, in thoſe common calamities of War, and Famine, and Peſtilence, and the like, which many times befall whole Countries, to wrap up both good and bad without any difference, and at once to ſweep them all away: For, you may be pleaſed to remember, that at my firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> entrance upon theſe words, I left that point of Doctrine to be diſcuſſed.</p>
            <p>I made no artificial or curious diviſion of the words, but went over them as it were ſtep by ſtep, word after word, in order as they lie. And, firſt, I conſidered the word <hi>Your,</hi> which is the firſt round and ſtep in my Text, <hi>Your houſe.</hi> Which word, I told you, was a word of contumely and diſgrace; for our greateſt glory is to be his, and not our own; <hi>You are not your own, you are bought with a price,</hi> ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle. When therefore ſpeaking of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> houſe, he calls it <hi>yours,</hi> this was, I told you, a term of reprobation, and ſignified that it was no more his, he would no longer own it. From this word, <hi>yours,</hi> I went forward to the next word, <hi>houſe,</hi> which is the next ſtep in my Text; and finding that this word might bear a double interpretation, I drew from it a two-fold leſſon; Firſt, I told you this word <hi>houſe</hi> might ſignifie the Temple, wherein he then was when he ſpake theſe words. Hence therefore, in that we might well underſtand him to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that he would therefore leave the Temple deſolate, I drew a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> leſſon, teaching us to conſider and lay unto our hearts thoſe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgments which God did many times pour out even upon Churches and Chappels, and Houſes dedicate to Religion and ſervice of God, when they were abuſed to Superſtition or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Secondly, I told you this word <hi>houſe</hi> might by a Figure ſignifie the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or rather that whole Eſtate and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for it is an uſual phraſe in Scripture, by theſe words, <hi>the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>the Houſe of Jacob,</hi> to expreſs that whole Common-wealth. Hence therefore, in that we may underſtand him to threaten the ruine of the whole Eſtate and Kingdome of the Jewes, I drew a ſecond leſſon, teaching us to conſider <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the judgements of God many times poured out upon whole Kingdomes without reſpect, when the people ſhall relapſe from God, and fall to ſinne. Now this leſſon, which then I onely pointed at, but came not ſo near as to touch it, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at this time, by Gods grace, fully to unfold and inſiſt upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> For it is a leſſon above all others teaching us to take heed unto our waies, and to prepare our ſelves to undergo the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our God. And ſo much the rather deſerves this point to be carefully lookt into, becauſe in this judgement of God upon whole Kingdomes, ſomething there is which ſeems to croſſe that juſtice by which the world is govern'd. I have heard that in the Civil Law it is a matter of danger, and will bear an action, if a man ſpeak evil of a whole Society, or a whole Nation: And the reaſon is given, becauſe there is no Society, no Nation ſo bad, but there may be found ſome good perſons amongſt them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

The <hi>Idumae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were held for aliens and ſtrangers from the Covenant of grace, yet unto them we owe <hi>Job,</hi> that moſt glorious pattern of patience. But, Beloved, our God regards not what is written in the Pandects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he governs not the world by the Civil Law; but out of a law of his own not onely ſpeakes evil, but doth worſe unto whole Nations, amongſt whom notwithſtanding ſome righteous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> perſons are. <hi>Ah ſinfull Nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers, Princes of Sodom, people of Gomorrah!</hi> Theſe be the names by which he ſtyles the inhabitants of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>; amongſt whom I doubt not but many good men were, though no other, yet <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet, who ſpake theſe words. And as he gives them all, without regard of difference, one name, ſo he makes them all, good and bad, to drink alike of one cup of captivity, notwithſtanding there were many among them of great uprightneſs; witneſs <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellowes. Again, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour, when the inhabitans of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> had in a wantonneſs and tumult ſlain one of his men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſent in his ſouldiers upon the City, and without examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inquiry who were guilty, who were innocent, ſlew with a great ſlaughter all that came to hand. This fact of his ſo farre diſpleaſed St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> at that time Biſhop of <hi>Millaine,</hi> that he put the Emperour from the Lords Table, forbad him the Church, and ere he would reſtore him, made him in publick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail his errour, and crave forgiveneſſe of God for it.

Laſt of all, in the world, that which makes ſinnes many times ſcape unpuniſhed, is the multitude of offenders: <hi>Noſcio,</hi> (ſaith a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man in the Hiſtorian) <hi>an ſuaſurus fuerim omittere potiùs prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valida &amp; adulta vitia, quàm hoc aſſequi, ut palam fieret quibus vitiis

impares ſimus.</hi> Sins many times do reign amongſt men, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſpread themſelves ſo farre and wide, that no ſtrength of the Magiſtrate is able to ſuppreſſe them; and therefore many times men think it beſt wiſedom to let ſuch ſinnes alone, for he that goes about to amend them ſhall but betray his weakneſſe. But, Beloved, God will not be out-braved by any ſin, be it never ſo univerſal; it is not a multitude that can countenance or uphold iniquity againſt him; he will not regard or pitty the loſs of ſo many lives, or be remorſefull at the ſhedding of ſo much bloud. For, it is not onely true which the Prophet ſaith, <hi>That a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares with him are but as one day</hi>; but, in the caſe we now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſpeak of, a thouſand, a million, a whole world of men, are no more with him then one man. <hi>Caligula</hi> the Emperour wantonly wiſhed that all the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had but one neck, that he might ſtrike it off at a blow. Beloved, when the Lord Chief Juſtice of Heaven and Earth ſhall ſit to do judgement upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, all the world hath before him as it were but one neck; and if it pleaſe him, as once it did under <hi>Noah,</hi> he will ſtrike it off at a blow. I know the world ſometimes doth acknowledge a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuch proceeding, though joyned with ſome injuſtice: <hi>Habet aliquid ex iniquo omne magnum exemplum, &amp;c.</hi> Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> puniſhments and publick reformation can never take place, without ſome wrong to ſome particulars; but the wrong which doth befall ſome few is largely recompenſed and made up by the good that redounds unto the whole. There was a law in <hi>Rome,</hi> that if a Maſter were ſlain by one of his ſervants, all the ſervants under his roofe were to dye for it; alſo accordingly was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: For, when <hi>Pedanius</hi> was ſlain by his ſlave, 400 of his ſervants were put to death. This ſeverity they thought fit to practiſe, ſo to ſecure the lives of men, and to reſtrain ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes as might come by the inſolency of ſervants. Yet, Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that Mans reaſon may take no offence at theſe proceedings, and be ſcandalized that in theſe common calamities no greater difference is made betwixt the good and bad, we will, firſt of all, conſider what reaſons we may find out why God ſhould hold ſo unreſpective a hand: and ſecondly, we will draw ſome Uſes from the Doctrines. And firſt of the reaſons why God doth thus proceed.</p>
            <p>And firſt I ask, what if peradventure we were able to render <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> no reaſon at all of this action of God? ought this to prejudice or call in queſtion the juſtice of it? Alas, we are men of dull and ſlow underſtanding; when we have turned our Books, and ſpent our daies and nights in ſtudy, and wearied our ſelves in ſearching out the cauſes of naturall things, yet with all this ſweat, with all this oyle, we cannot attain ſo far as to know why the graſſe

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which growes under our feet is rather green, then purple or ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, or any other colour. And think we then to dive into ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturalls, and ſearch out thoſe cauſes which God hath locked up in his ſecret Treaſures? St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> having written to a ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of his, and opened many points unto him, tells him, that if he had given him at all no reaſon of ſuch things as he had written, yet he ought to be with him of ſuch authority and credit, that he ſhould take them upon his word, without any farther queſtion. Was it thus betwixt St. <hi>Austin</hi> and his ſcholar? how much more then ought it to be ſo betwixt God and us? how readily ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we to take him on his word, and willingly believe him above, againſt, our reaſon? <hi>Hiero</hi> King of <hi>Sicilie</hi> when he had ſeen thoſe wonderfull deviſes and engines which <hi>Archimedes,</hi> that great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician and Engineer had fram'd, and conſidered what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cts they were able to produce beyond all expectation, he commanded to be proclaimed, that whatſoever <hi>Archimedes</hi> hereafter affirmed, how unlikely ſoever it ſeem'd to be, yet <hi>ſans queſtion</hi> it ſhould be taken to be true. Beloved, the great Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician of Heaven, which made all things in number, weight and meaſure, hath infinitely ſurpaſſed all human inventions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and can we do him leſs honour then <hi>Hiero</hi> did to <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> then cauſe it to be proclaimed throughout the world, that whatſoever he ſaith or doth ſhall be taken for juſt and true, howſoever no probability, no reaſon can be aſſigned? The whole diſputation of the book of <hi>Job</hi> doth drive at this very Doctrine; for, when that God had afflicted <hi>Job</hi> in that fearfull manner, and his friends were come to comfort him, there ariſes a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the reaſon why <hi>Job</hi> ſhould thus be handled: His friends, grounding themſelves upon this concluſion, that all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is for ſin, lay folly and iniquity to his charge, and tell him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that though he had made fair ſhew in publick, yet certainly he had been a cloſe irregular; and though he had eſcaped the eye of the world, yet the judgement of God had found him out. But <hi>Job</hi> on the contrary ſtoutly pleades his innocency, and marvels for what reaſon the hand of God ſhould be ſo heavy upon him. And when their controverſie could have no iſſue, behold, <hi>Deus è machina,</hi> God himſelf comes down from Heaven, and puts an end unto the queſtion; and having condemned <hi>Job</hi> of ignorance and imbecillity, tels him, that it was not for him to ſeek a cauſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> or to call his judgments in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it may well be that we may ſave our labour, that we need not move the queſtion, or ſeek a reaſon at all: For, in theſe common calamities which befall whole Kingdoms, it may be God doth provide for the righteous, and deliver him, though we perceive it not. It is the property of God, <gap reason="foreign">

find means when all mens inventions faile: <hi>He bringeth down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the grave, and raiſeth up again,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hannah</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi> Some examples in Scripture make this very probable: The old world is not drowned till <hi>Noah</hi> be provided for; <hi>Sodom</hi> cannot be fired till <hi>Lot</hi> be eſcaped; <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellowes, though they go away into captivity with rebellious <hi>Juda,</hi> yet their captivity is ſweetned with honours and good reſpect in the land into which they go. And who knows whether God be not the ſame upon all the like occaſions? How many millions of righteous perſons have thus peradventure been delivered, whoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> names notwithſtanding are no where recorded? It was an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Junior <hi>Plinie, Facta dictaque virorum illuſtrium alia clariora, alia majora:</hi> All men have not gained credit in the world according to their deſert. Some things of no great worth are very famous in the world, whereas many things of better worth are leſs ſpoken of, or perchance ly altogether buried in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>caruerunt quia vate ſacro,</hi> becauſe they lighted not on ſuch who might tranſmit their memory to poſterity. The examples of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and ſundry others, which becauſe they ſtand upon record, take up the talk and ſpeech of the world, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be of this rank, perchance they are onely <hi>clariora,</hi> they are onely more ſpoken of; and others, whoſe memory is loſt, are <hi>non minora, ſed obſcuriora,</hi> are no whit leſſe then they, onely they are leſſe ſpoken of. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Salluſt,</hi> that divers reading the ancient Stories, and finding many famous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mention'd in them, much commended thoſe times, becauſe they thought that all the men had been ſuch as thoſe. As this was an errour in thoſe that read the ancient Stories, ſo let us take heed, leſt we reading the holy Stories of the Bible fall upon a contrary errour; and finding the memory of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> others, ſo ſtrangely in theſe generall plagues delivered, ſuppoſe, there were none but theſe; <hi>Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona,</hi> doubtleſs, both before and ſince, millions have made the like eſcapes, though their memory lies buried in oblivion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, be it granted that in theſe oecumenical, theſe general plagues, the righteous and ſinner ſpeed alike, yet there is great reaſon it ſhould be ſo: For though in great and crying ſins the righteous partake not with the wicked, yet in ſmaller ſins the righteous and ſinner evermore concur. For who is amongſt the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſons of men that can preſume himſelf free from theſe kind of ſins? Now the greateſt temporall puniſhment that is imaginable is far too little for the ſmalleſt ſin you can conceive; for, the due reward of the ſmalleſt ſin that is can be no leſſe then eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torment in hell. This is enough to clear God of all injuſtice; for who can complain of temporall, that doth juſtly deſerve eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61696:27"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> paines? Or why ſhould they be ſevered in the penalty that are thus joyned together in the cauſe? And what though the fault of the one be much the leſſe? it will not therefore follow that the puniſhment ſhould be leſſe. It will ſeem a paradox that I ſhall ſpeak unto you, yet will it ſtand with very good reaſon, Great cauſe many times there is why the ſmaller ſin ſhould be amerced and fined with the greater puniſhment. In the Poenitential Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, he that kills his mother is enjoyned ten years penance, but he that kills his wife is enjoyned a far greater: and the reaſon is immediately given, not becauſe it is the greater ſin, but becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> men are commonly more apt to fall upon the ſin of murdering their wives than their mothers. Beloved, the reaſon is larger than the inſtance, and it teaches us thus much, That in appointing the mulct for a ſin, men ought not onely to conſider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, but the aptneſs of men to fall into it. It is a note that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> layes upon ſmaller ſins, that they are <hi>tantò crebrïora quantò minora,</hi> becauſe they be leſs men preſume the oftner to commit them. It is good wiſdom therefore when ordinary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment will not ſerve to redreſs them, to enhance and improve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their penalty. <hi>A. Gellius</hi> reportes that there was a law in <hi>Rome,</hi> that he that gave a man a box on the ear was to pay him about the ſumme of twelve pence of our money: Now there was a looſe, but a rich, fellow, that being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſpoſed to abuſe the law, was wont to walk the ſtreets with a purſe of money, and ſtill as he met any man he would give him a box on the ear, and then a twelve-pence, and a box of the ear, and ſo a twelve-pence: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the inſolency of ſuch a fellow, there was no way but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the value of the mulct. Beloved, the ſame courſe doth God take with us; when his ordinary and moderate puniſhments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> will not ſerve to reſtrain us from falling into ſmaller ſins, he ſharpens the penalty, leſt we ſhould make the gentleneſſe of the law an occaſion of ſin. And hence it ſeems it doth proceed that God many times layes ſo great penalties upon the righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and couples him with the groſſer ſinner in theſe general plagues which by his providence do befall the world.</p>
            <p>A fourth reaſon I will borrow from St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who in his firſt Book <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> touching upon this queſtion, Why the righteous partake with the wicked in common calamities? notes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> one ſpecial cauſe to be, that they uſe not that liberty which they ought in reprehending ſinners, but by their ſilence ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and partake in their ſin, and therefore juſtly partake in their puniſhment. For, Beloved, it is not as you think, that this duty of reprehenſion is impropriate, and pertains onely to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; it is a common duty: for, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpake in another caſe, <hi>In majestatis reos &amp; publicos hoſtes omnis homo miles eſt,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61696:28"/>
Traytors and common enemies every man is a ſouldier: ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is it true here, every one that is of ſtrength to pull a ſoul out of the fire, is for this buſineſs, by counſel, by advice, by rebuking, a Prieſt; neither muſt he let him lye there to expect better help: <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſee thy brother ſin, but thou ſhalt rebuke and ſave thy brother,</hi> ſaith God in <hi>Leviticus.</hi> He ſpeaks it not unto the Prieſt, but to the people. <hi>Cura animarum,</hi> the cure of Soules is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to every man as well as to the Prieſt: Every one of you hath cure of Soules, either of his child, or his ſervant, or of his friend, or of his neighbour; and if any of theſe periſh through your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, his blood ſhall be required at your hands. The man in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Goſpel that fell amongſt theeves, when he was neglected by the Prieſt and the Levite, the Samaritan undertook the cure of him. Though thou be but a Samaritan, though but a Lay-perſon, yet if thou findeſt thy brother faln into the devils hands, thou muſt not ſend for the Prieſt or the Levite, but diſcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge the cure thy ſelf: For, God that commands thee to bring home thy brothers beaſt, if thou find him going aſtray, much more meant that thou ſhouldeſt bring home thy ſtraying brother. Common charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires thus much at thy hand; and to make queſtion of it, is as if thou ſhouldeſt ask with <hi>Cain, Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of this duty, as in it ſelf it is a great ſin, ſo is it in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect much greater, becauſe it intereſts us in other mens ſins: For were we frequent in diſcharging this duty, in all likelyhood ſin would not be ſo rife; whereas now, by neglect of it, we as it were pull down the banks, and open a wide gap to ſin and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs. No marvel therefore if ſometimes the righteous perſon find himſelf overwhelmed with thoſe flouds to which himſelf hath opened the way. And let this ſuffice for the reaſons which may be drawn to clear Gods Juſtice from all imputation, in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> execution of his general judgments. Let us now a little ſee what Uſes we may make of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, the conſideration of the general judgments of God is a notable argument to work out the converſion of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſinner: For, howſoever many times ſinners, in the heat and proſecution of their ſins, forget and neglect themſelves, yet when they ſhall be put in mind what a train their ſin hath, how it may enwrap their poſterity, their family, their whole country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how like it is unto the Dragons tayl in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which drew down the ſtars from Heaven; how even good men and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Saints of God may fall within its compaſs, and ſmart for it; if they have not put off all ſenſe of common humanity, this muſt needs make them return and conſider of their wayes.

The thought of this muſt needs break the heart of a ſinner that is not quite turned to flint. We read in our books, that when <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> feigned himſelf mad, becauſe he would not goe to the Trojan War, and in his madneſſe drove his plough fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically, thoſe who were ſent to diſcover him, layd his young ſon <hi>Telemachus</hi> in the furrow, to ſee if he would drive over him; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> at the ſight of whom all his mask of madneſs fell off. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though ſinners run mad in ſin, though they drive as furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly as <hi>Jehu</hi> did, yet if we lay before them their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>&amp; dulcia pignora,</hi> if any ſenſe remain, they will forget their madneſſe, and not drive over them. It is a great means of looſeneſſe in many men, that they ſtand alone, and have none to depend from them, none to care for but themſelves. And thoſe who ſeek out perſons whom they may employ in deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate purpoſes, will ſooneſt faſten upon ſuch an one who is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

            <p>Our ſecond Uſe ſhall be a note of comfort for thoſe good men who bear a part in any common calamity, it is this, That they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be not diſheartned to ſee themſelves yoked in puniſhment with wicked perſons, as if that God held the ſame eſteem of the one and of the other: For, that is moſt true which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpake, <hi>Manet diſsimilitudo paſſorum, etiam in ſimilitudine paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum</hi>; howſoever the penalties be alike, yet God ſees a great difference betwixt the Patients, though the world perchance cannot diſtinguiſh them. The gold and the droſſe lye in one fire, yet the Workman can diſtinguiſh them, and puts the one into his Treaſury, the other to the Dunghil. The Wheat and the Chaff are both under one Flail, yet the Husbandman ſevers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them, the one to the Granary, the other to the Fire. God in very good wiſdom may and doth refuſe to diſcover his love by any outward token of diſtinction. Amongſt the ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> it occaſioned much miſchief, that their Father, in token of his love, had given his ſon <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a gayer Coat than unto the reſt of his brethren. To take therefore away from us all ſtrife and emulation, it pleaſed God to clothe us all alike, and to leave

no difference betwixt the Coats of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his brethren. It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is the property of ſervants many times, if they diſcover their maſters love, to be cranck and bear themſelves proud of it, and ſo contemne their fellow-ſervants. That this befall not us, it pleaſed God to conceal his love untill time convenient, and mean while to give both good and bad the ſame Livery, the ſame look and countenance. Let us therefore with patience expect the day of ſeparation; and ſince this world is the place wherein we muſt be cleanſed and purified, let no man be diſheartned if he find himſelf in the ſame fire with the droſs, in the ſame floor with the chaff, in the ſame puniſhment with the wicked.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
