            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all Theſe that OBSERVE Dayes, Moneths, Times and Years; This is WRITTEN, That they may ſee whether they follow the Example and Doctrine of the Apoſtle; Or whether they are ſuch as the Apoſtle teſtified againſt.</head>
            <p>TO keep a Day Holy to the Lord, is not diſpleaſing, but acceptable to him; and therefore he that regards a Day, let him regard it to the Lord, and not judge him that doth not regard it; For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>one man eſteemeth one Day above another; another eſteemeth every Day alike, let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind,</hi> this was the Apoſtles Doctrine, who had the ſpirit of God; he did not judge <hi>the one</hi> nor <hi>the other,</hi> but ſaid, <hi>let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind:</hi> (Mark that) all you that obſerve <hi>Dayes</hi> and <hi>Times;</hi> and conſider well whether you regard <hi>the Day to the Lord,</hi> or you obſerve it <hi>to the ſatisfying of your luſts;</hi> for ſuch obſervation of Dayes, is not acceptable with the Lord, to wit, to obſerve them to ſatisfie your luſts, and live in pleaſures and vain delights; this is not a keeping the Day Holy, but rather prophaning it; and againſt ſuch obſervation the Apoſtle writeth, when he ſaith, <hi>How turn you again to theſe weak and beggerly Elements, where unto ye deſire again to be in Bondage; Ye obſerve Dayes and Months, Times and Years, I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed upon you Labour in vain.</hi> So here you may ſee, though the Apoſtle did not judge him <hi>that regarded a Day to the Lord,</hi> yet he reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>thoſe that had known God,</hi> or rather <hi>were known of him,</hi> who turned again <hi>to thoſe weak and beggerly Elements,</hi> and he was afraid <hi>leſt he had beſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wed Labour in vain:</hi> And therefore all you <hi>that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Days and Times,</hi> take heed that you are not in bondage to your luſts. You that obſerve a Day for <hi>Chriſts Nativity</hi> (as you ſay) take heed that you ſpend not away your time in vanity and the pleaſures of the fleſh, for they that do ſo, will Crucifie the Juſt and Holy One, much like thoſe who built the Tombes of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and garniſhed <hi>the Sepulchres</hi> of the Righteous, and ſaid, <hi>if we had been in the dayes of our Fathers, we would not have ſlain the Prophets;</hi> and yet thoſe put Chriſt to death, of whom the Prophets propheſied; And ſo you ſay now, <hi>You would not have Crucified Chriſt, nor put</hi> Stephen <hi>to death; and you obſerve a Day for him;</hi> but conſider, if one come in the Name of the Lord, and bear a Teſtimony againſt <hi>your Temple</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as <hi>Stephen did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theirs,</hi> and tell you, <hi>that you are ſtiff-necked, and uncir cumciſed in Heart and Ears,</hi> &amp;c. Would not the ſame Spirit of Wrath and Envy ariſe in you as it did in them? And ſo ye would make it manifeſt you are of that Generation that put <hi>Stephen</hi> to death, though you keep his Day. But what do you keep it for? Do you keep it in remembrance of his Martyrdom? If ſo, how dare you Feaſt and Rejoyce as if you were glad of his Death? Do you not herein juſtifie the deeds of that Generation who ſlew him? And why do you keep a Day <hi>for the Innocent Children</hi> whom <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew, or cauſed to be ſlain? And why do you feaſt upon it, and make merry? Do you not herein juſtifie <hi>Herods</hi> fact, and ſo become guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of innocent blood? Conſider well upon theſe things, and who it was that firſt commanded theſe Dayes to be kept: Was it not the <hi>Pope?</hi> For the Apoſtle doth not command Saints Dayes to be kept; but ſaith, <hi>He that regardeth a day, regardeth it to the Lord,</hi> he doth not ſay <hi>he regardeth it to Saints,</hi> and ſo it is manifeſt that the obſervation of Saints dayes is come up in the night of Darkneſs and Apoſtacy ſince the Apoſtles, and not by their command or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And further it is manifeſt, <hi>That he who is fartheſt from a Saints life, will contend moſt for a Saints day;</hi> even <hi>the Drunkard, Swearer and moſt prophane,</hi> will be ready to do miſchief to the man that doth but follow his lawful imployment upon ſuch a day as they call Holy. Now, whether is it more unholineſle for a man to follow his lawful imployment, or for a man to be Drunk, Swear, Game, and follow the pleaſures of the fleſh? Conſider well upon theſe things, and diſhonour not the Lord God by doing wickedly, while you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe you honour his Saints. Oh the abhomination that is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Nation and throughout Chriſtendom, under pretence of <hi>keeping Saints Dayes</hi> and <hi>Chriſtimas!</hi> (as it is called) and where had you that name but from the <hi>Pope?</hi> If you had it not from him, tell us where you had it, and who was the firſt Author of it, and of the penalty for not keeping it? And whether is not the inflicting pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties or puniſhments for not obſerving it, clean contrary to the Apoſtles Doctrine, who ſaid, <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his one mind;</hi> here was no penalty put upon one nor other (but this) <hi>and they were not to judge one another about Dayes,</hi> nor <hi>Meats,</hi> nor <hi>Drinks,</hi> (as you may read) <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>And is it not a cauſing the People to ſin, to impoſe things upon them as <hi>Meats, Drinks</hi> and <hi>Dayes,</hi> (in which the Kingdom of God doth not ſtand) ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he that doubteth is damned if he eat,</hi> (Mark that) <hi>becauſe he eateth not of Faith: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not of Faith is ſin. And Faith is the gift of God, which giveth victory over the World;</hi> in which we have unity with the Father, and the Son, and with the Saints, and keep the Day to the Lord Holy (<hi>Mark that</hi>) in the Faith which purifieth the heart the Day is kept Holy; which faith ſtands in Chriſt the Power of God, by whom all things were Created. But if thou doubtſt, and keep'ſt a Day becauſe it is impoſed upon thee, then thou ſinneſt, and ſo haſt not unity with God nor the Saints. And therefore You who are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, take heed that the obſervation of Dayes be not impoſed upon any (eſpecially thoſe called Saints Dayes) leaſt thereby You cauſe the people to ſin, And why do You forbid working upon thoſe Daies, and not Gaming, as <hi>Cards, Dice, Dancing, Sporting,</hi> and all other vain Pleaſures? Do not thoſe things more diſhonour the Lord, then for a man to be <hi>Digging, Planting,</hi> or following any other lawful employment whatſoever. Conſider well upon theſe things, that prophanneſſe may be ſtopt, and the abuſe of the good creatures of God in this Nation by exceſſive Eating and Drinking may be prevented; leaſt the Judgements of God fall upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as in the dayes paſt; for ſuch like wickedneſs Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments came: And let the Saints life more appear, and the fruits of the Spirit in all Meekneſs, Gentleneſs and Patience, and Brotherly love; that the Day of Chriſt you may ſee, which <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw and was glad, and <hi>Simeon</hi> waited for and departed in Peace, who ſaw <hi>the Salvation of God,</hi> A LIGHT <hi>to lighten the Gentiles</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets fore-told) <hi>and to be the glory of Iſrael;</hi> And if you are againſt <hi>this Light, Gods Covenant,</hi> though you profeſs <hi>Abraham</hi> to be your father (as the Jews did) and obſerve <hi>Dayes</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> for the Saints, while you are againſt the Saints life (Chriſt who lived in them) who is the end of the Law and Prophets, all your Performances and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>dayes</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> are abomination to the Lord, and are Idolatry and Superſtition, and are teſtified againſt with and by the Spirit of Truth; which Spirit convinceth you of ſin, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Saints into all truth; in which Spirit the God of Heaven and Earth is to be Worſhipped, ſerved and obeyed; in which Spirit there is Unity, Fellowſhip and Peace with God, and one with another, and Holineſs is known; Without which, no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is Written, that all People may take heed, that while they are profeſſing, they honour Chriſt and the Saints</hi> by keeping Dayes for them, <hi>they do not diſhonour the Lord,</hi> by Prophaneneſſe, Idolatry, Superſtition, <hi>in obſerving</hi> Dayes <hi>not commanded by God, Chriſt, nor the Saints, but</hi> by the Pope <hi>in the night of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who hath killed the Saints and Witneſſes of Jeſus; and then to cover himſelf, hath Obſerved and Commanded the Obſervation of Saints Dayes.</hi>
