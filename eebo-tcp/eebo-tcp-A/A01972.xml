            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>The reaſon why wee doe end the firſt yeare with the former Hiſtory of <hi>Matthews</hi> calling, and begin the ſecond yeare with this, is</p>
                     <p>Becauſe there is no Hiſtory recorded after the former, but ſome circumſtance moueth vs to thinke it was done after this Paſſouer.</p>

was a great multitude: which ſhewes, that in thoſe dayes they were many whom the Lord ſcourged, and laid his heauie hand on them; as may appeare by this, and alſo in that notwithſtanding Chriſt did daily cure ſo manie, yet ſtill many more reſorted vnto him.</p>

                     <p>This is firſt, to ſhew that this cure was miraculous, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hereby God would pull downe the pride of the Iewes, that euen in the middeſt of their glorious citie, ſuch a companie of diſtreſſed perſons was to be ſeene, as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of their own condition; which vſe we are to make of the ſicke that are amongſt vs: thirdly, it ſhewes the great goodneſſe and pitty of Chriſt, that he would come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. which teacheth vs alſo not to caſt our eyes aſquint vpon poore ſicke perſons, but rather to goe vnto them, if we haue any meanes of helpe; like the Samaritan.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The end why they lay here, which was to wait for the mouing of the water: and the reaſon of this end is in the fourth verſe, that by ſtepping into the water at ſuch a time, they might be cured.</p>
                     <p>Hence we learn, That they who were diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eſſed in body, had a care to vſe the meanes of recouerie. So we ſee when Chriſt did manifeſt himſelfe to haue diuine power to cure diſeaſes, how all ſuch as were ſick reſorted vnto him; and the reaſon was, becauſe they were ſenſible of their bodily diſeaſes. To apply this to our ſpirituall diſeaſes, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3435:5"/>
vs, that we being ſicke and dead in ſinne, doe not yet regard the meanes of cure.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of their wayting, ſet downe verſ. 4. contains the ſtory of a great miracle; whereof there are two parts, 1. the meanes of working this cure, which was, troubled water. 2 the meanes of attaining to it, <hi>viz,</hi> the ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in.</p>
                     <p>In the meanes of working this cure, firſt, there was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vſed. Hence, to omit the allegories of ſome vpon this place, why water is here vſed, in generall we may learne, That God doth vſe meanes in the working of his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary workes. Not but that he could doe them without meanes: but it ſo pleaſeth him to vſe them, for the triall of our obedience. and it teacheth vs to bee carefull, in the vſe of all meanes that God hath appointed for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of any thing. Secondly, it was Troubled water. Now troubled waters are not wholſome, and good for cure as cleere waters are; but this was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>aordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie power, and that the cure came from him, not from the water. Hence the Doctrine is, That God can make any meanes powerfull for the effecting of that which hee will haue done; yea, though the things bee neuer ſo vnlikely and contrary: as wood to bring vp iron, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6 6. Salt to make water ſweet, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 2.21.22. Clay and ſpittle to cure the blinde.</p>
                     <p>For the worke is only from the Lord, and not from the meanes: but God doth it to draw our minds from the meanes, to the consideration of a higher author. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to tye Gods power vnto the meanes; or in thoſe meanes that God hath appointed, to diſpute of the fitneſſe and goodneſſe of them, as Naaman did.</p>
                     <p>To apply this to the meanes of ſaluation, it teacheth vs to conſider the ordinance of God, and not the weakneſſe of the meanes. The want of which conſideration made both Iewes &amp; Gentiles to ſtumble at the Goſpel of Chriſt, and not to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ape that benefit by the miniſtery of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as otherwiſe they might.</p>

                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:3435:6"/>3. The Cauſe of the troubling of the water is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to bee an Angel. Some reade the text, an Angel of God; but that he was ſo, is plainly implyed by this diuine and good worke whereabout hee was ſent. Many queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are here moued about this Angel; which ſeeing they are but curioſities and meere coniectures, wee will omit. In general we may learn, That God hath made theſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angels to be his miniſters for the good of men: ſo are they called miniſtring Spirits; and ſo we reade they were ſent from time to time to the children of God to comfort, to defend them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But a particular reaſon of the ſending of an Angell here, was that they might know, that the vertue to cure came not from the goodneſſe of the water, but that it was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worke, ſeeing that the water could not cure till the meſſenger of God from Heauen was come.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It was for the honour and glory of God to haue ſuch glorious meſſenger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This was a great honour which God doth to men, in ſending Angels to them; which ſhould teach vs to reſpect this honour, and by way of gratefulneſſe to honour him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, by hauing our hearts filled with an holy admiration of Gods great workes, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. and yet take wee heed of giuing this honour due to God vnto the Angels, a ſinne whereunto we are much ſubiect, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Time when this water was troubled is indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſet downe, [<hi>at a certaine ſeaſon.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> A queſtion is made, whether the time were ſet and fixed when the Angel did come downe; as at euery ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Feaſt, or on the Sabbath day, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There was no ſet time, as appeares, firſt, becauſe there were ſo many continually waiting for the mouing of the water; which they needed not to haue done, ſeeing they might haue come at the ſet time onely. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a ſigne giuen of the Angels comming downe, <hi>viz.</hi> the water was troubled, which needed not, if they had knowne that hee did come downe at a certaine
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3435:6"/>
howre. Thirdly, the long time of their abiding and waiting here, and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, tranſlated ſeaſon, implies no certaine time, but is indefinitely taken here, and ſo vſed in many other places.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why this was vncertaine is, that they might wait, which thing they did. So muſt wee, ſeeing the Spirit bloweth where it liſteth, attend ſtill vpon the preaching of the Word, becauſe if one time we find not comfort, another time we may, ſo that we ought to come ſtill. The like muſt we doe in all things, whereof the ſeaſon is kept cloſe vnto the Lord, and vnknowne to vs. So much for the meanes of working this cure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond point, is the meanes of attaining vnto this cure; which was <hi>Stepping into the water.</hi> And this is ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Firſt, by the Reſtraint, <hi>he onely was cured that firſt ſtepped in.</hi> Secondly, by the iſſue and effect of it; <hi>he was made whole, &amp;c.</hi> The water was the meanes wherby the cure was wrought, and they that would bee cured muſt ſteppe in. Hence the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, That they that obtaine a bleſſing muſt vſe the meanes: <hi>Act.</hi> 27.32.</p>
                     <p>Now in temporal things al men are ready to vſe the meanes of obtaining any good: but in things ſpirituall, wee all ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and faile. Wherefore ſeeing God hath appointed his Word and Sacraments the meanes for our ſaluation, we ought to be concionable in the vſe of them. And whereas many flee vnto Predeſtination, that they need not vſe the meanes, ſeeing if God haue elected them, they ſhall be ſaued; we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that God, who chooſeth vs vnto this end, hath ordained meanes to bring vs vnto it. Neither doth this vſe of the meanes withdraw our hearts from depending on the prouidence of God, but in a moderate vſe of them, our hearts are more lifted vp to the conſideration thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Reſtraint ſtands in this, that but one was cured at once, he that went in firſt: not becauſe God was able to cure no more, but firſt, to ſhew, that the vertue came not from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but was in the will of God. Secondly, to cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtriue to goe in firſt. Thirdly, to ſhew, that this was not ſo much for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3435:7"/>
a corporall good as for a ſpirituall or to draw their mind to conſider of his power and preſence among them. We may here apply this to the meanes of ſaluation, that as there was here a ſtrife to enter into the water: ſo in vs there ſhould be a ſtrife after the Word of God, and an endeauour to follow it, as it was in <hi>Iohns</hi> time, when the kingdome of Heauen ſuffered violence, But the inſtruction that naturally ariſeth he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce, is this; That meanes are not further powerfull, then God doth giue a bleſſing vnto them. So here, it being the will of God that but one ſhould bee cured, he that came in after the firſt found no helpe, the water was but common water to him. So the Sea that was a wall to the Iſraelites, drowned the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. So 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7.</p>
                     <p>For although God haue appointed the meanes, yet he ſtill retaines his power ouer them. And without the will of God, the creature is neither willing, or able to doe vs good.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore in the vſe of the meanes, let vs pray to God for a bleſſing, and depend on him, not doting vpon the meanes, as <hi>Aſa</hi> did on his Phiſitions.</p>
                     <p>Yet further, in this Reſtraint obſerue alſo an extent: for although but the firſt were cured; yet whoſoeuer this Firſt were, and of whatſoeuer diſeaſe he were ſick, he was certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, which ſhewes.</p>
                     <p>That God in beſtowing of his gifts, is no reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And the reaſon, for that the ground of his workes is in himſelfe; and from his owne goodnes, and not from any thing in man. Which may ſerue for an Incouragement to all to come to God.</p>
                     <p>The Iſſue, or effect may be conſidered, firſt, in it ſelfe; 2. in the Extent.</p>
                     <p>The former is; That he that ſtepped into the water was ſurely cured. Whence in generall ariſeth this Doctrine: That a right vſe of the meanes appointed by God, and vſed in that manner that God hath appointed, ſhall aſſuredly be effectuall as appeares by the example of <hi>Naaman</hi>: and the blinde man whom Chriſt bad goe and waſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:3435:7"/>Reaſon is, becauſe Gods honour and truth is herein ingaged hee hauing promiſed ſo much. Wherefore wee may reſt on it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> But many heare the Word and reape no benefit by it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is becauſe they heare it not as they ought. For nor he that went into the water, but hee that went in firſt was cured: ſo they only receiue profit by the word, that heare it attentiuely and reverently, and mixing it with faith. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.2.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore this is a rule, That if the meanes be not effectual, we faile in the vſe of them.</p>
                     <p>The Extent is, that they were cured of whatſoeuer diſeaſe they had.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> God is able to cure all diſſeaſes. Which is a matter of conſolation to vs whatſoeuer our diſtreſſe bee.</p>
                     <p>Now for the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of this to be a true miracle, theſe circumſtances may be alleadged: Firſt, that the water was troubled, and ſo not ſo fit for cure, as cleare water. Secondly, that this was wrought by an Angell comming downe from Heauen; which ſhewes it to be a diuine worke. 3. That the cure was reſtrayned only to that time; which ſhewes, it was not naturall, ſeeing nether before, nor after, it could worke the like effect. 4. that none but the firſt could be cured. 5. that all diſeaſes, whatſoeuer they were, were here cured. All which ſhew it to be a true miracle, and alſo a great miracle, and alſo a great miracle, the like whereof we doe not read recorded, and it is wonder that there is no where mention made of it but only in this place. By it we may conſider of the goodnes of God toward his people the Iewes; who were now without a Prophet, and ſo had continued a great while before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, to the end, that their mindes might be the more rayſed vp to looke vnto Chriſt. God therefore for a token, and euidence of his preſence among them, that hee was yet their God, and that he had not reiected them, giueth vnto them this extraordinary miracle, and that in the City of Ieruſalem, that all might the better take notice of it. 2. God wrought this great
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3435:8"/>
worke for a confirmation of the true worſhip of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> So long as a People doe remaine the people of God, he alwaies giues ſome ſigne of his preſence amongſt them.</p>

                           <p>And a certaine man was there, which had infirmitie thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and eight yeeres.</p>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>WE are now come to the 3. Part of this miracle, <hi>viz. the Party endured</hi> who is ſet downe indefinitely to be a certaine man. Secondly he is deſcribed his condition, that he was diſeaſed 38. yeeres.</p>
                     <p>In that he is only called a certaine man, it implies, that hee was a man of no great name or note, but that he was a poore man; as alſo appeares, in that he had layne here ſo long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out helpe; for if he had been a rich man, he might haue hired ſome to put him in. Yet Chriſt makes choice of this man, to ſhew his power on him. Which ſhewes the freeneſſe of his grace: a point often noted.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer of all the company that was here, he made choice of one onely to cure him: which he did, Firſt, becauſe it was ſufficient for him to ſhew what he was able to doe vpon one as well as vpon many. Secondly, that it might be an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to others to ſeeke vnto him. So that if no other but this man were here cured, it was their owne fault, in not comming vnto Chriſt. For we neuer read that he refuſed any that came vnto him for helpe and comfort. Thirdly, to ſhew that he was bound to none, but what he did, he did voluntarily, and ſo he chuſeth a poore man, one that deſerued leaſt.</p>
                     <p>Here we are to take notice of Gods dealing, how he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth his fauour but vpon few, in reſpect of the multitude: as in the Deluge. So of many thouſands that came out of Aegypt, two only entred into Canaan: of foure grounds that receiue ſeed, only one bringeth foorth fruit. See <hi>Math.</hi> 20.16· many come to the word, but few are cured by the miniſtery thereof. Neither let me here expoſtulate, and contend with God, for it is Gods goodnes that he hath appointed meanes, and that hee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3435:8"/>
doth make them effectuall to any. And ſo that may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, that Chriſt doth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. 2. The conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wicked men ſhall tell them, that they haue not done all that which they might, and haue not vſed that ability which God gaue them to doe good. But for thoſe on whom God ſheweth fauour, who are conuerted by the word, this is, Firſt, to magnifie the goodneſſe of God, that but of a few it hath pleaſed him to make choice of them. Secondly, to catch them to honour God, who hath ſo much honoured them by a godly life, and not to be like vnto the multitude.</p>
                     <p>The Condition by which this man is deſcribed, is, that <hi>hee had an infirmity</hi> 38. <hi>yeeres. &amp;c.</hi> If the circumſtances be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, we ſhall ſay that he was of all the company one of the moſt miſerable; Firſt, in that it is ſayd, <hi>he was diſeaſed</hi>; that is, as the originall ſignifieth, the diſeaſe had ſo long growne vpon him, and ſo much infected him, that he was vnable to helpe himſelfe. Secondly, in that it is ſayd, he was [<hi>in</hi>] this weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that is, the diſeaſe had ouer-whelmed him, and wholy poſſeſſed him in all parts. Thirdly, in that he found no helpe at all to ſuccour him. Fourthly, that to his diſeaſe there was added pouerty; and pouerty ioyned with ſickneſſe makes it much the more grieuous. Fifthly, The continuance of it, that he had been ſicke 38. yeeres, ſhewes the greatneſſe of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt makes choice of the moſt wretched and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to ſuccour them: a point to be obſerued in moſt of his miracles. Which hee doth for the magnifying of his mercy both in it ſelfe, for the greatnes of miſery doth amplifie the greatnes of mercy. 2. And alſo in the apprehenſion of the party helped that he may the more highly prize and eſteeme of it, and the more gracefully accept of it as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> To teach vs that the greatnes of our miſery ſhould be ſo farre from making vs doubt, and deſpaire of ſuccour, as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to miniſter to vs hope to be releiued of our miſery, being a fit obiect for Chriſts mercy to work vpon.</p>
                     <p>Now although this man had lien a long time in this diſeaſe, yet at length the Lord ſent him helpe. Hence we learne. That
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3435:9"/>
though the Lord ſuffer men a long time to lie in miſery yet at the length he affordeth them comfort and releife. This man was ſicke. 38. yeeres; the woman with the bloody iſſue 12. yeares; the woman bound by Satan 18. yeares: the blinde man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. till he came to mans age, as Verſ, 21. ſo the Cripple <hi>Act.</hi> 4.2. yet all cured. The captiuity was 70. yeres, yet at length they returned: 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> laſt. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 1. <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed in bondage 400 yeares, yet at length deliuered. So Satan hath beene let looſe now 600. yeeres <hi>Reu.</hi> 20.7. yea, the Church hath almoſt 6000. yeeres been in continuall warfare; yet ſhall at length tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in heauen. The reaſon why God doth thus diſpoſe of it, is; Firſt, in regard of himſelfe, that his power, and glory, and mercy may be the more manifeſted: as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.3. and 11.4. Secondly in regard of man, for the triall of his patience: for the continance of a miſery doth more trie a mans patience then the Weight of it.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheleſſe, God doth ſend helpe firſt, to manifeſt his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome care and prouidence, that he doth not forſake and forget them though he haue deferred to helpe them. Secondly to miniſter comfort to thoſe that haue long been in miſery, when they ſhall ſee others in like caſe comforted.</p>
                     <p>Vſe, is not to be diſcouraged, becauſe of the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our afflictions; but that we conſider, that their is ſome end or other, why the Lord doth deferre to help vs. And that God herein aimes at our good, as well as his owne glory that hereby he will haue our hearrs purged, our mindes weaned from the world, and deſire of heauen more increaſed: ſo that the iſſue and fruit of our affliction ſhall recompence the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſneſſe of it. If this man had been cured, before he had not come to that knowledge of Chriſt and ſo to remiſſion of ſins as now he did; as Verſ. 14. wherefore we muſt wait on God with patience: <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. and vphold our ſelues, Firſt by faith beleiuing that God doth herein deale with vs as a wiſe God, and a mercifull father. Secondly by Hope to ſtrengthen our faith and to make vs looke for both preſent aſſiſtance in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and future deliuerance from them.</p>

                     <p>From the ſecond, that Chriſt did only ſee his miſerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but did alſo take notice of the circumſtances of it, or that he had ſo long continued in it, we learn; That Chriſt is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the circumſtances of our miſery, the time, the kinde, manner and meaſure as <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.7.

                     <p>THeſe words containe the fifth part of this miracle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preparation to this miracle. How Chriſt prepareth this man, and the reſt there preſent, to the obſeruation of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, it conſiſts in a conference betweene Chriſt and the man. Wherein obſerue, Firſt, Chriſt his Question. Secondly, The mans Anſwere.</p>
                     <p>Chriſts Queſtion is, <hi>Wilt thou be made whole</hi>? a ſtrange que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, may ſome thinke. For did not the man come hither for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3435:10"/>
that purpoſe? and was Chriſt ignorant of that, or doth hee ſpeake it to gall and vexe him. No, but for theſe reaſons:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To ſhew, that it was not in this mans power to heale himſelfe; that be did it not voluntarily; that he lay ſo long heere, but of neceſſity, becauſe no man would helpe him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To worke in him a deſire of cure, and likewiſe a hope to haue ſome helpe of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To moue the partie himſelfe to attend this worke that he meane to doe vpon him; as alſo to moue the reſt of the company, and thoſe that were preſent to mark it. For they would thinke: Surely he meanes to doe ſome thing, that hee doth aske him this queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To ſhew indeed that he did take compaſſion on him, and did commiſerate his eſtate.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To manifeſt his owne preuenting grace, in that Chriſt ſought him, before he thought on Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>From all theſe doe ariſe ſeuerall inſtructions: as</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they who by neceſſity, by the hand of God, are brought into miſeries are eſpecially to be pittied; and not ſuch as for a little eaſe doe make themſelues miſerable, as doe many beggers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they who are brought to a ſight of their miſery, and a deſire and hope of comfort, are fit to receiue eaſe and comfort from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Chriſt ſo ordered his great workes as moſt may take notice of them; and ſo we are to attend to the workes of God, that they be not lightly ouerſlipt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 That knowledge of our miſeries workes compaſſion in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. that Chriſt thinkes of helping them, who thinke not of ſeeking of ſuccour from him. See <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.1. This is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs, becauſe it is verefied in the conuerſion of euery one of vs. As in the conuerſion of <hi>Adam</hi>; God ſought him, when he fled from God: ſo it is euer ſince: And this is to the end that we may giue all the praiſe of our conuerſion to him.</p>
                     <p>In the Anſwere of the man we note 1. The title He giues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3435:10"/>
Chriſt. Secondly, the ſubſtance of his Anſwere.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Sir</hi>: A word giuen to men in occaſion of ſpeach, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, Firſt, a reuerence that he gaue vnto Chriſt. A point im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable of vs, becauſe Chriſtianity doth not ouerthrow ciuilty, but eſtabliſh it; eſpecially, this is to bee vſed when a kindnes is offered; for this is a ſigne of gratefulneſſe, and the contrary of Ingratitude; as of <hi>Nabal</hi> to <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. As this ſhewed his reuerence, ſo it argueth his ignorance of Chriſt, that he knew him not to be Chriſt; if hee had, hee would haue giuen him another title like <hi>Nathaneel, Ioh.</hi> 1.49. and haue deſired helpe of him rather, then ſhewed the reaſon why he was not helped before, as now he doth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Ignorance of Chriſt his Power, his Goodnes, his Nature and Offices, make vs backeward, and careleſſe in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe good things at his hands, which otherwiſe we might receiue; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10. for knowledge is the ground of all other graces, and without this we neuer ſeeke for them. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the ignorance of men, and teacheth vs to labour after this grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the Subſtance of his anſwer conſider, Firſt, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this man had a long time lien here in great miſery, yet hauing now occaſion to ſpeake of it, he murmures not againſt God, he is not bitter, hee enuieth not those that went in before him, but only maketh a plaine narration of the matter; which ſhewes his patience, otherwiſe then many, who if they finde no helpe will fret and fume, accuſe both God and man, &amp;c. an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuch murmurs: ſee 2. <hi>King.</hi> 6.33.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Marke the reaſon that ſhould moue him thus to declare his caſe vnto Chriſt, it was, Firſt, becauſe he had a deſire that Chriſt ſhould helpe him into the Poole. Secondly, for that hee hoped that Chriſt would doe ſo. So that all this while hee thought of no other meanes of cure, but of the Poole. Where hauing ſeen many euidences of Gods power in curing of other, his minde is fixed vpon it, only tying, the power of God vnto this water, and not conſidering that he was able to cure him by other meanes. So the Iſraelites, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.20. and hence this is the fault of moſt, That we tie Gods power to thoſe meanes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3435:11"/>
that he ordaines. Whereas we ſhould account of them but as of particular euidences of Gods Power in generall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is able to make other meanes effectuall.</p>
                     <p>More diſtinctly this anſwere doth ſet forth vnto vs. Firſt, the inhumanity of the Spectators and inhabitants about this place, that none would vouchſafe to helpe this poore man, ſo long and pittifully diſtreſſed to put him into the poole; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially this being a place beſides the Temple: whether the Scribes and Phariſes, who made ſuch pretence of Piety, did day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſort: yet ſee what want of charity there was in them, which ſhewes their pietie was but hypocriſie. And we ſee that Chriſt doth many times taxe them of crueltie. So in the Parable of the Samaritane, Chriſt ſaith that it was the Prieſt and Leuite that were vnmercifull.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This ſhewes the deſire both of the man himſelfe, and alſo of all the reſt; that is, to be cured by the water; and for this cauſe, there was a great ſtrife among them to goe in firſt. The like deſire and endeauour ſhould be in vs after the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes of ſaluation.</p>

Their reproofe of the poore man might haue ſome pretence to ſhadow it, they comming with a religious pretence of the Sabbath. And becauſe, hee hauing beene ſo long time ſicke, might bee ignorant of what ſhould bee done of the Sabbath. But now in that they perſecute Chriſt alſo, by whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity this man had done it; and of whoſe Diuine Power th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y had ſo many euidences, it ſhewes plainly that the former came from malice, and not from any religious care of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Thus it is the nature of malice at length to ſhew it ſelfe like poyſon in a mans body, and fire that will not long lie hid. This appeares in Papiſts, who although they pretend Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet their ſecret malice doth oft breake out in treaſons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now this as it is laid downe as a ſecond effect, ſo is it alſo ſet downe as a Tranſition to the ſecond part of this Chapter, and an occaſion of that diſputation following: more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly note here.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The effect which is two fold. Firſt they did Perſecute. Secondly, they ſought to ſlay Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Reaſon of it.</p>
                     <p>Here, firſt marke the Inference how this is brought in vpon the former. The action of the man was good and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, <hi>viz.</hi> to Preach Chriſt, yet therefore did they perſecute Chriſt. Hence the Doctrine is wicked and malicious, men may take occaſion from good and commend able actions to bring to paſſe many miſchieuous workes, as is plaine by Cain. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.8. and 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.12. and <hi>Iſmael. Gen.</hi> 21.9. et <hi>Gal</hi> 4.29. becauſe <hi>Iſaack</hi> was regenerate: and thus did the Iewes againſt the Prophets and Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon is, becauſe of the poyſonous nature in wicked men,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3435:12"/>
which like the Spider turne the ſweeteſt things into poyſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> Not to Cenſure the actions of men, though ſome euils and miſchiefes are raiſed thereupon by wicked men, but to conſider the action whether it be good and iuſtifiable, and ſo the occaſion only taken and not giuen.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They perſecute Chriſt. The word is taken from Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that purſue the beaſt and ſuffer him not to be at reſt, till he be taken. Which notably ſetteth forth the purpoſe of the Iewes, that they would bring him before the High Prieſt, and Rulers, and there accuſe him, and condemne him. &amp;c. The cauſe of all this, is their owne malice whetted on by ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ambition. Vſe is, that we doe looke for the like, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Croſſe, and deſpiſing the ſhame as Chriſt did. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They ſought to ſlay Chriſt: note here, firſt the Extent of their rage in this word <hi>Slay.</hi> Secondly the Reſtraint of it, in this word <hi>Sought.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Perſecutors of Gods Miniſters are ſatisfied with nothing but blood, and ſo are they called blood ſuckers, and the metaphor of Hunters before vſed, fitly ſheweth this. So <hi>Ier.</hi> 38.4. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.2. Nothing would ſatisfie the Iewes, but to haue Chriſt crucified.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon and ground of it is as an immortall hatred and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable deſire of blood, ſo alſo a ſecret feare that wicked men haue, that they thinke themſelues not ſecure, till ſuch be taken away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> is therefore, alwaies to look for one trouble after another till we be dead. So though much be paſt, yet ſtill to prepare for more: vntill we come to that reſt, which remaineth for the children of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doctrine</hi> 2. From the Reſtraint that they onely ſought, but did not effect it: we learne that. Wicked men doe not alwaies preuaile according to their deſires and intents: as here theſe Iewes againſt Chriſt, nor <hi>Herod</hi> againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> as he had againſt <hi>Iames,</hi> nor <hi>Iezabel</hi> againſt <hi>Eliah,</hi> nor the <hi>Iewes</hi> that ſought to kill <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reaſon. For there is one that rules and directs all things, and hath appointed an houre, in which they ſhall be done: as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3435:12"/>
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.30. cum <hi>Luke</hi> 22.53.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> This is a ground of great comfort and encouragement to the Godly, that God will at length reſtraine and bridle the enemy, howſoeuer in his wiſedome for cauſes that he ſees good he ſuffers them to preuaile a while: this ſhould teach vs to truſt in God, to feare him onely, and to bee conſtant in our profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon is ſet downe, becauſe he had done theſe things on the Sabboth day: which the Euangeliſt layes downe not as if it were the true onely reaſon indeed, but as the reaſon which they pretended. Hereby ſhewing, Firſt their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſtood ſo much vpon the outward rites, that they neglected the maine workes of the Sabboth. Where we may ſee the nature of ſuperſtition, that it is buſied about ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, letting goe the ſubſtance: and alſo the danger of it, making men eager perſecutors of ſuch as doe allow of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions. Secondly, their Hypocriſie that they did ſo ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproue a man for ſhew of breaking the Sabboth; yet make no conſcience themſelues to perſecute and to ſeeke to murder, and that without a cauſe, euen vpon the Sabboth day, as it is probable. And thus alſo deale the Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 17. Here note, Firſt, the Generalle Chriſts anſwere. Secondly, what kinde of anſwere this was. Firſt, conſider to whom Chriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> doth make this Apologie: it was to ſuch as were captiouſly and maliciouſly bent againſt him, to depraue the honour of God in this good worke done to this poore man. Neuertheleſſe, in that Chriſt vouchſafeth an anſwere vnto them, we learne: Though Chriſt meet with wicked men. yet their malice could not make him leaue his goodneſſe. Now hee anſwereth them here. Firſt, in regard of God, that the Truth and worke of God might be iuſtified. Secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Diſciples, and of this poore man, who now began to beleeue in him: to ſtrengthen their faith that they ſhould not be moued with the cauels of the aduerſaries. Thirdly, and of theſe alſo, either to winne them if it might be, or to make them the more inexcuſable.</p>
                     <p>Vſe. That this minde be alſo in vs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. to be good
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3435:13"/>
and kinde, not only to the kinde, but to malicious and euill men. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.21. this is a propertie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, nature teacheth vs the other.</p>
                     <p>In the Apologie it ſelfe, conſider we, firſt, the meaning of the words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Father</hi>] this is ment of the firſt Perſon, it being ſpoken in relation to Chriſt. Wherefore he ſaith [<hi>my] worketh</hi>] that is, he ſitteth not idlely in the Heauens, but he is buſied and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in gouerning and preſeruing all things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hitherto</hi>] from the beginning of the World, continually without intermiſſion vpon euery day, the Sabbath not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For this is a reaſon, that therefore workes may bee done vpon the Sabbath day. That which might bee obiected, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2. is meant only of workes of Creation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And I worke</hi>] Here is a ſimilitude, and a likenes implied: as hee worketh continually and is blameleſſe, ſo I hauing the ſame authority, doe worke and am blameleſſe. Secondly, that I worke with the Father, and the Father with me; that which I doe, the Father doth; and what the Father doth, I doe.</p>
                     <p>So that here are contained two grounds of his defence.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Authority of himſelfe.</item>
                        <item>2 The condition of the worke that he doth.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>From the former, the Argument is this: God the Father worketh euery day, euen on the Sabbath; and is not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But I am Gods Sonne, and haue the ſame authoritie with him; Therefore though I worke vpon the Sabbath day, I am not to be blamed.</p>
                     <p>From the ſecond, the Argument is this: Diuine workes may be lawfully done vpon the Sabbath day: But this is a Diuine worke, wherein the Father worketh, and I with him. Ergo, it may be lawfully done on the Sabbath. We read in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of diuers kindes of Apologies that Chriſt vſeth, taken ſome from one thing, ſome from another. Here he vſeth an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy only proper to himſelfe, drawne from great and high miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which he doth partly to confirme his authority, partly to confute the conceits of his aduerſaries: Becauſe the poore man had alleadged his authority for what he did, and they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3435:13"/>
againſt it maliciouſly, ſaying, <hi>What man is this.</hi> Chriſt therefore doth giue them to vnderſtand, that he is no man, but God, equall with the Father, &amp; therfore of ſufficient authority to command him, and to iuſtifie what himſelfe hath done, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Obſerue here a great incouragement to ſtand to the truth, ſo far as it is knowne vnto, becauſe God will ſtill vouchſafe more illightening and confirmation dayly. So Chriſt doth now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale himſelfe manifeſtly what hee was vnto this poore man who before had ſtood for him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This may be a warning to all captious and malicious men, though they may for a while make faire gloſſes, yet in the end their madnes will be knowne 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Further here note, how this anſwer is made of Chriſt to preuent an obiection that the Iewes might vrge, concerning Gods reſting on the ſeuenth day.</p>
                     <p>The ſumme of this apologie is, a Demonſtration of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality betweene the Father and the Sonne. The branches of it are two; Firſt, what the Father doth. Secondly, Chriſts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with him in that.</p>
                     <p>Of the Firſt, there are two parts.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. A diſcription of the firſt Perſon, <hi>my Father.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. A declaration of his worke· <hi>worketh.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>In the Deſcription wee will ſhew, Firſt, how this relation of Father is taken commonly. Secondly, how properly in regard, of Chriſt. For ſo the word <hi>my,</hi> ſheweth a kind of propriety and peculiarity.</p>
                     <p>It is taken commonly, 1. in reference to all creatures by vertue of creation. So God is called the Father of the Raine. <hi>Iob</hi> 38.28. 2. In reference to Angels: <hi>Iob</hi> 1.6. and that, firſt, in regard of the Image of God in which they were created and ſtill remaine. Secondly, in regard of that ſpeciall loue manifeſted to them, that God vouchſafeth them to be alwaies in his preſence. 3. In reference to men, beſides the former reſpect of creation. Firſt, in a ciuill reſpect, in regard of their Office whatſoeuer their Quality bee. So Magiſtrates are called the Sonnes of God. Secondly, in a Spirituall reſpect; Firſt, by vertue of Adoption God hauing taken them to be his Sonnes· <hi>Rom</hi> 8. Secondly, by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3435:14"/>
vertue of Regeneration, he hauing begotten vs againe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe· <hi>Ioh</hi> 1·12.13.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is Proper to Chriſt in a double reſpect, Firſt, in regard of eternall generation, as he is God eternall of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the father. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5.6· <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3 16. Secondly, As he is Mediator, God and Man, by reaſon of the perſonall and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaticall vnion of the two Natures: <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.32·35.</p>
                     <p>Vſes to be made of this, are, Firſt, That Chriſt being the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and true proper Sonne of God, hence it is, that we come to be the Sonnes of God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.36. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. for whom Chriſt admits for his brethren, them will God admit for his Sonnes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is the ground of Chriſts Interceſſion; hee is Gods Sonne, and the Sonne of his loue. If God giue vs his Sonne, he will giue vs all things with him, he denies him nothing. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32·</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Note here the honour of the Saints, that wee are vnited and made one with him, that is, the Sonne. So are the Saints called Chriſt 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This ſets forth the loue of God, that he did not ſpare his only Sonne; and alſo of Chriſt, that he would vouchſafe to bee the Sonne of man.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This teacheth vs our duty, <hi>viz.</hi> to kiſſe the Son, to adore and worſhip him, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond part was the <hi>Declaration</hi> of the worke and Prouidence of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doctrine.</hi> God who firſt made all things by his mighty Word, doth ſtill vphold, gouerne and guide them by his wiſe &amp; good prouidence: not like a Carpenter that builds a houſe and leaues it: or like the Oſtrich, that layes her egges, and leaues them in ſand to be trodden of beaſts: <hi>Iob</hi> 39.36. but like a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that brings forth a childe and nouriſheth it. This proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God is proued. Firſt, by the names and titles giuen to God. For this cauſe God is caled <hi>Iehouah</hi>; noting a preſence ſtil aſſiſtant, which name was not giuen him before the ſeuenth day after he had made all things; before he was called <hi>Elohim,</hi> a mighty God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:3435:14"/>This name is compounded of the preſent, <hi>preterit,</hi> and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tence: as <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.4 in this regard are many names giuen vnto Places; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14. and 16.14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the effects of it: as in <hi>Iob</hi> the 38.39.40.41. chapters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all which, and the like are euident proofes of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>If any obiect: That many good things hapen vnto the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and many euill things vnto the godlie; and therefore ſhall denie the prouidence of God.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer: Firſt, That the ground of this, and ſo of all other miſorders is ſinne. Secondly, that the ſeeming good things that come to the wicked are indeed euill things and turne to their deſtruction. And thoſe euill things that come to the godly are indeed good to them, and turne to their benefit. Thirdly, Many things in this world ſeeme to fall out croſly, to the end that we might looke for that general iudgement, when euerie thing ſhall bee ordered according to iuſtice and right.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If it be obiected that it doth not beſeeme the Maieſty of God to haue regard to ſmall and baſe things!</p>
                     <p>I anſwer: The ſmallnes of ſuch things doth not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe his care and prouidence as the infinite number of them doth magnifie his wonderfull wiſdome and power in diſpoſing of them.</p>
                     <p>The vſe in briefe is, Firſt, To refute all Atheiſts and Epicures. Secondly, to teach vs to looke vp vnto him, to depend vpon him, to caſt our ſelues on him, to look for a bleſſing from him, whatſoeuer the meanes be that we vſe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Second point is, the likenes, Idenity, or Samenes, of the Sonne with the father. Chriſt here proues that his power and authority is one and the ſame with the fathers, becauſe the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of both are one and the ſame. The Doctrine in generall is, That</p>
                     <p>Chriſt is equall with the Father. This himſelfe plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth verſ. 19. and it is manifeſt in regard of the effects which are attributed to both ioyntly, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. touching the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to either of them; as the creation of the world to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3435:15"/>
ſonne. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.3. and redemption to the father. So the ſending of the holy Ghoſt to the Father; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26. and to the Sonne; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.26. and 16.7. this equality is plainely expreſſed. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. and <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. To refute all heretickes denying him to be God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It confirmes the former vſes, drawen from the title, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and it ſhewes that he is to be worſhipped as God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To ſtrengthen our faith in the maine point of religion, <hi>viz.</hi> redemption by Chriſt, that we may be fully perſwaded of the infinity and all-ſufficiency of his merites.</p>
                     <p>Conſider now the maine End and Scope, for which Chriſt alleadgeth this: he doth it, as we heard, to defend himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Phariſees, who excepted againſt that worke which he had done on the Sabbath. His defence is grounded, Firſt, on his owne authority. Secondly, on the goodneſſe of the work. God worketh, ſaith he, euery day, on the Sabbath alſo, and is blameleſſe. But I haue the ſame authority that God hath: therefore I am not to be blamed.</p>
                     <p>Hence this Doctrine ariſeth; Firſt, from the proposition; that God cannot breake his Law. The Sabboth was not here violated, becauſe in this act, God did worke with Chriſt. The grounds of it are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God is Lord of his Law, and not tied vnto it: for he gaue it vnto his creatures, not to himſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Gods will is the rule of goodneſſe, of lawfull and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The abſolute perfection and goodneſſe of God, that hee cannot goe againſt it, denying or thwarting himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Some obiections are made againſt this, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. Where God commands <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his ſonne. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. Where the Children of Iſrael are bidden to borrow of the Aegyptians Iewels, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To theſe I anſwer: Firſt. That theſe are not againſt the law: for the former example, there was no fact done, nor any intent and purpoſe of a fact to be done, but was only a triall. In the latter, the word which wee reade, borrowed, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3435:15"/>
alſo to aske, or require. So that they asked of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans theſe and theſe things; and the Aegyptians gaue them vnto the Iſraelites freely: and God did ſo extraordinarily worke vpon the hearts of the Aegyptians, that they gaue them their chiefe thinges.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer. That God is Lord of life and death, to take life from man when he will. And as he hath power; ſo alſo he hath right to doe it. Now God forbids the taking away of life, when we haue right ſo to doe; God therefore may command any one to be the inſtrument of doing this. Secondly, So alſo had God an abſolute power ouer the goods of the Aegyptians, to to diſpoſe of them as he pleaſed. Beſides, conſider the equity of this fact; Firſt, equity did require, in regard of that ſore bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage wherein they held them, that they ſhould make them ſome recompence. Secondly the Aegyptians enioyed their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and this deſerued wages. Thirdly, They reaped much good by the Iſraelites, who builded them cities, &amp;c.

                     <p>Another Obiect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is out of <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1.2. but to this I Anſwer: that it was but a viſion, and no fact: and the Prophet only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth vnto the people, that thus and thus was done in a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: to ſet forth vnto them their eſtate, what they were like vnto.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the Inference, or concluſion, ariſeth this Doctrine. That neither Chriſt can breake the Law of God; and that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame grounds, as the former: ſo hee is ſaid to bee the Lord of the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1 To ſhew vnto vs, that whatſoeuer Chriſt did in ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of himſelfe to the Law, it was for our ſakes. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.14. which is ſpoken in regard of a voluntary ſubmiſſion, as a pledge and ſuretie for vs.</p>

Thus did the old Iewes with the Prophets, caſting them into Priſon, and killing them, but yet not diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any error in their Preachings; as 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.21. So dealt <hi>Herod</hi> with <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi>; and the Iewes with the Apoſtle; <hi>Act.</hi> 4.16. So haue Heathen men and Heretikes alwaies done towards godly Martyrs; and ſo doe Papiſts where they get the vpper hand.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon hereof is; Firſt, The euidence of truth, which is ſuch, that it cannot by ſoundneſſe of argument bee refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

                        </gap>en downe.</p>
                     <p>This ſhewes a difference betweene thoſe that ſeeke for truth in ſincerity, and ſuch as are of a gaine-ſaying, and cauilling ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The one ſeekes the good of their aduerſaries that they might know the truth as well as themſelues, which makes them to deale with all meekenes and gentleneſſe; vnleſſe it be towards ſuch as are willfull, and obſtinate in fundamentall points of Religion; ſuch indeed are brought to puniſhment:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3435:16"/>
but yet after many warnings, admonitions, and exhortations. But the other aiming only at victory and conqueſt, vſe all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and if not in deeds, yet in words; vſing all violent and and bitter words, ſtriuing only to maintaine a cauſe. As we ſee that Papiſts, Lutherans, Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. doe in their writings: and generally the more men ſwerue from the truth, the more they goe from gentlenes, growing in heat and choler, to be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and violent.</p>
                     <p>The Extent is, in theſe words. <hi>The more.</hi>] why? becauſe Chriſt had more euidently mantained that which he did, and had now clearely manifeſted himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> The more euidence is giuen to the truth by the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of it, the more violent opposition is made againſt it by the enemies thereof. When Chriſt had wrought that great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of raiſing vp <hi>Lazarus.</hi> We ſee how the Iewes perſecuted him; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.47, 48, 53.</p>
                     <p>But eſpecially, when he roſe againe from the dead, how doe they beſtirre themſelues; by ſpreading abroad lies, by bribes, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.12, 13. This makes Papiſts more to hate Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, then any other kindes of Religion whatſoeuer; becauſe of that cleare light which they bring againſt their Idolatry. And here note a further difference betweene a meeke ſpirit and a contradicting ſpirit; the one conſiders the force of argument, and if it be a ſure, a certaine ground they yeeld vnto it, albeit their Opinion were otherwiſe before; as <hi>Peter Act.</hi> 10.28. the other only labour to maintaine a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes are twofold: partly old matter; becauſe he had broken the Sabbath, which is not to be taken ſimply, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their conceit, who made this a pretence. Partly new matter; becauſe he made himſelfe equall to God.</p>
                     <p>Thus theſe aduerſaries, though they haue new matter yet, they let not go their old hold. Euen as the Papiſts that ſtilbring their old threadbare arguments, beſides their new deuiſes.</p>
                     <p>The new matter that they conceit to haue againſt him, is, that he blaſphemed: Firſt, In that hee made God his Father, Secondly in making himſelfe equall to God.</p>
                     <p>But before we come to their erroneous conceits, let vs firſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3435:17"/>
obſerue ſome ſound and orthodoxall points, which the Iewes gathered from the words of Chriſt, whereby we ſhall ſee, how they vnderſtood his meaning aright. The</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Is, That Chriſt did account God his own Proper Father <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and not a common Father, as he is to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he was equall with God. And ſo though they were malicious enemies of Chriſt yet more truly did they obſerue and conceiue his meaning, then many heretickes haue done.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he that vniuſtly makes himſelfe the ſonne of God is worthy of death. This is a ſound collection and herein they go beyond the Papiſts in tolerating the Pope, who maketh himſelfe God, taking vnto him his Titles, Attributes, and Authority.</p>
                     <p>All this ſerues to amplifie and aggrauate their malice, that thus perceiuing his meaning, and not being able to charge him with vntruth and colluſion that he had at any time vſed, yet notwithſtanding they would without any further triall, raſhly accuſe and condemne him of blaſphemie, and ſeeke to ſlay him. Worſe then <hi>Pilate,</hi> who hearing that Chriſt neuer ſayd but truth, was afraid to meddle with Chriſt, when hee heard that he called himſelfe the Sonne of God. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.7.8.13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Malice blinds mens eyes that they cannot ſearch into the truth: but makes them condemne at the firſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they thinke will make againſt them. As doe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</p>
                     <p>Vſe, is to teach vs not to condemne any thing without full triall.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> is, as for our Imitation; ſo for our comfort, that if Chriſt be of ſo long patience towards his enemies, how much towards them that loue him, though they offend often againſt him.</p>

So that this Implies a vnion in nature, and Eſſence; becauſe though both haue abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of themſelues, yet neither can doe any thing without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whereas in nature, things therefore cannot worke one without the other, becauſe they haue not ability in themſelues, without the helpe of one another.</p>

                        <hi>But what he ſeeth, &amp;c.</hi>] This is ſpoken according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Iewes, it implies a taking of councell together, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. nor is it a word of ſpeculation of Efficacy, implying a communication of knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For whatſoeuer thinges, &amp;c.</hi>] Here are three points</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Sonne doth not only nothing alone without the Father, but doth ioyntly with the Father what the Father doth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That this communication is not in ſome things, but in all things.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That as the Sonne doth the ſame things, ſo he doth them after the ſame manner, by the ſame authority, to the ſame end &amp;c. [<gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>So that here in this 19. Ve. is contained a proof of the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Sonne with the Father, becauſe the ioynt effects of both are one and the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:3435:18"/>The myſtery and maine point here to be noted is,</p>
                     <p>That Chriſt is true God of the ſame eſſence with the Father, and euery way equall vnto him. Becauſe, Firſt, he can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelfe without the Father, but as he doth all things originally from the Father, ſo he doth them ioyntly with him. Secondly, yea he can doe nothing: implying a neceſſity and impoſſibility. Thirdly, becauſe he is in the boſom of the Father. Seeing [<hi>ſaue what he ſeeth</hi>] the councels of his father and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating him, which none but Chriſt hath done. Fourthly, againe what the Father doth, that he cannot but do. Fiftly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this concurrence is in all things. Sixthly and laſtly, hee doth euery thing after the ſame manner with the Father. All theſe ſhew an Identity, Samenes and Equality, between Chriſt and God the Father. Some illuſtrate this by examples, as if a thing burne, and cannot chuſe but burne, and burne alwaies, we ſay, that it is fire: ſo Chriſt, doing diuine workes, and the ſame with his Father, and that hee cannot but doe them, and doth them after the ſame manner that his Father doth, hee muſt needs be God. Some Hereticke haue obiected againſt this place, that Chriſt doth theſe things by <hi>imitation</hi>; and this they ſay is, meant by [<hi>ſeeing</hi> and <hi>ſhewing.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is falſe, becauſe he doth theſe things by the ſame authority and power, that the Father, hauing life and power in himſelfe, as verſ. 26. and becauſe he doth them after the ſame manner that the Father doth.</p>
                     <p>As touching the Phraſes of ſeeing on the Sonnes part, and ſhewing on the Fathers part: theſe are ſpoken, Firſt, in regard of our conceit. Secondly, to ſhew the diſtinction betweene the Perſons; the Father being the Fountaine of the deity, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and the Sonne, the ſecond perſon, is ſayd to ſee.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This may be interpreted of the humane Nature of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. Seeing Chriſt proues his equality with the Father, in regard of the effects common to both, we muſt learne to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all things done and ſpoken by Chriſt, as done and ſpoken by God the Father; and ſo to giue credence, reuerence, and obedience accordingly to the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to account of the doing of Chriſt, as done by God,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3435:19"/>
ſo likewiſe when we behold the workes of God the Father; as the frame of the World, and the things therein and doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in them the glory and Maieſty of God; to conſider alſo in, and by them, the glory and excellent Maieſty of Chriſt: and in this we goe beyond the Iewes, Turks and Heathen, who in the creatures ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behold the Maieſty, of God the Father only.</p>

                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:3435:19"/>Reaſon of this is not grace and fauour, but Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is his Sonne: as earthly men doe loue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe they come from themſelues, and are of their ſubſtance. <hi>vid. Pro.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. Now according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the perſons louing and loued, ſo is the loue, <hi>viz.</hi> euery way infinite, the like whereof is not in the World to be found. So that Chriſt is hee in whom is the beginning of Gods loue, and on whom it doth reſt, and from whom it is conueyed to all other. This, firſt, doth greatly amplifie the loue of God, that hee would giue the Sonne of his loue to vs: and of Chriſt, that being his Fathers delight, hee would come from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for our ſakes. How great a loue were it for a King to giue his onely ſonne for a poore Captiue. This thing was ſo highly accepted of God in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that hee did not ſpare his onely ſonne, that it was an occaſion why God did ſweare ſo to bleſſe his poſterity: <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16, 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is a maine ground to ſtrengthen our faith, in the interceſſion of Chriſt, to come vnto the Throne of Grace with confidence and boldneſſe. For is Chriſt the Sonne of Gods loue? and will he then deny vs any thing that we ſhall aske in his Name? And for this cauſe wee ought to hold vs cloſe to Chriſt, and to ſticke wholly to him.</p>
                     <p>Further, this loue muſt be conſidered not onely as a thing proper to Chriſt, but alſo as an euidence of Gods loue vnto vs, that we may gather from hence, that we are loued. For Chriſt hauing vnited vs vnto himſelfe, wee may be aſſured, that God who ſo greatly loueth the Head, will alſo loue the Members: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.23. And this is meant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. God is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Chriſt, not onely with him, but with whomſoeuer he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds in him; as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. ſo that none are loued but in Chriſt, and all in Chriſt are loued.</p>
                     <p>So much for this firſt Cauſe, ſimply conſidered in himſelfe: Now we come to conſider it in the reference thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is to ſhew the ground of that power, authoritie, dignitie, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and equality which Chriſt hath with his Father.

                        </gap> confidence in him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelues vpon his redemption, mediation, &amp;c. Secondly, it ſerues for the terror of thoſe, that oppoſe themſelues againſt this dignitie and equality of Chriſt: for they prouoke God, and are fighters againſt him, who hath in loue communicated theſe things to Chriſt. Thus did the Iewes, becauſe they would haue none to be equall to God, oppoſe againſt the authoritie of Chriſt: and this likewiſe is ſpoken to aggranate their malice.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Cauſe whereby it comes to paſſe, that Chriſt doth the ſame workes with his Father, is, becauſe the Father ſheweth him all things. Which is not to bee taken for a bare relation, or an inſtruction; or that the Father doth them only in the preſence of the Sonne, as one man may doe a thing in preſence of another; or that he ſets them before him, as in a Mappe or Table: but for a communication that the Sonne doth participate of the Wiſedome, Power, and whatſoeuer elſe the Father hath, together with his Eſſence. Secondly, that the Father doth ſo ſet forth himſelfe in his Sonne, that he may be ſeene in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who ſo knoweth the Sonne, may know the Father, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.9. And this is a further argument to proue the equality, becauſe God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municates all things to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. It ſhewes vnto vs, how the vnſearchable myſteries, and depth of Gods wiſedome come to our knowledge, and to be reuealed vnto vs. God hath communicated them to Chriſt, and Chriſt hath declared them to vs. See <hi>Reuel.</hi> 5.5. &amp;c. And this ſhewes a reaſon of that phraſe, that Chriſt is called the <hi>Word,</hi> becauſe he hath vttered the will of his Father, and hath declared the ſecret Councels of God, Therefore are wee to heare him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. as the old World was to hearken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſpeaking by his Prophets, and the Iewes to himſelfe when hee was on earth, and the Church afterward when hee ſpake by his Apoſtles; ſo are wee now to hearken to him ſpeaking in his Miniſters, who declare to vs the will of God. So much for theſe cauſes conſidered ſeuerally in themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Now conſider them ioyntly, as, the loue of the Father is made the ground of communicating all things to the Sonne. Whence obſerue, that</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:3435:20"/>1. All that Chriſt hath from his Father, it come from loue, then how much more doth all that which is in vs come of loue.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. According to the loue that the Father did beare vnto the Sonne, accordingly did he beſtow the Spirit: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.34. alſo dignitie and honour vpon him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> So likewiſe learne we by Grace to iudge of Gods loue towards vs, if we find that we are regenerated and ſanctified, to be perſwaded of Gods loue. And further, by the meaſure of grace, to hope for the meaſure of glory: for the more grace wee haue, the more God loues vs; the greater is his loue, the greater will be our glory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a fruit and token of loue, to enuie no skill, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, dignity, honour, &amp;c. but to be ready to communicate all things. So ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples; You are my friends, I haue ſhewed you all things. And herein eſpecially is that ſaying true, Among friends all things are common. And this may bee a triall for Parents if they loue their children, for Schoolemaſters if they loue their ſcholers, and for all friends if they loue one another.</p>

Which is done, firſt, to preuent a ſecret obiection which the Iewes might make: For it is ſo, that what the Father doth, thou doeſt; and what thou doeſt, the Father doth; can the Father then doe no more, then that which thou haſt done, <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God. Secondly, to ſtirre vp attention, becauſe the things which Chriſt had yet done, were lightly eſteemed, and oppoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, now therefore God would ſhew ſuch great workes, that their hearts ſhould be amazed and aſtoniſhed at.</p>
                     <p>In this tranſition are two points; firſt, the extent of Chriſts power [<hi>greater workes.</hi>] Secondly, the euent of it, [<hi>they ſhould maruell.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>For the former, it hath reference to the miracles which Chriſt had before time done. Whence the Doctrine is, that Chriſts miracles which hee did, were but euidences of a farre greater, and more almighty power; as his miracles of healing the ſicke, of power to cure our ſinnes, of reſtoring ſight to the blinde, of power to illighten our minds, of caſting out of diuels, of his power of ſubduing the Diuell, and deliuering vs from his bondage, and the like. And this vſe ought we to make in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the miracles of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yee ſhould maruell. Yee, mine enemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Such is the euidence of Chriſts power, that it maketh all aſtoniſhed: as we may reade at the working of moſt of his miracles, and at his reſurrection, how greatly the Iewes were aſtoniſhed. And at the day of Iudgement, all ſuch as haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed againſt him, ſhall tremble and quake. Now this aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at the power of Chriſt is, that wherein we muſt reſt, it being an argument rather of Chriſts power, then of our faith in him. But we muſt conſider the end of this power, for which it was giuen him, <hi>viz.</hi> that hee hath it for our good, that hee might ſaue vs; and then his power will be a ground of our faith, to make vs to ſhroud our ſelues vnder him.</p>

For firſt, it ſhewes, that they were dead, and ſo vnable to helpe themſelues. Secondly, that he rayſeth them not as ſtocks and ſtones, but with the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing puts life into them; which amplifies the benefits. Some take this raiſing of the dead to bee meant of Chriſts miracles, in raiſing of the dead, but that is to much to reſtraine it only to that: wherefore hereby is implied, firſt, a Spirituall quickening from the death of Sinne, at our conuerſion. Secondly, a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall quickening, the raiſing of our bodies out of the graues at the laſt Day; now if we will referre the miracles of Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, as euidences and proofes of what he was able to doe at the laſt Day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Euen ſo, &amp;c.</hi>] Herein is the equality: as the Father doth raiſe vp the dead ſo doth the Sonne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whom he will.</hi>] This is not ſpoken to put a difference, that the Father doth quicken ſome whom he will, and the Sonne others whom he will; but is added as a ioynt worke to both; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to the Son, but only applied to him; and this, Firſt, becauſe the Iewes doubted not concerning the Father, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he was able to raiſe vp whom he would.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore this ſhews, firſt, that there was no compulſiue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in Chriſt to do, as the Father doth, but a meere freewill. Secondly, as there is a vnity in Nature betweene them; ſo is there likewiſe in Will. Thirdly, that the Sonne hath a power to quicken whom he will, and whom he lets he dead in ſinne. Fourthly, that this quickening is of Grace.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That this is a happy quickening here meant, belonging to thoſe that he will ſhew grace vnto. So it is not ſimply to be taken for the raiſing from the graue, but for a rayſing to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting. Such a raiſing as we beleeue in the Creed.</p>
                     <p>The point then is, that the Work of the Father and the Son in quickening, is one and the ſame: 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                     <p>Whence are two euidences to proue the equality: Firſt, He that quickeneth the dead, is equall to God the Father in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But Chriſt quickeneth the dead; Therefore, &amp;c. Secondly,

                     <p>The effect is quickening of the dead, which is here brought in, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And as this Reſurrection from the graue, ſo is our Quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from ſinne, an euidence of the power of God. And for this cauſe, the meanes of quickning is called, The power of God: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5. For we are dead in ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p n="2">2. That ſeeing our raiſing from ſinne, is one of the great eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Gods almighty power, it confutes the Pelagians, that ſay, a man may raiſe himſelfe: and Semipelagians that ſay, a man is but ſicke, and being helped by a little grace, hee workes out his ſaluation himſelfe.

Wherfore it is not ſufficient to ſay we are no Arrians, nor Iews to denie Chriſt, nor Papiſts to confound his offices? but where is the faith in him? how doſt thou reuerence and feare him? &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>It is here vſed in a threefold reſpect; firſt of diſtinction of the Perſons in the Trinity: So the ſecond may bee ſayd to bee ſent of the firſt: and ſo the Holy Ghoſt, though he neuer aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe, nor were incarnate, is yet ſayd to bee ſent by the Father and the Sonne: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>et</hi> 15.26.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of Chriſts incarnation, that though he became man, yet was he Lord of Heauen and Earth, and ſent from God. So it implies an honour and dignity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Of the Offices of Chriſt, as he is Mediatour in a twofold reſpect; firſt, that no Office that Chriſt had, but it was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ordeined of God: <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.69. God is ſayd to rayſe vp a ſaluation. Secondly, as theſe Offices were appointed to Chriſt; ſo was he deputed to them: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5.</p>
                     <p>This Phraſe then amplifies the reaſon, and ſhewes, that this equall right of honor to him, as to the Father, is no vſurpation, but a naturall communication, and voluntary diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt vſurped not that honour, to be equall in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Father: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> That it is not euery word which is able to worke faith in vs, but only the Word of the Sonne of God. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell <hi>my Word</hi>] as oppoſed to the words of men, and their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.63. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 9. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18, and 14.6.</p>
                     <p>The law cannot doe this; for that is the letter that killeth, and it is the miniſtery of death: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.7. and much leſſe then the words of men, and their traditions.</p>
                     <p>Vſe is to teach vs, that as we be diligent to heare, ſo we bee carefull to know what we heare.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Action, is to belieue. Though hearing be a thing neceſſary, and a good ground-work and beginning, yet it is not ſufficient, but we muſt further beleeue in the truth, declared by the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> It is not ſufficient to heare the Word onely, but Faith muſt be added to our hearing: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.</p>
                     <p>For the Word doth but onely offer grace. Now what good is it to haue a Benefice offered onely, if it be not receiued: but this is done by Faith: <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> As before we were exhorted to heare, ſo here wee are directed how to heare, <hi>viz.</hi> not to content our ſelues with a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3435:26"/>
bare and naked hearing, or that we doe vnderſtand the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and know the myſteries of the Scripture, but to apply the Word and Promiſes to our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>The Obiect of this action is deſcribed in theſe words [<hi>him that ſent me</hi>] which is a deſcription of God the Father, and implies a relation betweene the Father and the Sonne: as if he had ſaid, In him of whom I am, who hath giuen me vnto the World, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> God as he is the Father of Chriſt Ieſus, is the onely obiect of our Faith; and therefore he ſaith not [and beleeueth in God] ſimply, but in him that ſent me. And therefore wee muſt come vnto God in Chriſt, and doe whatſoeuer we doe in, and through him: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15.</p>
                     <p>No creature can bee the obiect of our Faith, on which wee may reſt, becauſe it is not able to protect vs from Gods wrath. Neither is God himſelfe, as he hath immediately to doe with vs, for ſo he is moſt ſtrict in iuſtice, and as a conſuming fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which we are but ſtubble. Onely as he is well pleaſed in Chriſt, and in him manifeſteth his grace and fauour, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach vnto him with confidence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It ſhewes the vanitie of the moſt part of the World, that either know not Chriſt, or deny him, as the Iewes; and ſo dare to come vnto him in great <hi>iuſtice.</hi> So much of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>The Promiſe is declared, firſt, affirmatiuely [<hi>hath euerlaſting life.</hi>] Secondly, negatiuely, and ſhall not, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> The fruite of that honour which we performe to Chriſt Ieſus, is eternall life: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.27, 28. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. which is not in regard of any deſert of the workes, but of Gods free grace, who ſets downe this reward to encourage vs, and to magnifie his owne mercy.</p>
                     <p>Which ſhewes his fatherly tenderneſſe towards vs, that whereas we are bound to doe no leſſe, and he might abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly command vs; yet hee rather chuſeth to draw vs on by the hope of reward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> To bee ſtirred vp to the performance of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, both in regard of thankefulneſſe to God, and in reſpect
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3435:27"/>
of our owne good.</p>
                     <p>This is now further amplified by the contrary, [<hi>and ſhall not come into condemnation, &amp;c.</hi>] Which imply in effect the ſame things that the former; yet they are added not in vaine, but for the further confirmation and ſtrengthening of our Faith in a matter of ſuch weight, and for the answering of all obiections that might be brought.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore this ſhewes a double benefit: Firſt, we ſhall haue life. Secondly, we ſhall be deliuered from death. And further it notes a difference betweene that happineſſe wherein man was firſt made, and that whereunto we are brought by Chriſt. <hi>Adam</hi> was created happy and immortall: but withall there was a poſſibility to fall. But we not onely haue immortalitie and life, but alſo ſuch a firmeneſſe and ſtability, as we ſhall not come into death.</p>
                     <p>[<hi>Hath paſſed from death to life.</hi>] Some take the meaning to be thus, that the beleeuer when he dies goeth vnto Heauen; which is a good ſenſe, and comfortable: but rather we are to vnderſtand it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that by death is meant, the ſubiection of vs all to eternall condemnation. But now ſo ſoone as wee beleeue the Obligation and Band is cancelled, and wee hauing Faith, haue our acquittance, and are ſet free.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct·</hi> Faith brings with it a diſcharge from condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
                     <p>Which is to be noted as a ſpeciall comfort of our conſciences againſt the terrour of ſinne, and horrour of condemnation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. No middle betweene damnation and ſaluation: he that is freed from the one, is ſure of the other. [<hi>Hath paſſed from death to life.</hi>] This appeares in the Parable of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the rich Man: and in the ſentence of the laſt Iudgement: as is plaine by reaſon, becauſe there are but two ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the one in Chriſt, the other out of Chriſt, &amp;c. Which muſt note againſt the Papiſts conceits of <hi>Limbus Patru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Limbus In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantum,</hi> and Purgatory: which as it is derogatory to the blood of Chriſt, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7. ſo is it a doctrine very vncomfortable, and that which doth adde a ſting vnto death: alſo it is a cauſe of much vniuſtice, when Parents will giue away their lands from
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3435:27"/>
their children to Monkes, &amp;c. to ſing for their ſoules.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the phraſe, <hi>hath eternall life, and hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp;c.</hi> it implies the certaintie of theſe promiſes. Yet a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will be made, in what reſpect we may be ſaid ſo ſoone as we beleeue to haue eternall life?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is, firſt in regard of hope.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe we haue the beginnings, and firſt fruits of it, <hi>viz.</hi> we are taken into the Kingdome of grace, which is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Kingdome of glory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In regard of our vnion with Chriſt our Head, and now glorified. Now wee being members of that body, whereof the head and principall part is raiſed vp, and in poſſeſſion of eternall life, we may be ſaid alſo, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> The true beleeuer is, and may be ſure of his eternall ſaluation. Which is to bee noted againſt our aduerſaries the Papiſts. Secondly, as a comfort to vphold vs in time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. A Preface, [<hi>Verily, &amp;c.</hi>] which words are here the third time laid downe. Now we may not thinke, that Chriſt vſed in vaine theſe ſtrong aſſeuerations, but that hee doth this to ſtrengthen our Faith, to rouze vp our dulneſſe, and to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate the incredulity of thoſe, that yet notwithſtanding all this will not beleeue.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Promiſe: wherein conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The time of accompliſhing of it, [<hi>the houre commeth] viz.</hi> of Chriſts death, reſurrection, and glorification; for then he drew all men vnto him, and then was the Goſpell publiſhed abroad. Yet this houre was now begun, becauſe that Chriſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3435:28"/>
was now exhibited. Now this time is called an houre, becauſe it is a ſet and certaine period which God hath appointed, and in which theſe things ſhould be fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> The time of the Goſpell is the time of ſaluation: for Chriſt here ſpeaketh of the time of the Goſpell: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The parties on whom this worke is to be wrought, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dead, that is, all naturall men; eſpecially meant of the Gentiles, who before this time were Alians from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Iſrael, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> The ſtate of naturall men, is the ſtate of dead men: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. there is in them by nature no iot, or dramme of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life. Which note,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Againſt heretikes that haue ſo much magnified Nature, as the Pelagians.</p>

There is an holy admiration without doubting, as when we admire the great workes of God, whereof yet we make no doubt: but ſo to wonder, as to call in queſtion any truth of God, to thinke it impoſſible, becauſe wee apprehend not the reaſon of it; this is a fault, and here reprooued.

                     <p n="1">1. By their place of abode: <hi>all that are in their graues:</hi> that is by a Synecdoche of one kind for all the reſt, by what manner of death ſo euer they died, and howſoeuer they were conſumed. This implies; That the conſumption of our bodies ſhall not hinder the reſurrection; becauſe the ground of it is the power of Chriſt, in regard of which there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                     <p>This ſerues for an encouragement againſt the diuers kindes of death whereunto we may come: as it was to the Martyrs: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.30.</p>

comfort of thoſe which in this world haue been forgotten, none hath taken notice of them, theſe at the reſurrection, Chriſt will not forget.

                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> To anſwere the ſcoffes of Atheiſts, who becauſe they ſee things fall alike to all, thinke it in vaine to ſerue God: as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Iob</hi> 21.14.15. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14, 15. but ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.37. <hi>Eſay</hi> 3.10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To taxe fond conceited men, that will deſire to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch a mans graue, or tombe, whom they hold for a good and holy man, that at the reſurrection they may receiue ſome benefit by him. Which is very ridiculous, although in ſome ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill reſpect it may be deſired.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. in the difference betweene them, note, firſt, the reward of the Righteous S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>condly, the reuenge of the wicked [<hi>they that haue done good vnto the reſurrection of life.</hi>] Here obſerue, firſt, the Parties. Secondly, the Reward.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:3435:30"/>1. The Parties are ſuch as haue done good: who are thoſe? not ſuch as build hoſpitalls, giue money to Friars and Monks, &amp;c. as the papiſts thinke. But there are foure things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to bring it to paſſe, that a man may doe good,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Partie that doth it. The rule is: That the perſon himſelfe muſt be good before the worke can be good. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Gen</hi> 4.4. God reſpected firſt <hi>Abel</hi> and then his offering. But how is the perſon good? In Chriſt the fountaine of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. Wherefore our workes are then good, when they come from vs as accepted of God in Chriſt, with whom we are vnited.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The matter of the worke: It is then good, when it is ſquared according to the rule of goodneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word of God: ſo that Actions framed according to Gods Will reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his Word, are good.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The manner: which is the cheife, and giues beeing, to the reſt. The rules are, firſt, that as it is good in its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo it muſt be done of vs in that reſpect, that it is good; that is, in Conſcience and obedience to Gods commandement, becauſe he hath commanded vs: 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that in regard of our weakenes and infirmity, it bee done in humility, with deniall of our ſelues, and faith in Chriſt, to haue all the blemiſhes pardoned, all the defects couered; and what is wanting, to be perfected in him otherwiſe being done in a proud conceit of our owne worth, it is odious and abominable.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That it be done in vprightnes and ſincerity of heart, as to God who is Iudge of it: <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.10. and fourthly, that it be done as a worke of God; that is, which God hath appointed vnto vs, either in our generall, or particular Calling.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The end that we muſt aime, firſt, at the glory of God. Secondly, The good of man. And from hence may we ſee, who they be that doe good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing is the Reward [<hi>of life</hi>] namely of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life; as <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. laſt verſe.</p>
                     <p>Let vs conſider what this <hi>life</hi> is; it is, in a word, our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God: that is, a coniunction of ſoule and body with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3435:30"/>
him. From whence ariſe theſe prerogatiues.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A continuall enioying of the glorious preſence of God, in as glorious and full manner, as the creature is capable of. A happy thing it was for the ſeruants of <hi>Salomon</hi> alwaies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his glory; 1. <hi>King.</hi> 10.8. and a great fauour for <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſee but the backe parts of the Lord. How great then will bee the glory, when God ſhall in ſuch ſpeciall manner communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelfe to vs: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2. and be all in all vnto vs. <hi>Reu.</hi> 21.22.23.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A fellowſhip and communion with the glorious Angels and Saints.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An abſolute perfection of ſoule and body, and of all the powers of both, perfect knowledge, perfect wiſedome; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. ſo that all things ſhall be done in that manner, as they could not haue been done better. In ſoule, ſuch integrity, as no defect; in body, immortality, incorruptibility, agility, and finally, a glorious body like vnto the body of Chriſt: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A full perfect and abſolute contentedneſſe that we ſhall not ſee what more to deſire: ſo that nothing can be added to our happineſſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A full redemption from all manner of miſery whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, eſpecially that miſery of miſeries from ſinning againſt God. The expectation of which freedome is it, that in this life doth refreſh the ſoule of a Chriſtian, groaning vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſinne.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. An admirable ioy and delight in this happineſſe, which indeed giues life to all the reſt: for it is better to be without honour, then to haue it with griefe and vexation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That which makes vp the heape of all the reſt, is the perpetuity and euerlaſting continuance of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> is, firſt, to breed in our hearts an holy admiration of the goodneſſe of God, that hath prepared ſo great things for vs. Secondly, to ſtirre vp in vs a deſire of it, and in deſiring to vſe the meanes that leade vnto it.</p>
                     <p>The other part is the reuenge of wickedneſſe: wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:3435:31"/>1. The Parties, they that haue done euill: who, not onely open ſinners, but all that commit an <hi>anomie,</hi> or tranſgreſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law; for then there is euill.</p>
                     <p>All that are not accepted of God in Chriſt, whether Pagans and Infidels, or vnregenerate Chriſtians, all ignorant perſons, that know not the will of God. For if we draw a line without a rule, we through the peruerſeneſſe of our nature, ſhall draw it awry. All ſuperſtitious perſons that take their owne conceits, and mens traditions for a rule; or ſuch as doe good things for by-reſpects, all proud conceited iuſticiaries that doe truſt to their owne perfection, all hypocrites and diſſemblers, all buſie-bodies that doe thoſe things which belong not to them, all vaine-glorious perſons, and haters of their brethren.</p>
                     <p>For to make vſe of this, conſider the ſecond point, the iſſue of theſe men in their puniſhment, which conſiſteth, firſt, in the pronouncing of that fearefull ſentence, <hi>Goe yee, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, in the execution of it, the horror of which is vnconceaueable and vnutterable; for beſides the priuation of happineſſe, there is a fellowſhip with the Diuell and the damned, all horror and vglineſſe, nothing good in ſoule or in body, no comfort, and which aggrauates the terror of all, eternall continuance of this woe.</p>
                     <p>Vſe is therefore, that if that which hath been ſaid of life doe not allure vs, that this doe terrifie vs.</p>
                     <p>Here are now to be anſwered two queſtions that ariſe from theſe words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Whether the good which we doe, be the proper cauſe of ſaluation?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: the beſt good that the beſt can doe, is no cauſe of their ſaluation: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For life eternall is the free gift of God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. laſt. and if it be of Grace, it is not of work: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Suppoſe wee did all that God requires; yet we merit not, ſith all is but our duty: <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. yea, <hi>Adam</hi> if hee had continued in his integrity, and full performance of the whole Law of God, yet had he not thereby merited Heauen, it being but his duty ſo to doe: then much leſſe we, whoſe righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3435:31"/>
is as a filthy clout: <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.6.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. All our workes are imperfect, and ſo cannot merit: for if wee our ſelues can finde many imperfections in the beſt of them, God can finde much more; <hi>Iob</hi> 9.15, 30, 31. Yet is life eternall attributed to our workes, as they are ſignes and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the ſoundneſſe and truth of our Faith in Chriſt, by whom we obtaine the ſame. And ſecondly, there is a twofold reward; the one of debt, the other of fauour, called the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of inheritance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> The vſe of this point, is to teach vs rightly to diſtinguiſh of workes, and to know their right end, that we be neither ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant and conceited, nor yet prophane and negligent of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Whether euill workes be properly cauſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea: as meriting and deſeruing it properly: for damnation is the wages of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> But how can that be, ſeeing the puniſhment is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the ſinne: the puniſhment infinite, and the ſinne but finite.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The puniſhment is not greater then the offence: for the offence muſt be weighed according to the greatneſſe of the perſon offended: now this is God, who is infinite, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly his wrath infinite.</p>
                     <p>Sinne therefore is infinite in meaſure, though not in time but the puniſhment is infinite, not in meaſure, but in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For the Creature is not able to beare the whole wrath of God at once (as Chriſt did,) and therefore it lyeth vnder the burden thereof eternally.</p>
                     <p>What then is the difference betweene good and euill workes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sinne is perfectly and fully euill: but the good workes we doe, are not perfectly good, vnleſſe they were done euery way according to all things commanded, and ſo were fully anſwerable to the Law of God, which we cannot doe.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, conſider wee ſome few inſtructions that ariſe from the manner of laying downe theſe words.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. [<hi>They that haue done good.] Doct.</hi> Not the abſtaining
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3435:32"/>
from euill, but the doing of good is that which cauſeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection vnto life.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. are three arguments to proue this point: firſt, that of the fiue fooliſh Virgins that wanted oyle, Verſ. 3. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that of the vnfaithfull ſeruant who was puniſhed, not becauſe he had purloyned, or ſtole any thing, but for not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of his Talent, Verſ. 25 &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The tenor of the ſentence: which is pronounced accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to workes done, or omitted, Verſ. 35. &amp;c. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 34.14. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                     <p>For herein doth the Image of God conſiſt, that wee bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in our mindes, and that we put on the new man, as well as put off the old.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> It ſerues for reproofe of the greater ſort of men, who thinke it ſufficient if they be not thus and thus, though in the meane time, as touching workes of Faith, Piety and Charity, they haue none.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. [<hi>They that haue done good.</hi>] And <hi>Doct.</hi> The good. [<hi>they that haue done euill.</hi>] And euill that in this life is done, is a ſigne and euidence, either of life, or of condemnation: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. [<hi>In his body</hi>] whileſt hee liued: <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. [<hi>In thy life time</hi>] for this life is but as a probation time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> See <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.13, 15.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Conſider what it is that Chriſt here vrgeth as an euidence of life eternall: it is the practice of good works, not the Profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Which ſerues to reprooue vaine Profeſſors.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. [<hi>Reſurrection of life.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>[<hi>Reſurrection of condemnation</hi>] That there is a difference betweene the good and the wicked, we haue heard. Here we ſee what it is: euen the greateſt contrariety that can bee: <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16.</p>
                     <p>Which muſt incourage vs in our Chriſtian courſe, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the wicked may ſeeme in many things to be better then we, yet there ſhall be a difference hereafter.</p>

                     <p>IN this Verſe is laid downe the condition of Chriſts iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to wit, that it is a iuſt iudgement; that hee iudgeth according to equity. This is confirmed by that communion that is betweene the Father and Him. The Argument is this: That which the Father doth, ordereth, and willeth, that is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and iuſt. But the Father iudgeth with me, he directeth my iudgement, and conſenteth thereunto. Therefore my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is iuſt. The propoſition is omitted, as granted of the Iewes: the aſſumption and concluſion are here ſet downe. The aſſumption in three points:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In that he can doe nothing without his Father, [<hi>I can doe nothing of mine owne ſelfe.</hi>]</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In that the Father ordereth the courſe of this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; [<hi>as I heare, I iudge.</hi>]</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Firſt, negatiuely, in that hee ſeeketh not his owne will. Secondly, affirmatiuely, in that he ſeeketh the will of him that ſent him.</p>
                     <p>The concluſion in theſe, [<hi>and my iudgement is iust.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>So that this Verſe, as it is a further proofe of the point in queſtion; ſo is it likewiſe a concluſion by way of repetition of all the former arguments.</p>
                     <p>Meaning of the words, [<hi>I can doe nothing, &amp;c.</hi>] Namely, as Verſ. 17.19. with this difference, that there he ſpeaketh in the third, here in the firſt.

                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt ſpeaketh this according to the conceit of the Iewes, who tooke Chriſt but for a man, and thought that hee herein followed but his owne fancy.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Particularly ſet forth in foure diſtinct inſtances, the firſt, of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> verſ. 33.34.25. Secondly, of Chriſt his workes. verſ. 36. Thirdly, of the Father; verſ. 37, 38. and laſty, of the Scriptures, verſ. 39, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But before he come to the teſtimonies it ſelfe, Chriſt doth firſt lay downe the occaſion of vſing of this kind of argument; which is to preuent, and meete with a ſecret obiection, which the Iewes might make on this wiſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That thoſe great &amp; excellent things, which before he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3435:33"/>
of himſelfe, might well be ſuſpected, and called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; becauſe they concerned himſelfe, and himſelfe did auouch them of himſelfe. Now their readines to make ſuch an obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, appeareth by Cap. 8.13. where they doe it plainly vpon the like occaſion. Therefore to preuent this, Chriſt brings in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimonies which might witneſſe the ſame things of him, which himſelfe had ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>This muſt be noted for the reconciling of a contradiction, which ſeemes to be betweene this place, and chap: 8. verſ. 14. For in that place Chriſt ſpeaketh litterally, and according to the truth of the thing; namely, that as he was indeed God, ſo albeit he had no other teſtimonie, yet was his owne ſufficient in his owne cauſe: but in this place he ſpeaketh by a Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conceſſion and grant, according to the conceit of the Iewes touching him, that he was but a man and no more. Now then the witnes of a man in his owne cauſe, although it may be true, yet is not ſufficient to decide the matter.</p>
                     <p>Obſerue then here, firſt, What Chriſt yeelded vnto, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Vpon what ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Our Lord, Chriſt Ieſus, for the further confirmation of the truth, and ſatisfaction of the hearers, yeeldeth from that which he might haue ſtood vpon: Though hee might haue ſtood vpon his owne teſtimonie as ſufficient, he being God; yet becauſe this was not ſo clearely euident, vnto them, hee bringeth in other teſtimonies and grounds for the confirming of this truth, that were more plaine and eaſie to their apppre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.26.27. he yeeldeth from his right, hauing other meanes to manifeſt himſelfe to be the Sonne of God: and <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.53. hee might haue called for Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                     <p>For Chriſt ſought not himſelfe and his owne glory <hi>Ioh</hi> 8.50. but the glory of God, by giuing euidence vnto the truth, and the edification of the hearers. Which ſhewes, firſt, Chriſt his great meekenes, euen againſt his aduerſaries; and his great deſire to bring them to the knowledge of the truth. He might hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> only deliuered the truth, &amp; being God, haue exacted cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on paine of eternal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation; but he conſidereth our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3435:34"/>
weakenes, and ſo imitateth God his Father, who not only com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>andeth, but bringeth with all arguments and reaſons, to ſhew the equity of his Lawes, to the end to perſwade vs to yeeld obedience. Secondly, it is for our Imitation, that as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offereth it ſelfe, we be ready to yeeld from our right, and not ſtand to ſtrictly on euery thing that may be iuſtified, if by other meanes the truth may bee the better perſwaded and taught.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ground vpon which he yeeldeth is, that if hee had been man, as they conceited him to be, then his owne teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie had not been ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> None are to iuſtifie themſelues and their actions, and to commend the things which they doe. For if Chriſt, who was free from an ouerweening conceit of his owne doings, from vaine glory, and deſire of applauſe, and whoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie was moſt true, would not yet commend himſelfe; how much leſſe may we, who are partiall in our owne matters and ſubiect to the other vices? <hi>Prou.</hi> 27.2.</p>
                     <p>For, firſt, If we commend our ſelues, it miniſters occaſion that our teſtimonie ſhould be ſuſpected; and it is hard but we ſhall mingle ſome vntruth, either in ſuppreſſing ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which might diſgrace vs, or amplifying other hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically which tend to our honour.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It ſauours of a deſire of vaine glory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If we do things that are indeed praiſe-worthy, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; for they will commend themſelues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> For reproofe of thoſe that ſtand ſo much vpon their owne credit, that they will haue euery thing ſo, becauſe they ſay it: as doth the Pope, who what he ſaies, ſitting in his chaire, men are bound in conſcience to beleeue: herein making himſelfe like God: 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. And as do many, who though they deliuer a thing but vpon their owne authority, yet are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended if it bee called in queſtion. So much for the occaſion.</p>

                     <p>But how is God another from Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In foure reſpects. Firſt in regard of the Iewes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that Chriſt was but a man: ſo is God another.

                     <p n="3">3. In regard of his Office, as he was Mediator betweene God and Man, ſo hee may bee ſaid to bee another then God. Fourthly, in regard of his perſon, as he is God, being a diſtinct perſon from the Father: ſo is the Father <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The meaning then is this, as if Chriſt had ſaid; You except againſt my teſtimonie, as a humane teſtimony; but I haue a diuine teſtimonie of theſe things, euen the teſtimonie of God himſelfe, who by <hi>Iohn,</hi> by his owne voice, by his workes, And by his word, doth beare witnes vnto mee.</p>
                     <p>The Generall then of this verſe is this; That thoſe things which Chriſt had deliuered, were confirmed by diuine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</p>

Now to ſhew that this reioycing is ſpoken more, to ſhew the powerfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the miniſtery of the Word, then in commendation of them, hee addes a limitation, that this their ioy was but for a ſeaſon; as is the ioy of all hypocrites and wicked men: <hi>Iob.</hi> 20.5. ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19, 20. They reioyced in <hi>Iohn</hi> for by-reſpects, in hope that he would haue brought them liberty, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them from the Romanes, and the like: but when <hi>Iohn</hi> did plainely vnmaske their hypocriſie, and diſcouer their ſinnes, their ioy was nipt in the head, and withered. Which hath been the practiſe of people from all time, firſt, for a while greatly to admire a Miniſter; but when hee tells them of their ſinnes, and preſſeth their duties vpon them, Oh then he is too hard and too ſeuere, &amp;c. and ſo they forſake him.</p>

                     <p>Becauſe a teſtimonie hath his credit from the dignity and credit of the witnes-bearer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The witnes it ſelfe is taken from his workes. Chriſts workes were diuine workes: Therefore they witnes that he was God.</p>
                     <p>The Doctrine then in generall of this verſe is this: Chriſts workes were a ſure euidence of his diuine power, and that hee was God: as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.25. and 15.24. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2. and 1.48.49. and 4.19.</p>
                     <p>For man cannot doe the workes of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> But did not the Prophets doe miracles, and diuine workes, and alſo the Apoſtles?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea. But the difference betweene their works and the workes of Chriſt, ſtandeth in foure points, firſt in the workes themſelues. Chriſt made choice of ſuch workes, as for the kind, neuer any did before as to raiſe one dead foure dayes and ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. To giue ſight to the blind: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.32. and the like. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the number neuer any did ſo many as Chriſt did: for he healed all that were brought, &amp;c. Thirdly, Chriſt ſtill as he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the body, ſo he cured the ſoule.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Prophets and Apoſtles were reſtrained, and could not doe miracles when they pleaſed, but when God permitted
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3435:37"/>
them. As appeareth in the example of <hi>Eliſha</hi>: 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.27.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſt did worke how and when it pleaſed him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The workes which the Prophets and Apoſtles did, they did neither by their owne power and authority, nor in their owne name: <hi>Act.</hi> 3.12. But Chriſt did his works both by the one, and in the other.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The miracles which the Prophets and Apoſtles did, were to ſhew, that they were ſent of God and were his ſeruants and meſſengers. But there was a higher ſcope of Chriſts miracles, that they aimed at, namely to ſhew that he was the Sonne of God.</p>
                     <p>We ſee then how ſtrong an argument this is, and how well this witneſſe of his workes is brought for confirmation of his Godhead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> is, firſt, that we reade not the miracles of Chriſt, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only of Hiſtory, but to take them as props for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of our faith in Chriſt, whom they ſhew to be God, and ſo an al-ſufficient mediator.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To applie this to our adoption) that we ſhew our ſelues to be the Sonnes of God, by being partaker of the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and doing the workes of God.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The ground of them is, becauſe they were ſuch workes, as the Father had giuen him in charge to doe: which ſhewes, that what Chriſt did, he did by authority &amp; commiſſion from his Father: a Doctrine heretofore noted, and it is a notable ground for the ſtrengthening of our Faith, becauſe God no doubt will accept of thoſe things that Chriſt did for vs, they being done by his authority. And ſecondly, it is for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that wee haue the warrant of God for the things wee doe. Now as this is a ground, ſo it is an end why Chriſt do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

theſe workes; as <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.49. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.38. and before, verſ. 30. of this Chapter: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.34.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The extent is, that Chriſt was not onely to begin theſe workes, but to goe thorow with them, and finiſh them. Hence learne,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> That the worke that God hath giuen vs, is not done, till it be finiſhed. This Chriſt knew, and ſo he fully finiſhed the worke his Father gaue him: as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.30.</p>

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> What Chriſt did, he did by his owne power. This did the people obſerue in all his Miracles, how he by his owne authoritie, and in his owne Name, did caſt out Diuels, forgiue ſinnes, teach the people, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Whence we learne, that Chriſt is to bee acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, adored, worſhipped, beleeued, and truſted in, as one that is abſolute of himſelfe to doe what he will. And thus are not Saints to be truſted vnto, who are only the inſtruments of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Witnes which theſe workes doe beare, is expreſſed in theſe words, [<hi>That the Father ſent me.</hi>] Now where Chriſt vrgeth this ſending, as a proofe of his equality with the Father, we muſt vnderſtand it of ſuch a ſending, as when an Equall is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This Phraſe of being ſent, is applied to Chriſt in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: 1. In regard of diſtinction of Perſons, of the Father and the Sonne.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In regard of Chriſts Incarnation, who being in Heauen in the boſome of his Father, was ſent to take fleſh vpon him here in earth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In regard of his Office, as he is Mediatour betweene God and Man, and therevnto ſent, and deputed by God.</p>

                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:3435:38"/>This ſhewes, that Chriſt did not vſurpe any authority and dignity of himſelfe, but had this by communication from God the Father. A point before noted.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3435:39"/>
for the firſt, that is, the teſtimony of the Prophets, comes next to be handled; the ſecond is ſecret: now Chriſt would bring ſuch a teſtimony, as all might take notice of. And for the third that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Here, then we are diligently to weigh the greatnes of this teſtimonie and in it to note the great goodnes of God, and the care that he hath of vs. For this being the ground of all the Articles of our Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt is the Son of God, without which there can be no comfort in beleeuing of any. God was not contented to haue declared this by his Prophets, yea or by Chriſt himſelfe; but himſelfe from Heauen in his owne perſon doth aſſure vs of the truth of this ſo neceſſary an Article of Faith, that Chriſt Ieſus is his owne Sonne, in whom he is well pleaſed with vs. And therefore of all teſtimonies of Scripture this among the reſt, and aboue all the reſt is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as a moſt ſure and ſtrong prop of our Faith. And this vſe <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth vs to make: when from hence hee bringeth a ſtrong argument to confirme the truth of the Goſpell. 2. <hi>Pet</hi> 1.16, 17, 18.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. In his repoofe note, firſt, The fault for which he reproues them. The ground of this fault.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The fault is noted in theſe words [<hi>yee haue not heard his voice at any time neither haue yee ſeene his ſhape.</hi>] Which words may be taken, firſt, litterally: That they neuer heard the voice of the firſt perſon ſpeaking by himſelfe at any time, that is, at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other time, except then, and vpon that occaſion when hee gaue teſtimonie to his Sonne. Neither yet did, or can any man behold God with carnall eyes. So that this, firſt, amplifies the greatneſſe of this teſtimony, that it is a matter of great weight, ſith neuer before, nor ſince, the like teſtimony hath been giuen. Secondly, it ſhewes what a great benefit it was, that Chriſt was incarnate, who is the character and ingraued forme of the Father, in whom we may ſee and behold him: <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:3435:39"/>2. Metaphorically, and to this ſenſe I rather agree: and then it is a prouerbiall kind of ſpeech taken from men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt doth taxe their ignorance and vnacquaintance with God. For men are knowne two wayes, by their ſpeech, and by their ſhape. Now they had neither heard the voice, nor ſeene the ſhape of God, and ſo were without all knowledge and acquaintance with him, and ſo in this reſpect like Heathen men. All the meanes that God affoorded for the declaration of his preſence among them, his voyce that hee cauſed to bee ſounded forth by the miniſtery of his Prophets, by Chriſt, yea by himſelfe extraordinarily, they regarded not, but ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ignorant. Like vnto theſe Iewes, are many among vs; that notwithſtanding the preaching of the Word, remaine ſtill in their ignorance, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The ground of this ignorance is ſet downe in theſe words, [<hi>and his Word haue you not abiding in you.</hi>] This Chriſt ſaith to preuent an obiection which they might make, <hi>viz.</hi> That they had the Law, the Sacrifices, the Word preached in their Synagogues, &amp;c. and therefore were not ſo ignorant as he bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore Chriſt taxeth in them two things, that the Word was indeed preached among them, and they heard, the ſound of it with their eares, but it went not vnto their hearts. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that if at any time it peirced to the heart, yet it did not there abide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> It is not ſufficient to haue the Word amongſt vs, to heare it, to talke of it, and the like, vnleſſe it be in our hearts, and abide there, all is worth nothing. Though <hi>Moſes</hi> were read euery day in the Synagogue, it profited the Iewes nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they vnderſtood it not; they were not affected with it, vnleſſe for a ſhort time, they made it no rule of their life to walke by. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                     <p>This ſhews we haue an honeſt and good heart, if the Word abides with vs, and we practiſe it; and on the contrary ſide, an euill corrupt heart.

                     <p n="1">1. That wee vſe the meanes to vnderſtand, and come to knowledge of the VVord. This was the fault of the firſt ground, the ſeed therein had no entrance at all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That we loue and delight in the VVord, that we make it our ioy, that we reliſh and affect it: for hauing knowledge, and feeling the ſweetneſſe of it, we ſhall be the more deſirous of it, without weariſomneſſe, without loathing. From the want of this, it is, that many men of great learning are yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, becauſe their knowledge was onely in the braine, and not rooted in the heart. Like the ſecond ground.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That we ſuffer the VVord to rule vs wholy, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine our luſts, pleaſures, and worldly care together with it: for theſe will ſucke out the life of the VVord: ſo that it will not abide with vs long; as in the third ſort of ground.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That we haue a care to make it a rule vnto vs, to ſquare our life according to it, then will it abide with vs: for a good conſcience is the ſhip wherein Faith is preſerued from ſuffering wracke: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. and we ſee, that error in iudgement, and corruption in manners doe mutually infect one another.</p>
                     <p>The confirmation of this ground is expreſſed in theſe words [<hi>for whom he hath ſent, him yee beleeue not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The VVord of God did not abide in them; and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not beleeue in Chriſt the Sonne of God, whom he had ſent. The truth of this reaſon appeares in two reſpects;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſt, who was ſent of God, was the ſumme and ſubſtance of the VVord of God, both of the Law, and of the Prophets; <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. whom principally it ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to declare. Now then how is it poſſible that they could haue the VVord abiding in them, who did not entertaine and beleeue in Chriſt when he was come.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe they receiued not Chriſt, who ſpake the words of God. Now if they had the Word of God abiding in them, they would haue beleeued in him, who had brought this Word vnto them.</p>
                     <p>

Ieſus. Which firſt, is againſt all ſuch as know not Chriſt, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him, or rely not vpon him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it teacheth vs to lay ſure hold on Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it ſhewes that they that deſpiſe the Word, and the Miniſter thereof, haue it not abiding in them.</p>

Now it ſeemeth that Chriſt obſerueth an order in ſetting downe theſe teſtimonies; firſt, to lay downe the leſſe, and then the greater. So that indeed this teſtimony of the Scripture is the greateſt of all the reſt. Not as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted, that there is any difference in regard of the truth of them; but in regard of the euidence and cleareneſſe thereof. This the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſhewes, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. where hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged the former teſtimonie of the voice of God the Father, verſ. 17.18. and comming to ſpeake of the teſtimony of the Scriptures, he ſaith [<hi>we haue a more ſure word of the Prophets.</hi>] It is greater then in theſe reſpects: firſt, in regard of the long continuance of this witneſſe, that it hath been a teſtimony gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of Chriſt from before ſo many ages, and ſo receiued by the Fathers, and approoued from time to time, as a certaine ground of Faith.</p>

Some care not to reade the Scriptures, but of all bookes make leſt account of it: Chronicles, Hiſtories, Playbookes are often read; the Scriptures ſeldome. Some will not ſuffer a Bible to be in their houſes, and count it a reproach to carry a Bible to Church. Some will reade at Church, and turne to places as they are quoted, but neuer at home, their buſineſſe ſuffers them

not: who yet are better then many, that will bring other bookes to Church, and while the Miniſter is preaching, reade thoſe. Some content themſelues to haue read ouer a number of Chapters at a time, without any further ſearch. Some read and labour to ſearch out the true meaning of places, but all is, that they may know the occurrences of things, bee able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile places, and maintaine them againſt the Aduerſarie, who yet faile in this duty, in that they are not caſt into the mould of the Scripture, and by their ſearch doe not finde out the hidden Pearle, Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

                     <p>The Argument then is thus: They that loue God, loue thoſe that come in Gods Name, and reiect the other that come in their owne name:</p>

                     <p>Obſerue here then, firſt, a deſcription of thoſe who are the obiect, whereby our loue to God may be diſcerned, namely, of Miniſters, who are either ſent of God, or come in their owne names; that is, are either faithfull Miniſters, whereof Chriſt

doth here ſet forth himſelfe as a patterne.</p>
                     <p>[<hi>I am come, &amp;c.</hi>] (But of this diuers times before) or falſe teachers and vnfaithfull, here ſet downe by the example of the Phariſes, of whom it is plaine, that they were not ſent of God, who preached their owne Traditions, and ſought onely their owne glory. Hence we learne,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> That it is a certaine note of a true Miniſter, to come in Gods Name, and of a falſe Miniſter to come in his owne name: the one hath an eye vnto God, and runnes not before he be ſent; and being ſent, obſerues what his will is, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, doth all things for his glory: the other hath an eye onely to man, to pleaſe him, to ſeeke honour and preferment, &amp;c. This difference wee ſee plainely betweene <hi>Michah</hi> the Prophet of the Lord, and <hi>Chenaanah,</hi> and the reſt of the falſe Prophets: 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22.11, 12, 14. betweene <hi>Ieremiah: Ier.</hi> 42. who perſwaded the people to obey the King of Babel: and <hi>Hananiah: Ier.</hi> 28.10, 11.</p>
                     <p>See <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.16, 17.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> This is a ſpeciall meanes to try the ſpirits, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.1. whether they be of God, or no, if they ſeeke themſelues, or the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It ſhewes that many among vs, although they haue an outward Calling, yet comes not in Gods Name, in that they aime not at the edifying of the Church by preaching, but their owne maintenance, eaſe and honour; or if they preach, they preach themſelues to ſhew learning, not for inſtruction of the people.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, obſerue in this verſe the peoples carriage and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards the Miniſters, either receiuing, or reiecting of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. They that receiue not ſuch as come in the Name of God, it is plaine they haue no loue of God in them: for they that loue not him that is ſent, loue not him that ſendeth: 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Iob.</hi> 13.20. This appeareth by the different carriage of godly men, and of hypocrites from time to time towards the faithfull Miniſters; as of <hi>Abab</hi> and good <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> towards <hi>Micah:</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22.8. of the good Princes, and the hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

                     <p>Note this, that we may examine our ſelues, with what mind wee haue entertained thoſe faithfull Miniſters, that God hath g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. They who receiue ſuch as come in their owne name, loue not God: for there is a maine oppoſition betweene this, the ſeeking of mans ſelfe his honour and eaſe, and the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. and therefore they that delight in ſuch as ſeeke not the Lord, aſſuredly loue not God. For it is a property of true loue, to loue thoſe whom God loueth, and hate thoſe whom he reiecteth: <hi>Reuel.</hi> 26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.21, 22.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. From the ioyning of theſe together, learne. That thoſe who reiect true and faithfull Miniſters of the Lord, are ready to embrace falſe teachers. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hated <hi>Moſes,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres. Ahab</hi> hated <hi>Michaiah,</hi> but liked the falſe prophets. So the Iewes did flocke after <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> of Galilee, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.36, 37. yet they reiected Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The like they did in the laſt deſtruction of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> reports; and now doe they highly eſteeme their Rabbins. Which commeth to paſſe, firſt, through the iuſt iudgement of God, who giueth them vp to the blindneſſe of their heart to beleeue ſtrong deluſions: 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> 28. Secondly, through the corruption of nature, becauſe we are naturally diſpoſed vnto error, rather then vnto truth, into which alſo wee eaſily doe fall, if wee bee not reſtrained by the Spirit of God. Whence it is, that there neuer was any he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, were his opinions neuer ſo groſſe and damnable, but had many followers: 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.2.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>For there is a direct oppoſition betweene Faith and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Faith makes a man to be vile in his owne eyes, to ſee his owne wants, and ſo cauſeth him to goe out of himſelfe, and ſeeke for helpe at God onely.</p>
                     <p>But ambition makes a man to thinke highly of himſelfe, to ouerweene himſelfe, and be much conceited of his owne gifts, as the proud Phariſes. So that he will attribute all to himſelfe, and nothing to God, as did <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12.22, 23.</p>

This ſheweth whether to haue recourſe for a ſupply of our wants, and to whom to giue thankes when we haue receiued any bleſſings. Thirdly, that God, as he beſtoweth all things on men, ſo he proportioneth them accordingly to euery man. This ſheweth, that wee are to obſerue our owne gifts and callings, and herewith to be contented.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The Allegory. The Bride is the Church; the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome is Chriſt; the Friend of the Bridegroome is here meant particularly <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was ſent to prepare the Bride for Chriſt: for this was the end of his Calling. Now hee hearing that Chriſt is come, and himſelfe ſpeaketh to his Bride, and that the people hearken vnto him, now doth he reioyce, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now the application is excellent and very fit, to conuince that enuious and ambitious conceit which poſſeſſed the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds, concerning the greatneſſe of <hi>Iohn</hi> aboue Chriſt. I am not (ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi>) the Bridegroome, but the Friend ſent to prepare, and fit the Bride for him: now how great a ſinne and offence were it for vs, if being ſent to woe for the Bridegroome, I ſhould ſpeake for my ſelfe, if I ſhould take the honour due to him, vpon my ſelfe, and ſo cauſe the Bride to commit idolatry, and ſpirituall fornication with another man.</p>
                     <p>Now come we to the inſtructions ariſing from the maine ſcope of theſe verſes, which is to ſhew the great difference that is betweene the Miniſters and Chriſt. Wee may obſerue, firſt, the Compariſon: ſecondly, the Inference.</p>
                     <p>The Compariſon ſheweth, firſt, the place of Chriſt, and the place of the Church. The point is; Chriſt is the onely Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome and Husband of the Church, and the Church is the Spouſe and Bride onely of Chriſt. Whence it is, that ſuch titles of Head, Husband, Bridegroome, are giuen to Chriſt, onely in relation to the Church; of Wife, Loue, Spouſe, to the Church onely in relation to Chriſt: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. and in the booke of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> Chap. 4.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23.</p>

I am not worthy to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his ſhooes; and as <hi>Abigaile</hi> ſaid, when ſhe ſhould be <hi>Dauids</hi> wife. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.41.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Heſter</hi> was taken to be <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> his wife, though ſhe were a poore captiue, yet was there ſome cauſe why the King loued her, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe ſhe pleaſed him, <hi>Eſter</hi> 2.9. but in the Church there is no cauſe why Chriſt ſhould caſt his loue on her, as appeares, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How carefull ought we to be in pleaſing of him, and by loue to anſwer this his loue, to carry our ſelues reuerently, to ſubiect our ſelues vnto his commandements, to ſeeke his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not to carry our ſelues rebelliouſly, preſumptuouſly, and proudly.</p>
                     <p>Againe, this is matter not onely of inſtruction, but of triall alſo, whether wee are of the Church, or no. This will appeare by our carriage: for if we be proud, contemptuous of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, worldlings, couetous, &amp;c. it ſhewes, that the Spirit of Chriſt is not in vs, whereby wee a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e vnited vnto him, and one vnto another; if it were, then would the fruits thereof be in vs, as loue, meekeneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For Conſolation: firſt, that ſo Chriſt will performe the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3435:54"/>
duties of marriage; what are they? That he will protect and defend, and prouide for her: for he is both able, becauſe God; and willing, becauſe he was not conſtrained to take the Church for his Spouſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.16. Secondly, ſo Chriſt is a companion with vs in all diſtreſſes, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. though he were in Heauen, yet by vertue of this vnion he was perſecuted: ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>penult, Heb.</hi> 2.17. Thirdly, the Law of marriage requireth, that there be a communication of all the goods of the Husband with the Wife. Now Chriſt is rich, and full of grace, and ſo is the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13.</p>
                     <p>Though the Church ſtart aſide ſometime, yet doth not God caſt her away, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10, 11.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſuch grace is giuen the Church, that ſhe ſhall neuer fall away finally, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.1. So that this bond is indiſſoluble, and neuer to be broken, which is another conſolation we receiue from hence, that we are the Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For refutation: So the title giuen to the Pope of Rome to be Head of the Church, is moſt diſhonourable and deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to Chriſt. Hee is not ſo the Friend of Chriſt, but plaine Antichriſt, arrogating that honour to him, which is due onely to Chriſt, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. our Husband. <hi>Iohns</hi> diſciples would faine haue made him Pope too, but he refuſed it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The compariſon ſheweth the place, and duty of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>The reaſon why it pleaſeth Chriſt to haue theſe friends, is, firſt, for the honour of himſelfe; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This ſheweth the dignity and excellency of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Calling.</p>

                     <p>Now let vs ſee what duties belong to the Miniſters, as they are the Friends of Chriſt. They are theſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To be Sutors to the Bride, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. to labour to win many wiues for Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When people are wonne and conuerted, then to keepe them from ſtarting backe, and following ſtrange fleſh: for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are not onely planters, but alſo waterers, and Nurſes to bring vp, as well as fathers to beget children vnto God; and if they continue not to the end, theſe loſe the fruit and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of all their former labours.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If by the temptations they fall, then to labour to reclaime them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. Chriſt ſheweth his affection there by thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables of the loſt ſheepe, and Prodigall childe, as a patterne for all Miniſters to be ſo minded.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To haue a ſpeciall care to maintaine the honour due to Chriſt entire vnto him, not to part ſtakes with him, or to wooe for themſelues, as <hi>Iohn</hi> would not here, and the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi>

                     <p>IN the thirtieth verſe is noted the ſecond inference, inferred from the former compariſon; as if hee had ſaid, Now the Bridegroome himſelfe is come, mine office of preparing the Bride is finiſhed; therefore ſhall I decreaſe both in the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall function: for now the people will ſtocke vnto him, and leaue me, as alſo in that credit and preſent account which they carry of me, becauſe they ſhall now reuerence, admire, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>This then that here is ſpoken of <hi>Iohns</hi> decreaſing, is not meant as concerning the authority of <hi>Iohns</hi> Doctrine, or his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his Calling, which can neuer be diminiſhed, but as long as the World ſtands, <hi>Iohn</hi> wil be found to haue been moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his Office.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſhew that this came not by his owne negligence, or by Chriſts pride and ambition, but onely by the will of God, he puts a muſt to it [<hi>I muſt increaſe, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>From this humiliation of <hi>Iohn</hi> wee may learne diuers good leſſons, as</p>
                     <p>Firſt, this teacheth Miniſters that they ſhould not bee grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, though they grow into diſgrace, and ſmall account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, if ſo be that thereby any glory may bee got vnto Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the more men are eſteemed, the leſſe account is made of Chriſt; and contrariwiſe, the more account is made of Chriſt, the leſſe will man bee eſteemed; as is plaine by the example of the Corinthians, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. and by that holy iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie which the godly Miniſters haue had, when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued much people to flocke about them.</p>
                     <p>The vſe is to teach vs, to fixe our eyes on Chriſt and God,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3435:56"/>
and not to dote on mans worthineſſe, and not ſo much to haue their perſons in admiration, as their Callings, and eſpecially that meſſage which they bring from God.</p>

Take an inſtance in his vnderſtanding, and wee ſhall ſee it naturally carried vnto carnall and ſenſuall conſtructions.

                     <p>Firſt, this is a notable euidence of Gods loue towards vs, who hath giuen vs Chriſt Ieſus, the Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda, to open the booke of the myſteries of the King of Heauen, and to reueale them vnto vs, without whom we ſhould otherwiſe haue had no more knowledge then Sauages, and wilde people haue, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 5.5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this is to admoniſh Miniſters that they be not puft vp with pride, and ſwell againſt their brethren, becauſe they haue more knowledge, but to remember that they are men as well as others, and ſo though they haue many helpes to get knowledge, yet it is Chriſt, who by his Spirit muſt illuminate their minds, to giue them ſound vnderſtanding in heauenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

                     <p>WHich words containe the complaint of <hi>Iohn</hi> for the incredulity and vnbeliefe of the Iewes. In it are two parts; firſt, the ground and reaſon of his complaint; ſecondly, the complaint it ſelfe. The reaſons or arguments whereby he vrges the greatneſſe of their incredulity are two; firſt, drawne from the excellency of Chriſt, [<hi>Hee that is come from heauen is aboue all.</hi>] Theſe words, firſt, in that they are twice repeated, and that for the weightineſſe of the matter therein contained, teach Miniſters that they ought not to thinke the bare deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a truth, and that but once ſufficient, but duely to conſider the weight of the matter, and ſo to vrge and preſſe it againe and againe, that hereby as it were by many ſtrokes, they may beat the truth thereof into the hearts of the hearers: <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they ſerue to aggrauate the incredulity of the Iewes. For who ſpake? Was it not Chriſt from heauen, who is ouer all? then the greater is their vnbeliefe that would not receiue his teſtimony. The Doctrine hence ariſing is,</p>
                     <p>The greater the perſon is that deliuereth a truth vnto vs, the greater is the fault if it be lightly regarded by vs. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of the ſecond of the Hebrewes: For the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prooued in the firſt Chapter, that Chriſt is more excellent then the Angels, Chap. 2. verſ. 2, 3. thereupon inferres, that if the Word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and euery tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſobedience, receiued a iuſt recompence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, the fault is greater, then if a meane and baſe perſon deliuered the ſame meſſage vnto vs. And the husbandmen were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eſpecially deſtroyed, becauſe they regarded not the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3435:59"/>
which the Lord ſent vnto them by his only Sonne: <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.37.38.</p>
                     <p>For this contempt of the meſſage, ſhewes a light eſteeme of the Perſon that deliuers it.</p>
                     <p>The vſe is that which the Apoſtles make, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. <hi>ſee that yee deſpiſe not him that ſpeaketh from aboue.</hi> Where he addeth a reaſon drawne from a compariſon betweene <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt, that if they eſcaped not which deſpiſed him that ſpake from earth, (1) <hi>Moſes</hi>; much more ſhall not we eſcape that deſpiſe him that ſpeaketh from heauen (1) Chriſt. That the former eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped not, appeareth by the example of <hi>Mirian, Numb.</hi> 12. of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Leu.</hi> 10. of the man that gathered ſticke, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. of <hi>Corah</hi> and his companie, of the Iſraelites that would needs fight with the Canaanites againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſſe commandement, yea and of all the Iſraelites, who periſhed in the wilderneſſe for this cauſe. Now if theſe did not eſcape, how can we?</p>
                     <p>But how ſhall we heare Chriſt ſpeake, who is now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaketh vnto vs by his miniſters, to whom he hath firſt deliuered this meſſage; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3, 4. and therefore Chriſt ſaith; <hi>he that heareth you heareth me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, but we ſee no ſuch iudgements come vpon thoſe that contemne the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is then becauſe we doe a right obſerue the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: for is not the puniſhment of the Iewes for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning Chriſt and his Goſpell, namely their vtter deſolation and diſperſion, farre greater then any of their Captiuities vnder the times of the Law. Doe we not ſee all thoſe famous Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Greece for their light eſteeme of the Goſpell, vtterly deſtroyed, &amp; now in ſlauery to the Turk, and is not Rome now a ſeruant of Antichriſt; a greater plague then to be made the ſlaue of the Turke; 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. And if there be no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall plague, then doth God ſend ſpirituall puniſhments, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing men vp to hardnes of heart, and reſeruing them to eternall condemnation: 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.26, 27. which plague of hardnes of heart is ſo much the more fearfull and grieuous by
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3435:59"/>
much leſſe ſenſible it is.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond argument is drawne from the infallible and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth of the Goſpell that Chriſt hath deliuered, verſ. 32. [<hi>what he hath heard and ſeene.</hi>] which words, firſt, ſhew the certaine truth of his doctrine for hearing and ſeeing are ſenſes of learning, and ſuch proofes are moſt ſure. Secondly, it ſettes forth his manner of deliuering: for he ſpake it not by relation and inſpiration, as the Prophets: but he ſaw, and heard it in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, in the boſome of his Father, at the Counſell-table, as it were of the Trinity.</p>
                     <p>The Doctrine hence ariſing is, That the Goſpell deliuered by Chriſt, is a moſt ſure and certaine truth. See <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1.3.2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.2. and therefore Saint <hi>Iam.</hi> cap. 1.18. fitly calleth it, the Word of Truth, both in regard of the Author, and of the manner of deliuery, and alſo of the effect it worketh in the heart of the receiuers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. This ſerues to aggrauate the incredulity both of the Iews, &amp; alſo of vs who notwithſtanding theſe cleare euidences, cannot yet be perſwaded of the truth thereof. We will beleeue a man that ſayth, hee both heard and ſaw the thing he repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; yet the Goſpell firſt preached by Chriſt, in whom there is nothing, but it makes him worthy to beleeued, after confirmed by the Apoſtles, who were eye-witneſſes, and eare-witneſſes of all that was done, cannot wee be drawne to beleeue: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.48.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This ſerues to ſtrengthen our faith in the doctrine of the Goſpell deliuered vnto the world; that wee beginne not to doubt, and ſtagger about the truth thereof, but to ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for the defence and vpholding of the ſame, and euen, if need bee, to ſeale vp the truth of it with our owne blood.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chriſts faithfulnes in deliuering that only which he ſaw and heard; ought to teach miniſters to take heed, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer nothing but what is ſure and certaine; which they haue receiued from Chriſt, and is grounded vpon the Word; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are liable to the Apoſtles reprehenſion: 1. <hi>Timo.</hi> 1.7.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This confutes our aduerſaries, who deliuer many points
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3435:60"/>
of doctrine, as neceſſary to ſaluation, which they neuer ſaw nor heare, whereof they haue no ground; as of <hi>Purgatory, Limbus, Tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c.</hi> Finally, if we will be certainely reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in points concerning our ſaluation, we muſt not relye vpon the ſayings, teſtimonies, and opinions of men, but vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth of Gods Word.</p>
                     <p>Now come we to the complaint it ſelfe. The fault hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of, was, that <hi>no man receiued his teſtimony.</hi> Though Chriſt ſpake from Heauen, though his perſon was moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and the truth of his doctrine moſt certaine, yet no man did beleeue it, that is, very few, and in compariſon of thoſe other that beleeued not as nothing.</p>
                     <p>From which inference wee may obſerue this inſtruction, that no euidence will ſatisfie incredulous and obſtinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: ſo the Iewes were perſwaded, the Prophets, and namely, <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> were inſpired of God, <hi>Ier</hi> 42.2. yet when he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered his meſſage from God to them, they would not beleeue him, but gaue him the lie, and ſaid, that <hi>Baruch</hi> did prouoke him againſt the people: <hi>Ier.</hi> 43.2, 3. So <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians would not be perſwaded, euen for their owne good. The Iewes, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.16. could not deny the truth of thoſe things the Apoſtles had done, yet would they not beleeue. So the Phariſes againſt their owne conſcience ſaid vnto Chriſt, that he caſt out diuels by the Prince; and though they knew he did it by his Diuinity, yet would they not be perſwaded; <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24. Thus infidelity cloſeth vp the eyes of a mans reaſon, ſo that, be the proofes and euidences neuer ſo plaine, yet he cannot be perſwaded in his heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> Not to thinke any thing the worſe of the truth, though men beleeue it not: for few there are that will beleeue, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. but the truth of the Goſpell depends not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man, but vpon God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. Wherefore wee ought not, as many doe, to ſtagger and doubt of the truth, becauſe Papiſts and others after ſo much writing and diſputing, and ſo plaine euidence on our ſides, will not yet beleeue, but ſtill write, and euen die in defence of their errors. For what if an Heretike bee burnt at a ſtake, ſhall we thinke euer the better of his hereſie, or
on
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3435:60"/>
the worſe of Gods truth? God forbid. Let vs rather looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Word of God, and ſo ground our ſelues thereon, and conſider withall what a man is, if God giue him ouer to the diuell, to incredulity, obſtinacy, and hardneſſe of heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Receiued</hi>] They heard the Word preached, and the truth of it proued vnto them oftentimes by Chriſt, yet they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned incredulous and obſtinate. Which firſt, as it ſerues to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate their hardneſſe of heart and vnbeliefe. Secondly, ſo it yeelds vnto vs this obſeruation. That incredulity and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy againſt plaine euidence of truth, is not onely proper to the profane and infidels, but to many of them alſo that vſe to heare the Word preached, to frequent Sermons, &amp;c. as the Iewes did, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31, 32.</p>

                        <hi>He that receiueth his teſtimony</hi>] Here Faith is deſcribed by the nature and obiect of it, which is the teſtimony of Chriſt, that is, the Goſpell, whereof Chriſt is the Author. The point of doctrine hence ariſing is, that true faith is onely grounded vpon the Word of God, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.8. That faith which relyes vpon mans word and authority, brings no honour to God, nor comfort to our owne conſciences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hath ſet to his ſeale that God is true.</hi>] Here is the excellency of faith ſhewed by the effect. That faith ratifieth and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the truth of God; as <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith is ſaid to glorifie God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. whereas vnbeliefe makes God a lier, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.10. But how can faith ſeale vp the truth of God, or infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty impeach it? Indeed the truth of God doth not depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man, but vpon the immutability of Gods will; yet Faith is ſaid to ratifie and confirme it, firſt, in regard of the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth of God to others: as among men, hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth another, doth manifeſt to the world, that accounts him a true and truſty man. Secondly, becauſe it aſſures and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines vnto our owne hearts and conſciences the truth of God. Thirdly, in regard of Gods acceptation.</p>
                     <p>Infidelity doth impeach the truth of God; not that indeed an vnbeleeuing man can make God a lyer, but becauſe he doth his vttermoſt endeauour as much as in him lyeth, to make him a lyer, by denying and doubting of his truth.</p>
                     <p>This affoords many inſtructions: firſt, that of all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Faith is the moſt neceſſary for a mans own ſelf, becauſe by it we apply the promiſes of God, and the merits of Chriſt vnto our conſciences. Secondly, that likewiſe none is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, becauſe it confirmes the pretious truth of God. Thirdly, that this is the moſt acceptable grace, becauſe it ſanctifies all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; without it, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. Fourthly, this ſhewes the great reſpect that God hath to man, that hee doth accept a teſtimony from him. Fifthly, againe, that faith doth on our part to God, that which the Spirit doth on Gods part to vs; this aſſures vs of Gods truth, that ſeales vp the truth of God, as Chriſt by his Spirit is knit and vnited to vs, wee by faith to him.</p>

                        <hi>FOr he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaketh the words of God.</hi>] Here is laid downe a reaſon, of that which was ſpoken of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of faith in ſealing vp the truth of God, drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the office of Chriſt. The reaſon ſtands thus: He that receiueth his teſtimony whom God hath ſent, and who ſpeaketh the words of God, hee ſealeth that God is true: but hee that receiueth Chriſts teſtimony, receiueth his teſtimony, that is, ſent from God, and that ſpeaketh the words of God. Therefore he that receiueth the teſtimony of Chriſt ſealeth that God is true. Or more briefly thus: Chriſts teſtimony are the words of God; therefore he that receiueth Chriſts teſtimony, ſealeth that God is true. This 34. verſe then containeth two parts:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Office of Chriſt, with the condition, or effect of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the gifts of Chriſt, and the quantity of them:</p>
                     <p>The Office is ſet downe in theſe words [<hi>He whom God hath ſent.</hi>] Which phraſe of ſending, is generally applyed to all the Meſſengers and Miniſters of God from time to time, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after Chriſt, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.19. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.20. And it notes three things: Firſt, the kind and quality of their Office, that they are Miniſters and Meſſengers. Secondly, the warrant of their calling; God ſends them. Thirdly, that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and ſet apart to that calling. But particularly, it is here vnderſtood of Chriſt, and in the generall, it ſetteth forth thus much, That Chriſt tooke not vnto him this Calling and Office of himſelfe, but God did appoint him, as the Apoſtle prooues, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>More particularly it ſheweth, that Chriſt was ſent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, euen from the boſome of his Father, to take fleſh vpon him to declare vnto vs the ſecret counſell of God, and to work our redemption, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.36.</p>
                     <p>But it will bee obiected, that in this reſpect Chriſt is very God, and then how can he be ſent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:3435:62"/>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, very well, if we conſider the diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for there is no inconuenience to ſay, that one perſon may ſend another, as Chriſt is alſo ſaid to ſend the holy Ghoſt. Yea but then one perſon ſhall be inferiour to another? We anſwer, Firſt, that there may bee a ſending among equals. Secondly, more particularly and properly we ſay, that Chriſt, firſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the humane nature which hee tooke into the vnity of perſon with the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ity. Secondly, in regard of the Office of his mediatorſhip, is inferior to the Father: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.28. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt was deputed of God to be his Meſſenger, and his Miniſter; a phraſe much vſed in Scripture; as <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.1. prooued to bee ſpoken of Chriſt by <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.9, 11. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10. and <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.1. Chriſt is expreſſely called, the Meſſenger of the Couenant; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. a Miniſter.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, none but Chriſt was fit to doe this, who onely knew all the ſecret councels of God; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, none was able to performe the worke, but he that was both God and man.</p>
                     <p>For vſe of this point; firſt, this manifeſteth Gods loue vnto vs, that when we had no meanes to come to the knowledge of his will, and to life eternall, he ſent his onely Sonne to bring vs vnto both, as in the 16. verſe of this Chapter. Secondly, this ſheweth that great reſpect that he beareth to mankind, in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo great and honourable an Embaſſadour vnto him. As among men, what greater honour then for a King to ſend his ſonne in embaſſage to a poore man. Thirdly, it ſetteth forth vnto vs that great loue and reſpect that Chriſt Ieſus bare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, in that he diſdaind not to take vpon him this office to be made a Meſſenger of God for our good, which we are well to note, that hereby we may learne to prize Gods loue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the worth of it, and ſo to loue him againe. Fourthly, this is matter of comfort vnto vs, that thoſe things which Chriſt performeth, are acceptable to God, becauſe God himſelfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to this worke. Fifthly and laſtly, it is exemplary for our imitation, that if we will haue comfort in the things we take in hand, we muſt looke, firſt, that the calling be warranted of God. Secondly, that our ſelues be deputed, and ſet apart to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3435:62"/>
that Calling, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. That the Calling is appointed of God, we ſhall know if it be warranted in the Word; and that the Calling is ordained for vs, if wee find our ſelues mooued thereunto by the Spirit of God, and inabled with gifts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it. This makes againſt Maſſe-Prieſts, and vnſufficient Miniſters, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.21.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He ſpeaketh the words of God,</hi>] Which is the effect of his Office. The Doctrine is, That Chriſt being appointed a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of his Father, was carefull to declare the Minde, Will, and Word of his Father; as himſelfe witneſſeth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.24. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.6, 8. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2. Chriſt is faithfull, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was: for this is a maine end why his Office was laid vpon him: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.38.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> is, firſt, it is a further motiue to preſſe the point and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, that we ſhould be attentiue vnto the Word, becauſe Chriſt brought it from heauen. So that if either the Author of it, namely, God; or the meſſenger, that is, Chriſt can mooue vs, it ſerues to enforce that exhortation which the Apoſtle hath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. that we doe not let ſhip this Word.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it teacheth Miniſters to haue a care that they bee like vnto Chriſt, to iuſtifie that they are ſent of God, by ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nothing but Gods Word. Which firſt is Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.7. <hi>Mat. vlt. vlt. Ierem.</hi> 23.21. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the example of the Saints ſhewes it; ſo did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets alwaies ſpeake in the Name of the Lord. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. Thirdly, this will gaine reuerence and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto their Miniſtery, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. Fourthly, herein lyeth a maine difference betweene faithfull and vnfaithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                     <p>Now from the force of this reaſon ariſeth this Doctrine, that to receiue their teſtimony that are ſent of God, and that ſpeake the words of God, is to ſeale the truth of God. Which as it is vnderſtood here of Chriſt, ſo is it true of all other Miniſters vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ground: <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.20. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. <hi>vlt.</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. The reaſon hereof is drawne from their Office, becauſe they are ſent of God, and are Embaſſadors of Chriſt ſtanding in his ſtead: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:3435:63"/>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> This ought to breed reuerence in mens hearts to the Miniſtery, becauſe they haue not to doe herein onely with men, but with God, who is honoured when the Miniſtery is honoured, deſpiſed, and contemned, when it is reiected: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.8.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it ſerues to vphold Miniſters againſt the deſpite of thoſe, who contemne their Miniſtery, becauſe of their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and weakeneſſes: but man ought to conſider not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the office.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Saying.</hi>] The charge of Chriſt is twofold; firſt, <hi>Hold thy peace,</hi> or be mufled, as 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.18. But why would not Chriſt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3435:63"/>
receiue the teſtimony of the Diuell. Becauſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the ground of this confeſſion was not good; it was not loue, but a ſlauiſh feare that made him, as a ſlaue ready to bee beaten, giue good words to his Maſter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in regard of the matter, it was in ſome reſpects true, but not in all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in regard of the manner, it was deceitfully vttered by him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, in regard of his perſon, he was not fit to giue teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Chriſt; and if he had receiued it, it might haue confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that ſlanderous opinion of the Phariſes of compacting with him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Come out of him.</hi> Chriſt needs nothing to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Diuell but onely his bare Word: So <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. though he ſuffered the Diuell to doe much, yet at his Word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he hies. Which ſhewes the difference betweene Chriſts caſting out of Diuels, and others: He, by his owne command; they in his name: he hy his Word, they by Prayer and Faſting.</p>
                     <p>Further, in regard of the party, note the goodneſſe of Chriſt towards mankind, which as particularly he ſhewed to this man here, ſo will he to euery one of vs, in deliuering vs from the ſlauery of the Diuell.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3435:64"/>
ſhould be the reaſon of all this violence? euen becauſe hee was now to abandon his hold. Hence marke this point, The laſt conflict with Satan is commonly the ſoreſt and greateſt. This is to be obſerued in all other demoniakes. Memorable is that of Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.30. when the Diuell was now at the point to be fully ouerthrowne.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, his obedience it ſelfe is noted, in that <hi>He came out:</hi> note, firſt, that the Diuell cannot reſiſt Chriſt, becauſe no proportion betweene the infinite power of the Creator, and that finite of the creature.

                     <p n="1">1. Their inquiring after this matter is firſt noted in way of reproofe, to taxe their ignorance and negligence, that they were not acquainted with the Scriptures and Prophecies concerning Chriſt, that it ſhould be he that ſhould confound the power of Satan, nor had attended vnto the preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor vnto Chriſts former Sermons, wherein he had declared himſelfe to be the Meſſias. Where we may ſee what followes vpon neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the miniſtery of the Word, that men are euer learning, yet come not to knowledge. Neuertheleſſe, in that they doe inquire, is commendable in them, and ſet forth for our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without it we ſhall neuer make profit of the Word.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By their particular queſtions, we may ſee the fruit of due attention. Firſt, they inquire into the nature of the Miracle, [<hi>What thing is this</hi>] for when once by diligent attention the mind hath receiued a deepe impreſſion, it is neuer ſatisfied, till it hath gotten the full knowledge of the thing. Secondly, they come to conſider of the principall circumſtance of the miracle, <hi>viz.</hi> the meane of performance, [<hi>What word is this?</hi>] Laſtly, they goe further, and apply the miracle to the right end of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the confirmation of a Doctrine, which for the high account and eſtimation they had of it, they called New; not in diſdaine to diminiſh the authority of it. A thing is ſaid to be new, when it is done in another manner then it hath vſually been.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The reaſon was; <hi>For with, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fame and report of Chriſt, (which is another effect of this Miracle.) Firſt, <hi>ſpread abroad,</hi> namely, by the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, that Chriſt and his doctrine might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entertained whereſoeuer he became. Wherein Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Church appeares, that thereby many came to reape profit by that which was done amongſt a few. Wherefore our duty is to publiſh the workes of God: which alſo was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt to many whom he cured. For firſt, this is a ſpeciall meanes to amplifie the glory of God. Secondly, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and edifie the Church. Thirdly, to hinder other idle and vaine rumors, when our care is to ſpeake of the works of God.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>In variety of phraſes, as <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Simon, ſicke of a Feuer,</hi> and <hi>taken with a Feuer, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſumme of this Hiſtory is a miraculous curing of <hi>Simons</hi> wiues mother. The parts of it are theſe: firſt, the Time. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the place. Thirdly, the Parties preſent before whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fourthly, the party cured. Fiftly, the manner of curing. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the manifeſtation of this to bee a Miracle. Seuenthly, the euent of it.</p>
                     <p>The time was, aſſoone as he came forth of the Synagogue, and it hath a double relation, either to the former Miracle, or to the aſſembly and meeting of Gods people, verſ. 22. in regard of which relation wee may note, firſt, that Chriſt counted it a proper worke of the Sabbath, to doe a worke of mercy. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that Chriſt contented not himſelfe to haue performed the publike worſhip of God on the Sabbath, but as occaſion was offered, did alſo other good workes.</p>
                     <p>Which is for our vſe, that among other duties of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to haue a ſpeciall regard to the workes of mercy, it being a good meanes to fill our hearts with godly meditations, and our mouthes with holy conference.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:3435:66"/>Secondly, that wee content not our ſelues with the publike ſeruice of God onely, but bee carefull to ſpend the reſt of the Sabbath after the aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p>The place where it was wrought, was, firſt, a priuat houſe. Here obſerue, that Chriſt was ready to manifeſt the gift which God had beſtowed vpon him in doing good, not onely openly before many, but in priuate houſes alſo before a few; as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1. at a priuate marriage of a poore couple hee wrought his firſt miracle: and <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.23. becauſe it was not a popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe that he ſought for, but doing of good to the Church, and for it he was as ready in one place as another. Howbeit, moſt of his miracles were publike, becauſe hereby, firſt, God was moſt glorified: ſecondly, more did reape benefit: thirdly, his Miniſtery more credited.</p>
                     <p>The vſe is for vs to doe the like in doing good to all, in all places indifferently, as occaſion ſhall ſerue. For to doe nothing but what many may take notice of, ſauoureth of arrogancy and deſire of glory, rather then zeale of Gods glory, and good of their brother.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It was the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi>; where a queſtion may be moued, how it is ſaid to be the houſe of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>Andrews</hi> both?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was either becauſe both had right to it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both of them dwelt together. To that, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.44. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That their breeding might bee at Bethſaida; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Trade of fiſhing, they might haue a houſe at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum. Secondly, <hi>Peter</hi> might dwell there becauſe of his wife. Thirdly, becauſe Chriſt did dwell there to entertaine him.</p>
                     <p>To that <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.11. I anſwer, they forſooke all, that is, all that might hinder them in following of Chriſt, as their calling. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the vſe of all, but not the poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Now this ſhewes the brotherly agreement betweene theſe two brothers; a thing highly commended in Scripture; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, though they ſuffered nothing to hinder them in following of Chriſt, yet they did not fondly caſt away that they had. <hi>Matthew</hi> made Chriſt a Feaſt in his owne houſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3435:66"/>
he had forſooke all: <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.28, 29. For riches are Gods bleſſings, and haue a good vſe, wherein they are to bee imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they croſſe not greater matters. Secondly, we are Gods Stewards, and no Steward may caſt away his Maſters goods. This confutes the Anabaptiſts, and ſome ancient Philoſophers, which caſt their money in the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The company preſent were the foure Diſciples, verſ. 29. who were companions together, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.7. Here note, firſt, the care of Chriſt to traine them vp, becauſe hee meant to make them Apoſtles; and ſo he made them eye-witneſſes of his Miracles and Doctrine, for the further ſtrengthening of their Faith, that they might haue the greater euidence to preach Chriſt vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This ought to be the practice of Tutors. This did <hi>Paul</hi> with <hi>Timothy.</hi> Secondly, their care and diligence to doe him ſeruice in attending on him, who was their Maſter. Thirdly, the Diſciples deſire to profit by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The party cured, was <hi>Simons</hi> wiues mother. Where wee may note, that Chriſt thought it not an vnfit thing to take a married man for his Diſciple. But ſome obiect againſt this, and ſay, that by a wiſe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5. is meant another woman? which is both ſlanderous and rediculous. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. in all, marriage is honourable, and in Miniſters: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3:</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in that <hi>Peter</hi> had a carefull reſpect of his wiues mother, we learne, that husbands and wiues ſhould haue a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſpect of the parents each of other, as appeares in <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Iethro.</hi> The reaſon of it, is the Law of marriage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. by which bond they are to extend their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the parents of one another. Secondly, this is a great meanes to breed loue and kindneſſe betweene themſelues, when the one ſeeth how much the other reſpecteth his friends.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, her diſeaſe wherewith ſhe was afflicted, was, firſt, a hot burning Feuer: ſecondly, a great Feuer: thirdly, ſhe was ſo ſicke of it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hat ſhe was faine to lye downe: fourthly, ſhe was healed of it. All which circumſtances do amplifie the diſeaſe, ſhewing it to be grieuous and dangerous. Whence learne we, That there is no diſeaſe ſo dangerous, but Chriſt can cure it;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3435:67"/>
becauſe the abſoluteneſſe of his power is ſuch, that with him there is no reſpect of greatneſſe or ſmalneſſe. Teaching vs hereby to truſt perfectly vnto him in all our diſtreſſes, it being he alone that can giue to others wiſedome to preſcribe, and to the meanes power to effect our health and welfare.</p>
                     <p>The manner of curing. Here note the occaſion; <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.14. ſaith, <hi>Chriſt ſaw her. Marke,</hi> that <hi>they told him of her. Luke,</hi> that <hi>they intreated him for her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, then the ſight of our miſeries moues Chriſt to ſuccour vs; as <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.34. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.6. becauſe the eyes of Chriſt are eyes of pitty, like to thoſe of the Samaritan: <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. Which ſerues to miniſter comfort to vs in all miſeries. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3, 4, 5, &amp;c. And albeit that Chriſt doth alwaies ſee our miſeries, yet muſt we put him in minde of them, that he may ſee how wee are affected with them our ſelues.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In that they told him, and intreated him for her: this ſhewes, firſt, their faith in Chriſt: ſecondly, their loue and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to her. Teaching vs in like caſes to giue an euidence of our faith and brotherly loue, by commending the caſes of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to Chriſt. For as he is beſt able to helpe in all diſtreſſes, ſo firſt, it is an honour done vnto him: ſecondly, it is a meanes to obtaine helpe for them: thirdly, it is a ſacrifice acceptable to God, and we are accepted as worſhippers of him.</p>
                     <p>The meanes of curing, reſpect partly the geſture, partly, the ſpeech of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The geſture: <hi>He came vnto her, tou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>hed her, and lift her vp:</hi> all to ſhew, that this cure came of him. Chriſt was able to doe it without theſe meanes, but hee did it to giue a greater eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And falſe is that collection of the Vbiquitaries vpon <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.31. that in the fleſh of Chriſt was a vertue to heale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diuine qualities were transfuſed in the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>

                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:3435:68"/>The ſeuerall branches of this Hiſtory are, firſt, the Time: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Occaſion: thirdly, the Parties cured: fourthly, the Witneſſes preſent: fifthly, the Manner of working this miracle: ſixthly, the Manifeſtation thereof: ſeuenthly, the Effect: eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the End, <hi>viz.</hi> the accompliſhment of the Prophecy.</p>
                     <p>The Time; <hi>When Euening was come, viz.</hi> the Euen of the ſame day whereupon Chriſt had done ſo much before, as the inference ſhewes plainely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt is euer ready to doe one good after another, as occaſion is offered. A thing often noted in him; as after the long Sermon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6, 7. in the eight Chapter are ſet downe more workes which he did preſently after; becauſe he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of this life as of a time of worke, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.4. and ſo he did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue this time.</p>
                     <p>Which teacheth vs to learne the like diligence vpon the ſame ground of the ſhortneſſe of life, labouring here, looking for our reſt hereafter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.8.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is ſaid, the Sunne was downe, and Euening was come. Now this ſeemes a time of reſt, and vnſeaſonable for ſuch buſineſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> No time was vnſeaſonable to Chriſt to doe good, he conferres with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in the night: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Samaria, weary and hungry; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. The reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt did eſteeme the doing of Gods will aboue his meat, drinke, and reſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.34. and ſo muſt we doing good workes both in, and out of ſeaſon, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. and it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe for thoſe that will doe good, but it ſhall be onely at ſeaſonable and fit times.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, [<hi>the Sunne was ſetting.] Marke, [When the Sunne was ſet.</hi>] Here ſeemeth to be ſome contradiction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Sunne was ſcarce downe, and yet it was euen now downe, when as they brought their ſicke vnto him; ſo that the Sonne was but newly ſet.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why they brought not their ſicke, till the Sunne was downe, was, becauſe the Iewes did hold the workes of mercy vnlawfull to be done on the Sabbath day, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.2, 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.14. &amp; 14.2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.9, 10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.16. therefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3435:68"/>
hereof they bring them not till the Euening, their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath then ending, as they thought. Where note we, that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition makes men neglect their owne good, and the good of their friends. Chriſt might haue been gone away to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, or haue taken himſelfe to his reſt, and would not cure them, and other caſualties might haue come betweene. For ſuperſtition blindeth the iudgement, that it cannot diſcerne betweene things conuenient and vnconuenient, but wholly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the thing conceited. Wee ſhall auoide ſo dangerous a thing, if we attend to the Word, and looke that thoſe things which we maintaine, bee grounded vpon the Word of God: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9.</p>
                     <p>The Occaſion that mooued Chriſt to worke theſe Miracles was, becauſe there were brought vnto him fit obiects to work vpon. Hence we learne, that the charitable workes of other in bringing their ſicke to Chriſt, gaue him occaſion to heale them. Reaſon was, firſt, to ſhew the goodneſſe of his nature, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the perſons themſelues ſue vnto him, but alſo when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers intreate for them. Secondly, to ſhew how he approoues the good mind of others herein, as alſo their Faith.</p>
                     <p>More particular circumſtances to be noted, are, firſt, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality; <hi>all brought their ſicke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> All of all ſorts are ready to ſeeke remedies for the cure of bodily diſeaſes: A Ruler, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.46. a Begger: <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.46. a Canaanitiſh woman, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22. becauſe theſe outward diſeaſes are ſenſible. This will be a witneſſe againſt vs all, that are ſo careleſſe in ſeeking redreſſe for our ſpirituall maladies.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the manner of bringing. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>they led them by the hand. Marke,</hi> that <hi>they brought them.</hi> Noting hereby, that ſuch was their care for their friends, that they thought it not enough to tell them of a remedy, but they brought them to the place where it was to be had: ſo <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.56. The cauſe of it was the greatneſſe of their Faith in Chriſt to cure all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and of their lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to their brethren.</p>
                     <p>Vſe is for our imitation, not onely in the temporall good of our friends, but in the ſpirituall health of their ſoules, by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3435:69"/>
them to the meanes of ſaluation; ſuch eſpecially as are vnder our authoritie.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Parties cured.</hi> Note here Two points. Firſt, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie of them <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> ſay <hi>all; Luke, euery one:</hi> and that this <hi>all,</hi> were not a few; <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith, that hee cured <hi>many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The kindes of maladies noted to haue beene; Firſt, in generall, diuers diſeaſes, ſome dangerous, ſome deadly, ſome infectious, &amp;c. Secondly, in particular, poſſeſſions of Diuels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Firſt, that Chriſt in doing good, ſhewes himſelfe to bee no reſpecter of perſons: all that came were healed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> none loſt their labour; <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.37. For the ground of Chriſts actions is in himſelfe, and his owne goodneſſe, not in any thing whatſoeuer in man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> For comfort and incouragement for all, in all diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to haue recourſe vnto Chriſt. Secondly, for imitation that in doing of good, we reſpect not the perſon, but the occaſion that God offereth. This ought Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, Councellors, &amp;c. to do; <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.1. Thirdly, for reproofe of thoſe that reſpect Greatneſſe, Friends, Money, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Secondly, Chriſt was not weary of well doing. He healed a multitude; teaching vs not to bee diſcouraged in comming to Chriſt, becauſe we ſee many goe; but to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that his power and ability is not ſtinted, but infinite as himſelfe, like a neuer dried Fountaine.</p>
                     <p>Among the diſeaſes that Chriſt healed, there were no doubt, ſome loathſome, and ſome infectious: heare obſerue. Firſt, Chriſt loathed none of them, being full of pittie, and the more grieuous the diſeaſe, the more pittifull. Which giues vs comfort and confidence to goe vnto him, though neuer ſo loathſome and contemptible in our owne eyes; yea, the rather becauſe of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; and further teacheth vs to be of a like minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others. Secondly, that Chriſt was not capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which as it is gathered here in generall, ſo it expreſly <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.3. prooued, by curing the Leper. For Chriſt was not infected with our perſonall diſeaſes, being from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:3435:69"/>Laſtly, that Chriſt was able to cure all, it ſhewes him to be a ſufficient and perfect Sauiour, both willing and powerfull to doe vs good. The application which the Prophet makes, in <hi>Matthew.</hi> 8.17. proues this.</p>
                     <p>The witneſſes preſent, were the whole Citie, that is, many of the people of the Citie. <hi>Per Metonim. Subiecti.</hi> And <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoc. Totius proparte.</hi> Such phraſes in Scripture are vſuall. Neither are we to ſearch too curiouſly, nor condemne a man of vntruth preſently, if he vſe ſuch a phraſe. That ſo many aſſembled, it ſhewes rather the good prouidence of God, then any goodneſſe in them, being by him brought to paſſe for his Glory, and the good of the Church, and the clearing of the innocency of Chriſt his Sonne, and his plaine dealing; ſeeing the Phariſes and others counted him an impoſtor. But what profit theſe Capernaites made of theſe miracles may appeare; <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>The meanes which Chriſt vſed were:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His Word, Chriſt hath an abſolute command ouer the Diuell. So wee are to truſt in Chriſt, if wee feare the Diuell. And this we muſt doe when we ſee no outward meanes. For Chriſt can worke by his owne Word, without any meanes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His laying on of his hands: not that this was any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall meanes, but to ſhew that the cure came from him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of theſe miracles to be true miracles, is ſet forth by diuers branches.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the generalitie, no diſeaſe ſo deadly, but Chriſt cured it, no ſpirit ſo ſtrong, but Chriſt diſpoſſeſſed him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>. It was done ſo ſhortly and ſuddenly. So miraculouſly. For time is required to things done by courſe of Nature.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The cure wrought ſo perfectly.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That theſe things were done without any naturall meanes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the Diuells came out crying, that is, vnwillingly, and flatteringly.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That Chriſt did not ſeeke to colour any thing, but did it in view of all. Wherefore Chriſt being thus able to doe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3435:70"/>
he is to be truſted vnto, aboue meanes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>cts</hi> are two: Firſt, in regard of the Diuell. And Secondly, in regard of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Of the Diuels, that Firſt, they came out; Secondly, they cried; Thirdly, they confeſſed Chriſt the Sonne of God. The Firſt, ſheweth their inforced obedience; The Second, that they ſtand in dread and awe of Chriſt; The Third, they had knowledge of Chriſt, though not by themſelues, but by the Church; hearing the Prophets point at him. So that euen the Diuels many times doe profit more by the Word, then men of Chriſt. Firſt, that he rebuked the Diuell; ſhewing his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of him, and indignation againſt him.</p>

                        <hi>Place,</hi> is noted in generall to bee Capernaum; of which Citie hath beene ſpoken before. Here note, that this is the fourth time where expreſſe mention is made of Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto this City.</p>
                     <p>So that this was the chiefeſt place of his abode: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called his owne Cittie; <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.1. In regard of which reſidence of Chriſt here, &amp; his often preaching, it was that this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3435:71"/>
Citie, was lift vp vnto Heauen; in reſpect of the benefit they might haue reaped by his ſtill being with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> It is a great benefit to haue a faithfull Miniſter, or neighbour dwelling by vs. This the Shunamite well knew; 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.9.10. Becauſe of Gods bleſſings accompanying ſuch. Secondly, of greater meanes of comfort and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thirdly, wee are after a more ſpeciall manner partakers of their prayers; for ſuch will not forget to pray for their Friends and Neighbours, and ſuch as they are bound vnto. Which comdemnes the world, that of all other, are loth to haue a Miniſter, or a godly man dwell by them; for feare leſt their prophaneneſſe be diſcouraged. And we ſee that the Capernaites light eſteeme of Chriſt, his dwelling and paines taking amongſt them; was it for which Chriſt doth afterwards condemne them to hel, though before lifted them vp to heauen.</p>
                     <p>The particular place noted, is the Houſe; <hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſts vſuall abode. For he dwelt in Capernaum; <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.13. &amp; 9.1. Not of his owne inheritance, for hee had not a houſe of his owne, to hide his head in; <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.20. But it is like to bee that of <hi>Simons</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> mentioned before; <hi>chap.</hi> 1.29.33. For theſe were likelieſt to entertaine him: and hither the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reſorted once afore <hi>verſe</hi> 33. and ſo found him out the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er now; and <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.27. <hi>Peter</hi> payeth tribute for Chriſt and himſelfe, as if they had dwelt both together.</p>
                     <p>Here we ſee that Chriſt lets ſlip no opportunitie, but preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a priuate houſe, hauing good occaſion: which albeit he and other extraordinary perſons, did vpon extraordinary times and occaſions; yet we muſt take heed how wee draw it into imitation, in a ſettled Church where the libertie of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like aſſemblies is permitted to all, to the offence of the ciuill Magiſtrates. Much leſſe may we with Browniſts and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, with draw our ſelues from the publike aſſemblies to goe into Woods, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Occaſion</hi> in generall, was the peoples concourſe; where note firſt what moued the people to come. It is ſaid that his comming was noiſed abroad; the rumour ſpreading from one Neighbour, to another. This is to bee noted for ſuch places
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3435:72"/>
(as many in the countrey are) where the preaching of the Word is rare; that if happily a faithfull Miniſter comming that way, be willing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>re to beſtow his paines; one Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour doe make it knowne to another, and incourage them to come.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Note their readineſſe, expreſſed two waies. Firſt, their ſpeedineſſe [<hi>ſtraight way,</hi>] which condemneth the ſlacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of many in comming to the Church. Secondly, by their Multitude, [<hi>many,</hi>] amplified by that, that Firſt, the Houſe; Secondly, no not the Porch and places about the houſe were able to receiue them. Amongſt which multitude, though ſome came for curioſitie, ſome for helpe of their diſeaſe, ſome for other reſpects, yet ſome came to heare, and in generall, their comming was commendable, and to good effect; occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning Chriſt to inſtruct them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Readineſſe in people to heare, ought to ſtirre vp in Miniſters a deſire to preach; as <hi>Act.</hi> 10.33. For this is a ſigne that God will giue a bleſſing; Secondly, that hee hath called vs to ſuch a place.</p>
                     <p>The perſons that were Auditors, are diſcribed by <hi>Luke,</hi> to haue beene not only of the common ſort: but alſo of the Phariſes and Doctors of the Law.</p>
                     <p>The Phariſes were a ſtrict Sect, differing from all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in apparrell, diet, and conuerſation. But two things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially are noted of them. Firſt, that they were moſt exact expoſitors of the Law. Secondly, their ſtrictneſſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation; in both which reſpects, Chriſt doth notably diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their falſe dealings, ſhewing them to be, both hereticall in their Doctrine, grounding their expoſitions not on the Scriptures, but the traditions of their Fathers: and alſo hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall in their converſation, doing whatſoeuer they doe, to be ſeene of men.</p>
                     <p>The Doctors of the Law, are thoſe that be called elſewhere Scribes, not from writing, but learning. For both Scribes and Phariſes, ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chaire, though theſe were a more common kinde of teachers then the Phariſes.</p>
                     <p>Both theſe ſorts were in oppoſition againſt Chriſt, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3435:72"/>
and hating him. And now they came with a malicious, enuious, and captious minde to enſnare him: as may appeare by their reaſoning againſt him in their hearts. Yet it is ſaid, theſe men came from euery quarter round about, to ſhew how farre malice and enuie will carry men, further ordinarily then pittie. Secondly, note here that Chriſt ceaſeth not to preach, although theſe captious and enuious hearers ſate before his face: being he knew that his Doctrine was true, and that hee was able to defend it. Now there was neuer any congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where were not ſome enuious, captious, and malicious hearers; who comming not with a minde to ſubiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to the Word, finde occaſion to cauill and carpe at it, to bleare mens eyes with this pretence, as a cauſe why they doe not yeeld obedience vnto it. For all this Miniſters muſt not be diſcouraged from preaching, but regard: Firſt, that the Lord hath ſent them. Secondly, The Talent that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon them, which they muſt imploy, if the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hinder them not. Thirdly, that there be ſome honeſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hearers, and their good is to be reſpected. Such kinde of Auditors had <hi>Ieremie,</hi> chap. 20.10. ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.3. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As an antidote againſt the poyſon of enuious tongues, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ought to regard both the matter and manner of their Doctrine, that it be ſuch as may be iuſtified by the Word of God, that it be ſo deliuered plainely, powerfully, that it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour not of oſtentation, and affectation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seale</hi> of Chriſts preaching, is the extraordinary Power of God, that is, the gift of healing; which did now manifeſt it ſelfe in an extraordinary manner. That it is called the power of the Lord, inferre no oppoſition, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe was the Lord. Or ſecondly, rather becauſe that Chriſt in regard of that condition, whereunto he did ſubiect himſelfe, in taking our nature and infirmities vpon him; he needed the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God. Not that this power of the Spirit was not alwaies in him, but becauſe it did not alike alwaies ſhew it ſelfe, as <hi>Marke</hi> 6.5. himſelfe reſtraining it in regard of the condition on mens part, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith.</p>
                     <p>At this time he doth manifeſt this diuine Power, the rat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3435:73"/>
becauſe of his malitious aduerſaries that were there preſent· So that it is to be noted, that the more the Word is cauilled at, the more euidence God giueth thereunto. <hi>Moſes</hi> miracles the more the Sorcerers did diſgrace, the more clearer they were, till they did confeſſe the finger of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 4.16. Which ſerues to incourage honeſt hearers, and to confound the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond general part is the Miracle it ſelfe, and the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, wherein note, firſt, the kind of the diſeaſe: ſecondly, the occaſion: thirdly, the manner of curing.</p>
                     <p>Touching the kind of the diſeaſe, it was the Palſie: a diſeaſe whereby the nerues and ſinewes are ſo looſed and diſſolued, that motion and life is loſt in that part which is ſo affected; and therefore it is called the dead Palſie, which if it bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what growne, it is hardly or neuer cured; as it was with this man, who was neither able to goe, nor to ſit, which ſhewes the greatneſſe of the cure. Now though this diſeaſe be a ſhame to Phiſitians paſſing their skill, yet Chriſt did cure it, as he is able to doe all other the moſt dangerous ſickneſſes.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion of working this Miracle, was partly the Faith of them that brought him, partly the Faith of himſelfe, verſ. 5. which Faith, though it be an inward grace, and ſo of mans eyes inuiſible, yet Chriſt could ſee it inwardly. Notwithſtanding, here he ſees it alſo by the fruites thereof in them by their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, diligence and labour in bringing this poore man to Chriſt. Secondly, in the man himſelfe by his great patience, in ſuffering all thoſe things they did vnto him. Of theſe wee will ſpeake of more particularly; and firſt, of the fruits of faith in this mans Friends.</p>
                     <p>Their charity and care is ſet downe in fiue branches; firſt, that they did not onely tell him of a remedy for his diſeaſe, but alſo did foure of them bring him vnto the place where it was to be had, verſ. 3.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he being not able to riſe and goe along with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they carry him, and not ſo onely, but for his greater eaſe, bed and all, verſ. 3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hauing brought him, they leaue him not ſo, letting him
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3435:73"/>
alone for others to bring him to Ieſus, but themſelues ſeeke all meanes to come neere vnto Chriſt, verſ. 4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.17.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When in ſeeking of this meanes of acceſſe, they were hindred, yet doe they not ceaſe to proceede on, not making this hinderance an excuſe either for to leaue him, or to carry him backe againe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Finding no ordinary meanes, they ſeeke vnto extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: firſt, they clime vp to the top of the houſe, and ſo draw vp the bed. Now it is to be noted, that their houſes were flat on the top, as may be gathered out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.8. and that this houſe here ſpoken of, was open to the top without chambers, like a great Hall, and ſo it was fit for a great many to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Secondly, they vncouer the roofe, and breake it open. Thirdly, when they could not goe downe themſelues, they let him downe with ropes.</p>
                     <p>From theſe circumſtances we learne many duties of charity to be performed in like caſes of diſtreſſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is not ſufficient to tell our friends of the meanes of cure, but wee muſt doe our beſt to make them partakers of ſuch meanes. For ſome are vnable to helpe themſelues, as this man; and ſome are careleſſe of their owne ſafety, like <hi>Naaman,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 5, 12. and ſome it bootes but little, only to tell them of the meanes, vnleſſe we help them to it our ſelues, and perſwade them to vſe it, like to <hi>Naamans</hi> ſeruants. To apply this to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall cures, wee muſt not onely make knowne vnto others where the meanes of ſaluation is to be had, but alſo as farre as in vs lyeth, make them partakers of it. For here the reaſon holds true, that we are vnable, careleſſe, and vnwilling to ſeeke vnto theſe meanes of our ſelues. This belongs to thoſe that are ſet ouer others, as Maſters their Seruants, Magiſtrates their Subiects, and Miniſters alſo their people, to cauſe them to come vnto the miniſtery of the Word.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That we tender thoſe that are weake, according to their weakeneſſe, ſupplying their wants; and therefore did theſe men bring the bed alſo. So did <hi>Iob</hi> relieue euery one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his want, Chap. 29.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.2.</p>
                     <p>Note here a contrary practice of a cruel wretch, namely, <hi>Saul,</hi>
                        <pb n="144" facs="tcp:3435:74"/>
who when <hi>Dauid</hi> would not ſpare him, but would haue him brought, bed and all, to be ſlaine: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.13. ſo that the charity of mercifull men cannot goe ſo farre, but the cruelty of wretches will goe as farre, or further.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That in good actions and indeauours which wee goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, wee ſuffer not obſtacles to hinder our proceeding. For no actions are without ſome: yea, God doth many times mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſome for the triall of our faith and conſtancy, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>. &amp;c. The diuell alſo through malice doth lay many blockes in our wayes, as 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.18. And this is the rather to be noted, becauſe of our proneneſſe to make excuſes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſpirituall matters, wherein wee are like the ſluggard in the <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> ſtill doubting of ſome danger. Herein <hi>Heſter,</hi> though otherwiſe a good woman, failed, fearing the Kings Edict: <hi>Heſt.</hi> 4.11. but <hi>Mordecay</hi> told her, that this ſcruple muſt not hinder her in ſo good a purpoſe, as the ſafety of the Iewes, verſ. 13.14.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When by ordinary meanes we cannot effect our deſire, then are we to vſe extraordinary, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did; 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21, 4, 6. whoſe example Chriſt doth alleage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.34. So where the Word is not preached in our Pariſhes, we may come to others. Alwaies prouided, that though the meanes bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall, yet they be lawfull. Wherein <hi>Rebecca</hi> failed, in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her ſonne a bleſſing, by teaching him to lye.</p>
                     <p>Now for a generall vſe of all, if we compare our backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in ſeeking the ſpirituall good of our friend with the care of theſe, in ſeeking the temporall good of this man, wee cannot but be aſhamed. Surely ſeeing there is a greater neceſſity of this ſpirituall care, then of the bodily, and that in ſeeking of this, we are more acceptable vnto Chriſt, then in the other, we ought to be ſtirred vp with greater care to tender the good of our brethrens ſoules.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we are to conſider the fruites of Faith, which are in this man the patient. His patience is ſet forth; firſt, that he ſuffered himſelfe to be brought out of his houſe, which a ſicke man eaſily doth not, to bee carried among the preſſe, to bee drawne vp, and to bee let downe; all which could not but
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3435:74"/>
worke great diſquiet vnto him: yet doth hee not repine, and ſay, If you were in my caſe, you would not bee thus and thus tumbled vp and downe. But ſeeing that his friends deſired his good, he willingly ſubmits himſelfe to them.</p>
                     <p>From whence wee may learne, how to carry our ſelues in time of ſickneſſe, to bee patient, to yeeld to our friends aduice, conſidering that they do it for our good, and alſo better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is fit for vs, then our ſelues. Now then how pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ought we to ſubmit our ſelues to thoſe, that ſeeke our good and conuerſion, though it be with ſome trouble to vs in our conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Wee come now to conſider their Faith, the ground of all theſe workes, expreſſed here, verſ. 5. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.20. [<hi>When hee ſaw their Faith.</hi>] Wherein three words are to be noted; <hi>Saw. Their. Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Faith makes all other workes to bee acceptable to Chriſt. He regarded not thoſe outward things theſe men did, but he ſaw their faith in them. The whole Chapter of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth to the Hebrewes, prooues, and eſpecially verſ. 6. For Faith is the roote of all ſanctifying graces: by it we are vnited vnto Chriſt, in whom being rooted and ingrafted, wee receiue from him life and grace, which ſhewes it ſelfe forth in vs by the fruites, as a tree receiuing ſap from the roote, ſends it forth into fruit: ſo that what comes not from Faith, hath no ſpirituall life in it, the roote whereby it is receiued, being wanting.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith is the hand whereby we receiue the gifts of God; as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. where receiuing and beleeuing are all one.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Of all other graces, God by Faith is moſt glorified: for by it alone we come vtterly to deny our ſelues, and to attribute all to the goodneſſe and grace of God. This ſhewes how farre the world is deceiued; firſt, Gentiles and Heathens that know not God, and ſo no good thing they doe can bee acceptable to him. Secondly, Papiſts, that thinke by workes to merit Gods fauour, which conceit doth indeed breed ſpirituall pride in mans heart making him moſt odious in Gods ſight.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Ignorant men that thinke their good meaning and intent makes the thing acceptable before God. Let vs then labour

                        </gap>kes, doing them, firſt, becauſe God hath commanded them: Secondly, in deniall of our ſelues, relying on Gods goodneſſe in Chriſt, to haue both them and our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons accepted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saw.</hi>] Chriſt ſaw their faith by his diuine power: but here eſpecially by thoſe great fruits whereby it appeared.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> The Faith which is acceptable to Chriſt, is a viſible Faith, which manifeſteth it ſelfe by the fruits, ſuch was the faith of thoſe Worthies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. appearing by ſome notable marke or other: <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.18. For Faith if it receiue ſap and grace from Chriſt, it will grow and bud forth; it is like fire, it cannot bee hid: and this is a marke diſtinguiſhing true faith from falſe: ſuch as is that of many carnall Goſpellers, who make an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion, but their fruits are none, they remaine meere worldly and carnall ſtill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Their.</hi>] That is, as the plurall number ſheweth, of the friends of this man: but yet in that hereupon hee turneth his ſpeech vnto the man, and ſaith, <hi>Thy ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> it is plaine that by this word <hi>Their,</hi> is meant the Faith of this ſicke man, as well as of his friends.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> The Faith, Prayer, and Charity of men are auaileable before God, not onely for themſelues, but for others alſo. Here then let vs ſee how they are auaileable, how farre not.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Faith of one man is auaileable for another, as firſt, the faith of the Parents is a meanes to giue their children a right to the Couenant of God. So are they called holy, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. becauſe of their beleeuing parents.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Faith of one may be a meanes to bring another to repentance and grace. So are our prayers auaileable for the Iewes, as were theirs alſo for the Gentiles in times paſt. So may our prayers profit particular perſons, by mouing God to worke Faith and repentance in them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to obtaine temporall bleſſings: as <hi>Laban</hi> for <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.27. <hi>Potiphar</hi> for <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſake was bleſſed, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 39.5. and the whole world is bleſſed for the Churches ſake.</p>
                     <p>But it is no way auaileable for the obtaining of eternall life, and enioying the free grace and mercy of God in the remiſſion
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3435:75"/>
of ones ſinne, for this euery man muſt haue Faith of his owne, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                     <p>Hereby we ſee how God doth reſpect the Faith of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, accepting it not onely for themſelues, but for others alſo. And the vſe for vs, is to vſe this charitable meanes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of our brethren, the Lord giuing vs this encouragement to come for others, as well as our ſelues. Wherefore it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable practice of friends to deſire the prayers one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Now in that this mans friends did not alone intreate for him, but himſelfe alſo beleeued, ſo that his Faith ioyned with theirs, was effectuall for the curing of his bodily diſeaſe, and alſo the obtaining of remiſſion of ſinnes, we learne, that when the prayers of parties themſelues are ioyned with others, then they are truly effectuall. So the Apoſtle deſires the Romanes to ſtriue with him by prayers to God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> is for reproofe of thoſe that thinke they are ſafe, if others call vpon God for them, though themſelues neuer pray. This is not ſufficient. <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed for <hi>Iſmael, Gen.</hi> 17.18. but <hi>Iſmael</hi> prayed not with him, and therefore they benefited him not, verſ. 21. So did <hi>Samuel</hi> pray for <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.35. but <hi>Saul</hi> was careleſſe of himſelfe; and therefore God bids <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> ceaſe praying, Chap. 16.1. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14. Wee ought ſo as we deſire to obtaine temporall, or ſpirituall bleſſings by the prayers of others, to ioyne alſo our prayers with theirs.</p>
                     <p>All this while wee heare of no petition, this poore man is brought before Chriſt, and there hee lyes, none ſpake a word for him, nor yet himſelfe for himſelfe. Neuertheleſſe doth Chriſt worke this great miracle on him.</p>
                     <p>Here note, firſt, Chriſt his readineſſe to grant vnto vs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and groanes of our hearts, when he knowes them before that we doe vtter them. <hi>Dauid</hi> did but thinke to confeſſe, and God forgaue, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.18, 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> For comfort of them, who through feare, griefe, or trouble of minde, are not able to expreſſe their deſire. 2. If God doe accept a deſire, how much more a faithfull prayer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:3435:76"/>Secondly, in the parties, note by their ſilence, that they thought it ſufficient to make knowne vnto Chriſt this mans caſe, by laying him before him, without preſcribing how, or when to cure him. In like manner muſt we wait patiently on Chriſt, not appointing him the time, place, or meanes of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So much for the occaſion of this Miracle.</p>

in time whileſt he was preaching, &amp; ſo ſeemed to interrupt him: yet ſeeing his ſincere and faithfull heart, he doth not reproue him, but receiueth him, with great kindeneſſe and compaſſion.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt doth account all faithfull men his ſonnes and children. Where <hi>Diues</hi> in Hell is called Sonne, it is ironically ſpoken, and by way of vpbraiding; <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25. as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy gueſt is called Friend; <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.12. The vſe is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13.</p>
                     <p>The exhortation is ſet downe by <hi>Matthew</hi> chap. 9.2. Bee of good cheere. And it is oppoſed to a kinde of feare and doubt, that was in this man; by reaſon of his ſinnes: though he had Faith, yet it was not without doubting; Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing his caſe, applies a fit remedie for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt doth not reiect a weake faith, which ought to be a great incouragement vnto vs, if ſo be that we can finde in our ſelues any euidence of the beginning of true Grace.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vſe</hi> Is to teach vs how to carry our ſelues towards thoſe that are ſicke, to applie remedies according to their wants; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if they be afflicted in minde, then to yeeld vnto them all the comforts we can; <hi>Prou.</hi> 18.14.</p>
                     <p>The third part of Conſolation is the Abſolution, where we may note that Aſſurance of the remiſſion of ſinnes is a moſt ſoueraigne ground of comfort.</p>
                     <p>For our ſinnes being forgiuen, all things turne to our Good. It being ſinnes alone, that makes vs miſerable. Secondly, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3435:77"/>
the difference of Chriſt his manner of pronouncing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſinnes from that both of extraordinary Miniſters; as Prophets, and Apoſtles, and of ordinary Miniſters, ss alſo of Priuate Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt being God and Man, the Mediator of Mankinde, hath purchaſed by his death remiſſion of ſinnes: ſo that hee can pronounce abſolution of them, in his owne Name, and not only pronounce it, but alſo actually giue remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>Prophets and Apoſtles did pronounce it in Chriſts Name, &amp;c. thhat conditionally, vpon condition of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, alſo they could by inſpiration, know whether a mans ſinnes were forgiuen or not.</p>
                     <p>Ordinary Miniſters, are Gods Embaſſadors; and in Chriſts ſtead, by vertue of this Office and Function, in which they are placed for the comfort of diſtreſſed ſoules; vnto whom, vpon condition of faith and repentance, they may pronounce abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                     <p>Priuate Chriſtians can doe no more, but tell their brethren of the promiſes of God, and comfort them with the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Scripture, but to pronounce abſolution of ſinnes, is not in their, but the Miniſters authoritie, and commiſſion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We may here note, how Chriſt ſhewes himſelfe to be a faithfull Phyſition, in that he ſtrikes at the roote, and firſt takes away the cauſe of the diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> his ſinnes. The like courſe is to be vſed with ſicke perſons, to labour firſt to bring them to a ſight of their ſinnes, and repentance for them, and ſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply remedies for their diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Chriſt obſeruing the faith of this man, doth preſently pronounce remiſſion of ſinnes. Where note that remiſſion of ſinnes ariſeth from the free mercy of God, without any workes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The mans friends came only for the curing of his bodily diſeaſe, and Chriſt beſtowes on him a greater benefit, hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giues him his ſinnes. Hence wee learne that Chriſt doth giue greater and better things to thoſe that come to him in Faith, then themſelues doe deſire. <hi>So Iacob deſired but food and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell,

                     <p>Parties oppoſing weare Scribes and Phariſes, of whom we heard before that they were accounted learned expoſitors of the Law. Whence we obſerue, that learning not ſanctified, makes men to bee the greater enemies to the Truth, of God. The people wee ſee did glorifie God, it was the Scribes and Phariſes, that cauilled againſt Chriſt preaching. So <hi>Ier.</hi> 26.11. Heretikes haue beene alwaies learned men. And among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3435:78"/>
the Ieſuites are moſt learned.</p>
                     <p>For learning ſeparated from grace, puffeth vp, and maketh men ſelfe-conceited. So that they ſet all their wit and learning to diſgrace, and defame others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> Is for Schollers, to pray God to Sanctifie their learning, vnto them. Alſo that the people, who from the vniuerſities, doe receiue Miniſters; doe pray for them, that God would ſanctifie and ſeaſon their learning with his Grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Manner</hi> of oppoſing was that this conceit was but yet in their hearts, they vttered it not, they did not fret, fume, and depart away, diſdaining to heare ſuch blaſphemie, but they ſit ſtill, and carry a ſmooth face, minding to watch their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Hypocrites do then deuiſe greateſt miſchiefe in their hearts, when they carry faireſt faces. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.1, 3. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 33.31. <hi>Iudas</hi> carried ſo fare a face, that none of the Diſciples ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of treacherie, euery one was more affraid of himſelfe; <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.22.25.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> To teach vs to bee wiſe as Serpents, not to truſt men vpon ſhew and outward appearance, when they come to heare the Word, and are attentiue vnto it. Chriſt did it not. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.24. For he ſaw that they had hollow hearts. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.26.</p>
                     <p>The matter they lay to his charge is Blaſphemie; now to Blaſpheme, is to impeach the name and credit of any: and is attributed to man. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Iud. verſe</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>But the common vſe hath more principally attributed it to God: and ſo it is taken in double reſpect. Firſt, when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things derogatorie to the diuine Maieſtie, is attributed to him: and then ſome word is added, as blaſphemes God, the Name of God, &amp;c. <hi>Reue.</hi> 16.9.11. Secondly, when ſome thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God is attributed to man, and then it is ſaid ſimply, he blaſphemed; <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.65. This ſinne was puniſhable by death. This great offence they lay to his charge, the more to bring him in danger, and ſee how they aggrauate it as appeares by their diuers queſtions, ſet downe by the Euangeliſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Malice doth make men aggrauate euery thing to the vtmoſt, as <hi>Korah. Numb.</hi> 16.3. the Princes conſpiring againſt

                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> To teach vs that if we liue among malicious men, wee carry our ſelues wiſely, and warily, ſo that wee may iuſtifie whatſoeuer we doe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ground</hi> and reaſon of their oppoſition, is in theſe words, [<hi>who can forgiue ſinnes, but God only.</hi> Where firſt in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall note, that nothing can be ſo comfortably ſpoken, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious enemies will peruert it to the contrary. Chriſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this man, by pronouncing forgiueneſſe of ſinnes to him; they impute this to Chriſt, as a matter of blaſphemie: becauſe there is ſuch men, a ſatanicall ſpirit, which like poyſon, turneth the ſweeteſt things into venome.</p>
                     <p>More particularly in the reaſon of this their Cauill, we may ſee that the ground is true and good, but their fault is in the application. It is true.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That, that which properly belongeth to God, cannot be attributed to man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, is proper to God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That man, cannot forgiue ſinnes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That Chriſt in taking this power to him, tooke that which belonged to God. All theſe, the reaſon truly implies. Yet neuertheleſſe, the concluſion which they draw from hence that Chriſt Blaſphemeth, is falſe, and blaſphemous.</p>
                     <p>In which points, our aduerſaries the Papiſts, goe beyond theſe Phariſes, who attribute the power of binding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience proper only to God, to mans alſo; who beſides Chriſt, giues vnto the Pope, and other, power to forgiue ſinnes and the like.</p>
                     <p>In this reaſoning of the Scribes and Phariſes, we may note two faultes of them. Firſt, that without further inquiring they did raſhly accuſe Chriſt of Blaſphemie, vpon that ſpeech; they might haue interpreted it as ſpoken prophetically. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in that they did not ſee that he had power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to doe that which he did. They did wilfully winke at all thoſe euidences, and teſtimonies of his diuine power, which were manifeſted among them, and were eſpecially knowne to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3435:79"/>
ſuch learned men as they, the ſignes of his birth; his diſputing with them, his miracles and the like; by which many others were conuerted. And therefore Chriſt bids them take heed, leſt they ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, by denying ſo plaine a truth.</p>
                     <p>So that we ſee that theſe Scribes and Phariſes, thinking to accuſe Chriſt of Blaſphemie, doe themſelues Blaſpheme, in denying vnto God that which doth belong vnto him; <hi>viz.</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to forgiue ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>So dealt the Papiſts in accuſing our Doctrine, as a Doctrine of libertie, when none is more licentious, then their owne, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe,</hi> Is not therefore to diſlike the Scripture, accounting it with the Papiſts a leaden rule; but to trie the conſequences drawne from thence, and to labour that on this foundation we build Gold, not Stubble, Hay, and Straw. So much for the Oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>Wee are now come to Chriſt his <hi>Apologie,</hi> where before wee handle the Defence; wee haue to conſider how Chriſt knew of this their Cauilling.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt knowes the very ſecrets of mens hearts, bee they enemies or friends; as of his Diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:3435:79"/>The <hi>Reaſon</hi> is here added by <hi>Marke,</hi> hee perceiued their thoughts in his Spirit, by his Diuine Power and Godhead; 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8.39. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.24. And herein is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and the Prophets, who knew many times the thoughts of men, but it was by reuelation, and inſpiration; 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.27.</p>
                     <p>This was another euidence againſt the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to conuince them, that the thoughts of their hearts, ſhould thus be knowne to Chriſt, no man telling him of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe,</hi> Firſt, for inſtruction, to haue a ſpeciall regard of our hearts, when we come before Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for Conſolation in regard of enemies, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they imagine againſt the Church, ſhall not hurt vs, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt knoweth all their deuices, and will preuent them; 2. <hi>King.</hi> 6.12.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in regard of our ſelues, that though men ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke vs, and regard not that ſeruice which wee performe to God; yea, nickename vs for it: yet Chriſt which knoweth the heart willl reward vs. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.6.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Apologie</hi> is firſt a reproofe; Chriſt reprooues them: <hi>Why reaſon ye theſe euill things in your hearts?</hi> So that mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſlanderers are to haue their faults plainely reproued. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the <hi>Defence</hi> it ſelfe, where firſt, note in generall, in as much as Chriſt ſtands to that he hath deliuered, it being a truth, and denies it not, though his enemies had raiſed a ſlander vpon it; that, Truth is not to be denied for the cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of men, and their oppoſition againſt it; <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.5. wherein <hi>Peter</hi> halted verſe 11.12.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe Gods Truth is more pretious then Pearles, and no part of it is to be loſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In ſhrinking from the truth, we feare man more then God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, wee giue aduantage to the aduerſarie, and make him bold; and alſo we diſcourage the weake brethren.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In particular we ſee that the Phariſes and Scribes, oppoſed againſt him, that he had taken too much vpon him,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3435:80"/>
namely, a propertie of God to forgiue ſinnes. Chriſt denieth not that hee had taken this vnto him, but ſaith hee tooke no more vpon him, then hee had right and authoritie to doe; namely, to forgiue ſinnes in his owne Name: and that he hath this authoritie in a thing inuiſible, hee proueth by a viſible effect of his Diuine Power. The Phariſes reaſoned thus: He that is man and not God, cannot forgiue ſinnes. Chriſt is man, and not God: therefore Chriſt cannot forgiue ſinnes. Chriſt to the contrary proueth that he is God, and not man only; in that by his bare Word, hee could cure a man deſperately ſicke: wherefore being God, hee tooke vpon him no more then lawfully he might.</p>
                     <p>The Argument ſtandeth thus: Hee that hath an abſolute power ouer diſeaſes, he hath authoritie to forgiue ſinnes. But I, ſaith Chriſt, haue an abſolute command ouer diſeaſes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue authoritie to forgiue ſinnnes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Propoſition,</hi> is laid downe verſe 9. where both theſe effects, <hi>viz.</hi> forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and curing of a bodily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, are compared together, and ſhewed to be of like hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eaſineſſe, that it is of like power and authoritie, to doe the one, as the other; wherefore if they could not deny this outward viſible effect to be wrought by a Diuine Power, neither could they doubt of the other, though inuiſible. And for a further ſtrengthning of the argument, it is laid downe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatiuely, Chriſt referring it euen to his aduerſaries, to be Iudges, whether it were not ſo or no.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> But here a queſtion will be mooued, whether the curing of a bodily diſeaſe, and the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, bee equall; one as hard and as eaſie as the other: for as much as it ſeemeth that ſinnes of the ſoule are more hardly cured, then diſeaſes of the body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, theſe are compared not one with another, but in regard of humane power, becauſe both are aboue humane ſtraine; and neither can be done without diuine power. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly. Being compared with the Power of God, they are both alike; for in reſpect thereof, there is no difference of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe or hardneſſe; 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.6. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. Thirdly,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3435:80"/>
this is ſaid in regard of their earthly conceit and dull vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. For that a man but now ſo deſperately ſicke, ſhould on a ſudden be perfectly cured; this in their conceite ſeemed the greater worke. Fourthly, Sickneſſe is a fruite of ſinne, and he that can remooue the effect, can as eaſily remooue the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To ſay,</hi>] that is, ſo powerfully and effectually, to ſay that the thing ſhall be done.</p>

                     <p>For this end did Chriſt worke all his miracles, that in them we might ſee him to bee an Alm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For earthly we are, and beſt vnderſtand earthly things, by comparing whereof with ſpirituall things, wee come by little and little to vnderſtand them; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.12. and for this cauſe did God in former times giue ſignes vnto his people, his Seruants and Prophets; as to <hi>Moſes, Gedeon, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Vſe,</hi> Is for vs to helpe our ſelues by theſe outward meanes.

                     <p>Next followes the <hi>Application</hi> of this argument, which is laid downe by Inuerſion. The aſſumption. <hi>viz. [But I haue an abſolute command ouer diſeaſes</hi>] is laid downe verſ. 11. by an euident proofe of a deede done. The concluſion is verſ. 10. by an infallible inference from the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That ye might know, that the Sonne of Man, hath Power to forgiue ſinnes on Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:3435:81"/>We will handle them in order, as the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet them downe. In them we may obſerue the <hi>manner</hi> of curing this man; and firſt the <hi>end</hi> why.

                     <p>The <hi>end</hi> was that they might know hee had power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doctr.</hi> Chriſt had a further end in his micacles, then a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily good vnto thoſe that were cured. A higher myſterie is contained in them, namely that in curing of our bodies hee might ſhew himſelfe the Sauiour of our Soules, &amp;c. as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe,</hi> Is that we read not theſe miracles as bare hiſtoricall nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but that we conſider in them the Almightie power of Chriſt: otherwiſe we miſſe of the fruite and benefit of them, for the ſtrengthening of our Faith in him.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Chriſt labours to inſtruct thoſe that are contrary min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, his aduerſaries the Scribes and Phariſes that cauilled at his Preaching. He might haue reſted himſelfe in the approbation of his Heauenly Father, the teſtimonie of his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the witneſſe of his Diſciples that his Word and Doctrine was true, and in that former proofe of Diuine power which hee had giuen them, in diſcouering vnto them the thoughts of their hearts: neuertheleſſe ſeeing them thorow blindneſſe, and malice, not yet throughly inſtructed, hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by further proofe to ſhow them their error, and to bring them to knowledge of the truth. Thus he deales with them againe; <hi>Marke</hi> 3.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Conuincing them of error by many arguments: and generally wee may obſerue of Chriſt, that neither the dulneſſe of his hearers, their impious ſcoffing, nor their ſlanderous cauilling, did hinder him from ſtriuing to inſtruct them further; as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his dulneſſe. The ſcoffe

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="1">1. Here in generall, we ſee how ready Chriſt is to doe one good worke after another.

Here vpon to confirme their faith, he doth againe preach vnto them, and performe this great worke, in forgiuing the ſinnes of this Publican, as before hee had forgiuen the ſinnes of the palſie man. Thus God ſent an interpreter to the Eunuch, whileſt hee was conſcionable in the vſe of ſuch meanes, as God afforded him. And this did Chriſt promiſe to <hi>Nathaneel Ioh.</hi> 1.50.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The place is the <hi>Sea ſide,</hi> noted to ſhew that the place <hi>of the receite of Cuſtome, was nigh the Sea ſide.</hi> Where we may note againe, that which hath beene often obſerued vpon like occaſion, that Chriſt hauing the opportunitie to preach,

and yet himſelfe writing of himſelfe, ſpareth not to vſe this name, regarding more the glory of God, and the good of the Church by this his conuerſion, then his owne credit and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. So <hi>Dauid</hi> doth in the title of the 51 Pſalme. So <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. but when he ſpeaketh to the honour of himſelfe, he ſpeaketh in the third perſon, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. for it was not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, nor their owne honour they ſought for, but the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the grace of God.</p>
                     <p>This firſt ſhewes, by what Spirit they were guided, not of fleſh and blood, but by the Spirit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>od, of humilitie and meekeneſſe. The wicked indeed may acknowledge their faults themſelues, but they ſpeake not of them with ſhame, as doe thoſe men. This humble ſpirit in any man, is a ſigne and euidence of the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this makes for the truth of the Story, that the Writers thereof makes ſuch conſcience of the truth, when it doth tend to glory, that withall they let not to publiſh their owne blemiſhes. Now if a man will lye, he will do it to ſaue his owne credit and reputation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he is deſcribed by his Parentage; he is the ſonne of <hi>Alpheus</hi>; not he that was the Father of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> the Apoſtles, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.15, 16. but another, who whether they were of kinne, or no, it is not expreſt; onely this is noted, that theſe two <hi>Alpheus</hi> had ſonnes that were Diſciples. This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſhew the truth of the Story.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by his Office, <hi>Luke</hi> calleth him, chap. 5. verſ. 27.2 Publican, expreſly. Now Publicans were certaine Officers in the Romane Empire, which did gather vp the tribute that was to be paid, and ſuch gifts as were giuen. And becauſe the goods of the Empire were called <hi>Publica,</hi> hence came the name of Publicans; an office in it ſelfe lawfull: for <hi>Iohn,</hi> when the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans came vnto him, bid them not leaue their Calling as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, but deale honeſtly in it; <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.13. Yet were theſe Publicans vile perſons, and vilely accounted of; either becauſe they were ſo in the eſtimation of the Iewes, who accounting themſelues a free people, could not endure to be vnder tribute, and ſo hated thoſe that were gatherers of the tribute: or elſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3435:83"/>
becauſe of their owne miſ-demeanour, beeing grieuous ex-actors and oppreſſors of the people, for they did farme the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of the Empire, and ſo did extort from the people much aboue the due for their owne gaine: as may appeare, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.13. and by that of <hi>Zacheus, Luk.</hi> 19.8. ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.46, 47. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying thereby Publicans to be moſt grieuous ſinners, and in the cenſure of the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. whereby it appeares, that theſe Publicans were notorious wicked men, and odious to the people, and much more this man being a Iew, and ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his owne Countreymen.</p>
                     <p>We haue heard before in the calling of the other Diſciples, how it pleaſed Chriſt to chuſe meane men to be his Diſciples; and here we ſee he chuſeth for his Diſciple, a vile notorious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, that had a brand and marke aboue the reſt, which firſt ſhewes the freeneſſe of Gods grace; 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. and ſecondly, the aboundant riches of his grace, verſ. 14. of the firſt of <hi>Timothy,</hi> the firſt Chapter. 3. Chriſt did it to this end, that the Apoſtles, and other miniſters of grace, ſhould the more boldly and confidently offer grace to the moſt vile and wicked perſons, conſidering that euen amongſt them there was one as vile as any. Fourthly, to encourage all ſorts, how wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſoeuer, to yeeld vnto the grace of God offered vnto them, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> is, firſt, that we ſhould take notice of this grace of God, and obſerue what a great alteration it is able to make. This man, who before was counted amongſt the wicked, a moſt wicked perſon, is now eſteemed among the godly a holy man: he that was of a vile calling before, is now of a moſt glorious calling: before a moſt vile Publican, becauſe a Iew, now a a moſt glorious Apoſtle, becauſe alſo an Euangeliſt; for but two of the Apoſtles were Euangeliſts, <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Matthew:</hi> See the like, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11.6, 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that none ſhould deſpaire.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to teach vs to ſuppreſſe our cenſures concerning the latter end of any man.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that we thinke not the worſe of Miniſters, or of their Miniſtery, who in time haue been wicked liuers, ſwagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3435:84"/>
and the like: for it pleaſeth God euen amongſt ſuch, to call many vnto that Worke, pulling them out of the ſnares of the Diuell, that they may more pitty others, and apply the greater conſolations vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the place where hee was called, was the Receite of Cuſtome, either a houſe whither they brought their tribute, or a table where he ſate with his money-bookes of account, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> God calles man when he left thinkes of it. <hi>Matthew</hi> was now buſie about his trade and gettings, hee little thought of Chriſt. So <hi>Paul</hi> is called, whileſt he yet breathed out ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>To ſhew, that our conuerſion comes from the grace of God, that to him all glory may be giuen.</p>
                     <p>And this thing, if we apply to our owne ſelues, we ſhall find euer, that wee were conuerted when wee thought not of it; whereof this Hiſtory and the reſt are types, though not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the extraordinary manner.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the manner of calling: it was done by the onely word of Chriſt, <hi>Follow me.</hi> Which although it may ſignifie ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to leaue a former wicked courſe of life, and to turne to Chriſtianity, and ſo to follow Chriſt: yet here it ſignifieth more peculiarly to be with Chriſt, and to attend vpon him: for thus did Chriſt traine vp his Diſciples with him, the more to fit them to their great Calling.</p>
                     <p>Note heare how powerfull the voyce of Chriſt is; he ſaith only, <hi>Follow me,</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> leaueth all, and goeth after him.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, his obedience, hee left all that might bee an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance vnto him: he followes Chriſt without caſting any doubts and difficulties how he ſhould be prouided for, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vndergone the enuie of the people, and ſhould now incurre the diſpleaſure and hatred of the Phariſes, &amp;c. but preſently without any more adoe followes him. And this teacheth vs, when wee heare the voyce of Chriſt ſounding in our eares, and ſmiting our hearts, that we doe willingly and readily obey: but of theſe things more hath been ſpoken in handling the calling of the other Diſciples.</p>

his brothers wife.

                     <p>The euent was the danger of his life; which came firſt, from <hi>Herod</hi>: ſecondly, from <hi>Herodias</hi>: and was eſcaped by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> affection, firſt, towards <hi>Iohn,</hi> this hindred <hi>Herodias</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: 2. towards the people, this hindred his owne purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The party rebuking was <hi>Iohn,</hi> a publike Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſent of God, to preach Faith in the remiſſion of repentance and conuerſion from ſinnes.

The action is a Reſiſtance, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, the Diuell. Firſt, of the obiect. By the Diuell here is meant all ſinnes and temptations ariſing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their from that corruption that is in vs, and ſo from our ſelues; or elſe ſpringing from external obiects, and ſuch motions as are by the Diuell immediately ſuggeſted vnto vs. All which are termed by the name of Diuell, becauſe he hath the chiefe hand in theſe matters, and is a principall agent therein. The action of reſiſtance is that, whereby a ſpirituall ſouldier of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus doth ſtriue and endeauour according to that meaſure of grace that is giuen him to auoide all ſinnes whatſoeuer, and to pleaſe God in all things, not to offend him in any. This action thus explained in generall, reſpecting the whole courſe of mans life: let vs conſider it therefore in a more particular regard, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we are to put it in practice at ſeuerall combats, with ſeuerall temptations.</p>
                     <p>For the better performance of it, we are to conſider three things: firſt, our preparation before the combate. Secondly, our behauiour in the very time of the aſſault. Thirdly, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour when the fight is ended. For the firſt, it is needfull
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3435:86"/>
that we be armed for our defence; the parts of which ſpirituall armour, we may ſee affoorded vnto vs out of the <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. The firſt peece, is to haue our loynes girt about with verity: that is, an heart firmely grounded and eſtabliſhed in the truth, in certainty of Gods pure worſhip and Religion, that we be not carried about with euery blaſt of outſide doctrine. The ſecond, is the Breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe; that is, a ſtedfaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the heart, to be vpright, righteous, and holy before God in all things, not will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng to offend him in the leaſt: as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I haue deſired to doe thy good will, O my God; yea, thy Law is within mine heart.</hi> The next part, is to haue our feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpell of peace: which is an vndaunted and ready minde to make a conſtant profeſſion of the Goſpell in all places, and at all times, though it bee to loſſe of lands, goods, liuing, yea, life: as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> wiſheth vs, to put on our Sandals, and to be ready to giue an account of our Faith to euery one that ſhall require it of vs. The fourth is the Shield of Faith; which is a liuely and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt perſwaſion and aſſurance of the mercie of God in Ieſus Chriſt, particularly belonging vnto vs; the force of which, is to quench all the fiery darts of the Diuell; that is, all ſtrong, all ſudden, and all dangerous temptations by him ſuggeſted. A fift, is the Helmet of ſaluation, which, as it is 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. is the hope of euerlaſting life, whereby our heads being couered, may be preſerued from doubt and deſpaire. Another is the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God: the vſe of which is, that we ought to labour to bee furniſhed with ſuch pregnant places of Scripture, as whereby we may both defend our ſelues, and offend Satan, according as Chriſt did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. The laſt is Prayer, whereby we muſt intreate the ayde and aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, to ſtrengthen vs to the combate. Our behauiour in the combate ought to be guided by theſe rules:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, entertaine not with any liking the firſt motions to ſin, but reſiſt the primary beginning, intiſements, and occaſions to them, and ſuffer them not to haue a place of abode in heart and affection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the nature of ſinne, which being not at the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3435:86"/>
firſt, repelled quickly gets ground of vs. By the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who firſt was idle, then looked; the temptation left him not there, but then hee luſted, and afterwards committed actuall folly: 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. So <hi>Peter,</hi> firſt, he denied barely; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, then he ſware it; thirdly, he curſed and denied: <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> 26.70, 72, 74.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe the Diuell as he is ſtrong, ſo is he ſubtile: giue him an Inch, and he will take an Ell. Giue him but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to ſet foote into your heart, and you ſhall hardly chuſe but he will poſſeſſe it wholly.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, put not too much truſt and confidence in our owne ſtrength, but rather to be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10. This confident boldneſſe, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on our owne ability, cauſed <hi>Peters</hi> fall, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.33.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we muſt not beleeue the Diuell, nor hearken to his perſwaſion and reaſons; nay, nor truſt him, though hee ſpake truth. So when the Diuell tooke on him to be a Preacher, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.16, 17, 18. <hi>Paul</hi> would not ſuffer him to ſpeake, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him forth. So Chriſt rebuked the Diuell, <hi>Luk</hi> 4.34, 35. <hi>Eue</hi> ſinned by being credulous, in beleeuing the Diuell when he vttered a loud lye, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, wee muſt conſider what profit a ſtout reſiſtance doth bring <hi>viz.</hi> that the Diuell will bee the weaker, the more foiles he receiues, and we the ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, take heed that we compare not the pleaſures of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and yeelding to the temptation, with the paine of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for then ſoone ſhall wee faile: but rather compare the paine of reſiſtance with the horrors, anguiſh, and perplexitie of an euill conſcience, which follow the committing of any ſinne, and ſee whether is rather to be vndergone. The burden of an euill conſcience. <hi>Salomon (Prou.</hi> 18.14.) deſcribeth, ſaying, <hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtaine his infirmity, but a wounded ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>irit who can beare it?</hi> After the combate ended, if thou obtaine the victory, firſt, giue God the glory and prayſe, not aſcribing it to any ſtrength, or worthineſſe in thy ſelfe; take heed of this pride. Secondly, auoide ſecuritie, and thinke not when thou haſt ouercome one, then thou haſt vanquiſht all; but know,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3435:87"/>
that one temptation, like waues, come one in the necke of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore prouide thy ſelfe for a new aſſault. If thou be ouercome, thinke with thy ſelfe, that, it may bee, God hath let you fall, thereby to puniſh ſome ſinne in thee. Secondly, lye not in ſinne, but endeauour to renew thy ſelfe by repentance, knowing that it is as great, if not a greater victorie, to recouer being fallen, then to auoide a fall.</p>

                     <p>It was a Sacrament in two reſpects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To put man in minde of his preſent [<hi>immortall</hi>] eſtate, by vertue of his creation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To giue him notice of his future eſtate. which ſhould be according as he vſed or abuſed this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Tree of Knowledge,</hi> did aſſure him, that if he did tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, he ſhould die the death.</p>
                     <p>Why it was called <hi>the Tree of Life,</hi> there is ſome doubt. Some ſaid that it had vigor in it, to preſerue the life in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitie, and immortalitie. But it ſeemes to be otherwiſe: for firſt immortalitie was properly giuen to man in his creation, why then ſhould we giue it to the <hi>Tree of life?</hi> Secondly, then it muſt either haue kept him from ſin, or haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, whether he had ſinned or no; both are falſe. And to the obiections, which may ſeeme to confirme that opinion, as firſt out of chapter 3.22. <hi>Leaſt man ſhould put forth his hands &amp;c.</hi>] Wee anſwere that it is taken Ironically, to lay forth mans conceit plainely.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to ſhew that he was not worthie of the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> life, becauſe he was vnworthie of the ſigne. Thirdly,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3435:88"/>
to ſhew that the ſigne doth not belong to them, who haue no right and title to the thing ſignified. For now <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fe eternall, whereof this was a ſigne. Then the ſafeſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that this <hi>Tree,</hi> was called the <hi>Tree of life,</hi> becauſe it was ordained of God a ſigne and pledge of life eternall, ſo long as man remained obedient.</p>
                     <p>So that other tree was a ſigne and ſeale of that wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> a like reſemblance of the ſame thing [<hi>ſometime.</hi>] For we are not to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3435:89"/>
vnderſtand this, as a ſubordinate Sacrament, or as a Figure of Baptiſme, for then it followes. Firſt, that a Sacrament may be a ſigne of a Sacrament. Secondly, that ſomething ſhould bee repreſented to <hi>Noah,</hi> which he knew not of, for Baptiſme was inſtituted long after.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What kinde of Sacrament this was; It is firſt, the firſt Sacrament which we reade recorded in Scripture, giuen to the Church, [<hi>after the fall of man.</hi>] Sacrifices there were as wee reade of <hi>Abell</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> which were alſo in a manner as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, becauſe both repreſented Chriſt, and God by that meanes did vphold their faith in expectation of him. But now the Church hauing a long time waited for the accompliſhment of the promiſes, and accounting them to bee now the further of, that they might ſay as it is, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 4. It ſtood in more need to be ſupported in faith and hope, and ſo God ordained firſt extraordinarie Sacraments, and then ordinary to continue till Chriſts comming.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This was an extraordinary Sacrament; ſuch as were thoſe that were either done but once, or did continue but a ſhort time; as the <hi>Red Sea, Manna, &amp;c.</hi> Now it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in two reſpects. Firſt, becauſe it was wrought by a miraculous power of God. Secondly, becauſe it was wrought vpon an extraordinary occaſion: yet neuertheleſſe, though for the Act it was but once for the vſe, it is continuall to the Church of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In what reſpect it is ſaid to be a Sacrament; and theſe are; Firſt, in generall, becauſe it repreſents vnto, and aſſures the Church of God of their deliuerance from the wrath of God, by which all the world beſides periſhed; Secondly, particularly; Firſt, becauſe it did prefigure the killing of the old man, and quickening of the new, and preſeruation of it vnto life eternall. In that the wicked World periſhed, and righteous <hi>Noah</hi> was preſerued aliue: the which thing is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to Baptiſme <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>initio.</hi> Secondly, becauſe that as ſafetie was brought to <hi>Noah,</hi> by meanes of the Arke: ſo ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not to be had, but only by Chriſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe as the Arke could not ſaue <hi>Noah,</hi> vnleſſe hee

were in it; ſo likewiſe muſt wee bee in, and of the Church: whereof the Arke was a figure, it repreſenting Chriſt, not as a particular perſon, but as a myſticall body, ioyned with his Church. Other reſemblances their might be made, as; Firſt, that in the Arke were few, ſo they are but few that ioy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e themſelues to the Church, and repoſe confidence in Chriſt. Secondly, that as of thoſe that were in the Arke, one was a curſed <hi>Cham.</hi> So in the Church there are many Hypocrites: but thoſe before alleaged, are the maine and principall points.</p>
                     <p>The inſtructions that ariſe out of this place are; Firſt, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, to ſhew vnto vs, that this Hyſtory is analogicall; it hath not only an hyſtoricall, but alſo a myſticall and ſpirituall ſenſe. Neither yet will it follow, that one place may haue two ſenſes; for theſe are but two parts of one entire and full ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may a man know when their is a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, beſides the hyſtory?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This we may know; Firſt, by a diligent obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the circumſtances. As the Apoſtle doth prooue by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.7. that what the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7. muſt be vnderſtood of the ſpirituall reſt. So <hi>Act.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Peter</hi> prooues <hi>Dauids</hi> ſpeech to be meant of Chriſt; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by comparing one place with another, the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the New: as that <hi>of the Red Sea.</hi> By 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. That in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.36. thence we muſt learne diligently to marke the Scriptures, to obſerue the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but eſpecially thoſe applications that the Holy Ghoſt maketh, becauſe this is the ſureſt way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That God doth performe a double benefit to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by temporall preſeruation. Firſt, ſafety from temporall danger. Secondly, aſſurance of deliuerance and redemption from ſinne; which as it ſhewes the tender care of God ouer vs, ſo it teacheth in all temporall preſeruations, to haue an eye to him, in regard of our ſoules, for if God be mercifull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue our bodies, how much more our ſoules; and though all temporall deliuerances are not Seales and Sacraments of this yet this vſe may we well make of them. But withall as <hi>Noah</hi>
                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:3435:90"/>
did, ſo muſt we.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Beleeue Gods promiſes, and apply them to our ſelues.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And alſo yeeld our ſelues to the direction of his Word, in regard of the meanes to accompliſh the ſame; which is a maine and principall vſe of this ſtory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence obſerue, that thoſe things which worke deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the wicked, are a meanes of preſeruation to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as was <hi>the Red Sea.</hi> The Angell that went behinde the Iſraelites campe.

For as a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhewed to the faithfull, ſhall be no aduantage to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſo a iudgement lighting on the wicked, ſhall be no damage to the godly, I meane in regard of that which is indeed, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpirituall hurt, or ſpirituall bleſſings.</p>

                     <p>The former is taken from Souldiers, that buckle their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour together with their girdle; as God bid <hi>Iob</hi> gird vp his loines, when he would haue him ſtand to his defence, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for himſelfe; <hi>Iob</hi> 38.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 40.2. in the like ſence; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 6.14. and this ſence is not here meant, for God would not that they ſhould prepare themſelues to fight with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the better vnderſtanding of the latter ſence, wee are to know, that in thoſe Eaſterne countries, they went with long ſide gownes hanging downe to their legges, which were an impediment in trauelling, if they were not truſſed vp. And

therefore they being now to take a long iourney, God bids them truſſe vp their gownes to their girdles; in this ſence are 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.46. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.1.</p>
                     <p>The myſterie is, that wee ſuffer not any thing to hinder vs in our courſe and worke that we goe about; this is not meant of ſuch things that are vnlawfull and wicked, but of thoſe that be lawfull, good, and as needfull as our apparrell, that if we obſerue any hinderance to proceede from them in our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſe, to be carefull to remooue it, which as it is meant; <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12 35. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. So without a metaphor it is plainely expreſſed; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.</p>
                     <p>For it is a point of wiſedome, when wee aime at any thing to remooue all impediments, or elſe we venture the loſſe of the thing we aime at.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe,</hi> That when lawfull things doe become hinderances, as they doe many times by our immoderate vſe of them, our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon them, or preferring of them to other better things; <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wee doe take them away, and abridge our ſelues of them; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For reproofe of thoſe that care not what burden they lay vpon their backes, how many offices they get, how much lands and liuings they heape vp, what pleaſures, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they follow, though in the meane time they be by theſe things hindred from attending vnto better duties, to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſeruice of God.</p>

                     <p>Myſterie is, that for the furtherance we may vſe all lawfull helpes.

of peace, ſo that albeit the way which we muſt go through be rough and thorny, that is, full of afflictions, yet ſhod and furniſhed with the comforts of the Goſpell, wee may goe on boldly without feare of pricking.</p>

                     <p>And it reprooues thoſe that are bold and preſumptuous of their owne ſtrength and abilitie, and refuſe the meanes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereby many times they fall away.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>And yee ſhall eate it in haſte.</hi>] This is the laſt ceremony, and it is laid downe as a reaſon of the former. And the reaſon of this reaſon is expreſſed, verſ. 33. For God intending to bring that great iudgement on the Egyptians; and foreſeeing how the Egyptians would thereupon deale with the Iſraelites, by forcing them to bee gone vpon the ſudden, hee doth thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, that they ſhould be all in readineſſe to depart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> God is carefull to prouide helpe for his people, when they are in any ſtreights. When the World was on the ſudden to be drowned, he cauſed <hi>Noah</hi> to make an Arke before hand to ſaue himſelf. When the Children of Iſrael trauailed through the Wilderneſſe, and were to depart from euery place on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at the riſing of the Cloud and Pillar of fire, God cauſed them to dwell in tents, and not to build houſes. So that euery way he doth fit and prepare his people to thoſe ſtates that hee meanes to bring them. For he that fore-warned, is fore-armed; and troubles that come on a ſudden, make men at their wits end, and cauſe many diſtractions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> is, to be carefull in vſing the meanes that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for our good, as becauſe the comming of the Sonne of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3435:93"/>
man is ſudden, to watch; becauſe as death leaues vs, ſo iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will find vs, and the houre thereof vncertaine, it teacheth to be alwaies prepared for death. Thus though they come on a ſudden, they ſhall not be ſudden to vs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The myſtery hereof is, that in this world we haue no place of abode, but muſt alwayes be, as ſtill going out of it. A point manifeſt by the line of the Patriarkes, by the Children of Iſrael in the Wilderneſſe liuing in tents: See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9, 10. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. Wee muſt therefore make haſte, and vſe the things of this world in haſte, becauſe wee haue a long iourney to goe, and know not how much time wee haue thereunto. To this end let vs learne, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. and be as the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. where the metaphor is taken from runners, that looke not vnto that which they haue runne, but how farre they haue to runne yet vnto the marke.</p>
                     <p>This haſte is to bee made, firſt, for feare of hurt that may come by abiding. Thus the Angels haſtened <hi>Lot</hi> out of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, leſt he did partake of their puniſhments. So muſt wee haſte, becauſe of temptations of that body of death wee carry about, of ſnares, allurement and diſgraces, &amp;c. whereby we are drawne to forſake the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the expectation of a benefit cauſeth men to make haſte; the benefit that commeth to vs, is freedome from ſinne, eternall glory, and the enioying of all good, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Some adde vnto theſe a third right, namely, that they did eate it ſtanding. Where of albeit there be ſome probability, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the former circumſtances (which neuertheleſſe might be all done ſitting after their vſuall manner) yet it is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe, and ſo no inference can be drawne from it, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>refore the beſt manner of geſture to eate the Lords Supper is ſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Now in generall concerning all theſe forenamed Rites, we may obſerue this property; that ſome of them were onely peculiar to this Paſſeouer, and to no other: as firſt, that the Lambe ſhould be kept foure dayes, verſ. 3.6. Secondly, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they had to chuſe a Lambe, or a Kid. Thirdly, the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the blood vpon the doore-poſts. Fourthly, all thoſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3435:93"/>
next before mentioned, of eating it with their loynes girded, &amp;c. Fifthly, the not going out of the houſe vntill the morning. Theſe Rites were then commanded and vſed, in regard of the preſent circumſtances and occaſions, but were neuer in vſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And this may appeare in that, at the ſecond inſtitution of the Paſſeouer, when it was ordained to an anniuerſary rite, they are not repeated, nor yet were performed by Chriſt, when he did abrogate the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And this we may obſerue, that there may be rites in the firſt inſtitution of ordinances, which are not of perpetuall vſe. So in this Paſſeouer they were to keepe their houſes, and to ſprinkle the blood onely at this time, becauſe at this time onely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer was to paſſe by: and likewiſe to eate it in ſuch haſte, becauſe now onely they were to bee gone out of Egypt on a ſudden. So in the Lords Supper, Chriſt vſed vnleauened bread, becauſe at that time there was no leauened bread to be eaten: alſo he celebrated it at euening, becauſe it was immediately to ſucceede the Paſſeouer, which was eaten at Euen. So hee ſate at the Lords Supper, hauing ſate before after the faſhion of the Countrey at the Paſſeouer.</p>
                     <p>A rule to know when ſuch rites are occaſionall, as if they be not expreſſed in the words of the inſtitution of the ordinances. Seeing therefore the geſture of ſitting, is neither by the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, nor Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> repeating the inſtitution, expreſſely ſet downe, wee are herein to ſubmit our ſelues to the orders ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Church.</p>

God making choice of this time, that euen the time might ſtirre vp their hearts, and encourage them to hope for a deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Alſo it was a type of Chriſt, whoſe comming brought with it the Spring of grace, of knowledge and illumination, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> Here a queſtion may be moued, whether they were ſtrictly bound to obſerue alwaies this time, and no other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this we anſwer in generall, that they were not ſo ſtrictly tied vnto this time, as that vpon no occaſion it might be altered. This appeares by that ſtory which is recorded, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. verſ. 6. to 14.</p>
                     <p>Out of which we may note theſe points;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that God requires not impoſſibilities of his children, but doth diſpenſe euen with his owne ordinances in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3435:94"/>
as here in caſe of legall vncleaneneſſe, by burying a dead man, God gaue them liberty to alter the time vnto another moneth. So in the wilderneſſe was Circumciſion, becauſe of the vncertainty of their iourneyes; and ſo there may be many neceſſary occaſions to hinder a man from the Sacrament, and ſo I doubt not, but if a man that hath long lyen bed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed, ſhould haue a feruent deſire to receiue the Communion, the place might be altered, and it might be celebrated in a priuate houſe there being company ſufficient to make a Congregation, the like may be ſaid of Baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that it is better to forbeare for a time, then being vnprepared, to come to the Sacrament. Againſt this may bee obiected the example of thoſe that came vnpared to the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.17, 18. But wee anſwer, that God ſhewed his diſpleaſure at this, in that he plagued them, ver. 20. although at the prayer of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and their own repentance, no doubt he healed them. Alſo they had honeſt hearts, and did this in ignorance, wherefore hee paſſed by their infirmity. Now if there might bee Legall vncleanneſſe without ſinne: and yet thoſe that were thus vncleane, might not come to the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, much more ought wee that are indeed defiled with ſinne, abſtaine for a time, leſt being vnprepard, we make the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnfruitfull vnto vs, and an occaſion of bringing iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon vs, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that we doe not wittingly and willingly hinder our ſelues from the Table of the Lord. For theſe men were grieued, that they could not come, as appeares by their complaint to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which ſhewes they were neceſſarily hindred. And verſ. 13. wee ſee a great iudgement threatned againſt ſuch as might come, and did neglect it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it muſt be a matter of neceſſity that hinders vs, and not euery pretext that wee make vnto our ſelues. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe many will make themſelues vnfit, by continuing in malice and anger againſt others, by which meanes they continue ſtill in impenitency, and alſo ſhew their light eſteeme of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that if we be neceſſarily hindred at one time, wee
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3435:95"/>
labour to make it vp at another, hereby ſhewing our true deſire and religious care.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Concerning the continuance of the Paſſeouer, we are to note, firſt, how long it laſted at once for the celebration of it. Secondly, how long it laſted in the continuall ſucceſſion of it from yeere to yeere.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the former, it was celebrated ſeuen whole daies, verſ. 15. to the end that it being a great ordinance, a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of a great benefit, and a type of a greater, it might haue a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne celebration. Now it was kept ſeuen dayes, becauſe it was iuſt ſeuen dayes before their full deliuerance accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for the firſt day they came out of Egypt, and the ſeuenth, they paſſed ouer the Red Sea.</p>
                     <p>Here two queſtions may be asked:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, whether they might increaſe, or diminiſh the number of theſe dayes?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: they might not alter the dayes, to the end that the myſtery might be alwayes had in remembrance, and be an occaſion to declare vnto their children, when they ſhould aske them the reaſon of them, all the circumſtances of that deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                     <p>But in the 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.23. we reade that it was kept four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, they kept indeed a Feſtiuall ſeuen dayes ouer, but it was not the Paſſeouer. Secondly, if they did celebrate the Paſſeouer ſeuen daies longer, it was becauſe many were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane amongſt ſo many people, who could not goe home and come again the next moneth, and ſo they thought that it might be continued other ſeuen dayes, ſo that it was extraordinary: vpon that Law, <hi>Num.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. How theſe ſeuen dayes were celebrated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In generall all theſe ſeuen dayes were holy, <hi>Leu.</hi> 23.4.</p>
                     <p>2. But yet we muſt diſtinguiſh betweene the firſt and the laſt day, and the fiue middlemoſt. The fiue middle were holy in theſe reſpects:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe that rite of eating vnleauened bread was to be continued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:3435:95"/>Secondly, becauſe on all thoſe ſeuen dayes there were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſacrifices to be offered, proper to thoſe dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the continuall morning and euening ſacrifice, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.8. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.23.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe the people were to come together mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening to worſhip God, and to feaſt together in a holy reioycing in the Lord, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.43.</p>
                     <p>But the firſt and ſeuenth were in a peculiar manner, and more ſtrictly holy. Firſt, becauſe on theſe dayes there was an holy Aſſembly, verſ. 16. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.7, 8, <hi>Nvmb.</hi> 28.18, 25. What this holy Aſſembly was, ſee <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.2, 3, 5, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in regard that they were not to doe any ſeruile worke on theſe dayes, verſ. 16. to the end they might haue the more liberty to worſhip God, and not to be tyred and wearied with labour on the fiue dayes.</p>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>THe laſt thing to be conſidered, is the neceſſity of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Paſſeouer, and ſo conſequently of the Lords Supper, inſtituted in the roome thereof. That there was a neceſſary obſeruation of it, appeares in two reſpects: Firſt, becauſe it was expreſſely and ſimply commanded of the Lord, verſ. 14. Secondly, becauſe of the penalty laid vpon thoſe that ſhould wilfully neglect, or contemne it, verſ. 15. for although onely this particular Rite of vnleauened bread be here expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet by a Synecdoche wee muſt vnderſtand it of the whole Ordinance, ſo that the contempt or neglect is not onely of this rite, but of the whole Ordinance, as appeares by comparing this with <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.13.</p>
                     <p>That we may more diſtinctly ſee wherein this neceſſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, we are to conſider in generall; that a thing is then ſaid to be neceſſary, without which another thing cannot bee. Now this is vſed in two reſpects; firſt, for a thing that is abſolutely neceſſary, without which a thing cannot poſſibly be, ſo as are
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3435:96"/>
the cauſes of things ſaid to be neceſſary. Thus Chriſts death is abſolutely neceſſary for our ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is taken for that which is neceſſary by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for the better effecting, and more eaſie performance of a thing.</p>
                     <p>The Sacraments are neceſſary; not as cauſes, for then ſhould they giue grace and ſaluation. But they are neceſſary as a meanes of ſaluation, and that alſo not ſimply: for ſo is Faith the meanes, and this commeth by hearing of the Word, but in theſe two reſpects: firſt, becauſe God hath commanded them, they are his ordinances to trie our obedience; and ſo although we ſhould reape no benefit by them, yet were we to obſerue them. Secondly, in regard of our need, becauſe we are carnall, and are moſt moued with things obiected to our ſenſes, not ſo much apprehending ſpirituall myſteries, and therefore for the helpe of our vnderſtanding, and ſtrengthening of our Faith, God ordained the Sacraments, that ſo more particularly wee might apply Chriſt to our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>Therefore wee muſt diſtinguiſh betweene the outward ſignes, and the thing ſignified.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt is that which the Sacrament repreſents, now to feed on Chriſt, to celebrate this Paſſeouer (for ſo is he called) is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, without which no ſaluation, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.53. But as for the Elements and other Rites, they are neceſſary but in part, not as cauſes, nor as meanes ſimply, without which there were no partaking of Chriſt, but in regard of Gods command, and our better helpe.</p>
                     <p>In the Penalty obſerue, firſt, the Extent thereof; ſecondly, the Perſons againſt whom it is denounced.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Extent is in theſe words, [<hi>that perſon ſhall be cut off from Iſrael.</hi>] To take this in the largeſt extent, it ſetteth forth three things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that thoſe that offend againſt this charge, ſhall bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the communion and fellowſhip of the people of God, and ſo be accounted as Heathen men, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. laſt, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hereunto.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the taking of them cleane from the face of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3435:96"/>
earth, either ordinarily by the ſword of the Magiſtrate: for ſo this cutting off is taken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.14, 15. or extraordinarily by the hand of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, a depriuation of ſaluation and debarring from life eternall, a cutting off from hauing fellowſhip with the body of Chriſt hereafter, becauſe here they ſo little regarded the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his members; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.28.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The perſons againſt whom this iudgement is threatned, are plainely ſet downe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.10, 13. Where we ſee, that if vrgent cauſes did hinder any one, God in that caſe did diſpenſe with him, but if when he might conueniently keepe the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, and was not hindered by the prouidence of God, he did then neglect it, then was he liable to this puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>We ſee therefore that the Iewes were bound in conſcience to the obſeruation of the Paſſeouer, as they alſo did, verſ. 28. and in times ſucceeding, when they were growne careleſſe, or had forgotten the ordinances of God, we ſee that godly Kings conſidering the great neceſſity of it, had great care to reſtore it to its former obſeruation; as <hi>Ioſiah</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 30.</p>
                     <p>To apply this to our ſelues, ſeeing that there is as great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our Sacraments, as of theſe of the Iewes, as great a penalty denounced againſt the wilfull contemuers and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of ours, as of theirs, we haue as great need of theſe helpes as they, and as great benefit redounds to vs as to them, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that we are as ſtrictly bound vnto the obſeruation of the Sacraments as they were; and therefore we are not to think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it a matter arbitrary, and left at our choiſe, but to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to come, when God by his Miniſter doth inuite vs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Againe, as here is condemned all wilfull profanation, and contempt of the Sacraments, ſo likewiſe is reproued that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious conceit that many haue of the neceſſity of it, who if they be ſicke, will haue the Sacrament brought to them, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>GVile is a ſpirituall deceit, whereby a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues himſelfe before God in the matter of his ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>The kinds of it may bee reduced to foure heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Guile, in reſpect of Gods fauour when a man is deceiued by a falſe perſwaſion, that he is in the fauour and loue of God. This is done three wayes:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By compariſons; when a man compares himſelfe either with himſelfe, or with groſſe notorious ſinners that come farre behind him in goodnes, or with ciuil righteous men. As did the Phariſes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11, 12. ſuch are ſaid to bee aliue whithout the Law. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By reaſon of temporall bleſſings, which becauſe a man doth enioy plentifully, ſo he ſtraightway concludes, that he is beloued of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Laſtly, which is the moſt fearefull, when men being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with croſſes and calamities, doe hereupon gather, that God loueth them, ſaying, that they haue their puniſhment here, and ſo they ſhall eſcape hereafter; though in the meane time they neuer repent of their ſinnes, and leaue their wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for which end God did thus puniſh them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Guile and deceit of the heart in reſpect of Sinne; this is either before or after the committing of it.</p>
                     <p>Before the committing of a ſinne, a mans hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> deceiues and beguiles him foure wayes.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:3435:97"/>1. By perſwading him, it is but a ſmall veniall ſinne; ſo extenuating it, as a matter not much to be ſtood vpon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if the ſinne doe ſeeme great and vgly, then it labours to make him beleiue that God ſeeth it not, he takes no notice of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If this perſwaſion take no place, but that he thinke God will ſee it, then it ſuggeſteth vnto him that he will not puniſh him for it, he will paſſe by it, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If all this ſerue not the turne, then it perſwadeth him, that repentance may eaſily be had for it, that he will repent for it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dies, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After a ſinne committed, the guile is threefold.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A mans corrupt heart will endeuor to bring him to a loue and liking of that ſinne, and make it ſeeme pleaſant vnto him, that he may not repent for it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, or elſe to cauſe him to defend it by colourable ſhiftes and excuſes, that he may ſeeme to doe it lawfully.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if it doe begin to gripe him, and to pricke his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, then doth it labour to choke this griefe and ſorrow, and ſo to hinder ſound repentance, and that three wayes:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by merriment, when a man thinkes it but a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo gets him among merry companions to muſicke, and ſuch like, to driue it away.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if ſo it leaue him not, then hee performes ſome ſhort humiliation for faſhion ſake, without true ſorrow indeed, that ſo hereby hee may as it were, get himſelfe out of Gods hands.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by ſome ceremony or other; as when ſome coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous extortioner that gets his goods vnlawfully, and neuer thinkes of reſtitution, vpon his death bed, or before, will giue ſomewhat to build an Almeſ-houſe, and ſo make amends for all. This is but a ceremony as it were.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Guile, in reſpect of vertues and graces, when a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Firſt, when he perſwades himſelfe to be a true worſhipper of God, becauſe he frequents the places and exerciſes of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:3435:98"/>Secondly, to bee a true Chriſtian, becauſe he performes the outward duties of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, when hee beguiles himſelfe with the ſhadow of Faith and repentance, and all other particular graces, whereof there is no one but may be counterefited.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, guile in reſpect of the Word, and workes of the Spirit: for firſt, a man may haue, firſt, knowledge of the Word; ſecondly, aſſent vnto this knowledge; thirdly, a man may make profeſſion of it; fourthly, yea, he may ſtand for the defence of the truth thereof, and yet may he be beguiled with a falſe hope of his good eſtate; all things being wrought in him by that wonderfull power of God, whereby hee cauſeth euen the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngodly to giue teſtimony to the truth of his Word.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there may bee wrought in him, firſt, a kind of loue and ioy in the Word; ſecondly, a willingneſſe to heare it; thirdly, a reformation of ſome ſinnes and corruptions in the life and conuerſation (which is done by the reſtraining, and not ſanctifying Spirit,) as there was in <hi>Herod, Mark.</hi> 6.20. with diuers the like graces; and neuertheleſſe as <hi>Herod</hi> did, he may nouriſh ſome one boſome ſinne, and ſo be farre from the ſtate of ſound conuerſion.</p>
                     <p>Diuers other ſuch deceits there are, but theſe are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall: which things ſeeing they are ſo, and that the heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull aboue all things, yea, and who can know it?</p>
                     <p>Let vs labour and learne, firſt, to ſuſpect our hearts, and not truſt them too farre, but by due examination find out the wiles and ſubtilties thereof. Secondly, to get vs ſincere and vpright hearts.</p>

                     <p>Hence wee learne this inſtruction from this, in that the Apoſtle ſtayeth not in the general duties of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; but from thence deſcendeth to the particular offices of ſuch generall callings: that it is not ſufficient to performe the generall duties of Chriſtianity, vnleſſe we practiſe the ſeuerall duties of our particular vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Apoſtle heerein is as carefull to ſet downe the one as the other, and to the Coloſſians the like, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.5. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in his Epiſtle exhorts, and in the 2 <hi>Chap.</hi> ver. 15. of <hi>Titus,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhewes, that this is a thing that the Miniſters ought to teach the people, as is plain alſo in the 5 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, in which euery one, is ranked into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine degrees.</p>
                     <p>There are 4 conſiderations to ſtirre vs vp:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That thoſe ſeuerall places and callings wherein we are ſet, are appoynted of God, and that hee preſcribes the duties belonging vnto them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That the particular callings wherein wee are ſet, ſerue to make vp the comlineſſe of the Church of God, and the beauty of the body of Chriſt Ieſus: now wee diſturbe this comely order, when we either exalt or debaſe our ſelfe too much, or liue out of our callings.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Theſe are the bonds whereby wee are bound and knit one to another, and by which wee both doe much good, and reape much profit one of another, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16.</p>

                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1 That euery one doe obſerue that place wherein God hath ſet him: herein we muſt haue recourſe to the word, which ſhewes vs direction to walke in the ſame, <hi>Tit.</hi>

                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:3435:100"/>And wee may well ſay without breach of charity, that they who are not carefull to performe the duties of particular callings, are no good Chriſtians, whatſoeuer ſhew they make abroad: as an vnconſcionable Miniſter in his calling, cannot poſſibly be a good Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>2 Generall doctrine is, in that the Apoſtle doth make choice of thoſe callings that ſerue to build vp a family: all which in 3 ranks he reckoneth vp very acurately, and is very earneſt, copious and large in vrging the duties of them.</p>
                     <p>Hence wee learne, that the particular callings of a family are ſome of thoſe that belong to Chriſtians, and ſuch as in which wee ought to be diligent in ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The reaſon is, becauſe the family is the ſeminary of the Church and Commonwealth, &amp; as it were the Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiue, which heere and there ſendeth ſwarmes forth: So all men came firſt from the family of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi>; after the floud from the family of <hi>Noah</hi>: therefore great care is to be taken heerin, ſeeing in families all men are firſt trained vp, and ought ſo to be inſtructed, that they may be profitable members afterward of Church and Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>Therefore thoſe that haue no other calling but onely of a family, ought not to be diſcomforted and troubled in conſcience, as if they had no calling at all, becauſe they haue no publike calling; but they ought to k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fitly doth the Apoſtle beginne with the married couple: 1 Becauſe in the beginning of the world, this was the firſt, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were married and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. before either ſeruants or children were any.</p>

                        <hi>Therefore as, &amp;c.</hi>) This concluſion inferred vpon the former ground, ſheweth two things, 1 That there is as great reaſon that the wife ſhould ſubiect her ſelfe to her husband, as that the Church ſhould ſubmit her ſelfe to Chriſt. 2 That ſuch a ſubiection as the Church doth performe to Chriſt, ſuch ought the wife to performe to her husband; that it be done cheerefully, readily, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and ſo in other things agreeably.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> Why, but will ſome man ſay, is any man to be obeyed ſo as Chriſt is obeyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt reſtraine this and ſuch like genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to the point in queſtion; and then wee ſhall ſee the meaning to be this, that in euery thing, which doth belong to the husband by <hi>Vertue</hi> of his place, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, therein ought the wife to obey, euen as the Church obeyeth Chriſt. Like as it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. All things are lawfull for mee, that is, all things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: as alſo. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13.</p>
                     <p>Hence wee may learne two things. 1 That the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the husband is very ample and large. 2 That the wife muſt looke vnto all duties of obedience, and not onely to ſome, ſaying as ſome doe, I will obey my husband in theſe and theſe, but not in others.</p>
                     <p>More diſtinctly to ſpeake of them, we may conſider in theſe words, two parts. 1 The duty it ſelfe, and this,</p>

                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:3435:108"/>1 Wherein it conſiſteth, <hi>viz.</hi> In Subiection.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 How to be performed. The manner is threefold. 1 As to the Lord. 2 As the Church to Chriſt. 3 In eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The reaſon of this duty, taken from the authority and place, wherein God hath placed the man. The husband is the head, which is amplified by a ſimilitude betweene Chriſt and him.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Dutie</hi> is <hi>Subiection,</hi> which is a generall duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. For wee muſt thinke that this is not a iudgement onely, but alſo a commandement, as the iudgement vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> of eating his bread in the ſweat of his browes, was alſo a commandement that he ſhould not liue without a calling, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. And from this ground, the Apoſtles and Prophets haue raiſed this doctrine of the wiues ſubmiſsion, that wee ſtand not to recite all the places ſeuerally.</p>
                     <p>This word (<hi>ſubiect,</hi>) is of large extent, as the word honour is in the 5 Commandement. It implyeth two branches of duties. 1 That ſhe acknowledge and yeeld vnto her husband by reaſon of his place, the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of eminency, and ſuperiority aboue her ſelfe. 2 That accordingly ſhe reſpect him.</p>
                     <p>The firſt that is, That ſhe doe ſee and acknowledge a ſuperiority in her husband, is not only a maine duty, but alſo indeed the ground of all other. For how can the wife ſubiect her ſelfe willingly, if ſhee neuer acknowledge any preeminency, and authority ouer her in her husband? Well may ſhee yeeld a forced ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, euen as a conquered King may ſubmit himſelfe to the conquerour, though hee account him not his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, but in his heart deſpiſeth him, and ſeeketh op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of reuenge: but a willing and ready ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhe can neuer performe.</p>

                     <p>Wee ſee then, that ſubiection is a neceſſary duty to be performed by wiues: yea, of whatſoeuer ſtate or degree ſhee was before her marriage, yet muſt ſhe, though a Queen, &amp;c. but married to a meane ſubiect, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her marriage acknowledge her ſelfe inferiour to him, though for her Regiment and the like ſhe may be his ſuperiour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> Is firſt, to teach wiues, that they be diligent to learn this duty, &amp; for to attaine to the right knowledge, and acknowledging of their husbands prerogatiues.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To condemne ambitious and proud wiues, that will forſooth be not onely equall, but aboue their husbands: whence ariſe ſo many contentions in families.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond that is, Wiuely reſpect conſiſts in two things.</p>

                     <p>Reuerence is either inward or outward. Inward in the heart, when the wife doth eſteeme her husband in reſpect of his place, worthy of honour; which duty, in the laſt verſe of this 5. <hi>Chapter</hi> is called <hi>Feare.</hi> Not ſlauiſh and ſeruile, but ioyned with loue, when ſhe

                     <p>This is layd downe vnto vs, by the example of <hi>Sarah.</hi> For if wee compare, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. wee ſhall finde, that that which is ſet downe as her word, was onely the thought of her heart.</p>
                     <p>Now this duty is another ground of the good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all other duties; without this, they will be but fained, and hypocriticall: for as the former duty ſerued to informe the iudgement in a right apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſuperiority God hath layd on husbands; ſo this ſerues to rectifie the heart and affections, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and vnfainedly they may honour and reuerence them.</p>
                     <p>The want of this feare and reuerence, is the cauſe that we ſee many, who of others are much regarded and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored for their good gifts, which are more eminent &amp; openly knowne, are yet for ſome hidden infirmities, whereunto their wiues are moſt priuy, very vilely, and baſely eſteemed of them.

                     <p n="2">2 To bee more carefull to looke vnto their better parts.</p>

                     <p>Now this outward carriage conſiſts in three poynts. 1 Sober behauiour. 2 Courteous geſture. 3 Modeſt attyre.</p>
                     <p>Sobriety, as it is a vertue eſpecially belonging to all women, ſo moſt eſpecially to wiues; and it is oppoſed to Leuity and Wantonneſſe: for as this vaine and light carriage betokens a light eſteeme that wiues haue of their husbands, ſo the other is a ſpeciall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of inward feare and reuerence. See <hi>Titus</hi> 2.4. This is not oppoſed to Matrimoniall familiarity: ſuch as was betweene <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca, Gen.</hi> 26.8. but ſuch ſporting ought, 1 To be in priuate, when they are alone. 2 It ought to be begun by the husband, as it is there ſaid, that (<hi>Iſaac</hi>) ſported with <hi>Rebecca.</hi> 3 That in companie they doe abſtaine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Courteſie and obeyſance: not as children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants for euery light occaſion, for heerein a difference is to be put, conſidering, that of all inequality, there is leaſt diſparity betweene the husband and wife. This ſo muſt be ſhewed when there ſhall be a departing one from the other for a ſeaſon, or a comming home, or at the ſitting downe at table, or when the wife maketh ſome ſolemn requeſt vnto her husband: as <hi>Bathſheba</hi> did vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.16, 31. Some may ſay, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was a King, and ſo ſhe reuerenced him as King, &amp; not as her husband. But I anſwer, 1 that though <hi>Dauid</hi> were a King, yet was ſhe a Kings wife, and ſo dignified with the Titles and Honors of a Queene; and if ſhe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding would doe it, much more ought others. 2 That if on the contrary, <hi>Vaſhties</hi> ſtoutneſſe were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured as an ill example to all wiues, <hi>Eſter</hi> 1.17.

muſt ſauour of reuerence. <hi>Sarah</hi> was well inured and accuſtomed to this, that euen in her heart, alone by her ſelfe, when ſhee might haue ſtiled her husband o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, without any diſgrace to him, yet ſhee calleth him Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. Onely let Chriſtians take heed, that they auoyde ſingularity heerein, as in calling their husbands Head, or Guide, &amp;c. but let them vſe ſuch Titles of reuerence, as are vſual &amp; proper to our toungs. I do not altogether condemne thoſe that call their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands by their Surnames: as Maſter ſuch a one, &amp;c. But ſuch are to be condemned, as call them by their Chriſten names; as <hi>Iohn, Will, Tom,</hi> &amp;c. which indeed are, and ought to be vſed towards them onely that are inferiours. 2 Thoſe that giue them vaine and fooliſh names of their owne deuiſing: as chicke, pigge, &amp;c. What reuerence is there in theſe ſpeeches?</p>
                     <p>For the manner of ſpeech, either in approuing, or reprouing any thing; they may not directly command their husbands, but intreate: nor reproue with chiding and anger, but gently by exhortation, auoyding vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed and raſh ſpeech: as that of <hi>Rahel</hi> to <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 30.1. angerly and ſhrewiſh ſpeech: as, <hi>Iezabel</hi> to <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.17. Bitter and rayling ſpeech: as that of <hi>Zippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4.25. Scoffing and frumping: as <hi>Michol</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20. Diſdainfull and reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeeches: as <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, <hi>Iob.</hi> 2.9. Shee muſt not giue word for word. All theſe are implyed by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. vnder the name of a meeke and quiet ſpirit: a thing much ſet by of God.</p>
                     <p>This therefore is to be obſerued, becauſe that wiues being the weaker veſſell, are more ſubiect to choller, and raſh vnaduiſed anger. 2 Becauſe that this fault in them is double. 1 The diſtemper of affections in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. 2 The neglecting of their husbands place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In their abſence, to others concerning their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, they ought ſo to ſpeake of them, as they may ſhew their reuerence and honour to them, as <hi>Sarah</hi> did
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3435:111"/>
alone in her heart, as the Church in the 5. of the <hi>Cant.</hi> ver. 10. highly extolleth her husband Chriſt, vnto thoſe that ſhee meeteth. So doth <hi>Mary</hi> ſpeake concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Ioſeph</hi>: Thy father and I, putting him in the firſt place, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.48.</p>
                     <p>Now this ought to bee obſerued of women, when they meet together, becauſe then, commonly their talk is of their husbands.</p>
                     <p>So much for Reuerence. The ſecond branch is <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>: and this is that which tryes their religion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſubiect themſelues to the word of God or no: for the other duties ſtand more in contemplation, and acknowledgement, and ſo may be more eaſily perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>This duty is layd downe in the Law of the woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. (whereunto wee muſt alwaies haue an eye) which ſaith, Ty deſire ſhall be ſubiect to thine huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and he ſhall rule ouer thee: therefore it followes, that ſhee muſt obey: and by the example of <hi>Sarah,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. And the compariſon betweene the wife and the Church enforceth this. Laſtly, the woman promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſame at her marriage.</p>
                     <p>More particularly, let vs conſider three poynts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The kindes of obedience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The manner of performing them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The extent, how farre forth obedience is to bee yeelded.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, it ſtands in two poyntes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the wife abſtaine to doe any thing of her owne head, and after her owne minde, eyther without or againſt the conſent of her husband. 2 That ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which he willeth her to doe.</p>

                     <p>Particular conſent is for one, or ſome particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>Hannah</hi> had for not going with her husband at that time, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.22, 23. and <hi>Sarah</hi> againſt her maid <hi>Agar, Gen.</hi> 16.6. for power and authority to correct her, but for that manner ſhe did it in.</p>

                     <p>So then, if the wife doe any thing without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, or implicit conſent of her husband, ſhe breakes the rule and Law of Obedience.</p>
                     <p>Now againſt Conſent, is when the husband forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it and diſclaimes it, and yet ſhe will doe it. A
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3435:112"/>
thing ſimply to bee condemned.</p>
                     <p>This may be further amplified by ſome particulars: as, 1 in diſpoſing of the goods of the family: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhee hath not liberty to doe what ſhee will: but theſe goods are two-fold, either proper, or common. Proper goods are ſuch as the wife hath a property and right, not only in the vſe, but in the poſſeſsion of them; and they are either ſuch as the husband before his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bindes himſelfe by obligation, eyther vpon his own voluntary motion, or by the perſwaſion of friends to giue vnto her, to be diſpoſed at her owne minde and pleaſure: or ſuch as he husband in kindneſſe after their marriage giues vnto his wife; as the rent of ſuch a houſe or field, or the like. In all theſe it's left to the wiues liberty to doe therewith what ſhee pleaſeth, and not what her husband would haue her.</p>
                     <p>For goods that are common, which come eyther by the wife or by the husband; the property, right, and poſſeſsion belongs onely to the husband, the wife hath onely the vſe of them and no more. Therefore doth <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> call that riches which hee had with his wiues, his riches, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.37. and though his wiues called their goods, our goods; yet this prooues not that it was theirs for poſſeſsion, but only for vſe: and againe, this is ſpoken not in oppoſition to their husband, but in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>Laban</hi> their fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r, that it was none of his. And hence it is, that we neuer read in Scripture, the wife cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led rich, but onely the husband. This is alſo proued by that law among the Iſraelites, that no inheritrix, or daughter heire might marry to one of another tribe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the inheritance was to goe away from the wife, to the husband: as the example of the daughters of <hi>Zelophehad, Numb.</hi> 36.6, 8. And the Law of our Land ſheweth it, ſaying, that the woman is vnder couert ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and therefore ſhe may not giue, ſell, buy, or borrow without her husband conſent to it, for otherwiſe her huſband may reuoke all againe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:3435:112"/>But heere ſome caſes of conſcience are briefely to be decided:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Whether the wife may not relieue the poore Saints in diſtreſſe without her husbands conſent?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> She may not, becauſe her husbands goods are not hers to giue away. Yea, but it is to a good end. Well, but a good end cannot iuſtifie a bad action; and indeed children that are vnder the gouernment of their parents, may as well doe it, ſteale away from them, and giue it to the poore: and if good ends may ſerue the turne, then coozeners and fraudulent perſons that get their goods by deceit, &amp;c. may be excuſed, if they ſay they doe it to a good end: as to build an Hoſpitall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch like. Wee muſt ſo follow Chriſts rule, bidding vs to giue of that which wee haue, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.41. That obiection out of <hi>Luke</hi> 8.3. is nothing: for there indeed it is ſaid, that <hi>Ioanna Chuzas</hi> wife, miniſtred to Chriſt; but it is not ſaid that ſhee did it without the conſent of her husband, for then Chriſt would not haue ſuffered it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> But what if the husband be a profane hard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mercileſſe man, that will giue nothing to the poore, and ſhee bee pittifull and compaſsionate towards them?</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Her hands in this caſe alſo are tyed, ſhe may not giue, no more than a ſonne that being of diſcretion, and deſirous to relieue the poore, may take away any thing of his fathers goods. Her honeſt heart, her griefe that ſhee cannot doe it, her deſire and willing minde to relieue them, ſhall be accepted of God for the deed it ſelfe. But herein the husbands fault is doubled. 1. The neglect of charity in himſelfe. 2 That he tyes his wifes hands, and hinders her from doing the good ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and ſo euen cauſes her to cry vnto God againſt him.</p>

husband is in Chriſts roome, and he indeed is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per huſband; and therefore his will muſt not be thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and croſſed. 2 Seeing many good wiues are worſt vſed of their husbands, of whom ſhal they receiue their reward of their obedience, but of Chriſt? Hence ariſe two further conſiderations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That if God and Chriſt Ieſus doe command a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the husband will not aſſent that ſhee ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, ſhee muſt doe it without and againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Prouided: 1 That ſhee be fully aſſured, that it is Gods Commandement, and that obedience to her husband in this caſe is contrary to it. 2 That ſhe be not raſh and haſty to ſay, God commands it, therefore I will doe it, but that firſt ſhee vſe all gentle meanes poſsibly ſhee can to winne her husbands conſent.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That if the Lord forbids any thing which her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band commands, ſhee muſt not doe it. Onely take two caueats: 1 That ſhe be ſure God commands the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 2 That ſhee firſt perſwade him gently and meekely to forbeare, and not to vrge, and preſſe it vpon her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to a higher commandement: but if all this ſerue not, ſhe muſt obey Chriſt rather then him.</p>
                     <p>Examples of wiues reſiſting their husbands, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſparingly ſet downe in Scripture. We read of <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Gen.</hi> 27. and of <hi>Abigail,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. But theſe were extraordinary, and ſerue onely in the like caſe. Yet we may giue ſome examples, as if the husband forbid the wife to keepe holy the Sabbath day: if hee command her to weare garniſhed apparell, paint her face, to run to Stage-playes, &amp;c. ſhee muſt not obey, becauſe God commands the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as the Church is in ſubiection to Chriſt, euen ſo, &amp;c.) The affirmatiue part is, that ſuch obedience as the Church performeth to Chriſt, the ſame muſt the wife vnto her husband.</p>

The extent: which is not ſo generall, but that a limitation muſt be vnderſtood: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it will bee contrary to many other places in Scripture: as, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.29. But it is layd downe in theſe generall tearmes: 1 To ſhew the large authority of the husband. 2 Becauſe the wife ought to obey in all things, that is, euery thing that the husband by vertue of his place may command, and not onely in ſome things, which ſhee beſt liketh of. So that in briefe, by this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, not Gods will, but the wifes will is excluded.</p>
                     <p>From this ground ariſe two concluſions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the wife labour to bring her iudgement and will in ſubiection to the will and iudgement of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: Not onely in things neceſſary, which are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded by the Word of God, but alſo in things indifferent: for ſhe muſt think her husband to be wiſer than her ſelfe both for his ſexe and place.</p>

                     <p>The reaſon is, 1 Becauſe hereby is her ſubiection ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, that it is for conſcience, in regard of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands place and authority: for if it be in things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, ſhee muſt doe it, whether her husband will or no. 2 For the peace and quiet of families: for from hence we ſee ariſe many contentions and brawlings, that the wife will not yeeld in ſuch indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                     <p n="5">5 The example of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The firſt reaſon is a cleare point, by that generall rule, that all who haue any lawfull authority ouer other, they are as gods vnto them: as <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to bee to <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence ariſe two concluſions: 1 That the wife in ſubiecting her ſelfe to her husband, ſubiects her ſelfe to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:3435:118"/>2 That in refuſing ſubiection to her husband, ſhee refuſeth ſubiection to Chriſt: prooued by example of Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.40. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.23. of Miniſters, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7.</p>
                     <p>In thus doing, wiues ſhall be the wiues of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Now if wee conſider duly this reaſon, we ſhall ſee how ſtrong a motiue it is, to perſwade wiues to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this duty of obedience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. This reaſon ſheweth, that the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is to the wife, as the head of a naturall body is to it: hee is more eminent in place, more excellent in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he hath power to rule and gouerne: and therefore it ſtands with the law of nature, that the wife doe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her ſelfe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 For the further vrging and preſſing the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is added, that the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d herein hath a fellowſhip and copartnerſhip with Chriſt, and they are brethren in office. And though there be an infinite diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and the husband, yet may there be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance where is no parity, and a ſimilitude where there is no equality, and therefore this hinders not that fellowſhip: Hence two concluſions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That hee is vnto his wife as Chriſt to the Church, and therefore ſubiection is as well due vnto the huſband by the wife, as ſubiection by the Church to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That they that do ſubiect themſelues to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, doe honour Chriſt: they that impeach the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their husbands, impeach the authority of Chriſt: yea, the very place of the head in a naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as we ſee, he that impeacheth the authority of one Magiſtrate, impeacheth the authority of all in the ſame degree: See <hi>Eſter</hi> 1.16.</p>
                     <p>Corollary: 1 That Chriſt will ſurely maintaine the husbands authority, as Magiſtrates in the like caſe will doe one of another: Wherefore though the husband himſelfe forbeare, yet may ſtout and rebellious wiues iuſtly feare the reuengement of Chriſt.</p>

                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:3435:118"/>4 The fourth reaſon ſheweth, that the husband hath this authority not ſo much for himſelfe, and for his wifes good. The name of Sauiour, is properly and truely applyed to Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.22. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.69. and 2.30.

                     <p n="1">1 That the ſubiection of the wife, is for her owne good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That they who refuſe to be ſubiect, as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to themſelues, ſo they are vngratefull to their husbands.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Taken from the example of the Church, which if either example it ſelfe (which wee ſee is of great force both without and againſt precept) or if the warrantable example of the Church, that is, of good and perfect men, can preuaile; it ought much to mooue wiues to the performance of theſe duties: Hence theſe Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 There is as good reaſon the wife ſhould yeeld ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to her husband, as the Church to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That by this ſubiection, the wife ſhall haue an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence within her, that ſhe is of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Now for the generall vſe of all.

                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:3435:123"/>And it is likely, being not contrary to the Scripture, and agreeable to other rules, that <hi>Chuza</hi> did giue his wife ſuch an allowance, whereof ſhe miniſtered vnto Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.3.</p>
                     <p>For the manner, hee is to let the wife haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of her owne property, for the better teſtimony of her faith, loue, mercy, and charity: for many will be liberall of another mans goods; and ſo may the wife in the common goods of the family, whereunto her husband hath right and intreſt: but when they come to diſtribute of their owne, heere will be the tryall of their charitable minde. Now diuers meanes there are to bring this to paſſe; as ſome will giue their wiues the rent of ſuch a houſe, or ſuch a field, the vailes, that which they get by working for themſelues, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>The continuance of the prouident care, muſt not be onely during his life: but alſo during hers, if ſhee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue him, <hi>viz.</hi> That if hee be able, hee let her haue wherewithall to liue as well after his death, as ſhee did with him: at leaſt, if after portions diſtributed there remaine ſo much, to leaue her as much as hee had with her. And wee ſee Chriſt was more liberall to his Church after his departure, than when hee liued bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and this will be a ſure ſigne that he loued her, when ſhee ſhall ſee his care to prouide for her after his death.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, conſidering her weakneſſe, to manage her eſtate; hee ought to appoynt ſome to haue a care of it for her: as Chriſt did for his mother, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.26, 27. And for this cauſe did <hi>Dauid</hi> ſet <hi>Salomon</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that <hi>Bathſheba</hi> after his death might be well dealt withall, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.21. And as the more need is, ſo to be the more carefull for her, as if ſhee be not like to marry againe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Contrary hereunto is the practice of thoſe huſbands,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Who by prodigality ſpend their eſtate, and ſo leaue their wiues worſe then nought: whereas this

                     <p n="2">2 Who by fawning and flattering get their wiues to make away their inheritance which came with them, without giuing them ſufficient conſideration for it, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatisfie their owne turnes while they liue. This is both an vnkindneſſe, and alſo a poynt of iniuſtice.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Such as vſe fraudulent meanes to depriue their wiues of the thirds, by deeds of gift, or other conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.

                     <p>So much of prouiding things neceſſary. The next point is, that he doe protect her from things hurtfull; A duty which in the generall is prooued by the phraſe of the Scripture, calling the husband the vaile of his wife: which as it implies ſubiection on her part, ſo it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports protection on his, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10.

                     <p>That wee may ſee the weight of this argument, two poynts are to be noted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The great diſparity that is betweene the Church and Chriſt, which appeareth in two branches:</p>

                     <p>But betweene man and woman, there is no ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; but they are equall in reſpect of gifts of graces by Creation, and alſo by Redemption: And in regard of infirmities, both were made of the duſt, both tainted with the ſame corruption, and ſubiect to the ſame end. The difference that is, is only outward for ciuill reſpects, in ſexe, ſtate and conditions, &amp;c. And ſecondly, it is onely momentany, extending it ſelfe but to this life, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.30.</p>
                     <p>Now then, if Chriſt, who is infinitely more excellent than the Church, haue yet choſen her to bee his ſpouſe, and doth ſo loue her; this ought to be a ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to mooue husbands to loue their wiues, betweene whom there is ſo little diſparity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The 2 point is, the ſmall benefit that Chriſt gets by the loue of the Church: If we aske what it is? We anſwer, It's nothing. For neither hee needeth to receiue any thing of her, being already full of the abundance of all good things, neither is ſhe able to giue any thing of her owne, becauſe ſhe receiues all from him, <hi>Iob</hi> 35.7. But much comfort and profit comes to a man by his wife: Yea, and that in his innocent eſtate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18. and therefore is it ſaid, that he who findeth a wife, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a good thing, <hi>Prou.</hi> 18 22.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if Chriſt, who ſtood in no n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed of the Church, yet did ſo loue her, as to come from heauen to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3435:128"/>
dye for her, to giue her all good things, &amp;c. Let it then bee a ſhame for husbands not to loue their wiues, of whom they doe receiue great helpe and comfort.</p>
                     <p>Now we are the rather diligent, to marke and take heed to this example of Chriſt, becauſe that it wipes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all pretences that men vſually bring for their not louing of their wiues: As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Some wil ſay that they are too great, &amp; their wiues too meane. To ſuch we ſay, 1 That after the marriage ſolemnized, the wife is partaker of their honour. 2 That if they looke vpon Chriſt, there was a greater diſparity betweene him and the Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Some will ſay that there is nothing worth in her. But firſt, hee ought to loue her therefore, becauſe ſhe is now his wife. 2 What was there in the Church, that Chriſt could loue and effect? and though hee loue thoſe graces in her, which are of his owne beſtowing, yet he loued her, before he beſtowed thoſe on her.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Some will ſay, that they be ſo peruerſe, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue rather hatred than loue. But, 1 this ought not to ſtir vs vp to hatred, but rather to ſhew our wiſedome to amend it. 2 The Church it ſelfe is full of corruption, rebellion, and prouocation to anger and wrath, yet Chriſt continues ſtill to loue her.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Some will ſay, that ſhe will doe mee no good, but be a burden to mee all my life. If this come through ſome infirmity, yet may ſhee doe thee good by her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and well-bearing of this affliction.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If it be a wilfull peruerſenes, yet this is no chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cenſure: for loue hopes the beſt. 3 Let him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what good &amp; profit the Church yeelds vnto Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Concerning the other patternes of a mans owne ſelfe, this likewiſe is added to the former, not as a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſtronger motiue, but as that which more ſenſibly and eaſily is perceiued of vs, than the former. Wherein the Apoſtle ſendeth vs to the ſchoole of nature, (<hi>No man euer yet hated his owne fleſh.</hi>) Seeing then that by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3435:128"/>
of God, a mans wife is made as neere to him as his owne fleſh: therefore as nature teacheth him to loue and cheriſh the one, ſo ought conſcience and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on teach him to loue the other: for his wife is himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore 1 As in his body, if one member be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all reioyce at it: ſo if he be helpefull and louing to his wife, himſelfe ſhall reape the comfort of it.</p>
                     <p>2 As likewiſe if any one be neglected and receiue hurt, the damage redoundeth to the head and other parts: ſo if the wife be not tendered and cared for, the hurt and ſmart will be the husbands.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 That as he puniſheth them for a fault, ſo they make known this fault vnto them, after the example of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. 3 To correct eſpecially for thoſe faults, which they may ſhew out of the Word of God, to bee faults; and ſo ſhew that God is alſo thereby offended: for this will make them feare the more.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Manner. Generall rules: 1 That parents in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, doe call vpon God, for themſelues, that they may bee directed; and for their children, that they may reape benefit, becauſe that they are ſubiect to paſſion, and the childs nature is againſt it. 2 That correction bee done in loue, as in all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.14 ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to children, who take it as a matter of iudgement, in their parents. 3 That it be done, with a milde mind and calme affections, and to put it off, if rage and fury ariſe: as God doth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.24.</p>
                     <p>Particular rules.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the quality and condition of the childe bee obſerued, and accordingly to meaſure our correction:</p>

                     <p n="3">3 The vſe: 1 To obſerue the dealing of God towards them in correcting of them; which parents may obſerue by their correcting of their children, with what pitty and compaſſion they doe it.</p>
                     <p>2 To obſerue, that in correcting their children, they correct their owne ſinnes, and that the thing for which they correct them, came by their owne occaſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:3435:136"/>Aberrations in this point are,</p>
                     <p>1 Too much indulgence. 2 Too much ſeuerity.</p>
                     <p>Duties of parents in regard of the riper yeeres of their children, when they are youths, are of two kinds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Prouiding of its place and perſonall calling for the exerciſe of that gift, whereunto they haue beene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore trained vp: ſo <hi>Samuel</hi> made his ſons Iudges, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.1. So <hi>Iſhai</hi> had diuers ſonnes, whom he placed in ſeuerall callings, ſome ſoldiers, ſome ſhepheards: a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of eſteeme in countries.</p>
                     <p>Reaſons are. 1 By this meanes they come to make vſe of that ability and faculty, which they haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their parents, in training of them vp; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this they forget the ſame, like ſchollers that after long ſtudy haue no further calling.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Becauſe by this meanes they come to doe more good to the Church and Common-wealth; for before, they are but in preparation, and their paines (as of pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices) may in ſome ſort bee profitable, yet they are not till afterwards counted members of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth properly.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 By this meanes they come to liue of themſelues and doe more good to others; whereas before, their paines and gaines were for their maſters.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 By this meanes they traine vp others, as themſelues haue been trained vp before, and ſo there is a ſucceſſion of calling, and a maintenance of Church and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>Directions: Obſerue 2 Cautions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That they bee carefull to place them in ſuch a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as they haue beene trained vp vnto in their young yeeres. <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> were choſen to the worke of the Tabernacle, becauſe they were skilfull men, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 25. It is not fit, of a prentice to make a miniſter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That the meanes of placing them be good, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and honeſt, that thus entring in by thoſe meanes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3435:138"/>
that God hath ordained and warranted, they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon his bleſsing, as beeing thereunto called by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. What miſchiefs follow vpon an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable entrance, all know.</p>
                     <p>Aberration in two extremes:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Careleſneſſe of thoſe that thinke it enough to haue beſtowed education vpon their children; and ſo account themſelues diſcharged, ſaying, that they will leaue them then to depend vpon Gods prouidence. (But we muſt know, that God appoynts meanes, without the vſe of which, we cannot looke for a bleſsing.) Others ſaying, that their children may ſhift for themſelues: iuſt like brute beaſts, that leaue their young ones when they are able to feede themſelues. And thus by their negligence, many times their children come to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drones in the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 When parents are too prepoſterous and raſh in prouiding a calling, not conſidering whether the place be fit or no for their children, but onely whether it be gainefull and profitable, or of credit.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Another is, of thoſe that make no conſcience of bringing their children into a calling, into the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by Simony, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The ſecond duty is, concerning marriage, that they be carefull to prouide marriage for them in due and fit time; a plaine duty of parents, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.6. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.36, 37. in practice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.2, 6. and 27.46. <hi>Agar</hi> learned ſo much in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.21. and and ſo did God with the firſt man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18.</p>
                     <p>Reaſons, 1 Becauſe children muſt waite vpon their parents conſent, and therefore they ought to prouide for them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Parents ſtand in Gods ſtead, and ſo muſt bee a meanes of ſeeking a marriage for them.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 Careleſneſſe in prouiding marriage, letting them paſſe the flowre of their age.</p>

                     <p>Meanes for the better performance of thoſe duties, are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That parents haue a care to prouide a ſtocke and portion for their children, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.14. Whereas ſome obiect, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.19. wee anſwer, 1 That Chriſt aimeth heere at couetouſneſſe: ſo as the foole laid vp riches.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 The extent, which is limited by theſe ſpeeches: <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>as vnto Chriſt,</hi> ibid, <hi>as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Chriſt,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>as to the Lord,</hi> ver. 7.</p>

                     <p>2 Negatiuely, by ſhewing what vices are to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded, ver. 6.</p>

                     <p>Before we come to handle the kindes, it is neceſſary to lay downe, here as formerly hath beene done, the ground and foundations of the duties, which doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne either the opinion, or the affection of ſeruants. Thier opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they be perſwaded concerning their maſters ſuperiority, and their owne ſubiection, that it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3435:138"/>
is good, lawfull and warrantable, by the Word of God. For ſeeing Reuerence and Obedience haue relation to authority and ſuperiority; how can any bee yeelded, when wee are not perſwaded, that they to whom wee owe this, are our ſuperiours? Therfore did <hi>Korah</hi> &amp; his company fall into Rebellion, becauſe they thought that <hi>Moſes</hi> had not that authority, which hee tooke vpon him, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.3. Now that ſeruants may bee reſolued, touching the lawfulneſſe of their maſters authority, let them conſider, 1 That it is Gods commandement, both in the old and new Teſtament. 2 The many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, that God giueth to maſters and ſeruants, to carry themſeleus in their places: But God giueth no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for any vnlawfull calling. 3 The example of many godly men in Scripture, who haue beene ſeruants. 4 That, that the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. vrgeth it as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conſcience, which hath alwaies relation to the Law of God commanding.</p>
                     <p>Contrary to this, is the opinion of the Anabaptiſts, denying any ſubiection or ſuperiority; their reaſons for it are, 1 If, ſay they, there be ſeruants, and this a calling lawfull, they muſt haue either Chriſtians or Infidels to their maſters. If Infidels, who haue no part 'in Chriſt: what an vnfit and vnmeet thing is it for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to bee in ſubiection to ſuch? If Chriſtians, then are they all brethren, and why ſhould one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be inferiour to another?</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3435:139"/>
of ſinne, to bee duties impoſed on vs, as eating of our bread in the ſweat of our browes, a puniſhment, and yet a duty.</p>

                     <p>But wee ſee the contrary in almoſt all ſeruants, who of all others will not bee ſeruants to religious men: ſuch as are all naturall men, who are more ready to follow the Diuell, and thoſe that beare his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, than God, and ſuch as carry the Image of God. And it is a common complaint, that prophane men haue better ſeruants, and haue their worke better performed, than godly; yea though they giue leſſe wages, and worſe fare; becauſe the one ſort, ſo as they may haue their work done, care not how they breake the Sabbath, and what other ſinne they commit, which the other will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. So much did men preferre liberty in ſinne before meate, drinke and wages, and any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>3 and 4 In regard of Reproofe, and Correction, which may bee ioyned both together; reproofe being but a verball correction, and correction a reall reproofe: and herein obedience is ſhewed in two branches.</p>
                     <p>1 By patient bearing all reproofes and correction
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3435:143"/>
whatſoeuer it bee, whether iuſt or vniuſt, milde or bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eaſie or grieuous; this the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> proues by many arguments, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Ioseph</hi> vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impriſoned by his maſter, mutters not, nor repineth, nor yet reuengeth it when afterwards he came into au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.20.</p>
                     <p>Contrary to this, is the practice of many ſeruants, who being reprooued, will anſwer againe croſly and thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly; a thing expreſly forbidden, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9. True it is, they may make an Apologie for themſelues reuerently, and modeſtly, but if their maſters will not heare them, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and patience is required.</p>
                     <p>2 Of thoſe that will not bee corrected, but if their maſters come to correct them, they will take the ſtaffe by the end. 3 Of ſuch as fearing correction, will runne away: as <hi>Agar, Oneſimus,</hi> and <hi>Shemeis</hi> ſeruants.</p>
                     <p>4 Of ſuch as will giue blow for blow. 5 Of ſuch as will ſeeke for reuenge, by miſchieuing their maſters at one time or other.</p>

Thus did <hi>Oneſimus</hi> amend, <hi>Philem.</hi> ver. 11.</p>
                     <p>Contrary is the practice of thoſe, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all reproofe and correction, goe on ſtill, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke their maſters, either to adde more blowes, or in the end to turne them out of his doores.</p>

(<hi>In all things</hi>) which words being ſo generall, muſt haue ſome reſtraint and limitation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe maſters and miſtreſſes are men and women, and ſo being, are ſubiect to errour. 2 Some may be Idolaters,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3435:144"/>
Popiſh and prophane, and ſo may command that which is expreſſely contrary to Gods Word. 3 And againe, ſuch is the peruerſneſſe of many, that they oppoſe themſelues againſt God the higheſt Maſter.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheleſſe the reaſon why this ſo generall a phraſe is vſed, is to ſhew, 1 That whatſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uer the maſter hath authority to command, and belongs vnto his office, in all thoſe things ſeruants muſt obey. 2 That the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters authority is very large, ſuch as none but Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary command can reſiſt. 3 That it is not ſufficient to obey in ſuch things as they pleaſe; but it muſt bee all things, though grieuous and irkſome vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore we muſt diſtinguiſh between things 1 Simply good. 2 Simply euill. 3 Indifferent. The 1 are ſimply commanded. The 2 ſimply forbidden. The 3 are good or euill, according to the diuers circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and in theſe indifferent is this extent eſpecially to bee placed.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y then here to be learned is, that ſeruants muſt labour and indeauour to ſubiect their iudgements vnto their maſters, to think thoſe things meet and fit which hee commandeth. The ſeruant of the Leuites, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 19.11. would haue had his maſter lodged in Iebus, but the maſter thinking it otherwiſe meete, he was content and went with him. If their maſter appoint them to any worke, they ought to thinke this worke meete and fit for them.</p>
                     <p>Contrary is that of thoſe, who think themſelues wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than their maſter: ſo <hi>Gehezi</hi> thought his maſter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to let <hi>Naaman</hi> depart: ſo did the Prophets offend, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.16. in vrging <hi>Eliſha</hi> againſt his will. This is the cauſe of many miſchiefes, as of exceſſe in apparell, when they think their maſter not wiſe enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide what is fit, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now if they cannot thinke that what their maſter commandeth, is ſo fit and profitable for him, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, they ought to yeeld obedience; this caueat
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3435:144"/>
obſerued, that they may make known their mind vnto their maſters, with mildneſſe and reuerence. So did <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For hereby a ſeruant ſhewes his hearty obedience the more plainly, when hee yeeldeth r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>adily to that which is contrary to his will. 2 This is a ſpeciall meanes to preſerue peace and loue.</p>
                     <p>Contrary to this, is peremptorineſſe in ſeruants, that will obey no further then themſelues ſee reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The reſtraint of this generality is expreſſed in 4 clauſes: 1 <hi>As vnto Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 5. 2 <hi>As ſeruants of Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 6. 3 <hi>Doing the will of God,</hi> ibid. 4 <hi>Seruing the Lord,</hi> verſe 7.</p>
                     <p>All which imply in the generall; that ſeruants obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their maſters, muſt be ſuch as may ſtand with their obedience to Chriſt. For 1 Chriſt is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt maſter. 2 To him we are to giue the laſt account of all our actions. 3 His fauour muſt be preferred, and his wrath and vengeance muſt be feared.</p>
                     <p>For more particular application of theſe generall grounds: 1 If the maſter command any thing that Chriſt forbids, the ſeruant is freed in this caſe, he may not obey; for this are <hi>Sauls</hi> ſeruants commended, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.17. and the midwiues, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.17. and <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi> 39.12. And if a King is not to be obeyed in ſuch things, much leſſe a priuate man.</p>
                     <p>For maſters heerein goe beyond their commiſsion, and ſo loſe their authority, and are not to be obeyed, no more than a Conſtable or Sherife, &amp;c. that goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their office.</p>
                     <p>Heere neuertheleſſe, this caution is to be noted, that they be not peremptory: but 1 That they be ſure that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3435:145"/>
God commands the contrary to their maſter. 2 That with all reuerence they ſhew their maſter his errour by the word of God, and to perſwade him not to command them that which is contrary to it, before they abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſe to obey.</p>
                     <p>Contrary to this, is men-pleaſing, when as ſeruants care is ſo to pleaſe their maſter, that they reſpect not God: as <hi>Do eg,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.20. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are there ſo wicked maſters, but they ſhall finde ſuch men-pleaſers as will execute their will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but what the iudgements of God are vpon ſuch, we may ſee by the example of thoſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.22.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.9. willeth ſeruants to pleaſe their maſters in all things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Men muſt be pleaſed in thoſe things that belong vnto their power to command. 2 The Apoſtle in that place ſpeaketh of man, as oppoſed to God, in the text, as ſubordinate to God; there ſo to pleaſe men, as to diſpleaſe God, heerein pleaſing of them, ſtanding in the place of God, to pleaſe God himſelfe. Briefely, here is meant to pleaſe men in God, for God, and vnder God: So that ſo farre as ſeruants can approue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to God, and haue the teſtimonies of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and withall pleaſe their maſter, this man-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is lawfull.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If maſters forbid any thing that is by God expreſly commanded, ſeruants muſt not therfore abſtaine: So did <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 6.10. Reaſon is, we haue a good warrant ſo to doe, euen of God himſelfe; and if a man haue the warrant of the King, what need he feare, although an inferiour magiſtrate doe forbid him? Thus if ſeruants be commanded not to giue good weight, they muſt not doe it, although they may keepe the price which their maſter ſets: ſo if to breake the Sabbath and the like.</p>
                     <p>Onely let them be ſure and certaine, that God hath forbidden that which their maſter hath commanded.</p>
                     <p>Contrary heereunto is ſlauiſhneſſe, and timorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3435:145"/>
when they feare their maſter more than God.</p>
                     <p>For the auoyding of theſe extremes, and the better to performe the former duties, let ſeruants</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Labour to be fully inſtructed what is the will and commandement of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.17.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 Let thoſe ſeruants that be at liberty, haue a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſpect in chuſing of their maſters, that they as well regard their inward diſpoſition, as their outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; for this it was that <hi>Ruth</hi> followed <hi>Naomi,</hi> becauſe ſhee ſaw ſhe was Religious, 1 <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.16.</p>

                     <p>Contrary to which, is careleſneſſe in ſeruants, that regard not to what maſter they binde themſelues, be they worldlings, prophane, popiſh, &amp;c. all is one to them; whereby they bring themſelues into many ſtraights, eyther to diſobey God, or to diſpleaſe their maſter, &amp;c. So much for the Extent and Reſtraint.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 Feare and trembling: the phraſe is doubled, to ſhew the neceſsity of the duty: by feare is meant, all the former, and reſpect which ſeruants owe to their maſters: by trembling is meant, an awe &amp; feare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke their maſter to puniſh them. For as we may feare God in regard of his power, that hee is able to execute ſo great vengeance on vs; ſo may maſters be feared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath giuen the rod into their hand, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute puniſhment on the diſobedient, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5.

                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:3435:146"/>Contrary to this trembling in the defect is, 1 Too much familiarity. 2. Anſwering againe, murmuring and repining. 3 Careleſneſſe in prouoking their maſter, thinking with themſelues, it can bee but a beating, &amp;c. In the exceſſe, ſlauiſh feare, when all things are done for feare of the rod.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Singleneſſe of heart: that is, that the ſeruice which they performe, be done with an honeſt and vpright heart, pretending no more in outward ſhew, then they intend inwardly in the heart: it is called ſingleneſſe of heart, in oppoſition to thoſe phraſes in Scripture of a double heart, or, a heart and a heart, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.2. Such an vpright heart was in <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi> 39.8, 9.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon is, becauſe ſeruants haue to doe not onely with their maſter, but alſo with Chriſt, who ſearcheth the heart, and by the ſame giueth iudgement of the action, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Becauſe honeſty and vprightneſſe is ſo acceptable vnto Chriſt, and hee delighteth ſo much in it.</p>
                     <p>Contrary to this, is eye ſeruice, when they content themſelues with the outward worke, and neuer regard their heart; ſuch are moſt ſeruants.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hypocriſie and diſſimulation, when they will carry a faire face, fawne and flatter, yet care not what wrong they doe vnto their maſter: as Paraſites.</p>

                     <p>Contrary is that of many ſeruants, who although
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3435:146"/>
they bee good at their worke, yet doe it not for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, but for feare, for gaine, or ſome like by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>

                     <p>Reaſons hereof are, 1 In regard of God, who loueth cheerefulneſſe. 2 of our ſelues: becauſe it eaſeth the burden of the worke. And for a motiue to ſtirre vs vp to readineſſe, conſider wee of the reward that God will giue to ſuch as bee faithfull in their calling.</p>
                     <p>Contrary is, when ſeruants do their buſineſſe grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, heauily, and of neceſſity; wherein neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues can reape comfort, God not accepting of their worke, nor their maſters profit, it being done for the moſt part vntowardly.</p>

                     <p>2 Diligence. That they imploy all their labour and care (continually) for their maſters good, <hi>Ecc.</hi> 9.10. For

                     <p>Contrary to this, is Sluggiſhneſſe and Idleneſſe: which in a ſeruant how irkſome it is, ſee <hi>Prou.</hi> 10.26. how vnprofitable and hurtfull, <hi>Prou.</hi> 18.9. Yea, all ſlothfull ſeruants are theeues, robbing their maſters of their beſt paines &amp; labour, which is as due to them, as meate and drinke to ſeruants. Such idle ſeruants are thoſe, who if they bee ſent of a buſineſſe, will haue much talke and prate about it, before it can bee done, <hi>Prou.</hi> 14.23. It is alſo hurtfull for themſelues: for hee that is ſlothfull for his maſter, will ſeldome be diligent for himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>3 Laſtly, herein is required Faithfulneſſe, a chiefe and principall dutie of ſeruants, and to bee referred to the whole manner of their obedience.
