            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Humble Petition of <hi>Anne Henſhaw</hi> Widow, late Wife and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutrix
of <hi>Benjamin Henſhaw</hi> Eſquire deceaſed, on the
behalf of her ſelf and her ſeven children.</head>
            <opener>In moſt humble manner ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioner was left the diſtreſſed Widow of her ſaid
huſband, having the ſole care of 8 children left to her to be
provided for, out of certain debts due to her ſaid husband;
the chief of which was owing by the late Earl of <hi>Carliſle,</hi>
which ſhe could no way get aſſured, unleſs ſhe could procure <hi>4000l.</hi>
more, which ſhe did raiſe, by getting together her childrens portions
ſecured in the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> and by the credit of her friends,
and engaging of her whole eſtate, by which means the debt was
made <hi>12000l.</hi> And an aſſignment legally paſſed to your Petitioner
from the ſaid Earl of <hi>2000l. per an:</hi> (til the ſaid debt of <hi>12000l.</hi> ſhould
be fully ſatisfied) out of an Annuity of <hi>3000l. per an:</hi> granted upon
valuable conſiderations to the ſaid Earl by the late King, out of the
old and other Cuſtomes; The which Annuity was received untill
<hi>4000l.</hi> of the ſaid <hi>12000l.</hi> was paid and no more: And then in
the year 1641. the Houſe of Commons alone took all the ſaid
Cuſtomes into their own diſpoſall, and ever ſince that time have
imployed them wholly for ſupply of the publick neceſſities, though
the Order it ſelf exempts the old Cuſtome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, out of which your
Petitioner was to be paid, and which were legally veſted in the
Crown, and by due courſe of Law paſſed and confirmed to your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner;
And by reaſon of which diverſion and occaſion of the late
troubles, ſhe hath loſt above <hi>20000l.</hi> in good debts, which are now
deſperate and irrecoverable, whereby ſhe and her children are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a very mean condition.</p>
            <p rend="indent italic">The Petitioner therefore moſt humbly prayeth, that the ſaid debt of 8000l.
which is <hi>JUSTLY DUE</hi> unto her, and intereſt for the ſame,
ever ſince the year 1641. may be allowed for the relief of her and
her children; And that your Honours will be pleaſed to give Order
that ſhe may receive the ſame out of the ſaid old Cuſtomes, according
to the former aſſignment made to her, and which are chargeable
therewith by <hi>LAW,</hi> being continued by the Book of Rates agreed
by the Commons in Parliament, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1642. otherwiſe your
Petitioner and her children who have never been Delinquents in
the leaſt degree, muſt inevitably be ruined, unleſſe it ſhall pleaſe the
Lord to ſtir up your hearts to commiſerate the ſad condition of her
and her 7 children.</p>
