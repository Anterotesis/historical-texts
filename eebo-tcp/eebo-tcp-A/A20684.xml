            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had not published my
late Sermon, the world
beeing alreadie so full of
bookes, had I not bene
mistaken by some which
vnderstood it not, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly
traduced by others
which heard it not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
of it, as they would haue it, and not as
I deliuered it, not so much offended with the
Sermon, as with the Preacher. They take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions:
Against the matter, as if the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
were not sound. Against my words, and
maner of deliuering it, as irreuerend, because
I presumed not onely to speake against <hi>Beza</hi>
without crauing pardon, without ascribing
praise and commendation otherwise due to his
great deseruings, but also to passe him ouer
slightly, calling him by his bare name, without
addition; as if so doing, I did <hi>Peccare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr√† formam

the patterne of wholsome words. Against the
text it selfe, as vnseasonable for the time, and
vnpleasing to the auditory. Against my diuision
and reading of the text, as straunge and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
the like neuer heard of before: as if I had
offered violence to the holy scriptures.</p>
            <p>I answere with the Apostle: I passe litle
to be iudged by you,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> or of mans iudgement. I
haue builded vpon no other foundation then
that which is already laid,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> that is, Iesus Christ:

good report and bad report, as deceiuers,
and yet true.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Beza</hi> cannot blame me for dissenting
from him, because he hath done so by S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
and all the Fathers: nor for vsing his
name without addition, because hee hath done
the like by S. <hi>Paul</hi> and all the Apostles. I dare
not follow S. <hi>Paul</hi> farther then hee is a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
of Christ,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> and therefore must dissent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>


               <pb facs="tcp:17491:3"/>
               <hi>Beza</hi> when he dissenteth from Christ. I was
not then ignorant how thanklesse an office it
was to speake of him, whose authoritie is with
some, more canonicall then the canonicall
scriptures, to name <hi>Beza</hi> before them which
haue onely heard of his name, but knowe not
how to spell it, (for they call him <hi>Bezer,</hi> as
also <hi>Bellarmine</hi> they call <hi>Bellamye,</hi>) they
would bee Doctors of the Lawe,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 17.</note> but knowe
not what they speake, or whereof they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,)
it is very likely they haue read his
workes, and are able to iudge of his doctrine.
But I came thither to preach Christ, not
to commend any man, for so had I not beene
the seruant of Christe. And this I may
speake without offence: M. <hi>Beza</hi> hath
not deliuered all truth, but left some to others
to bee deliuered. And therefore I exhort
them that they would not condemne this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
because hee holdeth the contrarye,<note place="margin">Epist. Iudae v. 10. &amp; 16.</note> least
they immitate the false Prophets which
speake euill of the thinges which they knowe
not, and haue mens persons in admiration,
whom also they knowe not, and so commit
grosser Idolatrie by worshipping a man, then
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did by worshipping an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell.</p>
            <p>If an Angell from heauen preach new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,<note place="margin">Apoc. 19.</note>


               <pb facs="tcp:17491:4"/>
he is accursed,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> much lesse may the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
which any man publisheth, be presently
receiued without further triall, <hi>E√¥ nomine,</hi>
because hee taught it:<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4.</note> but the spirit must be
tried, the doctrine must be examined, be the
credit of the Doctor neuer so great.</p>
            <p>I haue alwaies opposed my selfe against
popularitie, as an enemie to true godlinesse,
supposing that they which preach mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ought their selues to bee mortified from
vaine ostentation of great auditories, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
desire of many followers, and glorying in
multitudes of Disciples,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 15.</note> by the example of
our Sauiour, which withdrew himselfe from
the multitude, when he sawe they would take
him vp and make him a King. And therefore
haue I refrained to intrude my selfe into such
great assemblies; as also that I might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
mine owne congregation, but contented
my selfe to keepe my station in mine owne
watch-tower, ouer that flocke onely, ouer
which God hath made me an ouerseer. I desire
his glory and not mine owne: I say with <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Baptist,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 30.</note> he must increase, and I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.
But beeing called to that place of so
great expectation, I thought it fit to choose
mine owne text; in which choise, if the wiser
sort of men will say I haue erred, I will craue


<pb facs="tcp:17491:4"/>
pardon for mine error.</p>
            <p>I was required by the Magistrate, vpon
shorter warning then ordinary, to supply a
course, which else had stood voyd; so that my
tongue was become the pen of a swift writer:
yet haue I not by reason of haste,<note place="margin">Ier. 48.</note> done the
worke of the Lord altogether negligently, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was I with the Disciples carelesse what
I should speake,<note place="margin">Math. 10<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </note> looking that it should be giuen
me in that houre; but my heart did with the
Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 45.</note> first indite the matter before
I spake it. In expounding this text, I did as
<hi>Daniel</hi> expounding a dreame,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> vse both pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and meditation: and I assure my selfe, I
haue according to the Apostles rule,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> shewed my
selfe approued vnto God, a workeman which
needeth not to be ashamed diuiding the word
aright. And whosoeuer will stand to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thechisme
and rudiments of Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and submit himself to the rules of Logicke,
will he, nill he, he must confesse, that my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and diuiding the text is very naturall,
and no way forced. Concerning this point, I
am to satisfie a kinde of men differing from the
other of which I spake before, which will haue
marriage after diuorcement, as well of the
partie innocent as of the nocent, to be adultery;
and yet the diuorcement it selfe, which they


<pb facs="tcp:17491:5"/>
graunt to be a dissolution of marriage, to be
lawfull, so that they will build without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and make a consequent without an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent.
For how can marriage after diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be vnlawfull, if the diuorcement it selfe
stand good? How is it possible to graunt a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce,
but with full power to marry againe?
when the first mariage is lawfully dissolued,
what can hinder a second marriage? But to
strengthen their error<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> they except against the
diuision of my text: they will haue it to be but
categoricall, which I haue said to be hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
they alleadge that no proposition can be hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheticall
vnlesse it be conditionall. To oppose
themselues against me, they except against the
Cathechisme it self, against the grounds of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke,
by which they lay themselues open to no
small reproach. Euerie young scholler which
hath learned <hi>Seron</hi> can tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall
propositions are not conditionall, but
some copulatiue, some disiunctiue, and that all
propositions are hypotheticall, which may bee
resolued into two categoricalls, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these words as they are set downe in Saint
<hi>Matthew,</hi> and more plaine in S. <hi>Marke,</hi> and
most plaine in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> the commas and points
being in all three alike obserued: to wit, <hi>Vxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

dimittens, &amp; aliam ducens, maechatur,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:17491:5"/>
That is, both he which diuorceth his wife, and
he which marrieth an other, committeth adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
are an hypotheticall copulatiue proposition,
and containe in them two categoricalls: <hi>Vxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
dimittens maechatur, &amp; vxorem aliam
ducens maechatur,</hi> Both of them being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception perfectly true propositions in
Logicke, according to the definition and forme
of a proposition. But for as much as <hi>I</hi> haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
my text according to forme, which is the
very life of all diuisions, my diuisions is iustified
who haue diuided the whole text into three
propositions. The case being cleare concerning
the forme, that this text conteineth three
true propositions, they can contend with mee
onely about the matter of the first proposition,
whether it bee <hi>Secundum qualitatem in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>e,
vera or falsa.</hi> They aske how it can be adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
for a man to put away his wife, when hee
dooth not onely abstaine from the second
marriage, from all carnall knowledge, but
also from coueting of any other? Adulterie
say they, consisteth onely in carnall knowledge,
and in coueting, and no writer of credit will
say that there can bee any other adulterie.
By which wordes they make Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>

continually resorteth to the Phisitian to aske

when man or wife asketh counsell of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
how they may be diuorced, the man so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is vnhonest; the woman so doing, is adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous.
Likewise, they make <hi>Vrsinus</hi> to be a


<pb facs="tcp:17491:6"/>
writer of no credit, which interpreteth this
commaundement, <hi>Thou shalt not commit
adulterie,</hi> in this maner. The scope and drif<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>
of this commaundement (saith hee) is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of chastitie, and the vpholding of
marriage, and all things are by it forbidden,
which any waies are causes, or effects, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
or consequents, contrary to chastitie, or
contrary to marriage. But say I, by diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
marriage is dissolued, and therefore not
vpheld or maintained by such a diuorceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t as
is allowed to be good; and yet with a restraint
from a second marriage, men and women are
caused to burne in lust, and defrauded of that
benefit which God hath appointed to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
against fornication: and therefore by it,
chastitie is not preserued, and by a consequent
adultery is committed. But to answere them
in a word, how hee which diuorceth his wife
committeth adultery, he committeth adultry
two maner of wayes: first as a principall offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
because he breaketh wedlocke; for so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement
is defined the dissolution of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
or vntying of the knot of sacred wedlocke:
and the briefest sort of the English and Duch
Cathechismes, haue in stead of thou shalt not
commit adultry, in more generall termes, thou
shalt not breake wedlocke: whereby it is the


<pb facs="tcp:17491:7"/>
iudgement of the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Germanie,</hi> that all breach of the law of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke
is adultery: and wedlocke is in no degree
so highly broken as by diuorcement<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> by which it
is dissolued. Secondly he committeth adulterie
as a partie accessary, for he giueth his wife al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
to marry againe, which my aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
do confesse to be adultery. That the intent
and meaning of diuorcement is to vndoo the
first marriage, and giue license to the second
marriage, who can speake better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the Iewes
themselues, of whom the Christians did learne
it, and the Christian Churches which doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it and put it in practise? That the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement
which was permitted by <hi>Moyses,</hi>
was with permission also to marry again, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by <hi>Moses</hi> himself. <hi>Deut. 24.</hi> That it is
so among the Iewes, in these dayes it appeareth
by the very forme of their Schodule or Bill of
diuorcement, which hath these words, <hi>do vx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori
meae potesttatem eundi qu√≤ velit, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi
cui velit.</hi> I giue my wife libertie to goe
whither she will, and to marry whom she will.
That it is so vnderstood among the Christian
Churches where diuorcement is practised, it is
plaine by the confession of M. <hi>Beza</hi> in his
booke <hi>De diuortio,</hi> as in my Sermon I haue
declared. As for my maner of reading, let them


<pb facs="tcp:17491:7"/>
readie as I haue read it, or as it is in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,
all is one in substance, (I did it but for
explication sake, as an Interpretor, not as a
bare reader) they cannot vnderstand it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then I did read it: let them diuide it as I
did, or otherwise, it will make a difference in
outward forme, the doctrine will be the same.
Onely this aduertisement I will be bold to giue
to some kind of Preachers in our Church: that
true preaching doth not consist in heaping vp of
common places, in prolixitie and length of
speech, in multitudes of quotatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s of Authors,
chapters and verses, nor in rash deliuering of
doctrine taken by tradition, vpon the bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
&amp; credit of others, without further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.
But he which will expound such a
text as this is, must suppose it to be like the
Hebrew Bible, which needed the Chalde pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase
that the Iewes might vnderstand it:
the rocke in the wildernesse which was to bee
cleft by <hi>Moses</hi> his rodde before water would
issue out of it:<note place="margin">Ex. 17.</note> the Land of promise,<note place="margin">Psal. 59.</note> which was
not presently discouered:<note place="margin">1. Reg. 18.</note> the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> which was

in it could be reuealed:<note place="margin">Apoc. 5.</note> the face of <hi>Moses,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:17491:8"/>
which had a vaile or couering before it,<note place="margin">Ex. 34.</note> to bee

the tooth in the Asses iaw-bone, and the Lyons
carkasse which required <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength,
before his thirst could bee quenched, before
sweetnesse could be drawne out of the strong,
or meate out of the eater: the handling of it
may not be triuiall or vulgar.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus according to my poore talent,
deliuered that which I hope will not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
to the godly, because it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>sonant to Gods
word, nor scandalous to the state, as tending to
schisme, or maintenance of strife, because it is
according to the Decree established the last
Parliament, by the generall consent of the
Cleargie; my humble desire is, that the world
would so thinke of vs, as of the Ministers of
Christ, and disposers of the secrets of God, of
whom it is required that euery one should bee
found faithfull, and to thinke of mee concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

God mightily for all the good parts which are
in him, that I am <hi>Famulus seruorum Dei,</hi>

propounded by the
Pharisies to our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ, concerning
diuorcement of Wiues
from their Husbands,
and by a consequent, of
Husbands from their
Wiues, whether it be lawfull or no? The
answere is negatiue, that no diuorcement
is lawfull. For, first he sheweth that no man
may put away his Wife for any cause. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17491:9"/>
hee prooueth it, for as much as if
any man hath put away his wife, hee hath
done it of fact onely, and not of right,
and his fact is held vnlawfull, according
to Gods word, because hee may not
marrie any other while she liueth. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hee prooueth that hee which hath
put away his wife can marrie no other
while she liueth, because shee can marrie
no other while he liueth. For these three
conclusions do necessarily followe: The
first. If the putting away of a mans wife
be of this nature that still shee continueth
his wife: then it is no diuorcement. The
seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d: If the putting away of a mans wife
be of that effect that shee is no longer his
wife: then he is no longer her husband.
The third: If shee be no more his wife,
shee may marrie an other, and if he be no
more her husband, he may marrie an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
therefore the knot of matrimonie is
dissolued, and both are free. But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
teacheth that neither of them is at
libertie to marrie againe, therefore that
the bond of matrimony remaineth firme,
and therfore that there can be no diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
These things are easily apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but the difficultie is, how these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

alledgeth sixe reasons why me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
reading the scriptures (albeit learned) yet
vnderstand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> not, whereof one is preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
tenne why reading they profit but a


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17491:10"/>
litle, whereof fiue are these: ignorance of
the true drift and scope of that which
they read, they follow not the analogie of
faith, they conteine not themselues within
the bounds of diuinitie, they contemne
the iudgement of the Interpreters, they
stand too peremptorily vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the bare word
and letter. Among sixe rules which he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
for the better vnderstanding of any
Text, one is a true desire to learne, and
zealous intent to goe away better instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Another I adde of mine owne obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
which is this: the right vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Text, consisteth much in the
true reading of the same; for, if ye mistake
in reading, ye cannot but faile in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
And because many of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory
are defectiue in all these points, I
desire you according to these Premisses,
to heare me with indifferencie, and not
with preiudice, as condemning me because
<hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> and others are of
a contrarie opinion, to waigh well the true
drift of our Sauiour in this Text, to follow
<hi>analogiam fidei &amp; loci,</hi> the analogie of faith
in generall, and of this place in particular,
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>te√¨n your selues within the bounds of
diuinitie, that ye harken to the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17491:10"/>
I meane the auntient Fathers which
were nearest to Christ, and farthest from
corruption: that ye dwell not vpon bare
and naked letters, that ye heare me with a
desire to learne, and according to mine
owne rule, that ye would heare how to
read this Text, because many Diuines do
not read it rightly, and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
though they expound it falsely. For,
<hi>legere &amp; non intelligere est negligere,</hi> to read
and not vnderstand, is not truly called rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but mere negligence: <hi>Balthazar</hi>
could read the Characters written by the
hand in a wall,<note place="margin">Dan. 5. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

so could the wise men of <hi>Babell,</hi> but a
more exact kinde of reading was required
of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that was, to read and vnderstand,
and he read it in more ample maner then it
was written: <hi>God hath numbred thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and finished it, thou art weighed in a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
and found too light, thy Kingdome is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
and giuen to the Persians.</hi> Wherefore
let vs not read <hi>cum neglectu sed cum intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectu,</hi>
not ignorantly but intelligently; not
as <hi>Balthazar,</hi> but as <hi>Daniel;</hi> as readers
which know what they read, else it is in

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:17491:11"/>
               <hi>I say vnto you, &amp;c.</hi> In which asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is a kind of Elleipsis or want of words,
which defect, as it is verie common in
the Greeke &amp; Hebrew, so it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supplied by the learned Reader and
Translator, by addition of words to make
the sence perfect, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did. Do not
entertaine so irreligious an opinion of me
as if I should adde any thing of mine
owne vnto Gods word, &amp; yet where the
originall Text is obscure and vnperfect
like vnto this, somewhat must be added
out of Gods word, which by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the place &amp; very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>nectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> and
coherence of it, doth appeare to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
vnderstood, but so that the additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
be printed in other characters, that it may
be distinguished from the originall. And
least this kinde of reading the scriptures
should seeme straunge and insolent, <hi>Beza</hi>
in his Latine translation of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
dooth the like, not in so fewe as
an hundred places, wee will instance for
example sake. S. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth in this
maner.<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 3</note> 
               <hi>Let no man deceiue you by any
meanes, for except there come a departure
first, and the man of sinne be disclosed:</hi> which
words are so imperfect, that they carrie


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17491:11"/>
no sence; but <hi>Beza</hi> in his Latine translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
readeth it otherwise, by adding these
words in other characters: The day of
the Lord shall not come. <hi>Let no man deceiue
you by any meanes, for</hi> the day of the Lord shal
not come, <hi>vnlesse there be a departure first,
and the man of sinne bee disclosed.</hi> Which
addition is necessarily vnderstood by the
circumstances of the place, for in the
next verse going before, hee shewed that
the day of Christ was not so neare as the
Thessalonians supposed, and in this verse
he sheweth a reason: because there must
come a departure first. Likewise in the
same Chapter, S. <hi>Paules</hi> words are these:
<hi>The mistery of iniquitie doth alreadie worke,<note place="margin">Vers. 7.</note>
onely that which withholdeth, vntill it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away.</hi> Which <hi>Beza</hi> readeth in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<hi>The misterie of iniquitie doth alreadie
worke, onely that which withholdeth,</hi> shall
withholde <hi>vntill it bee taken away:</hi> and so
according to the office of a faithfull Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator,
maketh that plaine in the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which was obscure, by reason of
the Elleipsis in the originall, and yet
was not wanting in the originall because
it was necessarily vnderstood. In like
manner: this Text being Elleipticall or


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17491:12"/>
defectiue for want of words, and the sence
of it obscure and darke; wee must adde
words in the English, but in other Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and read in this maner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I say vnto you, that</hi> according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Moyses, <hi>He that putteth away his
Wife vnlesse it be for whoordome,</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
adulterie, <hi>and</hi> if he <hi>marrie an other, he
committeth adulterie: and whosoeuer marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her that is diuorced committeth adulterie.</hi>
Which words, we must of necessitie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
to be inserted, because else wee
shall not onely leaue the sence maimed
and imperfect, but also include a manifest
contradiction to that which our Sauiour
concluded in the words immediately go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, as I shall shewe vnto you.
Wherefore our new Diuines for want of
right reading this Text, do misconster it
foure wayes. First, they thinke our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
speaketh affirmatiuely that diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is lawfull, whereas he speaketh nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely,
that diuorcement is not lawfull.
The second, they take this answer to bee
particular; as if in some one case, that is, in
case of adulterie, and for some persons, as
when one is nocent and the other inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
diuorcement were lawfull, whereas


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17491:12"/>
it is vniuersall that no diuorcement is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
be the case whatsoeuer, or the persons
whosoeuer. The third, they suppose it to
be hypotheticall, because he saith: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
putteth away his wife except it bee
for fornication, &amp;c. as if that were aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent
with this: if a man putteth away
his wife for fornication, it is no adulterie,
whereas it is catagoricall, because this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
in the Parenthesis <hi>(vnlesse it be for
fornication)</hi> is meerely voyd, and no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all, as I will make manifest vnto
you, and of no more validitie then if it
were left out. The fourth, they thinke
that in these words are comprehended but
two propositions, whereas there are three:
for, though our Sauiour saith: Hee that
putteth away his wife and marrieth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
committeth adulterie, naming adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
but once, yet it is twise vnderstood,
both in the putting away of his wife, and
in the marrying of an other, and therfore
all one as if he had said: he that putteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his wife committeth adulterie by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her away, and if he marrie an other, he
committeth adulterie also by marrying an
other, like that saying of our Sauiour: <hi>He
that breaketh the least Commaundement and


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17491:13"/>
teacheth men so, shall be called the least in the
kingdome of Heauen.</hi> Which words, do not
import onely that the breach of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t
together with so teaching, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a man the least in the kingdome of
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, but also the breach it self, although
he do not teach it, as S. <hi>Iames</hi> sheweth: so
he that putteth away his wife committeth
adultry,<note place="margin">Iacob. 2. 10.</note> though he doth not marry any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Wherfore according to that which I
haue deliuered vnto you, I diuide my text,
as it naturally diuideth it selfe, into three
propositions, the first beeing as a text, the
other two as a glosse or exposition; to wit,
the second an exposition of the first, &amp; the
third an expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the second; the first,
which is the text, that there can be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement,
where he saith: it is adultery
for a man to put away his wife although
he marry no other: the second, a proofe
that there can be no diuorceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, because
he which putteth away his wife can mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
no other; where he saith, it is adultry to
marrie an other; the third, a proofe of the
second, that he which putteth away his
wife can marrie no other, because his wife
which is put away can marry no other.
And of these three propositions in they
due place.</p>
            <div n="1" type="proposition">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:17491:13"/>
               <head>Concerning the first proposition, that there
can be no diuorcement, and that it is the
drift of our Sauiour in this text to disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null
all diuorcements.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>I say vnto you, whosoeuer putteth away his
wife</hi>) I shewed you before, how there was
an Elleipsis or want of words to be suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Not as though I would by that supply
of words serue mine owne turne, or seeke
to aduantage my selfe, for I neede not,
and if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tent our selues with the bare,
naked and imperfect words of the Greeke
text, which the aduersary vseth for his
best and onely aduantage, no diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can be prooued ot of them. That
I may examine the bare words: who so
putteth away his wife except it bee for

our Sauiour was two-folde, to shew what
was supposed to be lawfull by the permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
of <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp; what was indeed lawful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

two seueral constructions, <hi>secundum

                  </hi>
according to the permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and
the truth of the Gospell, according to
<hi>Moses</hi> his permission, which was a man,
and did like a man, diuorcement was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
onely in case of adulterie, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the immutable and incorrupt
veritie of the scriptures, Christ denieth
diuorcement to be lawfull, as by the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17491:15"/>
of this place doth appeare. For, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
our Sauiour saith: <hi>wherefore I say vnto you:</hi>
marke vpon what occasion our Sauiour
doth say these things vnto them? conferre
the beginning of the Dialogue or confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Pharisies and our Sauiour,
with the end of the same, and his purpose
will appeare. Wherevpon doth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
deliuer this definitiue sentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
diuorcement vnto them, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their falsifying and belying the words
of <hi>Moses,</hi> which hee restoreth to the true
sence and meaning thereof? In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ference, the Pharisies asked
Christ tempting him &amp; saying: Is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a man to put away his wife for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fault, making no mention of marrying
againe? He answereth, it is not lawfull for
any fault, and prooueth his deniall by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
drawne; first from the nature of
marriage, that which is but one cannot be
diuided, <hi>vnitas est indiuisibilis,</hi> but the man
and wife are one; therefore they cannot
be diuided. The Maior is a principle in
Arithmaticke,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 14. 1.</note> and cannot be denied: the
Minor is <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> a principle in diuinitie.<note place="margin">Cor. 6. 16</note>
Secondly,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 3.</note> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the definition of diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no man can seuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> whom God


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17491:16"/>
hath ioyned together, but to diuorce, is to
seuer man and wife, whom God hath ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together,<note place="margin">Deut. 24.</note> and this in effect is all that
may be saide of this question. But, the
Pharisies not satisfying themselues with
this answere, reply against it, and presse
him with the authoritie of the scriptunre.
<hi>Moyses</hi> say they, commaunded the man
to giue his wife a Bill of diuorcement and
put her away. Hee answereth them, that
in so alleadging the words of <hi>Moyses,</hi> they
falsifie the Texte three maner of wayes.
First, whereas they say <hi>Moyses</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
it is not so, for <hi>Moyses</hi> did but suffer
them for the hardnesse of theyr hearts;<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note>
there is great difference betweene a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
and a tolleration, they be of
sundrie natures. In deed our Sauiour saith
<hi>It hath bene said: Let him giue her a Bill of
diuorcement.</hi> Which words doo import a
commaundement, but by whom was it
said? only by the Iewes, according to their
receiued errour, for God neuer said it, as
also in the same place: <hi>Yee haue heard how
it hath bene said, thou shalt loue they neighbour
and hate thine enemie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 5. 43.</note> But if ye read the
place of scripture to which it hath relation,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 18</note>
ye shall finde they haue misreported of it:


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17491:16"/>
for there is mention onely of the loue of
our neighbour,<note place="margin">If any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect that the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise related in Marke<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> I answere with Greg<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Decretal. lib. 5. Tit. 40. cap. 7. Nihil obstat narrandi diuersit as &amp;c.</note> not of the hatred of our
enemie, that is but their owne collection.
Secondly, whereas they build vpon this
tolleration of <hi>Moyses,</hi> it is no sufficient
foundation to ground vpon, because <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
in this his tolleration did not permit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement
as a thing honest and lawfull,
but that he did as a man, to beare with the
hardnesse of their hearts, dispence with
them in this case, contrary to Gods word,
where hee saith: <hi>From the beginning it was
not so.</hi> But whatsoeuer is contrary to the
first institution of marriage as it was in the
beginning appointed of God is adulterie.
For we are not to regard the receiued er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the Iewes, but the truth of Iesus
Christ<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as <hi>Ignatius</hi> saith <hi>ad Philadelp.<note place="margin">Vrsinus Doctr. Christ. 2. parte, in 7. praecep.

the sheepe of Christ doo heare his voyce
onely, wee must not bee inquisitiue what
others haue done before vs, but what
Christ which is before all hath appointed
to vs, neither must we follow the customes
of man, but the truth of God. Bigamy was
permitted to the Patriarkes, yet vnlawfull:
so diuorcement to the Iewes, though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.
It were very hard if our Sauiour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thus pronounced diuorcement to bee
vnlawfull and repugnant to Gods institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
should in this text being the next
verse following after, contradict himselfe
and allowe it to be lawful. Thirdly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they falsifie <hi>Moses,</hi> as if <hi>Moses</hi> did tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
diuorcement for any cause, saying: <hi>Is
it lawfull for a man to put away his wife for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fault?</hi> Our Sauiour doth lay before them
their errour, affirming that <hi>Moses</hi> in that
place which they alleadge, did not permit
diuorcement for any cause but onely for


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17491:17"/>
one cause, and that cause is heere specified
to be adulterie, where he saith: whosoeuer
(according to <hi>Moses</hi> his permission) putteth
away his wife except it be for whoordome,
committeth adulterie. And yet he explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that againe saying: that according to
truth he cannot put her away for adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
because he can marry no other, neither
can she marry any other, but both shall be
adulterous. But, for the better satisfying
of your selues, conferre this place of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
with that of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> which is
the ground of all this disputation, and you
shal finde that the Pharisies haue not dealt
ingenuously, but very falsely.</p>
               <p>The words of <hi>Moses</hi> are these.<note place="margin">Deut. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>If a man
take a wife, if so be that she find no fauour in his
eyes because he hath espied some filth in her.</hi>
There is the onely cause, hee doth not say
any cause, but one cause, which is filth; but
filth is according to the Hebrew phrase
adulterie, as it appeareth by the fourth
verse of the same Chapter, where whoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is called by the generall name of
filth. So these words of our Sauiour are
not onely a farther explanation of that
texte of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> which the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
had corrupted, but also a definitiue


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17491:18"/>
sentence, and positiue point of doctrine,
that diuorcement being so common, was
helde among the hard-hearted Iewes as
lawfull, because it was suffered by <hi>Moses,</hi>
contrarie to the commandement of God,
and first institution of marriage, which was
from the beginning of the world. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
because the Pharisies aske why did
<hi>Moses</hi> command to giue a Bill of diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and put her away? and Christ answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;
<hi>Moses</hi> did but permit: some Diuines
do grossely mistake the sence thereof, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
these words to include partly a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
according to the words of
the Pharisies, partly a tolleratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> according
to the words of Christ; to wit, a tolleration
onely to put away their wiues, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
that if they would vse the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of this tolleration graunted vnto
them, yet that they should first giue a Bill
of diuorceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, that all proceedings might
be according to order, but they are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by reading the vulgar translation, and
other corrupt Interpreters, for they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it: <hi>Let him write her a Bill of diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
which translation hath brought
them into this errour. But according to the
Hebrew, <hi>Tremelius</hi> translateth in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17491:18"/>
                  <hi>If a man take a wife and shee finde no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
in his eyes, because he hath espied filth in
her, in so much that he do giue her a Bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement,
&amp;c.</hi> Here is no such commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
as let him giue her a Bill; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a supposition, if he doo giue her a Bill of
diuorcement, (because vnlesse the Bill
were first giuen,<note place="margin">Vide Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost. in Lib. de libel. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud.</note> the diuorcement was not
tollerated) so that <hi>Moses</hi> is so farre from
commaunding, that he doth not so much as
tollerate it in expresse words, but onely
<hi>p√®r tacitum consensum,</hi> by not forbidding it
expresly, &amp; so supposing such an enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to bee committed according to their
practise; onely he commaundeth this, that
after it is done, if the woman after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
marrie an other, that then shee
shall not returne to her first husband a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>And, whereas some Diuines take it <hi>pr√≤

writing a Bill of diuorcement, did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the diuorcement &amp; make an act law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
it is cleane contrary. You will say
then, if the Bill could not adde strength to
the diuorcement to make it good,<note place="margin">L. Ideser, dom. in monte</note> why was
it giuen? S. <hi>Augustine</hi> answereth, that a

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17491:19"/>
shewe the Iewes how vngodly a thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement
was, for as much as it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for none to write Bills of diuorcement,
but onely the Scribes and learned Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the Lawe, to whom onely it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by their office, <hi>scribere sacras liter as</hi>
to write in the holy tongue, and because
it was euen among them held for a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
and vnnaturall fact for a man to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his wife, and this Bill of diuorcement
could not bee ingrossed suddenly, but
it required time and space: when the
plaintiue resorted to the Scribes office to
haue the Bill drawne, the Scribe was
first to lay open to the partie grieued the
vnlawfulnesse of such proceedings, and
to perswade him by all meanes to desist
from so badde a purpose, and bee recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to his wife againe, and to take better
deliberation, and repaire to the office some
other time, to trie if the partie grieued
could by such delayes be better aduised in
colde bloud. But if so be that hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
obstinate and vntractable, that his
hatred towards his wife could not be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied;
then of two euils the least was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
to auoyd a greater mischiefe: rather
then the Iewe should murther his wife, it


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17491:19"/>
was <hi>vltimum refugium,</hi> the onely refuge
left, to giue a Bill of diuorcement. <hi>Treme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
in his notes vpon this place, obserueth
these foure things: First, that this tolleratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
of which we spake, did extend onely to
that time present, when they were in the
wildernesse, and not to be endured after
they should liue vnder a setled estate in the
land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> because it is written in the
fourth verse of that Chapter, <hi>Thou shalt not
suffer the land to sinne, which the Lord shall
giue thee to inherit;</hi> so that there was an
inhibition or restraint against <hi>Iosue</hi> and his
successors that they should suffer no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcements.
The second, that this fact
was euen then manifestly condemned by
<hi>Moses</hi> when it was permitted, because hee
saith in the 4. verse: The woman which is
put away and marrieth an other, is pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the fact of her husband which did
put her away, and so giue her occasion to
marry an other, and that is abhomination
in the sight of the Lord. The third, that
diuorcement is as vnlawfull as poligamy
or marriage of many wiues, of which
neither haue any warrant out of the
word, but that the Iewes liuing then
not by precept but by example, not of


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17491:20"/>
the godly,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> but of the wicked, learned poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy
of their fathers, of which the first was
<hi>Lamech,</hi> and diuorcement of the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
which were Infidels. The fourth, this
tolleration of <hi>Moses</hi> was not in regard of
Gods people in generall, but onely of the
Iewes in particular, which could not by any
arguments be perswaded to renounce the
poligamy of their auncestors, or diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Aegyptians.</p>
               <p>Hauing spoken of the analogy of this
place in particular, to shewe that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of our Sauiour Christ was to disanull
diuorcement: I come to the analogy of
faith in generall, to shew what faith it selfe
hath taught vs to beleeue concerning this
question. <hi>Whosoeuer putteth away his wife,
&amp;c.</hi> which words giue me occasion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
diuorcement, and to shewe what it is
for a man to put away his wife. In which
definition I must followe the example of
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> which defined the things which
were not. For when hee hadde shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
howe impossible it was, that there
should be either <hi>vacuum</hi> or <hi>infinitum,</hi> yet
defined them both, onely supposing those
things to bee, which the nature of things
doth not afforde. In like maner I say:


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17491:20"/>
                  <hi>Diuortium est non ens;</hi> diuorcement is a
thing which is not, nor cannot bee, and
that the Iewes did diuorce their wiues
onely in their grosse imaginations, because
being put away, yet they continued their
wiues, and their seperation was breach of
wedlocke, euen as in the story of <hi>Elisaeus,</hi>
they which came to apprehend the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
were strooken with blindnesse, so that
when they thought they were at <hi>Dothan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Reg. 6. Gen. 3. 8. Ionas. 1.</note>
their eyes being opened they found that
they were in <hi>Samaria:</hi> and as <hi>Adam,</hi> when
he thought to hide himselfe from God in
the thicket, was still in his presence: and as
<hi>Ionas</hi> thought himselfe safe from daunger
by flying to <hi>Tharsis,</hi> when he was most in
ieopardie: so they thinke themselues inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
by giuing Bills of diuorcement, when
they liue in adulterie and are nocent; but
supposing that to bee which cannot bee, I
will define diuorcement out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to prooue that there can be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement.
Our Sauiour saith: <hi>Whom God
hath ioyned let no man seperate.</hi> In which
words, is conteined the definition of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement,
<hi>Diuortium est seperatio viri &amp;

of man and wife by the law of man,
which are ioyned together by the lawe of
God. But that is an impossibilitie that man
should make a nullitie of that which God
will haue to continue firme and stable, that
man should vndoo, &amp; make to be of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie,
which God doth ratifie &amp; make to

an vnitie to be a number, an indiuisible

Christ hath thus defined diuorceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t
as you haue heard, and out of his owne defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of diuorcement, hath argued to
prooue that there can be no diuorcement;
and if ye will stand to the definition of our

there can be no diuorcement.</p>

any dissolution as he tearmeth it:<note place="margin">Loco com<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> de diuortio.</note> hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
himselfe in the next tract after,
where hee affirmeth that for adulterie a
man may put away his wife and marry an
other, that if a man bee boysterous, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
cyclopicall, barbarous to his wife,
if hee bee crabbed, rogish, the wife
may put him away and marry an other:
that if hee neglect his family, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
may warrant her to marry an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Others doo define marriage to the
same effect as <hi>Melancthon</hi> did, but in
more wordes: That marriage is a lawfull
and perpetuall ioyning together of man
and wife by the consent of them both,
for the begetting of children, auoyding
fornication, and mutuall comfort. In
which definition, the materiall cause of
marriage is man and woman, the finall
cause mutuall comfort, procreation, auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of sin: the efficient cause the mutuall
consent of them both, but the formal cause
which is the very nature, essence, and life of
the same, is their lawfull and perpeutal ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
together, but whatsoeuer is to a man
perpetuall, is during life: these thinges
being so, it cannot stand with faith that
marriage should bee dissolued,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 2.</note> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17491:22"/>
liuing. The Apostle saith therefore:
The woman which is in subiection to the
man, is bound by the law to the man while
he liueth, but if the man be dead, she is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from the law of the man; in which
words hee sheweth how the knot of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
cannot be vntied but by death.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 16</note> And
to the married I commaund, not I, but the
Lord: let not the wife depart from her
husband, but if shee depart, let her remaine
vnmarried, or be reconciled vnto her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
In which words, where hee saith:
first, let not the wife depart, secondly, if she
depart, let her remaine vnmarried; he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth
two maner of departures, the first,
is a <hi>vinculo,</hi> a rupture of the knot of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
the second a <hi>mens√¢ &amp; thoro,</hi> from bed
and boord; the first he saith may not bee,
because it is contrary to the institution of
marriage; the second, if vnhappily it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
that for the incontinencie of the one
partie, the other partie be grieued and
cannot be reconciled vnlesse they depart,
yet that departure be but for a season, vntil
they can be reconciled againe, and that is
no diuorcement. For there are three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partures
from the marriage bedde which
are lawfull, two priuate, the third publike:


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17491:22"/>
the first with the consent of both parties,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 5.</note>
one dispensing with the other, where the
Apostle saith: <hi>Defraud not one an other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be with consent for a time, that yee may
giue your selues to fasting and prayer, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
come together, least Sathan tempt you
for your incontinencie.</hi> The second, in case
of necessitie, it is lawfull for the man to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with himselfe, as if the woman be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with a contagious disease, that hee
cannot doo the office of an husband with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
manifest daunger of his life, and it is no
fraude because it is not voluntarie. The
third, if the wife be an adulteresse woman,
because it is a publike scandall, he may by
the publike magistrate be seperated from
his wife for her chastisement vntill shee
shew manifest tokens of amendment. And
yet as the Magistrate must be very sparing
to interpose his authoritie in such a case,<note place="margin">Tho. Aqui. in 1. Cor. 7.</note> as
to enter betweene the barke and the tree:
so againe, there be seuen exceptions which
debarre the Magistrate from graunting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
seperation from bedde and boord, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
incontinencie be euidently proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
as, if the woman be inforced by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
not giuing consent,<note place="margin">Gen. 24<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </note> as <hi>Dinah</hi> was: if

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17491:23"/>
deceiued,<note place="margin">Gen. 29.</note> taking one for an other, as <hi>Iacob</hi>
was when <hi>Laban</hi> put <hi>Leah</hi> in his bedde in
steed of <hi>Rachel:</hi> if the woman by great
presumptions in lawe, and the generall
view of the world, supposing her husband
by his long absence to be dead, doo by
publike allowance without guilt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
marry an other: if her husbande
himselfe be consenting to her adultery, as
<hi>Sara</hi> gaue her maide <hi>Agar</hi> to lie with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 16.</note>
for then it is his fault as well as hers:
if hee by refusing to accompany with her
hath abused her weaknesse and so giuen
her occasion to fall, he cannot with a good
conscience be a plaintiue against her: if he
knowing his wife to bee incontinent do
beare with her for the present time, hee
ought not afterward to complain, because
lawe doth suppose a reconciliation &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
of the crime, and after forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
there ought to bee no punishment.
But the greatest occasion is this: if the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

It is the doctrine of the Apostles
and Euangelistes, that neither the man nor
the woman which are parted, shall marry
againe, but either refraine from marriage,
or reconcile themselues one to the other.
Neither must they beeing reconciled, bee
married a new as some of late haue practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
among vs, because the knot being not
broken the first marriage is firme.</p>
               <p>His second obiection: that it is iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to punish the innocent for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent:
but if when diuorcement is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet the plaintiue which hath sued the
diuorce, shall be restrained from marriage,
he must either be in daunger of burning in
lust, because he cannot containe, or else be
compelled to receiue again his adulterous
wife which was diuorced: then is it all one
as if there had bene no diuorcement. So
<hi>Augustines</hi> answere is:<note place="margin">Ad Pollen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium. lib. 2. cap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Lex diuina non est

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17491:27"/>
complaint of iniustice must not alter the
law of God. And if the Magistrates eares
shall bee open to such complaintes, the
high way shall bee laide open to inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
liuers. <hi>Innocentius</hi> hath sayd well to
the purpose, a woman may bee long sicke
of an infectious disease, which crosse is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medilesse,
why cannot the husband as
well conteine in case of adulterie as of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
and where <hi>Beza</hi> replieth that the
case is different betweene a diseased
person whom the hand of God hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
and one which by adulterie hath
made a voluntarie breach of wedlocke:
that is no replye, because in respect of
the plaintiue which hath not the gift
of continencie the gift is all one, and
yet sometimes it falleth out, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
haue daungerous infections, not
onely by the hand of GOD, but also
by theyr owne misdemeanour of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>The third,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> is an allegation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle:
<hi>He which cannot abstaine, must marry,
but a man which is seperated from his wife
may want chastitie, and therefore must mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
I answere S. <hi>Paul</hi> out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> hee
which cannot containe let him marry, but


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17491:27"/>
let him marry in the Lord, <hi>nubat in domino,</hi>
not otherwise, but he cannot marry in the
Lord which is married alreadie; hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take a second wife which is not freed
from the first: therefore if he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
let him bee reconciled to his wife,
that is a present remedie against fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The fourth: hee asketh (whereas S.
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith the man is bound to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
his wife vppon repentance) what if
her repentance bee but fayned? and
what if after forgiuenesse there bee a
relapse into adulterye againe? why
should a Christian bee bounde to such
an inconuenience? I answere, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
hee thinketh it an hard condition for
a man to forgiue his wife vppon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
beeing not assured whether shee
repent vnfainedly or no; nor resolued
whether shee will afterwarde remaine
chaste or no: The like may bee obiected
against them which are excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the keyes of the Church, which
shewing themselues penitent doo craue
absolution, and to bee receiued againe
into the congregation of the faithfull:
hee which is to pronounce absolution can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17491:28"/>
iudge of the contrition of the inward
man, and yet hee must absolue, and leaue
the rest to God, which knoweth the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the heart. Man can goe but by
outward appearance, and in charitie hope
the best. So must a man doo by his wife;

may marry as well as the innocent, I
prooue by these foure reasons. The first,
the custome and practise of the Iewish
Church when <hi>Moses</hi> liued, from whence
the Christians haue learned diuorcement,
<hi>Moses</hi> saith:<note place="margin">Deut. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>If a man take a wife, and shee
finde no fauour in his eies, because he hath espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and her second husband diuorce her in

first husband againe, after shee is defiled.</hi> By
which word it is euident, that when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
liued, women which were diuorced for
adulterie did marry againe, as well as their
husbands which did diuorce them. The
second, is the set forme of words which the
Iewes at this time doo vse in their Bills of
diuorcement, which is after this manner.
In the sixt of the Sabaoth, the 12. of the

a wife without an husband, nor an husband
without a wife. The 4. wheras they which
speak in fauour of the party innocent, take

which putteth away his wife, vnles it be for

is no adultry. If that kinde of arguing bee
good, I can by the same, prooue that the

I argue: He which marrieth her which is
