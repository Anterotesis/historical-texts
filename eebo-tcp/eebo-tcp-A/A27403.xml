         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AND
An ANSWER to an other false slaunder, as concerning
Buggery, which he and they slander the Quakers
with, which was denyed before
any such thing was acted.</p>
            <p>ALSO,
Another slander which is cast upon them who are scornfully
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> By one <hi>Cotten Cosland</hi> of <hi>Stockworth,</hi> who hanged
himself, who was seen and denied, and was told that he was
<hi>Iudas,</hi> two years before, or there abouts in <hi>Gainsborough,</hi> in one
<hi>Woolsey's</hi> house, and there that man which hanged <unclear>himself</unclear>, brought
in false witnes against them called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and both he, and his
witness was denied. And the thing in which they would cleare
<hi>Iohn Gilpin</hi> of, as of drunkenness, denyed; and he proved and
manifest to be such a one as was declared of him before. And
this do they fetch up which was two or three years ago, to slaunder
them that be in the Truth. And also, something in Answer to <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
Prophecies.</p>

            <p>REader, thou may'st take notice of the diligence of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of darkness (who, as our blessed Saviour Iesus Christ hath
said, <hi>are wiser in their generation then the Children of light</hi>)
and especially of <hi>Thomas Walker</hi> Priest, and <hi>John Myriel</hi> School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master: who were chief actors in contriving, and publishing the first
Book put forth in <hi>Gilpins</hi> name: who being grieved to see the truth
spread over their lyes, and the light to comprehend their darkness;
have by themselves, and their Emissaries, in two or three years time,
gathered up in four Counties, viz, <hi>Cumberland, Westmerland,
Lancashire</hi> and <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> (in which Counties there are many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of the people called <hi>Quakers)</hi> four persons that have been found
faulty, though none of them save <hi>Milner,</hi> was ever owned as friends
in the light, much less in the life: (a good testimony for that people)
Which had <hi>Thomas Walker</hi> been as diligent to have observed the
failings, and wilful practices of his own flock, he might to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
have made a large Catalogue; but my desire is not to justifie
the people, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> by ripping up of others sores; for I know
the Lord God of Heaven and Earth is with them, and the shout of
a King is among them, and according to this time it shall be said of
them, what hath God wrought; and blessed is he that blesseth them,
and cursed is he that curseth them; and their godly conversation
shall, and hath put to silence the mouths of many their adversaries
amongst whom they live; but in the light I see, that wrath is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
and anger is outragious, but who is able to stand before envy;
and that the wickedness of the wicked shall slay his own soul. And
therefore, <hi>Thomas Walker,</hi> cease from thy blasphemies against the
light, lost he who is the Father of lights, and dwells in the light, shut
thee up in utter darkness, and give thee thy portion amongst them who
hated the light, whose deeds were evil, as thine are, who not only
would cover <hi>Gilpins</hi> drunkeness, but plead for his other sins, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a mook at sin: who calls him civil whom thou doest not deny
but was, and is drunk with sin; but also religious, and sutable to
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. No marvel therefore, that thou who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testest
such things under thy hand, questions thy own credit;
and therefore procures others to certifie for thee, who if it would
have stood with their credits, could have certified more of <hi>John Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi>
and his course of life, then thou, or thy friend <hi>Myriel,</hi> who knew
little of <hi>John Gilpin</hi> and his conversation, till thou declared thy
<pb facs="tcp:103710:3"/>
self openly an enemy of the light, and all the Children of the light, by
thee in scorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> which how many of them have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
for thee, and by thy means is well known to many in <hi>Kendal,</hi>
whereof <hi>Thomas Sands</hi> and the rest that have certified for thee, is
not altogether ignorant; to whom <hi>John Gilpin,</hi> and his conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for many years past, and before thou or thy friend <hi>Myriel</hi> knew
<hi>Kendal,</hi> was well known: whose silence in the thing is more testimony
against <hi>John Gilpin,</hi> than thy rash forwardness can gain credit for
him, whose cred't cannot stand for clear testimony, without others
certifying what they believe of thee, which is as little as they can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie,
while they own thee for their Minister, if they should certifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any
thing at all, but fools loves to be medling; And as for the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Thomas Craister, Cuth. Studholme, and Thomas Turner,</hi>
who say, <hi>They dare not plead for iniquity;</hi> and yet have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, to make null the testimony of <hi>Robert Wharton</hi> and others
who were eye witnesses of his drunkenness in <hi>Kendal,</hi> when they were
off <hi>Carlile</hi> above thirty miles distant, let the wise judg; And who
are not ashamed to certefie a plain untruth, (and yet say, <hi>they dare
not plead for sin</hi>) saying, That John Gilpin <hi>hath been indeed a
man (as they will witness that knew him formerly) not only ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously

                  </gap>ined, but also of a very tender conscience: insomuch
that to affirm the contrary there can be nothing more false:</hi> (these
be their words.) Though I take no delight to meddle with others
conditions, nor to discover others nakedness at such a distance; yet
for the Truths sake, and that the simple may not be deceived with lyes,
nor men full of talk be justified; I give this testimony of <hi>John Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi>
(being one who formerly knew him, and his education, living in
the same Town of <hi>Kendal</hi> with him for about sixteen years, and one
that wished him well at least, not only in reference to his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
but also to his deceased mother, who wilst she lived was one in
profession with me,) that his conversation was neither as became the
Gospel, nor a sober civil man. And if any of you subscribers, or <hi>John

               <p>TO thee, Oh <hi>John Gilpin!</hi> and all the subscribers of thy
booke whose folly in it is made manifest: out of you:
which books, thou &amp; you subscribers have directed to the
world: they are the best to receive it, and believe it, for
the world loves their own, and will receive their own,
which lies in wickedness, where the lying wonders is, and
such are given over to believe lies; for to the Children of
light his book is not directed, but to the world, and the
world receives it which hate Christ, and all the Children
of light, as <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, which light brings to see all <hi>Gilpins</hi>
signes and lying wonders, his butter-flies and his Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
and his filthy Dreame, sand all his running up and
down, and all his imitations and crosses, and all his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
which must be turned into howling and sorrow, and
wayling, and gnashing of teeth, which is denied by all
the Children of light. The man of sin hath exalted himself,
above all this is called God, or that is worshiped, so that
he as God fits in the Temple of God, that he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in his due time, whose coming is even after the
coming of Satan with all power and lying wonders and
with all deceiveableness of unrighteousness in him and
them that perish, because that they and he did not receive
the love of the truth that they might be saved: for this
cause hath God gi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cribers, directed their book: they
are of the world, and the world heareth them, therefore
speak they to the world, and the world heareth them; and
the whole world lyeth in wickedness: they who are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of light are not of the world, we which are in the

light are of God, and he that knoweth God, heareth us;
he that is not of God, heareth not us, hereby we know the
Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of error. So, marvell not
my brethren, if the world hate you, and persecute you, as
many of the subscribers to <hi>Iohn Gilpins</hi> book, hath done,
persecuted many, imprisoned many, for we know we have
passed from death to life, because we love the bretheren,
but he that loveth not his brother, abideth in the death
and who so hateth his brother, is a murderer, and hath not
eternall life abiding in him: so ye Children of light, who
see <hi>Iohn Gilpin</hi> and his subscribers, where the man of sin is

with the light, which is your condemnation: remember in
your life-time, you are warned, and you are in secret read
this: now, bretheren in the light, be not ye so soon sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in your minds, neither by his books nor words, who
hath given heed to fables, &amp; <unclear>swerved</unclear> from the truth, and
turned aside, and so now directs his book to his own, who
heareth and receiveth it. He that hath an eare let him
heare, and understand he that hath an eye, for over to
Satan is he turned and delivered, and so with the wicked
judged who are both with the light condemned, which
from his lies and fables, the Children of light are escaped:
are not they of the world that do <unclear>persecut</unclear> the, Children of
light? are not they of the world, that are given over to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
lies? are not they of the world that heareth the
world? are not they of the world, that sends their writing
to the world? and doth the world heare the Saints, and
doth not the world love her own, and did not ever the
world hate the Children of light? was <hi>Iohn Gilpin</hi> come to
that power that made the Devills to tremble, and you
who worship the beast whom all the world wonders after
to blaspheme, and doth the beast blasphem the power of
God, yea or nay? was that the power of God that made
the Devills to tremble in <hi>Iohn Gilpin,</hi> yea or nay? <hi>Answer,</hi>
else confess in your silence guilty, and let your mouths be
stopped for ever: is it the power of God that makes the
Devills to tremble, and doth not the world call this the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103710:4"/>
power of the Devil, and so abuse the power of God, nay
or yea?</p>
               <p>Having seen a book wherein the life and conversation
of <hi>Iohn Gilpin</hi> by severall hands certified that <hi>Iohn Gilpin</hi>
hath ever walked as becomes the <unclear>Gospel</unclear>, I have knowne
him this 12 or 14. yeares, and this I can say and lie not,
he was never owned in the least, of any that had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
but was of the sort which ran to all excess of
riot, a common Drunkard, a Cocker, a Gamster, as some
of those is, which hath given testimony of his Gospel-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:
but if this be their Gospel conversation, it with
the light of Christ is denied, and in judgment neither it
nor they can stand, but with the light is to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and with the Children of the light to be denied and
seene to be out of the Gospel. It is not the boasting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that lodgeth in the enemies of God (that can hurt the
truth) which casteth out floods of water to destroy the
truth, for in safetie is it kept, neither those high swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
words can hide him from the wrath of God, that is
revealed, to be powred forth upon all unrighteousness,
and, know thou lier, that my testimony is true and shall
stand: and this I declare to all in the presence of him that
knoweth, that I lie not, that as I was passing down the
high street in <hi>Kendall,</hi> betwixt the place called the new
<hi>Brigging,</hi> and the lower Wel, <hi>John Gilpin</hi> was passing on the
street, in that place I sae him drunk: but they being so large
in their exposition of things, they may do the like of his
drunkenness: these are the signes which I shall declare,
which will be a sufficient testimony that he was drunk,
first that he reeled to and fro, secondly turning to a side of
the street standing talking to a woman, was not able to
stand without wandering. Thirdly, his face inflamed

Drury,</hi> who was a freind to a man that himself made
away. Freind, the lies that the man and his witnesses spoke
in <hi>Wollies</hi> house we denyed, for he heard him not speak
these words which he witnesseth, and his witnessing before
and so he was a <unclear>liar</unclear>, and they was liars. And thou now
seeks to justify a lyer, and so it was no slander, nor no lies
in hypocrisie which was written forth for the truths sake,
that they that dwell in the truth, should not be slandered
with such a fellow: for freinds being slandered with him
after he was dead, for the truths sake it was written forth.
And thou that seekest to justify him and his lying wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
take heed of the just judgment of God falling upon
thee. And to that in thy conscience I speak. And him
whom the world calls <hi>George Fox,</hi> did witness the thing
that the lier and the false accuser had said he had spoken
before in his hearing, which he had not spoken the words
and so he was a lier, and his witness false, and thou false,
that justifies him. And that in thy conscience will beare
testimony against thee, though after before many witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
he did witness it, but not as carnally spoken, and thou
who dost now appeare in the same nature, take heed, take
warning, for <hi>Iudas</hi> he did see him to be, and <hi>Iudas</hi> end
came to him. And wo to that man that doth betray the
just &amp; the wo is to thee, for he was not slandered, who tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the light &amp; wilfully betraied the just, which light
is your condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which now seek to justifie the unjust
&amp; the betrayer. But in the power of the Lord, we are kept
above al your slanders, and accusations. And <hi>William Drury</hi>
let thy mouth be stopt, and thy lies covered, the thing
whom the world calls <hi>George Fox</hi> did witness, is witnessed
but he spoke it not as a Carnall creature, if thou this canst
receive, thou mayest, that in thy conscience is his witness,
and thy condemnation. And before many witnesses it
was confessed, that which he had not spoken before him,
that witnessed against him, therefore to him it is a lye and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103710:8"/>
thou art a false accuser, who seeks to justifie him; And ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
forth hy lies in hypocrisy for the truths sake was the
Note written forth, because freinds were slandered with
him after he was dead, and so the mist which thou casts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
peoples eyes, and the dirty stuffe which comes out of
thee, the truth cannot be darkened with it. But clearly
thou and he is manifested to the Children of the light.
And <hi>Judas</hi> was his name, and <hi>Judas</hi> end was scene, and
take thou heed who goe about to justifie him, for there
men see what your profession is without the substance,
And the truth being cleared the witnesses fled, and thou
wouldest not have had <hi>Judas,</hi> to have had his name then
when it was given him: let that in thy conscience beare
testimony and condemne thee, who would have had him
to have had another name, and have made him better then
he was, and there thou maiest see now what thou hast set
up. And the godly freinds are not saddened, who are in
the Image of God, who see the end of such as contrary to
the light do act, which thou seeks to justifie. But the
day hath declared his fruits, and thine. Therefore thou
<unclear>hast</unclear> time, now repent, and thy time prise it, least God sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
cut thee off. And this is in love to thy soul, from
him who is a freind of it; And that which was writ in the
Paper, was truth, and not a lie, not a slander in it, and
that in thy conscience will beare testimony to it, which
is thy condemnation, And that which (him the world
calls) <hi>George Fox</hi> did speak forth was proved before many
living witnesses, and that which they witnessed, they was
liers, for before to them he had not spoken it. So let that
in thy conscience be a witness against thee, to be in the
same nature against the truth as he was who with the
light are to be condemned. And lies, and false accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and slanders we all deny, for them we see are come
out of thy own Botle, and thither we do return them

who hanged himself, so he whom the world calls <hi>George

who brought lies and false witnesses against the truth, and

that is in the Priests; with the light that is eternall,
both it and they and them are to be condemned, which
light never changeth. Therefore to the light in you all
freinds did I speak which never changeth, that with it your
minds may be kept up to Christ, and God, who never
changeth: so if you do turne from the light which never
changeth, to the changeable, there is the <hi>Iudas</hi> the Son of
perdition, which is condemned with the light, and to you

this is the eternall word of God; And he that turnes from
the light of Christ, which he hath enlightened him withall,

Son of perdition, and <hi>Iudas</hi> is his way to perdition, and
Christ is not his way; who turns from the light, turneth
from Christ, and despaires, and with the light which comes
from Christ he is condemned, but <hi>Iudas</hi> is his way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
But who dwells in the light, and walks in the

all the world which hates the light, and lies in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
and doubts: the <hi>Iews</hi> which had not the life of

himself; with the light which comes from Christ, is all
these things seene, for this is the condemnation, the light:
therefore a warning to you all, that do prosess what you
