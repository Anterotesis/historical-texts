            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Math. ii.</note> when accordyng to his age, he
ought to haue been bothe tenderly and
quietly norished, was compelled through
the crueltie of Tyrauntes, to bee caried
from countrey to countrey, and yet hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
founde he reste at any tyme, so in all
pointes did the Crosse followe hym, euen
from the verie cradle, as thei vse to saie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> is bothe delicately and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
fostered, and brought vp without al
noise and disquietnesse. All Epicures and
worldlynges delight in hym. Thei seeke

               <note place="margin">Luke. ii.</note> when he was borne, had little
resorte vnto hym,<note place="margin">Math. ii.</note> for to releeue his poore

and the wise men of the Easte, with a
verie fewe other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> hath the whole worlde floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
to hym, which cease not to giue, and
offer vnto hym greate &amp; precions giftes,
although otherwise ouerflowyng with
the aboundance of all thynges.</p>
            <p>7 <hi>Christ</hi> beyng but twelue yeres of age
was studious of Goddes worde,<note place="margin">Luke. ii.</note> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
<pb facs="tcp:17158:4"/>
of the knowledge thereof, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettyng
his carnall freendes, and their
companie, he remained in the Temple of
Salomon at Ierusalem, sittyng in the
middes of the Doctours, hearyng them
and posyng them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> hateth the knowledge of
Goddes worde, and so many as fauour it,
forasmuche as it is contrarie to his filthy
will, and beastly pleasure, and deliteth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that doctrine, whiche serueth his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
appetite.</p>
            <p>8 <hi>Christe</hi> was obediente to Marie his
mother,<note place="margin">Luke. ii.</note> and to Ioseph her houseband, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng
hereby a good example of submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and obedience to all children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> will obeye no man, but rule
ouer all men, giuyng hereby an example
of pride, and disobedience to all men.</p>
            <p>9 <hi>Christe</hi> (as some affirme) from the
tyme of twelue yeres of age, till he was
thirtie yere old, accompanied Ioseph his
Mothers housebande, whiche was a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
by his occupation,<note place="margin">No manne ought to be idle in a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten common weale.</note> and laboured
diligently in that arte, by this meanes
gettyng his liuyng with the trauaile of
his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, and with the sweate of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
<pb facs="tcp:17158:4"/>
accordyng to the commaundemente
of his heauenly Father,<note place="margin">i. Thess. iiii.</note> giuyng a good
example in this behalf,<note place="margin">ii. Thess. iii,</note> to all that professe
his name,<note place="margin">Genes. iii.</note> that none in a Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

manne woorke some good thyng that he
maie haue not onely whereof to liue hym
self,<note place="margin">Marke. vi.</note> but also to giue vnto the needie. And
hereof commeth it, that Christe is called
a Carpenter in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> is altogether otherwise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
For he vseth no exercise, that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

idlely, of the labour of other mennes han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,

browes, contrary to the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of God, beyng in deede a verie vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

is estraunged from all Godlie and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
exercises:<note place="margin">The idlenes of the popish spiritualtie,</note> So likewise doeth he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraunchise,
and make free from all worke

appointyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to preache
the woorde of God, nor to administer the
Sacramente of Christe purely and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely,
accordyng to Christes Institution,
but to saie Mattens, Masse, and Euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>song,
<pb facs="tcp:17158:5"/>
and to sette forthe his ordinaunces
and decrees, &amp;c. that thei maie seem at the

            <p>10 <hi>Christ</hi> as he prospered in age,<note place="margin">Luke. ii.</note> so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
did he in wisedome and fauour, with
God and men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> the older he waxeth, the
worse he is, hated both of God and of all
Godly men.</p>

his woorde is
the Truthe: Againe, that the holie

hereby manifestly declaryng, that in his

for our saluation,<note place="margin">ii. Timoth. ii.</note> as saincte Paule
saieth: All Scripture giuen by inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

improue, to amende, and to instructe in
righteousnesse, that the manne of GOD
maie bee perfecte, and prepared vnto all

that Messias shall come, whiche is called

<pb facs="tcp:17158:33"/>

shewed you all thynges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> saieth, that though it bee

all truthe necessarie to saluation, is not
there to bee founde, but there are other
truthes as necessarie to bee beleued,<note place="margin">Unwriten vereties.</note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

that thei bee of equall aucthoritie

Signifiyng hereby, that no man can vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,

bee reueled, and opened vnto hym by the

and as euery man of his owne braine
fantaketh, but as GOD is the alone au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthour

            <p>3 <hi>Christe</hi> will all menne to searche the

            <p>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> commaundeth, that when

menne should haue recourse vnto
the Canons, and generall Councels, but
spicially vnto the See of Roome, where
all doubtfull matters are to bee decided.
As for the Scripture, it hath no more
aucthoritie, then it pleaseth the Churche,
that is to faie, the Pope and his adheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,

            <p>4 <hi>Christe</hi> teacheth, that all mennes tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,

decreed of menne, although of neuer so
greate ancthoritie and wisedome, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17158:34"/>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> teacheth plainely, that all
suche constitutions, and ordinaunces of
men, as bee decreed, and set forthe by the
aucthoritie of Counselles, and holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
whiche are alwaies gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the instincte, and consent of the

not bee grounded on Goddes worde, are
notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng good and profitable: and
menne are bounde vnder paine of deadly
synne, to obtaine and keepe them. For the
Churche can not erre.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>Christe</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">Luke. iiii.</note> that there is but one
onely,<note place="margin">Luke. iiii.</note> true liuyng and euerlastyng God
whiche alone is to be honoured, worship
ped, and called vpon: by whose name also
alone we ought to sweare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> also after a certaine sorte,
confessed also one God with vs, and that
he is to be honoured and called vpon, but
not alone. For he teacheth, that the sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes
in heauen, bothe maie and ought to
be honoured and called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea, and that
we maie also sweare by their names.</p>
            <p>6 <hi>Christe</hi> in his holie Lawe,<note place="margin">Exod. xx.</note> bothe by
Moses, the Prophetes, and Apostles, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
to make, sette forthe, or kepe any
<pb facs="tcp:17158:35"/>
Image to bee worshipped. But aboue all
thinges, he forbiddeth vs to make any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> saieth, it is lawfull not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to haue images and to sette them vp in
Temples,<note place="margin">Images.</note> Chapels, Oratories. &amp;c. but
also to worshippe theim, to kneele before
theim, to kisse them, to praie before them,
yea, &amp; to them, to knele before them, to set
candels before them, to decke and trimme
them, to offer vnto them, to sense them, to
put of our cappes vnto them, and at the
laste,<note place="margin">Beliques.</note> what not? Antichriste also diggeth
out of the ground the olde rotten bones
or reliques of sainctes, translateth them,
encloseth them in Golde, keepeth them in
precious shrynes and costly Clausures,
and setteth them forth to the people to be
kissed,<note place="margin">The Image of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> and worshipped. Moreouer he is
not ashamed contrarie too the manifeste
woorde of God, to make the Image of the
blessed Trinitie. He formeth and frameth
God the father like an old broken backed
man, with a white head, winckled forehed,
holow eied, slender cheeked, sharpe nosed,
tothlesse, wide mouthed, hangyng doune
lipped, crooke chinned, graye bearded,
<pb facs="tcp:17158:35"/>
small necked, leane handed, and in fine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
monstrous. GOD the Sonne
Antichrist setteth forth as a lusty younge
younker with his yelow lockes: and God
the holy Ghost he maketh like a yong lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
White flickeryng Doue. But this
blasphemous image causeth hee to be set
in Churches and in all other places, not
onely to be considered, but also to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
vnto the greate dishonour of god,
the slaunder of the Christen religion, the
offence of all good men, and vnto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of all Gods ennemies. But what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not Antichrist doe?</p>
            <p>7 <hi>Christ</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">Ioan. iiii.</note> that the true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
muste worshippe God in spirite and<note place="margin">Math. xv.</note>
trueth: againe, that they worship God in
vaine, whiche honour hym after the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> affirmeth, that it is lawfull
to worship God any maner of waie, so it
commeth of a good entent, good mynde,
good zeale, good deuotion, &amp;c. For God
casteth awaie the good intent of no man.
Antichrist therefore teacheth vs to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God with Golde, Siluer, precious
stones, sumpteous vestures, candels, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
<pb facs="tcp:17158:36"/>
Ashes, bread, water, Salt, &amp;c. With
long patteryng, curious singyng, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
pipyng, loude ringyng, &amp;c. With
Surplesses, Copes, Uestimentes, Caps,
Coules, &amp;c. with Massyng, with Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
goyng, with Pardons biyng, with
Beades saiyng, &amp;c. And all these thinges
he taught to be more precious and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in the sight of GOD, than to helpe
the poore, or to doe any worke of mercie.
For that is done but to manne, the other
vnto God.</p>
            <p>8 <hi>Christ</hi> in his sweete Sermon that hee
made,<note place="margin">Math. v.</note> in the mount saieth, that he came to
fulfill the Lawe, that is to saie, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishe,
whatsoeuer was prefigured of him
in the ceremonies of the olde Testament,
so that by his comming he hath put away
and vtterlie abolished all Ceremonies,
euen as the shadow is remoued by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the light. For as the Apostle
saieth.<note place="margin">Heb. x.</note> The lawe he meaneth the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
law was nothyng els than a shadow
of good thinges to come. The good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are come and geuen, therfore the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
ceaseth: wherby we euidently learne
that the Christians are nowe free from
<pb facs="tcp:17158:36"/>
suche cloudy lawes &amp; darke ceremonies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> teacheth, that although the
Ceremonies<note place="margin">Ceremonies</note> of the olde law be abolished
by the commyng of Christ, yet that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
nothing but that the Church, which
is the spouse of Christ, may appoint what
Ceremonies she wil, without any offence
of her husband Christ, whiche delighteth
in her and in her doynges, as in himselfe,
yea and that so muche the more bicause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the christians there are many rude
grosse, and thei must be rudely and grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled, and brought by little and little
vnto perfection thorowe suche Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and outward obseruaunces: whiche
Ceremonies and Ordinaunces of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
spouse the Churche, are with no lesse
reuerences to bee obserued, than if they
had beene commaunded of Christe her
husbande.</p>
            <p>9 <hi>Christ</hi> Iesus in his doctrine teacheth,
that he alone is our Sauiour, our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
our Bishop, or Pastour, our head, our
reconciliatour, our peacemaker, and in
fine, all our hope and comfort, in so muche
that whosoeuer beleueth in hym, shall not
perishe, but haue euerlastyng life.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:17158:37"/>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> in his doctrine teacheth,
that saluation and remission of synnes, is
to bee obtained also at his handes, at his
Pardons, Indulgences, yeres of <hi>Iubile,</hi>
Masses, Coules, Pilgrimages, &amp;c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that he is heade of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Churche of Christendome, Christes
Uicare, Peters Successour, the higheste
Bishop, the greatest Priest, the moste ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and moste blessed Father, to whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other, the keyes of the kyngdom
of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are committed, fo that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he bindeth in yearth, is also bounde
in heauen: and whatsoeuer he looseth in
yearth, is in like maner loosed in heauen,
so that whosoeuer cleaueth vnto hym, can
not perishe, but haue life euerlastyng.</p>
            <p>10 <hi>Christe</hi> taught vs,<note place="margin">Ioan. xiiii.</note> that whensoeuer
wee will desire any thyng of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Ioan. xvi.</note>
wee should aske it in his name.<note place="margin">i. Timoth. ii.</note> For
no manne commeth to the Father,<note place="margin">i. Ihon. ii.</note> but by
hym.<note place="margin">Rom. viii.</note> And in the writynges of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
wee reade,<note place="margin">Roma. v.</note> that Christe alone is our

by whom alone wee haue free, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
accesse vnto God the Father, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely
obtaine of hym all good thynges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17158:37"/>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> setteth forthe vnto vs,<note place="margin">Inuocation of Sainctes.</note> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

euen the soules and spirites of

vs to call vpon them, to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession

matter of iustification charitie goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and sicker both in Soule and Purse, then

            <p>37 <hi>Christe</hi> teacheth that wee should not

of God to their young children,<note place="margin">Deut. vi.</note> and that

holy churche teacheth them without any
further inquisition: yea he maketh it He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie

Princes to knowe Christe or his Lawes.
<pb facs="tcp:17158:45"/>
He hath digged Cesternes of his owne
traditions, and hath stopped vp the pure
fountaynes of Christes doctrine. He can
not abyde, that the Laity should reade the
Scripture, least they should perceaue his
iuglyng: neither can hee suffer that the
Scriptures should bee painted either in
publique Temples, or in priuate houses.
The blinder the people be, the warmer is
his Kitchin.</p>
            <p>39 <hi>Christe</hi> taught his disciples on this
wise:<note place="margin">Math. xviii.</note> if thy brother trespasse against thee,
goe and tell hym his faulte, betwene hym
and thee alone. If he heare thee: thou hast
wonne thy brother. But if he heare thee
not, then take yet with thee one or twoo,

man, and as a Publicane.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> vseth an other kynde of

hym, he will straight waies (suche is his

to make theim to reuoke the truthe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the truthe, and contrary to their
owne conscience, and so at the laste too
graunte to his will. But if he bee strong
through the Spirite of GOD (without
whom, no man is able to stande in suche
a case) and will not forsake the truthe:
then after long and many moste greuous
tormentes, secretely ministered to those
constant, and faithfull Martyrs of Christ,
at the laste he bryngeth foorthe, accuseth,
iudgeth, condemneth, and in fine, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to the temporall officers, as to their
Butchers and hangmen, to bee burnte at
a stake vnto ashes. As for that charitable
reconciliation, that our Sauiour Christ

as take vpon them to bee his Ministers,
he vtterly refuseth, and will none of it.</p>
            <p>40 <hi>Christe</hi> saieth: If thou wilte bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte,

there is one maner glorie of the Sunne,

according to his degree, euery manne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng

Hereof it should then followe, that
there is respecte of persones with God,
and that the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly glory is ours, not of

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> for money graunteth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sations
to all men, for to Marie where
thei will, when thei will, and with whom

money.</p>
            <p>70 <hi>Christe</hi> in his doctrine did neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde
mariage to be contracted betwene

            <p>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> in his Lawe prohibiteth
many and diuerse degrees to Marrie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
whom God hath sette at libertie.
He hath decreed also that Christen Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippes,

that haue been Godfathers, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers

their Marriage to bee incestuous, and

hande. This is to bee vnderstanded, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
thei purchase a licence of hym for

            <p>71 <hi>Christe</hi> freely permitteth Marriage

            <p>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> as wee haue tofore heard,
denieth Marriage to all his clatteryng
Clergie, rather sufferyng them to burne,
and to runne a Whoryng, then he will
suffer them to haue wiues of their owne,
that this Prophecie of sainct Paule may<note place="margin">i. Timoth. iiii.</note>
bee fulfilled. The Spirite speaketh eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
saieth he, that in the latter tymes,
some shall departe from the Faithe, and
shall giue heede vnto the Spirities of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

whiche speake falsly through Hipocrisie,

<pb facs="tcp:17158:57"/>
And as he forbiddeth certaine degrees of

Marrie, is not onely accursed, but his
Marriage also is not lawfull. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng,
if any man will bryng money,

tymes to Marrie for money: Is it not
lawfull to marrie without money? Doth
money make a thyng either lawfull, or

O Antichriste. Thy money perishe with
thee. For thy harte is not right in the

and in the truthe. For suche also the
Father requireth to worshippe him. God
is a Spirite: and thei that worship hym,
must worshippe hym in spirite and in the

            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> teacheth, that though wee
maie praie to GOD in all places, yet
ought wee moste chiefly to praie in suche
places, as his Bishoppes and Prelates
haue consecrated, and hallowed for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
as Oratories worthie for their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and holinesse, wherein our Praiers
maie the soner bee hearde, and the better
accepted. And yet in these places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of hym for Praier, one is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
more holie then an other, and more
meritorious to praie in, as the Churche
is holier then the Chappell, &amp; the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
holier then theim bothe: and yet the
<pb facs="tcp:17158:58"/>
Chauncell holier then them both: and yet
the Cathedrall Church, otherwise called
the mother Church more holy than them
all three. But to praie at the Shrynes of
his canoniced Sainctes, or in places of
Pilgrimage, where the Deuill worketh
stiracles. I would saie, miracles, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely
at Rome, at Compostella, at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
&amp;c. this passeth all. Praiers made
in those places with this confidence, that
they be the sooner hearde, and the better
accepted by the reason of the places, flye
to heauen, as it were a polde henne.</p>
            <p>74 <hi>Christ</hi> appointed a certaine forme of<note place="margin">Math. vi.</note>
praier, after the whiche we should directe<note place="margin">Luke. xi.</note>
our Praiers vnto our Heauenly Father:
wherein also he declareth, what thinges
wee shoulde specially aske of GOD the
Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> appointeth diuers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
formes of praiyng, not to God, but to
this he Sainct, and to that she Sainct,
yea and that for manie and sundry causes,
to euery sainct for a contrary thing. And
thus are men taught to worship the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in steede of the creator, robbing God
of his glory, and committyng moste wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:17158:59"/>
and damnable idolatrie.</p>
            <p>75 <hi>Christ</hi> saieth:<note place="margin">Math. vi.</note> when thou praiest, thou
shalte not bee as the Hipocrites are, For
they vse to stande praiyng in the Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goges,
and in the corners of the stretes,
that they may be seene of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> saieth: I will that my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines

are moste of all gathered together, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they vnderstande not one worde,
what is either song or said, or on the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
plaid. And bicause they may be seen
of men, and haue the greater assembly of
people at their praiers, he commaundeth
that now one Bell shal be rong, now two,
now three, now all the belles in the steple,
by the which diuersitie of ringing menne
maye the better knowe not onely when
Antichristes Chaplaines and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
may be sene to praie, but also when
it is <hi>Festum simplex,</hi> or <hi>Festum duplex,</hi> or
<hi>Festum principale,</hi> that is to saie, single
feast, or double feast, or principall feast.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17158:59"/>76 <hi>Christ</hi> saith: when ye praie,<note place="margin">Math. vi.</note> bable not
much, as the heathen doe. For thei thinke
it will come to passe, that they shall bee
hearde for their much babling. Be ye not
therefore like vnto them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> doth so lade and burden hys<note place="margin">The long praiers of the Papists.</note>
captiues with innumerable multitudes
of praiers, that they haue almost no tyme
to breath. They haue Mattens of the day,
and Mattens of oure Ladie with Prime

They haue long Letanies, long Seuen
Psalmes, long fiftene Psalmes with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and diuers Orisons. They haue long
Masses and long commemoration. They
haue long Diriges and long commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
They haue Euensong of the daie,
with Euensong of our Lady, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin
to them both. And all these thinges
must be saied or song vnder paine of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
synne. But how thei be mumbled and
iumbled vp, all the world may see: Uerely
without all godly affection of the minde.
The hearte goeth one waie, and the voice
an other way, so that they agree together
as Harpe and Harow, and come one to

            <p>78 <hi>Christ</hi> by his Apostles commaundeth<note place="margin">i. Timo. i.</note>
that euery congregation should haue his
pastour or preacher, to feede the Christen
flock with the most holsome fode of Gods
worde, so that euery spirituall Minister
should attende vppon his owne cure, and
not bee distracte with the care of diuers
congregations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> can not away with this,<note place="margin">Pluralities of Benefices</note> that
one man should haue but one benefice, and
one liuyng, therefore he dispenseth with
his Chaplains for money, to haue as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Benefices as they can get, neuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
thought for the discharge of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
He graunteth them dualities, triali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
pluralities, and tot quots, to snatche
as many as they can catch. Though God
would haue one Pastour to haue but one
flocke, and one Beneficed man to enioye
but one benefice: yet Antichrist contrarie
to this moste righteous will of GOD,
graunteth to one man for money through
<pb facs="tcp:17158:61"/>
dispensation to haue multitudes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
both against all right and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and againste the auncient practise
and vsage of Christes church. It is more
tollerable and praise worthy, that two or
three pastoures should haue the ouersight
of one Congregation beeyng large and
great in multitude of people (as we read,

one man to haue the charge of many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes.
How can one manne bee in diuers
places? can one man doe that whiche is
denied to Angels? I meane to be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and diuers places at once. Will they
commit the charge of them to other? and
hire other to satisfie their office? But our
Sauiour Christ saith:<note place="margin">Ioan. x.</note> A good shepheard
giueth his life for his Sheepe. An hyred
seruant, and he that is not the shepheard,
neither are the sheepe his owne, seeth the
Wolfe commyng and leaueth the sheepe,
and flieth, and the Wolfe catcheth and
scattereth the Sheepe. If Antichristes
Chaplaines be not able to serue so manie
Cures (as they are not able in deede) as

they place other in their stead, so let them
resigne and giue ouer, to their Curates

            <p>79 <hi>Christe</hi> by his blessed Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth<note place="margin">i. Timoth. iii.</note>
that suche should bee chosen to<note place="margin">Titus. i.</note>
be Bishops and Pastors of Gods flocke,
as be apte to teache, that is to saye, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte

them that say against it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichrist</hi> repelleth and putteth backe
none from taking cure of soules, if he can
reade his Portasse and his Missall, and be
weli seene in the Pye. As for preachyng
and teachyng, except it be foure tymes in
the yere to reade to the people a generall
curse, or to tell them some narrations out
<pb facs="tcp:17158:62"/>
of the Festiuale, or Sainctes lyes, lyues
I should saie, out of <hi>Legenda Aurea,</hi> he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not for it, yea, he abhorreth it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
Antichrist is growen vp vnto suche
fauour and madnesse, that he is not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for Money to dispense with Boyes,
and to licence them to haue cure of Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
and to enioye spirituall promotions,
whiche ought to bee the liuynges of the
true and faithfull Pastours, and of suche
as labour and trauaile in the Lordes har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest,
where as the boyes are not able too
haue cure of their owne Soules, beeyng
more meete to be taught, then to teache.
O thou Antichriste whiche burnest with
an vnquenchable thirst of worldly goods,
what an whorishe forehead haste thou put
on, that thou darest commit the cure of
Soules, and the liuinges appointed for
the same, to children, to boyes, to suche as
be like Moyles and Horses, that haue no
vnderstandyng? Is it sitting, meete and
conuenient, that those soules, which were
so derely bought with the precious bloud
of Gods owne Sonne, should be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the cure, charge, and ouersight of
boyes and children? Is not this to offer
<pb facs="tcp:17158:62"/>
the flocke of Christ, a spoyle to the wolfe?
Is not this to throwe mens soules head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
doune into the deepe dungeon of hel
fyre for lacke of knowledge? Is not this
vtterly to deface the ministery, and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to spoyle the worthy pastours of their
liuinges, and the Christen people of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
and true administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes?
wo worth thee, O Antichrist
with thy God that wicked Mammon.</p>
            <p>80 <hi>Christe</hi> by his holy Apostle,<note place="margin">i. Peter. v.</note> chargeth
all Postours to feede their flocke diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly,
and to bee residente vpon their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and not like an hirelyng or theef, to
forsake the flocke, and to haue no care
thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichriste</hi> contrarie to this charge,

he maie haue the money, nor yet regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
the will of God, so that his pouche
maie bee filled with golde and siluer. Let
the Shepe of Christ runne a straie where
thei will, hange on euery Brier, fall into
euery ditche, bee deuoured of euery wolfe
yea, sincke doune into Helle: he forceth

not. For money he licenceth the Shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard

The Pastour hauyng a good opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of his Dispensation, and non residence, is
ledde with no care toward his flocke, but
doeth what he will, and yet gorgiouslie
and deliciouslie, although absent, liueth of
the Wolle and Milke of the flocke, like a
Theefe, whiche as our Sauiour Christe
saieth, Commeth not but for to steale, to

depriued of their duetie, and thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
(alas for pitie) into extreme pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
hospitalitie decaieth, the poore are
not succoured, the needie are not reliued,
yea nothyng is done in those Parishes by
the Pastours, whereby the comfortlesse
may be comforted. No maruell when the
Papistes themselues, haue not wherwith
to relieue their owne necessitie, but are
compelled daily, as we may see before our
eyes (such is their miserie) to leaue their
flockes, whiche as Sheepe destitute of
shepheardes, wander here and there, and
too seeke other places, where they maie
haue whereof to liue, whereas if they had
<pb facs="tcp:17158:64"/>

vniustly taken awaie from theim by
Antichristes decree, they should not onely
be able to liue themselues, but also abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly

what deuill breathed this wicked affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into thy hearte, that thou shouldest
take awaie from the painefull Pastours
their right, and geue it to idle and slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishe
Monstrous, whose God their bellie
is.<note place="margin">Phillip. iii.</note> The Idolatrous Princes in tymes
paste gaue greate aboundance of worldly
possession to their idolatrous priests. And
arte thou nothyng ashamed to take that
awaie from the priestes of Christ, whiche
both the law of God, and the lawe of man
hath geuen theim. To robbe and spoile a
priuate man of his goods, hath alwaies
bene counted an hainous fault and synne
worthy of death: and shall it be lawfull for
thee (O thou Antichriste) to take awaie
from the Ministers of Christ their duety
and their right, and to geue it where it
pleaseth thee, O thou Godrobber. Is not
this to commit sacrilege, and also to deny
the workeman his meate, the laborer his
rewarde, the Shepheard his Milke, the
<pb facs="tcp:17158:65"/>
vinekeper his wine, the warriour his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and to moosell the oxes mouthe, that
treadeth out the Corne. And that wicked
Spirite occupieth their myndes also in
these our daies, whiche againste all right,
and againste their owne conscience, vnto
their greate damnation, except thei short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repent and amende, go forthe to kepe,
hold, and possesse these liuyngs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the poore Pastours? Antichriste as
thei them selues confesse, neither can thei
denie it, by his Deuilishe Decree moste
vniustly, and moste tyrauntlike, tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie,
the beste portion of the Tithes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the true owners, and gaue them to a sort
of monstruous Hypocrites: why then are
thei now retained of theim, that seeme to
bee enemies to Antichriste, to condemne
his Antichristian actes, and to wishe that
all abuses might be taken awaie, and that
a perfecte reformation might bee made,
accordyng to the woorde of GOD? Can
there bee any greater abuse, then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
to Antichristes Lawe, wrongfullie
and vniustly to withholde from the true
Pastoure, and Preacher of the Lordes
woorde, that whiche is properly his due?
<pb facs="tcp:17158:65"/>
The wise man saith:<note place="margin">Eccle. xxxiiii.</note> the bread of the nedy
is the life of the poore: he that defraudeth
him of it, is a murtherer and a manslaier.
What then is to be thought of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
take awaie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ministers of the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
worde, the Tithe corne, whereof thei
should haue bread to eate, and to giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the nedie? Is not this to plaie the part
of a murtherer? The nedie Pastour &amp; his
familie, would gladly eate bread, and the
corne, whereof it should be made, is taken
awaie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and vnfruitfully consumed
and deuoured of those, whiche do no good

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
those dueties to the owners, though
their delicate fare should somewhat be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
thereby, then to goe foorthe thus
wickedly to retain, that is not their own.
What doeth it profite a man, saieth our
Sauioure Christe, to winne the whole
worlde, and to lose his soule. it is truelie
saied of the Wiseman: Better is a little

then greater treasures with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe.
Moreouer, the blessed Apostle S.
Paule in the description of a bishoppe, or
spirituall Pastour, sheweth, that he ought
to bee a maintainer of hospitalitie. Now
what hospitalitie can there bee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
where those thynges are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaie,
that cheefly vphold, and maintaine hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie,

remaineth behinde, wherewith the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour

and to releeue either hym self, or any

maie not then the Spirituall minister be
called <hi>Pastor a pascendo, sicut mons a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uendo?</hi>
God haue mercie on vs, and sende

            <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">Malach. iii.</note> God by his Prophete
commaundeth, that all maner of Tithes
should bee brought into his Barne, that
there maie be meate in his house? Is not
the Pastours Barne, his Barne? And is
not the Pastours house, his house? Now
God commaundeth that all tithes should
be brought into the Pastours barne, that
there may be meate in the Pastors house.
But how can there bee meate in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
house, whiche God calleth his owne
