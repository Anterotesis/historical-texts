            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TRuth never had that advantage nor countenance from
the men of this world, (though wise in their generation)
(since sin entered into it) to have the approbation of the World,
neither of the powers and Potentates thereof, for it alwaies hated
the truth, because it bore witness against the World, and the deeds
and works thereof which are evil; <hi>for Wisdom is only justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of her Children;</hi> and Truth is justified of her Children:
neither indeed doth it need any other Patron to shelter it self
under, but the God of all Truth, from whence it proceeds; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall I seek a shelter, neither run to any mountain or hill
for safety or protection, nor to the mighty of the Earth, as many
of latter dayes have done to Patronize their Labours, and to
make them the more acceptable, and to be the sooner and more
readily received: But seeing the Apostle saith, <hi>Not many
wise, not many rich, not many noble are chosen, but he
hath chosen the weak and poor, and despised of the world,
who are rich in Faith and good works, who are heirs of
the promise, and of the world to come.</hi> I chuse only to be
approved to the witness of Christs light in every mans Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and to the measure of his holy Spirit which he hath placed
in every man, to that only I desire to be either approved, or by
it reproved, for wholly unto the judgment of that in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
I appeal, and do commend this ensuing Discourse, in the
sight of God, and the Answer unto <hi>A. Smalwood</hi>'s Book, who
hath sought to make void Christs command, for to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of men, as is manifest in his Epistle Dedicatory to the
Gentlemen of <hi>Cumberland:</hi> For it seems by his Epistle they
put him on work, to Preach and Print this Sermon, whether
<pb facs="tcp:94649:3"/>
upon this subject or not I shall not determine, but however he
sayes he hath obeyed their commands; though he hath laboured
as much as in him lies to make the command of Christ void, and
the Apostles Doctrine by his Arguments which he hath raised
to prove <hi>Christs Doctrine</hi> one thing, and his <hi>intention</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and so would blind the minds of people, only to establish the
Doctrines of men, and the Traditions of men in the Apostacy,
and hath put divers Constructions upon the plain words of the
Scripture and interpretation to prove his false Assertion that he
laid down at the first, that <hi>Christ did not forbid all swearing;</hi>
I say I could have willingly have been silent rather then to be
found over and over again contending with every new opposer,
of those old truths, that have been believ'd and received long
before the Apostacy entered in, which hath been answer'd (by
that People I own, in judgment and conversation) long ago; to
let pass those disadvantages, we have adventered upon; our
<hi>low persecuted, imprisoned,</hi> and in a manner <hi>condemned
condition,</hi> so that we may exspect our words, how true soever,
yet they are not like to gain much credit against such an eminent
man as <hi>Doctor Smallwood.</hi> Again, considering how we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our selves to the lash and severity of a sharp law, which some
men in their blind zeal are far more ridged and severe in their
<hi>Prosecution</hi> of it then I am apt to believe the <hi>supream enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi>
of it were in their <hi>intentions</hi> when they did inact it; all
which notwithstanding are no discouragement unto me, for as
much as the internal and eternal truth of our God, which we
have known, received and believed, is very precious in our eyes,
yea, far more then either life or liberty, and estate, (which some
have forfeited and lost upon Truths account) or any external
treasure, or outward enjoyment whatsoever, so that considering
how the truth lies at stake we cannot be silent, least thereby we
should appear to some mens apprehensions, as to be satisfied with
what the Doctor hath said, and own his Arguments &amp; Reasons
<pb facs="tcp:94649:3"/>
that he hath laid down for possitive truth; I could do no less
then to show our dislike of his Doctrine, and to manifest the
weakness of his Arguments about this particular of <hi>Swearing
at all,</hi> under the Gospel, though he hath strained very hard to
prove his Assertion, that Oaths may lawfully he taken by Christi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans
in some cases, notwithstanding <hi>Christs prohibition</hi> and
command to the contrary, but of how little effect or force his
Reasons are thou wilt see in the ensuing Discourse, although his
Book be looked upon by some, to be sufficient force to convince all
<hi>gain-sayers,</hi> and although he say he hath had divers Papers and
Books of Dissenters, who are of a contrary judgment, where he
found any <hi>Reason offered</hi> against what he hath laid down for
Doctrine, he hath answered, though indeed he hath <hi>over-riden</hi>
the most weighty matters in them, and hath said little but that
hath been said before by other opposers of Christs Doctrine;
though its very like the <hi>Doctor</hi> will count this but a loose <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi>
as he hath done others of very great weight, (yea indeed
of <hi>more weight and reason</hi> in them then any thing, he hath
<hi>exhibited,</hi> yet to the contrary) and so count it not worth taking
notice of; but though he do not, it is not of much moment, for
that end only I have writ, to bear my testimony for Christs
Doctrine against all the false and feigned interpretations of men,
being that which I have stedfastly believed, and is of that
force and weight upon many Consciences, and so evident by the
Spirit of Christ, that they can receive nothing of mans faln
reason and conceptions which are variable and changable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
or weigh down the Doctrine of Christ, and his Apostles,
and Primitive Christians, who walked in the order of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and obeyed the Commands of Christ before the Apostacy
entered in, and the <hi>power was lost,</hi> and the life and Spirit of
Christ <hi>erred from</hi>) and mingled the Ordinances of the first and
second Covenant together, and the injunctions of men among
them for Doctrine, and then compelled all to receive it, all this
<pb facs="tcp:94649:4"/>
long time of <hi>Antichrists reign,</hi> and the false <hi>Church visibility,</hi>
wherein she hath sitten as a <hi>Queen</hi> upon the Waters, which are
the <hi>Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People,</hi> which <hi>A. S.</hi>
brings as a great argument to prove Swearing in use among
Christians since Christ gave out that command, <hi>Swear not at
all.</hi> The reasons the very strength of them, I have laid down
as <hi>A. S.</hi> hath published them, without varying from his own
words; the Answer thou may peruse and read without prejudice,
and weigh with the measure of Gods Spirit in thy self, for unto
that I appeal, which is a more certain thing then <hi>Councils,</hi> or
<hi>Nations,</hi> or <hi>Consent</hi> of <hi>multi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Christian, and walks not in his Doctrine, neither lives his
life, nor doth the things he saith, I am shut up in a corner, and
have not that advantage that some opposers have of others la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as to bring Authors of divers Ages that denied to Swear,
though not only some there were but many; but alas, they are
condemned already by <hi>A. S.</hi> and others for <hi>Phanaticks</hi> and
<hi>Heteradox,</hi> and so their sayings, will seem of less force, but
however, I have not much striven, neither shall to fetch things
from far in the Apostacy, but rest in that which makes all things
evident, even the spirit of God in thy own heart and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Truth, which was spoken by the Spirit, which are so
clear unto many, that there needs not multitude of words, to
demonstrate this truth of the prohibition of all Oaths among
true Christians; but I shall not detain thee from the matter it
self, and the Lord give thee an understanding.</p>

            <p>THere being a Book lately published by <hi>A. Smalwood. D. D.</hi>
as I understand Doctor of Divinity; first preached in a
Sermon at <hi>Carlile,</hi> I suppose before the Judges at the
Assizes then holden the 17 <hi>th.</hi> day of <hi>August, 1664.</hi> since
which I perceive many Additions, by reasons and paraphrases are
added thereunto, and printed at <hi>York:</hi> In which Discourse he
hath vindicated the lawfulness of Swearing under the Gospel, and
hath gone about to prove it by many reasons, and Authors; how
that Christ upon that subject, <hi>Mat. 5. 34. <hi>Swear not at all,</hi>
               </hi>
did not intend an absolute universal prohibition of all manner of
swearing under the Gospel; which Book of his I have perused
with an upright heart, and an impartial eye, seriously, to the end
I might own that which is good in it, not as one being glued to an
opinion or judgment; but what as carries demonstration of truth
with it upon my conscience and in my heart; it being a principle
well known and believed amongst us, to have our consciences void
of offence towards God, and towards Man: and seeing my self
and many more are great sufferers at this day upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
which I look upon, being truly and conscientiously ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> and consonant to the <hi>Primitive
Christians,</hi> and seeing so large things have been written by other
hands in asserting the truth of what we have believed, which yet
stands as a witness unto the Doctrine of Christ; notwithstanding
all opposition and gain-saying, that it hath had by many hands;
I could have been wholly silent, and have refered all that have
been said to the judgment of the Lord, and to that of God in
every Mans conscience; but that I perceive <hi>A. Smalwood</hi> hath
rendred that People which I own in judgment, and practise, to be
in error, and hath greatly gain-sayed and villified all such as ever
did or do deny <hi>Swearing</hi> upon never so conscientious account; as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94649:5"/>
erroneous, and as only sprung from the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacheus,</hi>
and I know not who, and have rendred all with reproach
and disdain, as <hi>Phanaticks</hi> who discent from him, with disdainful,
and reproachful names, to represent us as odious as may be to the
Magistrate, and at such a time as this, when tender and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
people, who fear the Lord in their hearts, (and desires to
live and be at peace, and seeks it with all Men) are sufferers, and
great sufferers too; upon this very account, whereby many are
stired up to more persecution and wrath against us: and besides
this Discourse it seemes is cryed up, as the most exquisite that
ever was, or can be; and as unanswerable, and that we who deny
to swear, would abolish all judicable proceedings, and make them
nothing; this Discourse is printed, as <hi>A. S.</hi> in his 12. page sayes,
to induce us to forsake so irrational an opinion, and to convince
us of our error; and it seemes he himself, besides many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
it must effect some great matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I say all these things being considered, was a strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
to me, to write something in reply thereunto, though
in very deed I love not contention, neither strife about words,
but seeing it is the Doctrine of Christ, and that which hath been,
and is stedfastly believed by divers faithful Professors, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
both formerly and now, however by <hi>A. Smalwood</hi> accounted
and reproached by that disdainful name of <hi>Phanaticks;</hi> a word
lately invented in the Pit of Darkness, where many of those and
the like reproaches come from; I was engaged in my heart, to
hear my testimony against this said Book, and for the truth of
Christs Doctrine; not out of <hi>obstinacy</hi> and <hi>wilfulness,</hi> but in duty
as by conscience to God and his truth; which is dearer to me
then my outward liberty or all I have to loose for it, which I and
many more at this day choose rather to suffer, then to be found
violating the commands of Christ, or deny that which I have
stedfastly believed; being perswaded thereunto by the spirit of
the Lord, and evidence of the Scripture of truth.</p>
            <p>The subject <hi>A. Smalwood</hi> hath taken to treat upon, and in the
end to gain-say, and pervert; are no less then Christs own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<hi>Mat. 5. 34. <hi>But I say unto you swear not at all:</hi>
               </hi> who
would have believed or thought that one who accounts himself a
Doctor, a Divine, and a Minister of Christ, should choose <hi>Christs</hi>
own words to plead against <hi>Christ,</hi> and them that do abide in his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94649:5"/>
               <hi>Doctrine?</hi> or that ever any should go about to prove swearing
lawful from these words in Gospel times, or that swearing is not
forbiden; but what would not this Man encounter with? or
what would not he oppose? if he have but the power of this
World on his side? it is a small thing to gain-say <hi>what we say,</hi> and
pervert our words, and make them seem erroneous, and to make
our intentions one thing, and our words another; when he is so
bold as to make Christs Doctrine, his express words <hi>Swear not
at all,</hi> and his <hi>intentions</hi> contrary to his words, what do we judg
of a Man that speaks one thing, and intends another? it's fearful
to think what conclusions some will make to carry on their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
designes, but me thinks <hi>A. S.</hi> might have been more considerate
then to have taken Christs own <hi>Doctrine</hi> and words, to oppose
Christs <hi>intention,</hi> or to be so bold as to assert the <hi>intention</hi> of
Christ was otherwise then his words <hi>import;</hi> but rather have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
some other subject; but what matter makes many of subjects,
for with a consequence or two, and a little Logick, they will seem
to turn things any way, and go about to prove <hi>darkness is light,
and light is darkness,</hi> and what as in them lyes make it so to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
if they take a matter in hand; and therefore the Apostle
exhorted <hi>to beware of Phylosophy and vain deceit,</hi> for by this Men
have been cuning and crafty, <hi>and lie in wait to deceive the Innocent
and harmless and to lead them out of the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth page he saith, he will clear his intention, and that
there are two sorts of Men that do violence to this Text; the
one winds it up too too high a note, as though Christ had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
all Swearing whatsoever. And in the tenth page he saith, this
error is masked under a fair colour of a more then ordinary
piety, but tends to overthrow all <hi>Judicatures,</hi> and takes away
the decision of all emergent suites and controversies; and were it
granted saith <hi>A. Smallwood,</hi> we should be necessitated if not to
disown the Magistrates authority, yet to disobey their loyal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
as having a countermand from Christ, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> and
the other sort of men are such who in despight of this text do
commonly, rashly, prophanely and falsely swear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Who doth the greater violence to this Scripture? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>A. S.</hi> who in his Doctrine he hath raised from these words to
be the foundation of his Discourse, who makes Christs plain and
express words one thing, and his intentions another: I leave to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94649:6"/>
all unbyassed spirits to judge off, or they that say, Christ intended
what he spoke, and spoke what he intended, I say let all see and
consider where the violence lies, and in whom, and whether he
doth not wind it up <hi>by that not,</hi> or <hi>contrary to it,</hi> to use his own
words otherwise then Christ intends it, as after will be made more
evidently to appear, and we say its not error but truth to believe
Christs words, who are truth, more then <hi>A. S.</hi> his conjectural
supposition, neither do we believe it, to be error masked, but
truth revealed, and Christ spoke and declared it, that we might
beleive it and obey it: And we believe that <hi>A. S.</hi> and many more
hath put a <hi>mask</hi> and a <hi>vail</hi> upon Christs words, and would <hi>hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink</hi>
all, and lead them blindfold after their imaginations, and
crooked pathes, winding and turning this way and that way that
leads into darkness and trouble, and confusion, from the path of
life: And what doth Christs command? <hi>viz. Swear not at all;</hi>
doth it overthrow all Justice and Judicatories? It is not the seat
of Judgment established in Righteousness and truth? and they
that sit in Judgment ought they not to give sentence and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

little added afflictions unto our bonds, and they have made wide
the wound, and hath made the breach seem greater then it is, and
the matter more grievous then there hath been any cause for, I
desire they may consider of it and repent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in 13. page, from this Text,</hi> Mat. 5. 34. But I say unto
you Swear not at all; <hi>he layes down this Proposition or Doctrine,</hi>
viz. Our Saviour did not intend by these words, Swear not at all, an
absolute, universal and limited prohibition of all manner of swearing,
and goes on to prove it by divers Reasons.</p>
            <p>The first he gives is, That the Father and the Son are one in
nature, power, wisdom, immutability, and eternity, and one,
in will and wisdom, therefore they cannot give forth contrary
commands, but God the Father hath commanded Swearing, in
these words, <hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord and swear by his Name and
serve him, Deut.</hi> 6. 13. And therefore it is not possible that God
the Son should forbid it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the Father and the Son be one in nature, power
and wisdom, and immutability, and will, as in themselves, and
alters not, but keeps <hi>Covenant</hi> from age to age, and from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to generation, there is no contrarity in them, <hi>yet there are
diversities of gifts but the same spirit, and there are differences of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations
but the same Lord.</hi> It is granted that after sin entred
into the World, and death by sin and diffidence, and unbelief, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
and strife, and many transgressions, for which <hi>the Law</hi> was
added; and because of which <hi>the Law was added,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
given forth unto the <hi>Jewes</hi> to swear by the Name of God,
as <hi>Jerome</hi> saith upon the 5. of <hi>Mat. 3. 37. It was permitted the
Jewes under the Law,</hi> as being tender and infants, (and to keep
<hi>them from Idolatry,</hi> which the rest of the Nations did run into)
<hi>they might swear by the Name of God, not that it was rightful so to do
but that it was better to swear by the Lord then by false Gods or devils:</hi>
but the great Evangelical sincerity and truth admits not of an
Oath.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the ending of strife and variance being in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94649:7"/>
unbelief, which was the occasion of the adding of the Law, and
the cause of the command given forth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. with divers
more words specified by <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets:</hi> And though
Christ came not to destroy the Law but to fulfill it, and to <hi>destroy</hi>
that which the <hi>Law was against,</hi> (and which it took hold upon)
and <hi>to finish sin</hi> and transgression, and bring in everlasting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and to restore to the beginning, and we say according as
we have believed and received of the Lord, and have a cloud of
Witnesses, both them that are gone before, and of them that yet
remain alive: As Christ said of <hi>Divorcement,</hi> It was not so from
<hi>the beginning;</hi> so we say, <hi>Oaths</hi> was not from the <hi>beginning,</hi> but
was added after hardness of heart and sin, and unbelief, entered
into the World; but <hi>Christ who was made under the Law and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the Law,</hi> put an end to the <hi>transgression, sin, unbelief, variance,
and strife,</hi> in whom all the promises of God are fulfilled, he is the
Righteousness of God, and who are true Christians indeed are
come out of unbelief, variance, and <hi>transgression,</hi> and doth see and
know Christ to be the end of the Law, for <hi>Righteousness to them
that believe,</hi> who exhorted to do the truth, confess the truth, and
speak the truth, who said, <hi>Swear not at all by Heaven,</hi> and which
after more shall be said God willing to the Text it self: And so
<hi>A. Smallwood</hi> his reason is made void, and his impossibility made
possible, that God gave forth a command, and permitted the <hi>Iews</hi>
to swear in that Covenant and Ministration, and yet Christ in the
new Covenant countermands it as in the Text, being the Minister
of a better Covenant which stood upon better promises, who
leads to the beginning, and is the restorer of all Mankind that do
believe; and yet the Father and the Son are one in will, wisdom
and power. And though <hi>A. S.</hi> and others cannot understand, or
else hath no mind in that Latitude as generally prohibitive of all
swearing; because he says, God did require it, no less then he did
his own <hi>Worship and service</hi> in the Moral Law; these nice distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Moral, Judicial and Ceremonial hath confounded Peoples
understandings, though it is still acknowledged they did vow, and
did swear in the first Covenant under the Law; but whether he
or any other making, swearing, moral, judicial or ceremonial is
not much matter, seeing that Christ the Righteousness is the
summe and substance of all, and the end of the Law for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
to them that do believe, &amp; in him is life and Righteousness
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94649:7"/>
enjoyed; for the Law was given by <hi>Moses,</hi> but the <hi>Grace,</hi> the
<hi>Truth cometh by Jesus Christ,</hi> who is the summe of all <hi>types</hi> and
<hi>shadowes,</hi> and therefore the Apostle said, <hi>We are circumcised in
him, and baptised in him;</hi> and we do look upon an Oath under the
Law to have some type and figure in it, notwithstanding <hi>A. S.</hi> say
it was none, and that Christ is improperly called the Oath of
God, no more <hi>improper</hi> then he is a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Way,</hi> a <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">For he is called Gods Covenant, Isa. 55. 3 and GOD'S Covenant is his oath which he sware, Luk. 1. 72, 73.</note> for all the Promises are fulfilled in
Him, and are yea, and amen: And as for the
morality of it so far as it is Moral and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
to all under the Gospel, is in <hi>confession of
truth, and bearing witness thereunto</hi> as before the
Lord, or in his presence, and speaking the
truth when there is necessity, as when any mans
person or Estate, or any part thereof is in danger, and this we
have ever owned, and do own, and have, and are ready to testifie
the truth before the Lord, or in his presence as concerning any
matter which concernes the Glory of God, or the good of our
Neighbour without being pinched or bound up to a certain form
of words imposed upon us, but according as necessity requires,
so amply and largely as our words may give knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and light in any matter which is to be desired, but this
hath been denyed, and hath not been received by this unbelieving
generation, who seeks rather to establish the Traditions and
Customes of Men, rather then the Evangelical Doctrine of the
Gospel.</p>
            <p>And though <hi>Doctor Smallwood</hi> will needs have it, viz. <hi>swearing,</hi>
neither to be <hi>ceremonial</hi> nor <hi>judicial,</hi> but for any proof he brings
for ought I see it may be either as well as that he calls <hi>moral,</hi> for
sure I am that <hi>Oathes</hi> was used<note n="*" place="margin">Deutrono. 19. 16. Exod. 20. 10.</note> in <hi>judicial</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were used in the worship of
God and his service then, and by Commandement;
and the service of God, and his worship, I hope he
will say is moral; yet so as under the Law, it was not without
ceremony, and it is concluded by the most learned that there
was some ceremony, or figure, or signe in that Covenant, in all
the worship, and some shadowes of good things to come, (then
if swearing was any part of the worship of God) as the most do
grant, and assert, and I think <hi>A. S.</hi> will hardly deny, then I argue
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94649:8"/>
it had some Ceremony or shadow in it: but oh this <hi>A. S.</hi> cannot
away with in this point of swearing, but it must needs be all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
for fear he should waken his matter that he hath taken in hand
to war against Christs command; but it is evident that swearing
was used in <hi>judicial proceedings,</hi> as is manifest, <hi>Deutr. 19. 5. about
killing of a Man accedentally,</hi> and the 11. verse, <hi>about murther,</hi> and
the 14. verse <hi>about Land-markes,</hi> and in the 21. <hi>life for life, eye for
eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot,</hi> about all these
things and many more, and in the 16. verse <hi>about a false witness</hi>
(were to be decided and tryed by witnesses before the Judges)
and judgment was to be given according to the several commands
about the aforesaid different transgressions, all which Statutes
belonged to their judicial proceedings, as this about swearing,
and as is manifest in this Chapter; and all of these commands
seemes to have as much morality in them, as swearing hath in the
judgment of many, unto whose judgment I leave what I say, to
be weighed by the spirit of God in them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Law sayed many things by way of precept and
commission (at least <hi>permission</hi> from God, which would be <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities</hi>
grosly reproveable in Mens <hi>manners in moral matters,
conversations, civil transactions, and communications,</hi> should they be
used among them who profess the Gospel, the Law said an eye
for an eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot; the
Gospel saith <hi>avenge not your selves, resist not evil,</hi> suffer wrong, put
up, <hi>forgive, forbear,</hi> The Law said, <hi>thou shalt love thy neighbour, and
hate thy enemy;</hi> But <hi>A. S.</hi> will look upon this as an addition or
false interpretation to the Law it may be, but how ever certain
it is that under the Law they made war, the <hi>Jewes</hi> with <hi>Amaleck</hi>
with <hi>Moab,</hi> with <hi>Ammon,</hi> and the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and the <hi>Aegiptians</hi>
might be spoyled, but the Gospel said only <hi>love your enemies, if he
be hungry feed him, if he be thirsty give him to drink,</hi> and for any
thing I can see the aforesaid <hi>commands were as morall, and had as
much morality in them as swearing,</hi> what ever <hi>A. S.</hi> say or can say:
In the 7th. Section <hi>A. S.</hi> sayes if any argue that Christ abolished
the Ceremonial and Judicial Lawes once commanded by God, he
sayes he denyes that assertion, for we were never under the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Law, it being solely given to the <hi>Jewes</hi> for the regulating
their Common-wealth in the Land of <hi>Canaan, Deutro.</hi> 4. 14. and
they were never obligatory to us that are no <hi>Jewes,</hi> nor never
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94649:8"/>
dwelt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and as for the Ceremonial it was meerly tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
and ceased at our Saviours death, and was not abrogated,
but observed by him in his life, neither can it properly be said to
be repealed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Though I do not argue that Christ abolished the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
and Judicial Laws once commanded, nor abrogated them:
yet Bishop <hi>Gauden</hi> doth, who attain'd, if not to a degree of
knowledge and learning, yet to a degree of promotion above
<hi>A. S.</hi> in his Book which he wrote for the information of the
<hi>Quakers</hi> about swearing, he saith in his own words, <hi>Christ came
to fulfill the Moral Law, however he came in a way of fulfilling to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
the Ceremonial, yea and the Politick Lawes too,</hi> belonging to
the <hi>Jewes</hi> policy in Church and State; and herein is the Bishop
and the Doctor at odds, the Bishop said, he abrogated the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law, and Judicial Law too, belonging to the <hi>Iewes</hi> Policy
and State: But Doctor <hi>Smallwood</hi> says, he denies his Assertion;
for says he, We were never under the Judicial Law, and what was
never imposed need not be abolished: So then what remains for
me to say but this, If Swearing was any part of the <hi>Iudicial Law,</hi>
or did belong to their <hi>Political Estate,</hi> as it is the judgment of
many, but it is evident that swearing was used by the witness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Iudges in Israel</hi> in those days to try out their matters accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to commandment given of God, as is evident from 19. <hi>Deut.</hi>
in the whole Chapter, and divers other places then by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>A. S.</hi> hath made, he hath overthrown himself; for he saith, we
are no <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and so never imposed; and what was
never imposed need no abolishing; and it is as I have said, manifest
that Oaths had relation to <hi>judicial proceedings,</hi> and to the <hi>service of
God too in that Covenant,</hi> which was shadowy, and consisted much
in outward signes and figures, but the substance is Christ. So then
instead of proving swearing under the Gospel lawful, he hath by
his argument proved it never injoyned unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> neither
indeed was it, either ever commanded or commended unto the
Gentiles who believed, or they reproved for not observing it that
ever we read of by Christ or his Apostles, or Ministers in the first
and purest times of Christianity, <hi>for to</hi> Jacob <hi>he gave his Law, and
to</hi> Israel <hi>his Statutes; to every Nation he did not so,</hi> no not to <hi>Moab,
Ammon,</hi> nor the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> neither the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and though he
seem to plead hard for swearing under the Gospel, yet he falls
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94649:9"/>
short in his proof, except he took his own reasons and arguments
which divers of them are but imaginary, &amp; in the foundation of his
discourse he hath taken such great compass, as there is not an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
unlimited prohibition of all manner</hi> of <hi>Swearing;</hi> but what this
manner of swaring is, it is very uncertain, somtimes he makes it this,
and sometimes that, sometimes he saith it is no Oath, though in the
form thereof there be not I swear, or God be not named, or <hi>by God</hi>
doth not always signifie an Oath; and other where he seems to
affirm it to be an Oath, but when an impartial eye hath sounded
and tryed to the bottom what this swearing is that brings so much
glory to God, and so much good to our Neighbour, that he so
vehemently contends for that ought to be observed as well as
Gods <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>service,</hi> (it is but their own traditions and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for that under the Law will not serve (as the Lord lives) or
that he calls swearing under the Gospel will not serve, (the Lord
is witness) <hi>or I speak the truth in Christ;</hi> or this is truth in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, or the like, none of these will serve: But though
he and the Rulers do say they are Oaths, yet when at any time we
have proffered willingly to declare the truth in this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
cause, or to make as ample confession in demonstration for
clearing any cause in debate, that hath either conduced to the
glory of God, or the good and profit of any particular Man in the
Nation among whom we converse, and not without some attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, or of his wisdom, power, and presence, yet it would
never yet he received but reckoned as insufficient, though both
the Rulers of this age, and <hi>A. S.</hi> have sayed it, it might be that
in private it might, but in Judicature never was received, though
I do believe the most doth believe we dare not lie in ordinary
communication, much less in Judicature, yet we have been set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
as objects of wrath, as deluded <hi>erronious, factious, seditious,
contemners</hi> of Law, <hi>obstructors</hi> of <hi>legal proceedings,</hi> except we would
lay our hand upon a Bible and kiss it, and say, I swear, and by the
Contents of the Book, and so help me God, or else fined, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
for term of life, our Lands and Goods confiscated, and we
sentenced to be banished, our Wives and Children ruinated, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and Wife parted, Children and Parents separated, and such
<hi>monsters of Christians</hi> have we to deal withal in this age, and how
many brought into this sad condition in <hi>England,</hi> as little <hi>A. S.</hi>
knows as cares. But for ought I know that he and such as he, in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94649:9"/>
such publick discourses as this of his hath blown the sparks and
hath kindled a flame in the Rulers, and incensed them, and stirred
them up to severity and harshness against them who fear the Lord,
and doth maintain peace with all Men as much as in them lyeth,
and keeps their Consciences void of offence towards God, which
makes us to chuse rather all this hardship then to offend the Lord,
who serve and fear his Name, and reverence it more then they
who seem to honour it, and pretends Gods honour thorow their
swearing. But to make amends for this, <hi>A. S.</hi> he saith, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
must act by the Law, and that enjoynes such a forme of
swearing and they cannot allow it.</p>
            <p>Unto that I answer, it had been a more necessary discourse for
<hi>A. S.</hi> to have exhorted the Magistrates, if the Law had been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in the substance, not to be so severe in the forme, and also
to have told them where any Law was made contrary to the Law
of God, either in matter or forme: The Consciences of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
could not yield obedience thereunto, when it was repugnant
unto the Law of God, and not according to the forme thereof,
and in such cases to be wary, and he and the rest of the Clergy to
have advised with the Rulers and Law-makers, and to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
them from whom they receive such great incomes, and
revenues, (for the preservation and peace of all Men) that they
need not stand so much upon the forme, seeing that so many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
people questioned it, so that there needed not such ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to forme, under such great and heavy penalties, as banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
confiscation, and perpetual imprisonment, but have inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them so that the truth might have been found out, and no
<hi>judicial proceedings hindered,</hi> which I am sure may be without any
swearing, <hi>true testimony never being denyed,</hi> when required by any
Magistrate, and let bua a penalty be upon him that gives <hi>false evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
or <hi>speakes an untruth</hi> about any proceedings in <hi>judicature,</hi>
or otherwise called to bear evidence in any controversie, if found
out, let them suffer as them that <hi>sweares falsely,</hi> and as <hi>perjured,</hi>
and the case is one, and here all scruples, and contentions about
swearing would end, and there would not be the least obstruction
in <hi>legal proceedings,</hi> or in <hi>administration of justice,</hi> and let me tell
<hi>Doctor Smallwood,</hi> and the rest of his Brethren, that if they would
move such a thing in <hi>Parliament,</hi> peradventure it would be readily
received from them, and in so doing, they would do as acceptable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94649:10"/>
a piece of service, and as well pleasing to God, and would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
as much to the peace and tranquility of the Nation, as any
thing that ever they will do in their age, or hath been effected
many ages, and so all these heart-burnings, contentions, and evil
surmisings, and evil representing one another would cease and
end, and which if not effected, nothing can be looked for but
sad suffering, and great oppression and persecution, which will
provoke the Lord to anger, and ever did against all them that
were the cause of it in ages past, but I come to his second Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Second Argument. Some without any colour, reason or possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of proof, will need have swearing a Ceremonial write, but
God ranks it with his fear and service, therefore it must needs be
moral, and therefore what at all times, as well under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
as under the Law, as well amongst the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
tends to the glory of God, that is not a <hi>Ceremonial Ordinance,</hi>
nor forbiden by Christ, but such is swearing, and therefore it
cannot be thought to be prohibited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> to this. It hath been said and often asserted that all the
ten words and Commandements were moral and perpetual, as
well under the Gospel as under the Law; then I wonder what
<hi>A. S.</hi> and divers others intends to do with the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if it be moral and perpetual and to be observed, in the
same manner and with the same service, as then commanded, and
the same day and time, then he and most of them who contend
most for the morality of these ten Commandments, are great
transgressors, and if he grant there was something Ceremonial in
it, and typical or figurative, which then was the <hi>seventh day,</hi>
which was given for a signe, (of the <hi>Worlds rest from its labour</hi>)
and of keeping after it an <hi>everlasting Sabbath</hi> to the Lord, by
Mans <hi>cessation</hi> from his own works, as God did from his, <hi>Isai.</hi> 58.
and the last <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. which <hi>Iewish</hi> observation of the seventh day as
a Sabbath now, though never so solemnly, as then commanded,
will have no acceptation at all, no more then he, and he as much
(that is none at all) that never so solemnly <hi>swears</hi> by the name of
God, in such ceremonious ways as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did of old, (or goes
beyond the bare asseveration or testimony of truth, with some
attestation of Gods power and veracity which hath never been
denyed) which to do, we do not only think but know it to be a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94649:10"/>
superfluous Ceremony of Judaism) not to say brat of <hi>Jewish</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
as <hi>A. S.</hi> doth) now circumcised and cut off from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
by Christ, and what though God did, <hi>Deutro.</hi> 10. 20. rank
it with his fear and service, was there any service or worship in
that Covenant, that had not some signe and shadow in it, and was
Ceremonial, and was to end in the substance, was there not
prayer, and praysing, and were not these service and worship,
and had these not the Ceremony of Incense and Sacrifice, which
then attended these Services, but the substance was lifting up of
the heart unto the Lord, and making a melody in the heart, and
circumcision is now that of the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. which was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
before, <hi>the killing of a Lamb</hi> at the Passeover was an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in that Covenant, the substance thereof is <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over;</hi>
the other now under the Gospel would be no more then
cutting of a <hi>Dogs neck,</hi> these were all Ordinances of God to be
observed, and in their time and day, and they that did according
to the command of God, tended to the glory of God, in that
first Covenant, but in the second under the Gospel, whosoever
should observe them, in the Figure, Ceremony, and shadow should
much dishonour God and his Christ the substance, and Christ
would profit him nothing, see that Ceremony of swearing, the
morality that only abides under the Gospel <hi>is testifying the known
truth from the heart,</hi> with some attestation of God to witnesse,
who is witness of all we do or say, and that no more then <hi>confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
or <hi>deniall, by yea or nay</hi> which is no oath, is that standing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and the moral, if <hi>A. S.</hi> will have it called so that remaines
under the Gospel, which answers that ceremonious way of swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the Law, which is most evident by the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi>
rendring of that <hi>terme</hi> swearing as it was spoken in way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
concerning its continuance, then <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 23. To me every
tongue shall swear under that <hi>tearm confessing</hi> only under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<hi>Rom. 14. 11. Every knee shall bow, every tongue shall confess
to God, confession</hi> under the Gospel is made equivolent with an
oath under the Law, but this rendring of it <hi>A. S.</hi> doth not like,
but would pervert <hi>Pauls</hi> words to have it confession, (but put
to his own addition) by oath so that his Argument is void, swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was binding in that ceremonious way which it was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the Law, but not under the Gospel, nor among the
Christians, who are come to the substance, and to confess and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94649:11"/>
speak the truth in Christ to the glory of God acknowledging his
power and <hi>omnisciency,</hi> and his <hi>justice</hi> in discerning whether truth
be spoken, and in punishing them that speak falsely, and his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in discerning the secrets of all hearts, and <hi>A S.</hi> might as
well have said that offrings and oblations and sacrifice tends much
to the glory of God under the Gospel as under the Law as swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but saith he swearing is a part of Gods peculiar service, that
is incommunicable to any creature, the like I say of the former,
offring and sacrifice, and incense, was incommunicable to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but was due unto God alone; yet it doth not follow as well
under the Gospel, as under the Law, for that were to set up the
figure and deny the substance, so this second Argument is insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and the third is somewhat related to it, which I now come
unto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. This third Argument is, that if Christs purpose be
utterly to abolish all swearing as an illegitimate brat of <hi>Jewish</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
not to be admitted into the Christian Church, then it
must be either as it is repugnant to our duty to God, or else to
our neighbour, for into that summary he hath contracted the
whole Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> We must still distinguish that which was once a duty to
be performed under the Law, because commanded, is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as a duty under the Gospel, and the strength of most of <hi>A. S.</hi>
his Arguments, and the rest who contend for swearing under the
Gospel, are grounded upon the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, though this of
oathes he will needs have to be moral; it may be he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
as much for the morality of Tithes and Oblations, if it had
been the subject of his discourse, as for oathes, and them to be
<hi>jure divino,</hi> under the Gospel, for many such we have met with,
and he might bring the same Arguments for Tithes and Oblations,
they are not repugnant unto God, but brings glory to his name;
because hereby his Ministers under the Gospel are maintained,
and are enabled thereby to preach the Gospel for the conversion
of soules, which addes much to the glory of God, and therefore
cannot or are not to be prohibited, but these only belonged to
the Levitical Priesthood, and continued only to the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<hi>viz.</hi> to the bringing in of a better hope and a better
Covenant, which stood upon better promises for the Priesthood
being changed, there is also of necessity a change of the Law,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94649:11"/>
               <hi>Hebr. 6. 12.</hi> by which Tithes was a duty, and they robbed God
that detained them, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l. 3. 8.</hi> But this being ended and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in Christ the everlasting high Priest, who by one offering
perfected for ever them that are sanctified, he bid not his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
require Tithes as a due, or duty belonging to God, under
the Gospel, but freely you have received freely give, and what
House soever yee enter into that is worthy there abide, and eat
such things as is set before you, for the Workman is worthy of his
meat, and this was far more Evangelical, and conduced more to
the honour of God, then Tithes, and the Apostles lived more by
faith upon God, who provided for them, who was employed in
his service, so that I argue what was once a duty under the Law;
that was to be performed unto God, is not always a duty among
Christians, for though Oathes were commanded unto the <hi>Jewes</hi>
in that time of Infancy, and as being weak, and it was permitted
them, as <hi>Jerome</hi> saith upon the <hi>5th. Mat. vers. 37.</hi> to swear by
the name of God to keep them from Idolatry, seeing all other
Nations were given to Idolatry, and swear by false Gods, as
<hi>Chemosh, Ashterah,</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> he knew their aptness to be led aside
with the customes of other Nations, and therefore they were to
acknowledge him alone, who was the living God, and no other,
and to testifie truth by his Name, as a thing certain and sure, and
therefore one of their oathes was, <hi>as the Lord lives,</hi> and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest was one of the precepts of the Law, which was
added because of transgression, to swear by his name, which need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not have been added, if sin, and transgression, and unbelief had
not entered in, (mark this) and this Law of oathes pertained to
that part which was in the transgression, and variance, and strife,
and that led to worship Idols, and this continued while that <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
was <hi>standing,</hi> but <hi>Christ</hi> was revealed and given to finish sin,
and <hi>transgression,</hi> and <hi>unbelief,</hi> and to do away that part that <hi>lusted
after Idols,</hi> and that led into variance, and he leads out of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of evil, and from that which was the cause of the addition
of the Law unto <hi>everlasting righteousness</hi> again, which was in the
<hi>begining</hi> before sin entred, and they that come to believe in him
are not under the Law, but under grace, moreover the Apostle
saith, <hi>Rom. 7. 14. The Law hath power over a Man so long as be
liveth,</hi> even as a Wife is bound <hi>by the Law of her Husband so long as
he liveth,</hi> (and no longer) so as long as Man liveth <hi>in sin, unbelief,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94649:12"/>
transgression, discord, variance,</hi> and <hi>strife,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> the Law
hath power over him to correct and reprove him, and judge him,
and was to be a limit unto that nature; but Christ leades out of
the occasion of all these, for which the Law was added to do the
truth and speak the truth, and ceaseth strife, for which the Law
was added.</p>
            <p>Again, the Law was added as a cure and a remedy to defide
Controversies, and ill distempers, that was entred into the hearts
of Men, in the unbelief, and that is one reason which Doctor
<hi>Gauden</hi> gives, why solemn swearing should and ought to be in <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
proceedings</hi> among <hi>Christians,</hi> to take away Jealousies, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusts,
dissimulations, frauds, unsatisfactions and insecurities; and
quotes <hi>Grotius,</hi> that swearing is necessary, not <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
or <hi>preceptively,</hi> but by way of consequence and <hi>remedy,</hi> as to
the state of the <hi>Jewes</hi> we shall not, nor have not denyed it; but
as to the state of Christians who are truly such, we say that the
cause is taken away and the effect follows, all jealousies, distrusts,
dissimulations and strifes, and insecurities, and so the remedies, to
wit Oaths ceaseth, and the necessity of them, and that was one
main thing why Oaths were permitted to end strife, and strife is a
<hi>work</hi> of the <hi>flesh,</hi> and <hi>variance and discord,</hi> and it is inconsistent with
true love to our Neighbour to hold that which answers the strife,
and that part, for love <hi>fulfills the Law, works no ill to the Neighbour,
ends strife,</hi> and so puts <hi>swearing</hi> the means to end strife, and the
remedy out of <hi>place</hi> and <hi>date.</hi> But <hi>A. S.</hi> goes on and tells us that
Oaths advisedly and reverently taken upon necessary occasions are
so far from displeasing God, or hurting our Neighbour, that on the
contrary they are acceptable to the one, and advantagious to the
other, for by them <hi>Princes</hi> are secured of their <hi>Subjects Allegiance,</hi>
and <hi>Generals</hi> of their <hi>Souldiers</hi> fidelity, Leagues confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Nations, every Man's just right maintained, offenders dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and duly punished, and Controversies and Suits desided:
and these are such great and good ends that men cannot be in any
degree of security or happiness without them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> To this I answer, that notwithstanding all the great and
good ends, and the necessity of Oaths which <hi>A. S.</hi> conceives that
Men cannot subsist in any degree of security without, yet we see
by experience notwithstanding all the <hi>reverent</hi> taking, and all the
<hi>solemn</hi> taking, and the necessity that is put upon <hi>Oaths,</hi> yet they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94649:12"/>
have never answered the <hi>end purposed,</hi> for where perfidiousness and
unbelief, and distrust, and jealousies, and strifes are, (which is no
where so much) as among those that plead for swearing, yet
Oaths doth not, nor hath not bound them, when they had a mind
to be loos'd, &amp; sees that to stand to such obligations will not be for
their profit, or present safety, many instances might be given;
what security had the <hi>Pope</hi> when all the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Clergie</hi> in
<hi>England</hi> were bound to maintain his <hi>Supremacy</hi> by <hi>Oaths?</hi> and no
doubt but they swore reverently, and it was judged both by the
then <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> to be binding, and yet notwithstanding all
the <hi>Obligation,</hi> all was broken, and the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> denyed, in
the time of <hi>Hen. 8.</hi> and <hi>Edward 6th.</hi> in their time all swore against
the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> and how much se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
was the Nation in when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came to the Crown,
though the <hi>Nobles</hi> and the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> did all swear against
the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> yet behold it was brought in again, and confirmed
by Oath again; and yet in the days of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> renounced again,
and of latter days what Oaths have been exacted, first by one,
and then by another, and one party contrary to another, though
every party fancyed a security for the time, but it proved of no
more effect, neither were they in any degree more secure then if
there had been none at all; for indeed that frequent swearing
hath made men being got into a custome of it that it is become a
light thing unto them, though otherwise they look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as bound; Generals how have they turn'd one way, and
another way, and Souldiers the like; so that one may conclude
indeed that Oaths are made no more of but even to stand in force,
while (that bears up head and is exalted) that to please the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time and power they seem to be devoutly obliged to it, but
if it come under any <hi>eclipse</hi> or <hi>demunition,</hi> then they reckon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
no longer obliged; so that indeed their Oaths are becom'd
of little or no force at all; and for Controversies we see they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
many, and is the cause of much dissention and discord, but
ends few; for why may not all these foresaid States and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be secured, and as well, and the good and great ends accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
that <hi>A. S.</hi> pleads for by true evidence of every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in any of the foresaid relations, by <hi>declaring</hi> and <hi>confessing
the truth,</hi> and speaking it unto Men as necessity requires without
oath, yea and all the foresaid states have as much <hi>security,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94649:13"/>
as well, if not better, then by all this swearing, which more
properly belonged to the <hi>Judaism</hi> then to <hi>Christians,</hi> and there is
no such necessity of them among Christians if any at all, who dare
not <hi>swear</hi> for fear of offending <hi>Christ,</hi> or denying his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and
yet will not lie but speak the truth, and indeed it is the <hi>custome
of swearing,</hi> that have been used in the Nations since the <hi>Apostacy</hi>
entered in, that is more looked upon then any thing else, more then
any <hi>legality, necessity,</hi> or <hi>security,</hi> under the Gospel seeing in the
Primitive times truly so called, it was enough to say, <hi>Christianus
sum,</hi> and that sort of swearing that is imposed now hath no other
ground but custome, which <hi>Jer. 10. 3.</hi> is accounted to be vain,
neither hath it so much as an inch of ground from the Scripture,
and therefore doth not bring so much glory to God as <hi>A. S.</hi> tells
on, because whatsoever is added or superadded to whatever God
commanded as to <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>forme</hi> is but <hi>Will-worship</hi> at the best,
and a making whatsoever was said or commanded, or practised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>imperfect,</hi> and no way sufficient, but more of this shall be said
after if the Lord permit.</p>
            <p>Fourth Argument, Had Christ intended universally to forbid
all kind of Oaths in the words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> then those am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications,
neither <hi>by Heaven,</hi> nor <hi>by Earth,</hi> neither <hi>by Jerusalem,</hi>
neither by the <hi>head,</hi> had been useless as being generally included in
the general prohibition, but had he meant that no oath should be
used upon any occasion, the subsequent words are so far from giving
light to the preceeding that they much obscure them, but had he
said no more then swear not at all, it might have been said he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed
all oaths, but he descending to this or that creature may
rationally imply that his purpose was only to forbid such swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and not that which was formerly enjoyed, and his conclusion
is only creature swearing, or swearing by Creatures is that he
would have forbidden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ knew better what he intended then <hi>A. S.</hi> who
would make his words one thing and his intention another; it is
evident by the preceeding Doctrine, and by that which follows
after the Text, that Christ prohibits all swearing, which shall be
further spoken on when the second part of the discourse is spoken
of; some stumble <hi>ignorantly,</hi> and some <hi>wilfully,</hi> would pervert,
and turn aside from that which they have no mind to receive, and
would hold up that which they assert true or false, &amp; that makes all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94649:13"/>
this disputing and reasoning about the plain words of Scripture,
<hi>Christs words;</hi> But I say unto you, <hi>Swear not at all</hi> by <hi>heaven</hi> or <hi>earth,</hi>
is a general <hi>Negative</hi> of all Oaths, even of those which before were
used in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> and by Heaven and Earth, and Jerusalem,
are more ample expressions of Christ to make the Scribes and
Pharisees understand his mind of his dislike of these Oaths by
Creatures that they frequently used, and though these and much
more were included in the general Negative, Swear not at all;
yet they are not to be excluded as superfluous, neither do they
<hi>obscure</hi> the former, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> but gives more light to the
former, to any but them that fees with <hi>A. S.</hi> his eyes, for by
<hi>Heaven,</hi> by <hi>Earth,</hi> by <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> are more <hi>ample expressions</hi> of his
mind, and a further <hi>explication</hi> of the former, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi>
and though they seem to <hi>A. S.</hi> to obscure and darken Christs
words, if he did intend all Oaths, yet they that see with another
eye then he doth is that they are only more large expressions
thereby to make the Pharisees understand, who were in the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and dull of hearing, that he did not only forbid what the
Law had forbid before, but even those Oaths that they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used, under those terms and forms which the Law had not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in those words, as <hi>Heaven, Earth, Jerusalem, head</hi> and <hi>foot,</hi>
and therefore he <hi>enumerates</hi> them as an <hi>amplification</hi> of his former
<hi>prohibition,</hi> and so they are to be joyned, and we shall not stop as
<hi>A. S.</hi> says some doth at the words swear not at all, but shall joyne
that which Christ hath joyned, viz. <hi>Heaven, Earth</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
and to be enumerated only and joyned to the <hi>former negative,</hi> and
spoken as to their capacities in those ful and large terms that they
might understand his mind, that he prohibited not only by <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
and <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but even any other Oath which the
Law had commanded, or the <hi>Jewes</hi> permitted to swear before;
and though <hi>A. S.</hi> would have it limited, only to swearing by
<hi>Creatures,</hi> which indeed were forbidden under the Law; but
Christ who taught a more Evangelical and exact obedience then
the Law, he said, It hath been said of old time thou shalt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear
thy self: <hi>But I say unto you,</hi> (who saith more then the Law
hath said) <hi>Swear not at all, but let your yea be yea, and nay, nay, for
whatsoever is mere cometh of evil.</hi> And of this mind was BP. <hi>Vsher,</hi>
late of <hi>Armaugh,</hi> who pleaded the cause of the <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ldenses,</hi> or <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onists,</hi>
whose names are famous amongst the <hi>Reformed Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ches,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94649:14"/>
and were the most ancient and true <hi>Protestants,</hi> if any <hi>Reformation</hi>
be looked at beyond <hi>Luther,</hi> they professed it no way lawful for a
Christian to swear, and the said Bishop <hi>Vsher de Succes. Chap. 6.</hi>
doth esteem that place of the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>Mat. Swear not at all;</hi> and
that of <hi>5th. James</hi> to be a sufficient plea for them against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and he pleads their cause; and this made <hi>Renerius</hi> and <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius</hi>
so much envy the <hi>Waldenses</hi> two <hi>Romanists,</hi> who said amongst
all the Sects which are or have been, there is not any more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to the Church (meaning the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> then the
<hi>Waldenses;</hi> and that for three Reasons, first, their Antiquity;
secondly, because of their Universality; thirdly, in that they
did maintain and hold it no way lawful for a Christian to swear on
any occasion.</p>
            <p>But it may be that <hi>A. S.</hi> will tell us that these and other were
condemned in some general or Provincial <hi>Council</hi> for <hi>Heresie,</hi> and
if he do it is no great matter, since most of these have erred,
especially since all Nations have drunk of the <hi>VVhores cup of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi>
and have erred from the <hi>faith,</hi> and have lost the <hi>power,</hi>
and then contend for a forme, and bind all to receive it upon some
<hi>comination</hi> or <hi>malediction,</hi> or other, or else they were <hi>Hereticks;</hi>
And why who said so? the Church hath so decreed; and if these
Canons and such like must be binding, <hi>A. S.</hi> will hardly escape
their censure, if he continue in the profession of the faith he is
in, though he and they seem to agree in this particular, about
swearing. But I come to his fifth Argument.</p>
            <p>Fifth Argument, Christ never forbad any thing but what was
intrinsecally evil, as may be proved by induction, he forbids <hi>anger,
abusive language,</hi> he <hi>forbids lust,</hi> and <hi>divorce,</hi> and <hi>swearing by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi>
and therefore what ever he forbad was evil, and that in it
self, and not meerly as forbidden but swearing in general is not,
for that hath not only been the practice of holy Men, but of Angels,
<hi>Dan. 12. 7. Revel. 10. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Was it evil in it self under the Law if a man smote out
anothers eye, or tooth, or cut off his hand, or his foot, or give
one a would in any part of the body, <hi>Deut. 21. 24. Levit. 1. 24.
20. Deut. 19. 11.</hi> was it evil in it self for the Judges in those
days to give sentence, that he that had struck out his <hi>Neighbours
eye,</hi> or struck out his <hi>tooth,</hi> or cut off his <hi>hand</hi> to pronounce and
give the same judgment unto the offender that he should be so
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94649:14"/>
done withal, was this eternally evil or intrinsecally evil for the
party so wronged to seek remedy? or was it not an act of justice
equal and good, not only because enjoyned and commanded, but
in it self just, and was it or is it an act in it self (intrinsecally evil)
if a man sued a man wrongfully at the Law, and takes a mans coat
or garment away to seek to defend himself, and preserve his coat
or cloak, if not <hi>A. S.</hi> his argument is of no moment; for even in
the same Chapter, where <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>murther,</hi> and <hi>divorce</hi> saving for
<hi>fornication,</hi> and <hi>abusive language,</hi> and all <hi>swearing is forbidden,</hi> so is
that forbidden which is not intrinsecally evil by Christ, <hi>Mat. 5. 39,
40. But I say unto you that you resist not evil; and whosoever shall
smite the one cheek turn him the other also; and if a man sue thee at the
Law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also; and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall compell thee to go a mile go with him twayn.</hi> And it is in the
new Testament (I hope) written, <hi>Avenge not your selves.</hi> And was
it evil in it self, or morally evil to keep the seventh day of the week
as a Sabbath, or only good because commanded, or was it lawful
to fight with <hi>Amalecks, Edomites, Aegiptians,</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Israel</hi> was only commanded, or because they were real ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to God in their hearts; or as <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi> said well in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to Doctor <hi>Gauden,</hi> which <hi>A. S.</hi> quarels with, that <hi>Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Offerings, Passeover,</hi> and <hi>New Moons, Fasts</hi> and
<hi>Swearing,</hi> was not evil in themselves but because forbidden; and
though <hi>A. S.</hi> give such a great Challenge to <hi>S. F.</hi> to produce one
instance that any thing was prohibited by Christ, but what was
intrinsecally evil, or else his argument is in vain, I say the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
thing prove it, that something was forbidden that was
not evil eternally and intrinsecally, but because prohibited, and
again in the same Chapter, <hi>ver. 44. But I say unto you love your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
bless them that curse you;</hi> though under the Law they did
<hi>fight,</hi> and might <hi>fight</hi> with the aforesaid enemies, the <hi>Canaanites,</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but now I say, <hi>put up, forgive, love your enemies,</hi>
Peter <hi>put up thy Sword,</hi> he that takes hold on it <hi>shall perish by it;
avenge not, go not to Law one with another,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 7. <hi>Suffer, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,</hi>
forgive if thy brother <hi>sin against thee seventy times 7. times.</hi> And
though <hi>A. S.</hi> say that nothing was forbidden by Christ, or in all
the <hi>new Testament</hi> but what was in it self evil, or in some respect
conducing thereunto; methinks he hath given too bold a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge;
what will he say to all the former things mentioned? and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94649:15"/>
what evil had <hi>Circumcision</hi> in it, or the <hi>Passeover,</hi> or <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> or
<hi>New Moons,</hi> and the Sabbath days, or what tendency had they
to evil, but rather were good for the end they were ordained, to
be signes and types, and figures of holy things to come, like as
swearing was among the rest, what ever <hi>A. S.</hi> say or argue; and
yet when the substance of the good things was come to them that
had believed, and received him who was the summe of all; the
Apostle said, <hi>Gal. 5. 2, 3. If you be Circumcised Christ profits you
nothing;</hi> after he was offered up: And <hi>Gal. 4. 9, 10, 1. You ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
new Moons, and holy days and Sabbaths:</hi> And these things that
were once as <hi>really good</hi> as ever <hi>swearing</hi> was, considering the end
wherefore they were enjoyned, and these things was never evil in
<hi>themselves,</hi> yet the Apostle reckoned them <hi>beggarly Rudiments,</hi> and
told them <hi>they had begun in the Spirit, and now sought to be made
perfect through the flesh;</hi> and so stood in doubt of them that his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
had been in vain, and therefore if <hi>A. S.</hi> or any other will
needs uphold swearing, because commanded to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> (before
the seed Christ was revealed) I say he is <hi>Gal. 5. 34.) a debter to the
whole Law;</hi> and is as much bound to keep it in all <hi>other points</hi> as
this, or else he is a transgressour, and is one of those that would be
laying yoaks upon the Disciples necks, unto whom they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended, for if the Ceremonies and Rites and outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
which properly did belong to the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> and
state to observe till the fulness of time, when the partition wall
should be broken down, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> should be one,
and one shepherd and one fold for them both (and no longer) and
they were never given to the Gentiles to observe; and therefore,
for ought I can perceive many would have the <hi>Gentile Christians,</hi>
who never were under the Law, neither the Ordinances of the
first Covenant, neither ever given to them, yet <hi>they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the Christians to live as do the Jewes,</hi> and to observe their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
and therefore <hi>are greatly to be blamed, Gal 2. 13, 14.</hi>
Therefore we do not look upon any swearing to be <hi>now a duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel</hi> among true Christians, <hi>truly such,</hi> as some swearing
was once under the Law, but affirme all swearing to be now a <hi>sin,</hi>
because forbidden by the positive <hi>law of Christ</hi> under the Gospel,
who by his death ended the right of that, and many more legal
rites and Rudiments, which who so doth observe now as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
doth it not without sin, and guilt, and superstition; and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94649:15"/>
therefore <hi>S. Fisher</hi> that faithful servant of God (who suffred in
bonds til death for his <hi>Testimony</hi> even in this particular) saith well,
<hi>That that sort of swearing which was not sin simpliciter in its nature
under the Law, is now a sin upon the account of Christs universal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of all swearing;</hi> who was of authority to put to an end,
as he did by his death unto the Law: And therefore that sort of
service and worship which stood in outward observations, which
was a duty because commanded <hi>under the Law,</hi> and <hi>no sin,</hi> in
their own nature, neither were <hi>evil in themselves,</hi> nor in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
conducing thereto, as they were observed, but had some
signal good in them once, and yet who <hi>observes them now,</hi> as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, <hi>makes Christ</hi> of so little effect to himself, <hi>as that he
profits him nothing at all;</hi> I hope <hi>A. S.</hi> will not deny but these
things are forbidden in the new Testament, which sometime were
not evil in their own nature, but now are evil when the <hi>Substance</hi>
is come, in whom they all end; and therefore <hi>S. F.</hi> his argument
is not vain but of force: And yet let <hi>A. S.</hi> know that there were
many things observed and done not only by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but by
them that believed in Christ, and thought well of him while he
was present with them, and yet did not see to the end of these
things which were shadows and signes, and <hi>good as once commanded,</hi>
and had no evil in them, but were good as commanded, and for the
end for which they were ordain'd, which afterwards in the more
<hi>full growth</hi> and knowledge in the Mystery of Christianity they
came more to be seen thorough, and that was felt in which they
all ended; and though Christ came not to destroy the Law, but
to fulfill it, and to observe the Ordinances commanded in that
Covenant to fulfill that which was written of him, <hi>Psal. 40. 6. In
the volume of the Book it is written, I am come to do thy will O God.</hi>
And further he said himself, <hi>It behoveth us to fulfill all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
and that which was commanded, but this was before he was
offred up, and was as a midle dispensation betwixt the ending of
the <hi>Law and publishing of the Gospel;</hi> yet howbeit Christ knew it,
and did speak of it at some time, that those things that had been
sometime commanded, <hi>Deut. 12. 5.</hi> and was good as they stood
<hi>related</hi> to the <hi>end</hi> wherefore they were <hi>commanded,</hi> instance the
<hi>Worship at Jerusalem,</hi> and the service there, and the <hi>place</hi> where
God had <hi>promis'd</hi> to place his name, yet Christ said as foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the end of all, the aforesaid Worship which appertained to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94649:16"/>
that <hi>Covenant,</hi> and therfore he said to the Woman, <hi>Joh. 4. 23. but the
hour cometh and now is when the true Worshipers, shall worship the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in spirit and truth, for the Father seekes such to worship him, and
24. vers. God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him
in spirit and truth, 2 Cor. 3. 17. From hence it is clearly evident</hi>
(for this was before he was offred up) (that <hi>then</hi> was the time)
that neither at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> nor in the <hi>Mountain</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> it shall
be only said they worship the Father, though at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was the
place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 5. of worship formerly, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> held
it then, and the worship was that which was commanded, to wit
Sacrifices, and Offrings, and many other legal Services, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to them to perform according to the command of God,
and if swearing or oathes was any part of the <hi>service of God,</hi> as in
that Covenant, as we with <hi>A. S.</hi> doth grant, <hi>Deutr. 10. 20. You
shall fear the Lord and serve him, and swear by his name,</hi> then I say,
that swearing amongst the rest of the worship <hi>is included,</hi> but saith
Christ, neither at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> nor this Mountain, but they that
worship shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, so that the
time was (then) but came on more afterwards to be fulfilled, that
both the <hi>place,</hi> and the <hi>worship,</hi> and <hi>service</hi> that belonged to the
place, they should no more worship the Father (with and in) but
in the spirit and in the truth, and this may be in answer to that
which <hi>A. S.</hi> makes a great adoe with in his Book, how that Christ
said, <hi>swear not at all,</hi> it was before his death, and therefore they
that argue, saith he, that swearing was prohibited only and ended
in Christs death, cannot plead that all Oathes was prohibited,
but that command of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. because he spake this in
his life time, I say so did he this, <hi>Jo.</hi> 20. 21, 22, 23. And he
may as well argue that Christ destroyed the place of worship
at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the Worship also, and came not to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
it as he saith he did, and why, but because he spoke this
before he was crucified, and so did he, swear not at all, and why
may not <hi>A. S.</hi> conclude with us that this is a commodious place
to interpret and explain Christs meaning in those words in the
<hi>5th Mat.</hi> 23, and 24. and so the words may truly be understood
thus, <hi>yee have heard that it hath been said of old time, thou shalt not
forswear thy self, but shalt performe unto the Lord thine Oathes, Exod.</hi>
20. 7. and <hi>Deutr.</hi> 5. 11. but the hour cometh and now is, (<hi>when
I say unto you</hi>) that say more then the Law hath said, <hi>swear not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94649:16"/>
at all, neither by Heaven nor by the Earth, but let your yea be yea,
and your nay nay, for whatsoever is more then these cometh of evil,</hi>
and yet whatever may or can be said <hi>A. S.</hi> will need conclude
that all swearing is not forbiden, and why? because it hath been
the practise of holy Men, and also an Angel, this Argument is of
little force, so was it the practise of holy Men to offer <hi>Sacrifice,</hi>
and <hi>burn Incense,</hi> and as for the swearing of the Angel, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.
and <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 6. to prove the lawfulness of some swearing, these
hath been answered, over and over, and over again, though <hi>A. S.</hi>
will take no notice of it, though I perceive he hath read the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that have been used as Answers to these things, though
he will not seem to take notice, nor to reply to confute the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
but rather minds his own, and to assert what may seem
to make for his purpose, as to the matter he hath taken in hand,
but as for good Mens swearing, and the Angels swearing, if their
example would justifie the lawfulness of swearing, yet they could
not be any president to us, who are under the Gospel of the <hi>Son
that is greater then the Angels,</hi> (by the dispensation of whom) the
Law for <hi>Oathes, Tithes, Offrings, Oblations,</hi> and other legal Rites,
and Rudiments was given, which <hi>Son also, all the Angels of God are
bid to worship,</hi> for the Apostle saith, <hi>Hebr. 2. 5. For unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
hath he not put into subjection the World to come,</hi> but that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto the Son, under whose ministration and subjection <hi>we
are,</hi> who said, <hi>Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay,</hi> and speak
the truth, and do the truth, and bear witness to the truth, who
said, <hi>Learn of me,</hi> and these things we have learned of him unto
whom all power is committed, for he is counted <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. 3. more
worthy of glory then <hi>Moses,</hi> though <hi>Moses</hi> was faithful in his
House as a Servant, but <hi>Christ as a Son,</hi> which is that great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
that <hi>Moses</hi> prophesied of, which all is to hearken unto, with
whom the Father is well pleased, <hi>being made so much better then the
Angels, Hebr. 1. 4. as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent
name then they,</hi> vers. 5. <hi>for unto which of the Angels said he at any
time thou art my Son, this day I have begotten thee,</hi> vers. 6. <hi>Again
when he bringeth the first begotten into the World, he saith, let all the
Angels of God worship him, of the Angels he saith he makes them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
spirits and a flame of fire, but unto the Son he saith thy Throne
oh God is for ever and ever, the Scepter of righteousness is the Scepter
of thy Kingdome, for if the words spoken by Angels was stedfast, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94649:17"/>
every transgression received a just recompence of reward, how shall they
escape (Hebr.</hi> 2. 3.) who do not only <hi>neglect the command of Christ</hi>
but labours to pervert, through their strength of their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the <hi>ministration of the Son,</hi> who is the summe and substance of
all shadowy and typical ministrations; and therefore <hi>A. S.</hi> and all
concerned look to it who would introduce <hi>Judaism</hi> and the <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
observations</hi> upon the <hi>neck of Christs Disciples,</hi> and as Lawes in
his Kingdom, and whether would not this <hi>prefer</hi> the <hi>servant</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Son,</hi> yea or nay, and his ministration before the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Sons,</hi> though the one is not against the other, but the
one pointing at the other, and in the latter the first is fulfilled, the
truth declared, the truth spoken, the truth lived in, and the truth
confessed in every matter wherein any Christian is concerned,
which is the summe and the matter, which all oaths in their <hi>highest</hi>
and <hi>greatest ordination</hi> could or can effect.</p>

out of <hi>Rabby Johnas,</hi> says, <hi>In veritate forma jurandi apud Judeos;</hi>
but he concludes doubtfully, and says, it is only the next degree
unto an oath; but <hi>A. S.</hi> thinks he hath put it out of doubt with
his reason and his Authors, that <hi>verily, verily,</hi> is an oath, which if
it were true this would only prove swearing lawful in Sermons,
and not in Controversies, which is the great good end he so much
pleads for, and if this were true would serve his turn. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
exacting Oathes he seems to prove out of the <hi>Mosaical
Law,</hi> and the Priests swearing lawfully out of <hi>Pauls Epistles</hi> and
<hi>Christs Sermons,</hi> but this his covering is too short, and is but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
in the weighty things of God, not distinguishing betwixt the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94649:17"/>
first Covenant and the second, and the Ordinances thereof; for
the first he hath no adversary, <hi>viz.</hi> that they did swear though
never <hi>exacted</hi> under <hi>penalties,</hi> the second we conclude to be no
oath, <hi>viz. Amen, Amen,</hi> or verily, verily, which is no more then
<hi>truly, truly, I say unto ye;</hi> and if this be an oath why hath it not,
and why is it not <hi>accepted as such;</hi> for we have said more then this
and can do in truth which we look upon to be far from amounting
to an oath, and yet it would never be received as such, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
plainly that what <hi>S. F.</hi> and <hi>R. H.</hi> hath said, though <hi>A. S.</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with it, that surely the <hi>Magistrates in England</hi> doth not believe
the <hi>Priests Doctrine,</hi> for if they did, why are so many sentenced to
perpetual imprisonment, with confiscation of all Lands and Goods
to the ruinating of many poor Wives and Children, which <hi>A. S.</hi>
knows little of, and for ought I know such a discourse as this may
add affliction to their bonds, and misery to their sufferings, and
yet these have never been received; as if we say, <hi>verily, verily,</hi> or
<hi>truly, truly,</hi> or <hi>God is our witness,</hi> or <hi>we speak the truth in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;</hi>
yet notwithstanding this would never give satisfaction to
any Magistrate in any Judicature that ever we knew or heard of
in <hi>England;</hi> and though he tell us of <hi>I. Pennington,</hi> how that he
gave satisfaction, and that it found acceptance with the <hi>Court, and
also to the King:</hi> We are not ignorant of what <hi>I. P.</hi> hath written,
which is wholsome, just, and good, and sound, and condescending<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a Christian man could do, as about the premisses to pacifie
and satisfie all whom it concerned, that they might not proceed in
such a rigorous manner against the truly conscientious, and so in
letting them know what we could do, and what we could not do,
yet notwithstanding what ever any might seem to own as suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in <hi>private,</hi> we never found it in <hi>publick,</hi> or in any case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
but rather they knew before hand what would <hi>ensnare
us,</hi> have set the snare, and run us into it; but notwithstanding all
this that <hi>A. S.</hi> will have to be oaths, as <hi>God is witness,</hi> and I <hi>speak
the truth in Christ;</hi> and <hi>verily, verily,</hi> it will not serve, for he says,
the Law will not allow of it, for inferiour Magistrates are sworn
he says to act according to Law, and the Law prescribes in what
manner, and with what formality Oaths shall be taken; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Magistrates are not at liberty to accept thereof, because
they are tyed up to the Rules of the Law, as I said before, seeing
that Oaths are a matter of great concernment unto many it had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94649:18"/>
been a more necessary discourse for <hi>A. S.</hi> to have told the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
that these things in testimony which were ready to be given
had been sufficient, and that they should not so much have stood
upon the formality, seeing that which answered the substance of
the Law was not denyed, though we except against the formality
which is now used, and hath no example or president in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of truth as they are used; and therefore let <hi>A. S.</hi> tell the
Rulers that the rules of the Law in this case is too strict, and the
penalty exceeds the <hi>transgression</hi> far; as for a man for not holding
up his hand, or laying it upon a Bible, and kissing it, and saying
after a Clark or a Cryer, I swear, and the like needless Ceremonies,
which are not without (at least) a shew of evil in them, yet for not
<hi>doing</hi> and <hi>observing</hi> these <hi>formalities,</hi> though those things which
<hi>A. S.</hi> and others calls <hi>swearing,</hi> we have condescended unto; yet
it's reckoned as insufficient, though themselves say it is an oath, yet
it is not called so, nor accounted so, except the aforesaid <hi>needless
trifles</hi> be <hi>observed,</hi> and is not this a hard thing, and far from <hi>equity,
justice,</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> that a man should be exposed to so great a <hi>penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
as <hi>Confiscation of lands and goods, and perpetual imprisonment,</hi> for
want of observing of these trifling, groundless, needless Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and formalities, which is not at all beseeming <hi>Christians;</hi>
and whether the Law had not need to be rectified in this case,
which exposeth so many to so great suffring, which we in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth <hi>except</hi> against as well as Oaths, and seeth that the <hi>penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
far exceeds the crime, if it were any; but we look upon it to be
<hi>none at all,</hi> but rather a duty incumbant upon <hi>Christians</hi> to keep
to <hi>yea and nay;</hi> or that which amounts to it in all their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
both publick and private, and not to <hi>swear at all,</hi> but to
abide in Christs Doctrine and walk after the Primitive Christians
example to testifie the truth and not to swear: And as for <hi>Amen,
Amen, verily, verily,</hi> is no more then <hi>truly, truly,</hi> and is no more
then an <hi>ardent,</hi> and a <hi>fervent speech</hi> from the heart of him that
speaketh, wherein he would be believed, or it is truth from which
and in which he speaks; and as for comparing <hi>Amen</hi> with the 65.
of <hi>Isa.</hi> and 16. where he is called the <hi>God of Truth;</hi> this proves
nothing at all, he is called the God of Truth in opposition to false
Gods, which were lies; and in opposition to the Heathenish Gods
which were not true Gods, which had eyes and saw not, &amp;c. and
could not save; he might as well say, when <hi>wisdom, holiness, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94649:18"/>
or <hi>immortality</hi> is <hi>named</hi> or <hi>mentioned,</hi> that therefore it is an
<hi>Oath,</hi> as when truth is spoken, for these are as much <hi>epethites</hi> of
God as truly or truth; and though your Church in a Homily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
swearing, do say that Christ did often swear because he said,
<hi>Verily,</hi> we judge you have concluded upon too slender a ground:
And as for <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. The Lord hath sworn and will not repent:
It is not denyed though the Lord <hi>swore once, yea more then once by
himself;</hi> this was in condescention to the state of Man in weakness
and unbelief; and as to the state of the <hi>Jewes, Gal.</hi> 3. 19. before
the seed was revealed, which was the substance of all figures, and
<hi>Gods example of swearing</hi> is no example for us now to imitate, and
was in no wise a confirming of that old legal Ceremony of Oaths,
as a practice <hi>legitimate to his Saints for ever,</hi> as <hi>A. S.</hi> would make us
believe it was, for his Oath, <hi>viz.</hi> (Gods) ended in <hi>Christ, in whom
all the promises confirmed by oath, were yea, and in him Amen,</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to end all strife between him and men, and to put an end to all
strife and Oaths also that are among Men to end strife; <hi>Ambrose</hi>
saith upon that 110. <hi>Psal. Let him then swear who cannot repent of
his Oaths;</hi> a little after the same <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Do not imitate him
in swearing whom you cannot imitate in performing;</hi> and indeed the
principal sollution he gives is not to swear at all: And <hi>Theophilus</hi>
upon the place in Controversie whom <hi>A. S.</hi> says was not ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>telous
enough, as it seems among the rest of the Fathers that <hi>A. S.</hi> sets
as judge of, he saith, <hi>learn hence that under the Law it was not evil
for one to swear, but since the coming of Christ it is evil, as is Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
and in some what ever is Judaical, for it became a Child to suck
but not a man:</hi> So that it appears he amongst the rest of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did not only declare against Oaths in general or private
communication, but also distinguishes betwixt the first Covenant
and the second, and the Ordinances thereof; and though the holy
Ghost bear witness that both Angels and Men, yea and good Men,
and the Creator himself in that first Covenant did swear, so that
<hi>A. S.</hi> concludes that it is not morally evil of its own nature; In
the first we shall not much quarel nor dispute as <hi>under the Law,</hi>
but that which was obliging then, as by command, is not always
<hi>obliging,</hi> but Christ the end of the Law for Righteousness said, <hi>Let
your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, for whatsoever is more</hi> under the
Gospel (then amounts to this) <hi>comes of evil;</hi> therefore there is
no necessity to put any other sence of Christs words then his <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94649:19"/>
prohibition of all swearing</hi> as under the Gospel, (seeing that
speaking the truth, confessing the truth, declaring the truth, and
nothing but the truth in any matter wherein any Christian is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
either in respect of <hi>God,</hi> or a <hi>mans neighbour,</hi> this answers
the very substance of the Law, and the very end and purpose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as ever an <hi>Oath</hi> did among the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the first institution;
for asmuch as speaking the truth acknowledgeth Gods <hi>Omnisciency</hi>
and <hi>presence,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>wisdom;</hi> secondly it doth any office to
any neighbour, as in bearing witness to any truth, and again to
find out any <hi>transgressour,</hi> or <hi>transgression;</hi> and this is done, may be
done, and ought to be done by all true Christians; and therefore
no necessity of that <hi>formal Ceremonious</hi> way of <hi>swearing</hi> as under
the Law, neither is there any necessity for seeking any other sence
of <hi>Christs words</hi> and the <hi>Apostles words, Swear not at all by Heaven
or Earth, or any other,</hi> seeing all the main ends and good ends, and
good purposes is answered in the full, which the Law in the full
<hi>latitude</hi> and <hi>morality</hi> thereof did require, or for which it was
given.</p>
            <p>His sixth Argument is, That either these words, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>
must be interpreted as not to forbid any oath though taken upon
just occasion, or else <hi>Paul</hi> never knew the meaning of this text,
or else contrary to his knowledge, and that upon <hi>good deliberation</hi>
he acted against it, and that in these very writings wherein we all
believe that he was infallibly assisted by the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> for his
Oaths saith <hi>A. S.</hi> are upon record, 1 <hi>Thes. 2. 5. God is witness;</hi>
see <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. Now to call God to witness is the very substance of
an oath saith <hi>A. S.</hi> and as <hi>Austin</hi> tells him, and he says he hath not
read of any of a contrary opinion except some <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> which
if they would yield to as much as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>God is witness</hi> of the
truth of their assertions, it might be wished out of condescention
to their weakness that they might be dispensed withal if the Law
would give leave as to the external formality of an Oath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What A. S. will call a just <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccasion I know not, it appears
to me he would have a large compasse, and a larger then the most
contenders against <hi>Christs Doctrine</hi> that we have met with or what
he will account a just occasion I know not, though otherwise he
seem to condemn sometimes <hi>needless</hi> and <hi>vain oaths</hi> in ordinary
communication, though I know some without reflection upon A. S.
who uses them too too frequently, and are not only members but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94649:19"/>
Pastours so called of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and though he seems
in his Discourse here and there to be against <hi>customary</hi> and <hi>vain
oaths,</hi> yet for all that what he calls a just occasion upon some
ground, some calls it a needful occasion when they are called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Magistrate and some when any business is in controversie
betwixt man and man calls it a just occasion, where sometimes I
have seen a <hi>Curate</hi> administer that which he called an oath upon a
Book, what ground he had I suspect either from <hi>Commandement,</hi>
or <hi>example</hi> of <hi>Primitive Ministers,</hi> (is certain he had none) but it
may be A. S. will conclude it was upon a <hi>just occasion,</hi> but what
compass he will have for his just occasion is doubtful, seeing he
hath put no <hi>termination</hi> or end to it; but for ought I can perceive
would leave liberty for every man to <hi>exact an oath upon another</hi>
when he would, and call it a <hi>just occasion,</hi> and account it a point of
<hi>duty</hi> in the other to obey even in ordinary communication. And
as for St. <hi>Paul</hi> we deny thy Argument, as that he never knew the
meaning of this Text of Christs prohibition; secondly that in his
Writings he acted <hi>contrary</hi> to his <hi>knowledge,</hi> and upon set <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
for though God was his witness whom he served with his Spirit,
in the Gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you
always in my Prayers.</hi> Also, <hi>that which</hi> A. S. <hi>calls an oath, 1 Thes.
2. 5. For neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know for a
cloak of covetousness, God is witness.</hi> Though we know and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
believe with A. S. that he was infallibly assisted by the Holy
Ghost, when he published the Gospel of Christ among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
and wrote both unto the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who believed
that his calling <hi>God to witness</hi> was not any <hi>oath,</hi> neither was there
any <hi>necessity</hi> or just <hi>occasion,</hi> whatever A. S. may call just occasion
we cannot, for he hath left such a great compass for himself to
turn in, though here and there he seem to disallow of customary
oaths and frequent oaths; yet notwithstanding his, Discourse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tends to an allowance of swearing frequently and unnecessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for we reckon it to be a piece of ordinary communication for
a <hi>Christian Minister</hi> to write a <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>admonition,</hi> or <hi>exhortation,</hi>
or an <hi>Epistle</hi> unto the believing hearers, and that there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of <hi>Oaths</hi> in such a discourse; for what ever A. S. sayes this
would make the Apostle guilty of <hi>frequent,</hi> and <hi>unnecessary,</hi> and
<hi>common swearing,</hi> which we are far from believing; for asmuch as
they that did believe through the word of life declared <hi>by the spirit
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94649:20"/>
of God in him,</hi> neither through his Epistles written, being assisted
by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> they were not like to believe him <hi>for swearing</hi> if
he had <hi>sworn;</hi> but saith A. S. if his words had really been believed
which he spoke and wrote, what occasion would there have been
for him to have written so to the <hi>Romans, Rom. 9. 1. I say the
truth in Christ, I lie not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostle knew what occasion he had to speak these words,
and the <hi>occasion was this,</hi> that the <hi>Jewes</hi> sought to be <hi>justified</hi> by
the <hi>Righteousness of the Law and by the works thereof,</hi> and would
need look upon themselves as the Children of God, because they
were of the stock of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the flesh, but the Apostle
knew and also gave them to understand that the Children of the
promise was counted for the Seed; and again, <hi>for they are not all
Israel which are of Israel, Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. And thus he spake truth
unto them, as it was revealed by Christ, whom the Father had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in him, and why might he not say, <hi>I speak the truth in Christ,</hi>
seeing that Christ was in him, and he in him? <hi>I lie not,</hi> my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
also bears me witness in the Holy Ghost, he might also as
well say that <hi>Paul swore</hi> by his <hi>Conscience,</hi> seeing that he took it for
a witness; <hi>away, away,</hi> with such <hi>perverting</hi> and <hi>straining</hi> of the
Scripture beyond and beside the mind of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> for <hi>God
is witness, and I say the truth in Christ,</hi> they are no more then <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
and <hi>zealous,</hi> or <hi>fervent expressions,</hi> as the <hi>spirit</hi> of God at several
times did stir up in his heart both to speak and write, for the end
that they unto whom he spoke or wrote might believe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we conclude not as A. S. would needs have it, that the Apostle
spoke these fervent words <hi>unnecessarily,</hi> for we know and see his
end and purpose was good, and therefore he spoke with <hi>fervency,</hi>
and with <hi>boldness</hi> the spirit of the Lord bearing witness in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that he spoke the truth, which we are far from believing,
is either <hi>juration</hi> or <hi>abjuration,</hi> and for ought can be perceived by
A. S. disdainful spirit, all that doth dissent from him in his opinion
he calls <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> shall hardly go free, nor divers of
the ancient Fathers, as, <hi>Orgen, Chrysostome, Jerome, Theophilact,</hi>
and others, who denyed not only swearing in private conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to <hi>swear at all;</hi> but now these must be called <hi>Phanaticks,</hi>
who dissent from all Men but themselves, by A. S. and such as he
who sails with <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>tide,</hi> and exalteth and applaudeth that
<hi>which hath praise amongst men, and hath not the praise of God;</hi> and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94649:20"/>
so the last of all he makes this conclusion, <hi>that so help me God,</hi> is
the most certain expression of an oath; which forme of words that
though he count them certain, we find not either under the Law
or under the Gospel, and I look upon it more as a piece of <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
in A. S. because this is the forme and the custome which is
<hi>now called swearing,</hi> which is in use in this Nation, and its strange
to us that they will reckon this so great a piece of peculiar service,
which is <hi>incommunicable</hi> to any <hi>Creature</hi> but only to God, when
as indeed we never find it written or commanded, either among
the <hi>Jews,</hi> or commended or used amongst all the writings of <hi>Christ</hi>
and the <hi>Apostles</hi> that hath relation to Christianity; Indeed I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that I have read that in the days when the <hi>Popes</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was in full power here in <hi>England,</hi> how that the Chancellour
then of <hi>England</hi> said to one of <hi>John Wickliffs</hi> followers being
brought before him, in Examination he said unto him, Lay thy
hand upon the Book thou <hi>Heretick</hi> and swear, <hi>so help me God and
holy doom:</hi> An old <hi>superstitious Popish forme</hi> I look upon it to be,
and hath no consistance with an Oath in its true matter and forme
under the law, when it was commanded; and for ought I see
A. S. will rather take part with the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> and her <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
who persecuted, rather then <hi>Wickliffe</hi> that famous <hi>Reformer,</hi>
who had his <hi>Bones</hi> taken up and burned 41. years after his Decease,
and his Books, and these Articles condemned by the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Constance,</hi> who also burned <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Jerome of Prague</hi> for
holding <hi>John Wickliffs</hi> Opinions, which was, <hi>that all Oaths under
the Gospel be unlawful.</hi> I say A. S. might have been more modest
then with the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> condemn them for error, seeing
they were the only people in their age and time that opposed, and
suffered for opposing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Apostacy, seeing
that they are faine to own them if they look for any Reformation
before <hi>Luther</hi> to be their <hi>witnesses</hi> against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which I have heard many <hi>Protestants</hi> say that they were on their
part against the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and though A. S. tells us of a
generation of people, <hi>quos non persuadabis etiam si persuaveris,</hi> who
as they will not be perswaded so they will not be councelled, who
will have nothing else to be the formality of an Oath but <hi>by God;</hi>
but this he says only <hi>of his own head,</hi> except he knew some
people that we know not of, for we say to <hi>swear the Lord liveth as
an oath,</hi> and again, <hi>as the Lord lives is an oath,</hi> or <hi>by the Lord that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94649:21"/>
lives for ever and ever is an oath;</hi> and yet we must needs deny that
<hi>Paul swore in the 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 1. when he said by your rejoycing I
die daily: And we never said <hi>A. S.</hi> mistook himself in saying that,
<hi>by,</hi> as the only mark and character of an oath; and if <hi>Austin</hi> said
upon these words of <hi>Paul</hi> as <hi>A. S.</hi> tells us, <hi>per vestram gloriam ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio
est,</hi> upon <hi>Pauls words,</hi> I suspect his judgment, and therefore
shall not so much regard it: But <hi>A. S.</hi> seems not to be at unity in
his book with himself notwithstanding all his raveling out where
he seems in his 41. page to dislike of <hi>Nicholas Fullers</hi> judgment,
<hi>viz.</hi> that there is <hi>no oath</hi> where God is not <hi>interposed;</hi> and yet in
the 56. page he saith that the substance of an oath consists in the
<hi>attestation of God,</hi> and in the 89. page he saith that Christ answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>high Priest, I am,</hi> and <hi>thou hast said,</hi> is an oath. And in
the 91. page it was enough that Christ denyed not to swear, and
from this he imagines that <hi>he did swear;</hi> and when we enquire
what the oath was, it amounts but to this, <hi>thou hast said I am;</hi> and
where was the <hi>attestation of God</hi> here named, or mentioned, or
spoken on by Christ? was his words any more then his own Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
which he taught before, <hi>Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay:</hi>
when the high Priest said, art thou the King of the <hi>Jewes?</hi> he
answered <hi>I am;</hi> and is this any more then <hi>yea,</hi> though not in the
same <hi>syllables;</hi> and <hi>Mat. 26. 63. I adjure thee to tell us whether thou
art the son of God or not?</hi> and he answered, <hi>thou hast said.</hi> And is
this any more then <hi>yea,</hi> or <hi>I am,</hi> or <hi>it is truth</hi> But indeed if one
should traduce <hi>A. S.</hi> in his discourse and of his definition of an
<hi>Oath,</hi> it is so uncertain one shall hardly know what to pitch upon
to be his judgment, sometime it is <hi>this,</hi> and sometime it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>that,</hi>
and sometime it is neither <hi>this</hi> nor <hi>that,</hi> sometime he says <hi>it is an
oath where God is interposed,</hi> one while an oath consists in the <hi>attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God,</hi> another while it consists in saying <hi>truly, truly,</hi> and
sometimes, <hi>I call God to witness</hi> is an oath; and sometimes <hi>thou
hast said</hi> is an oath, sometime because <hi>God</hi> is named in a sentence,
therefore he concludes it must be an <hi>oath,</hi> otherwhiles when he is
not <hi>named</hi> it must be an oath; and thus he twines up and down,
leaving people in the dark, and leading them after his imaginations.
And I shall conclude the Answer to this reason, and neither impute
<hi>ignorance</hi> nor <hi>wickedness</hi> to the great <hi>Apostle,</hi> nor conclude that
Christs words as he saith doubtless the Apostle did, must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in a limited sence, and limited only to <hi>Creatures,</hi> and not to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94649:21"/>
all swearing; and why so but because the Apostle said, God is
witness; and I speak the truth in Christ, which is no <hi>contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of Christs prohibition, swear not at all.</p>
            <p>His seventh Argument is this, If some swearing be enjoyned in
the third Commandment, then all swearing is not forbidden by
Christ in these words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> because he came not to
destroy the Law, but some swearing is their enjoyned, or else the
Law written by the finger of God in Tables of Stone cannot be
vindicated from imperfection; and therefore in this negative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the affirmative must needs be included, thou shalt reverence
the Name of the Lord and swear by it, whensoever it is <hi>not vain</hi>
but necessary, which is required by a lawful Magistrate for the
glory of God, and for maintaining of peace, punishing offenders,
and ending of Controversies, and all these are necessary ends, but
not attainable, at least not so well by any <hi>expedient,</hi> yet put in
practice as by interposition of oaths, so it cannot reasonably be
believed that Christ would forbid them being of such important
use.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> The substance of this is answered before, but however
<hi>A. S.</hi> how he can make this third Commandment, Thou shalt
not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of swearing under the Gospel among Christians we do
not see, If <hi>Bishop Gaudens</hi> words be true (as they are) who says,
<hi>A true Christians oath is needless, his word being as firme as it, page</hi>
41. <hi>and an evil mans oath is worthy of no more credit then a lyer, pag.</hi>
17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Since upon that account whosoever swears by the name of
God swears in vain and to no purpose, whether he be a <hi>true man,</hi>
or one <hi>deceitful,</hi> his word amounting to as much as <hi>his oath:</hi> And
why <hi>A. S.</hi> mentions the third Commandment to prove swearing
lawful under the Gospel except for the morality of it which he
looks upon Christ came not to destroy, and doth he look that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>letter</hi> and <hi>syllable</hi> of all the <hi>ten Commandments</hi> is so <hi>moral</hi> in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
<hi>unchangable</hi> and uncaple of any <hi>annihilation by Christs coming</hi>
he much forgets himself, for all these things contained in the first
Table are not so <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>perpetual</hi> without some <hi>ceremoniality</hi> and
<hi>subjection to alteration by Christs coming,</hi> as he imagines if he had but
remembred the <hi>fourth Commandment</hi> the next unto it, Remember
that thou keep holy the Sabbath day, which then was the very
<hi>7th. day</hi> of the week which God had sanctified, was but a type and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94649:22"/>
sign, and shadow, and figure, and a ceremony of the <hi>7th.</hi> day of the
<hi>worlds</hi> rest from its labour and of the everlasting Sabbath as I said
before, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. and I might as well argue if the <hi>7th.</hi> day of the week was commanded in the <hi>fourth Commandment,</hi> then the <hi>7th.</hi>
day is not <hi>prohibited,</hi> neither by <hi>commandment, example,</hi> or <hi>practice
of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> or <hi>Primitive Christians;</hi> and I might add this
as a reason, because Christ came not to <hi>destroy the Law</hi> but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
it; and further I might add <hi>the 7th. day</hi> was enjoyned in the <hi>4th.
Commandment,</hi> (and they used to call it as <hi>moral</hi> as the <hi>third</hi>)
and therefore it ought to be so under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or else the Law
written in <hi>'lables of stone cannot be vindicated from imperfection,</hi> and
what would all my <hi>arguing prove,</hi> even as much as <hi>A. S.</hi> his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the <hi>continuation</hi> and necessity of oaths from the <hi>third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
and that is nothing at all; and the Law of God needs
not <hi>A. S.</hi> nor any vindication, it is <hi>perfect and endures for ever, Psal.</hi>
19. 7. and the Ceremonies, land types, and shadows that were joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with, and unto the substance of the Law, doth neither <hi>add</hi> nor
<hi>detract</hi> from its <hi>perfection,</hi> but it is the same in its self for ever; and
though we cannot own <hi>swearing</hi> in that <hi>ceremonious way</hi> as the
<hi>Jewes</hi> did use it till the <hi>seed came,</hi> unto whom the Law and the
<hi>Prophets bore witness;</hi> yet we do not make void the <hi>third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
we take not his <hi>name in vain,</hi> but <hi>reverence it,</hi> and
<hi>speakes well of it,</hi> and <hi>sanctifies</hi> it in our <hi>hearts;</hi> and as the Apostle
said, <hi>Do we make void the law through the preaching of Faith, God
forbid.</hi> So do we make void the <hi>law,</hi> or the <hi>perfection of it,</hi> by
speaking the <hi>truth,</hi> and bearing witness to the <hi>truth;</hi> though as I
said we cannot own those <hi>typical ceremonious</hi> way of swearing as it
was in the first Covenant; nay it is <hi>established,</hi> and the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
is established, for he that speaks the truth and bears
witness in and from the truth, <hi>honours Gods name, and reverences it,</hi>
forasmuch as he is called the <hi>God of truth,</hi> and as we have said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lawfully called before a Magistrate to bear testimony in any
thing wherein the glory of <hi>God,</hi> or our <hi>Neighbour</hi> is concerned,
or the decision of <hi>Controversie,</hi> seeing that <hi>true testimony</hi> is a <hi>medium</hi>
that concernes as much to that purpose now as swearing did under
the <hi>Law,</hi> therefore we have still been and are ready to answer all
these necessary ends, and as well; and this is as good and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to be put in practice amongst Christians as interposition of
Oaths, enjoyned by God in the first Covenant, and far more
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94649:22"/>
Evangelical, and therefore shall conclude with that of <hi>Jerome,</hi> the
<hi>Gospel truth admits not of an Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His eighth Argument is, That Christ did never any things
without some ground of reason, but no reason can be shewed
why all manner of swearing should be forbidden in a due manner,
and upon a just and necessary occasion, and therefore we may well
believe that such <hi>swearing</hi> was neither here or any where else
forbidden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> We shall not much dissent or disagree about terms with
<hi>A. S.</hi> that Christ did never any thing without some ground or
reason, but yet we must deny his Conclusion, that no reason can
be given why all manner of swearing should be forbidden; first
of all there was a time since man had a being in this <hi>Creation</hi> when
he was in the <hi>image of God,</hi> and stood in the Covenant of <hi>God,</hi> when
there was no <hi>Oath,</hi> neither any necessity thereof, Man being endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with power from God, which was placed in him, so that he was
in a capacity to fulfill, obey and serve, and believe his Maker <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Oath;</hi> for unbelief or sin had not yet entred, and this was
before the fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26, 27. Secondly, Christ the unspeakable
gift of God, who is the <hi>Mediator of the everlasting Covenant,</hi> yea
the Covenant it self, who is given for a <hi>leader to the People,</hi>
and who is made a Propitiation for sin and transgression, <hi>to end both sin,
transgression, and unbelief,</hi> which was the cause of <hi>the addition of
the Law,</hi> who leads to the beginning again, all that truly do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and are worthy to be called true Christians, or by the name
of Christ to have union with God again, in that <hi>life, power, truth,
righteousness and wisdom,</hi> in which the <hi>Image of God</hi> truly consists
which was before sin and <hi>transgression, and before the Law which was
added because of it, which was commanded four hundred and thirty
years after the Promise was made, Gal.</hi> 3. 17. Thirdly, After sin
was entred, and death by sin, an unbelieving part got up in all
the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> so that they could not believe God nor his
Promises, and yet such was his love unto Mankind, considering the
state into which they were plunged for confirmation of his Word
unto man, he <hi>swore by himself</hi> this was the Lords <hi>condescention</hi> unto
their low and <hi>unbelieving</hi> estate all that time, and no way exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for Christians (truly such) who are come into the <hi>Faith,</hi> and
to the <hi>truth</hi> it self, who do believe that all the Promises are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in Christ, <hi>yea, and amen,</hi> who is the author of <hi>Faith and of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94649:23"/>
eternal Salvation to them that believe, Heb.</hi> 9. 12. who prohibited
that by his command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 23. which sometimes was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yea and commanded, yea and added because of <hi>transgression,</hi>
and for which the <hi>law</hi> and the <hi>command for Oaths</hi> (was only added)
which he did not destroy) because he leads from under the power
of that which the Law came <hi>against</hi> (which is just and good, and
holy) and the seed fulfills it, and hath unity with it, and with him
who is the Judge and Law-giver, and Saviour of all that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him from sin and transgression. Fourthly, At that time
when the Law was given forth at Mount <hi>Sina, Exod. 19. 20. gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
all the Nations were given to Idolatry, and to serve and
worship strange Gods, as <hi>Baal, Ashtaroth, Chemosh, Rimphan,</hi> &amp; many
others, as the Gods of <hi>Samaria,</hi> which was said to be according
to the number of their Cities, and their Idols were called the sin
of <hi>Samaria; Amos</hi> saith, <hi>They swear by the sin of</hi> Samaria, <hi>that did
say, the God O</hi> Dan <hi>lives; and the manner of</hi> Barsheba <hi>lives, even they
shall fall and never rise again, Amos</hi> 7. 14. Which was no other
then the <hi>Calves</hi> which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> set up at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> which
they <hi>feared, worshipped</hi> and <hi>swore by;</hi> therefore God having cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
a peculiar people to himself to worship and serve him, and
honour him, who should not walk after the manner of the rest of
the <hi>Nations</hi> who knew <hi>not God,</hi> he commanded them to serve him,
and worship him, and <hi>swear by his Name, as Jerome</hi> saith well, <hi>to
keep them from Idolatry,</hi> and that they should not swear by the Gods
of the <hi>Heathen</hi> as the rest of the Nations did round about; yet
still this must be considered that this was the state of the <hi>minority</hi>
of the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> wherein God gave them Ordinances suitable
to their state, but it doth not follow, neither can it be reasonably
concluded that these Ordinances were to be perpetually binding
unto all <hi>future generations,</hi> especially when <hi>Christ the seed</hi> unto
whom all the Promises are, in whom the <hi>Law is fulfilled,</hi> and in
whom the former ministrations ends, that his Disciples and true
Christians should always be bound to those things once comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
especially seeing <hi>Christ their Master,</hi> in whom the Father is
well pleased hath <hi>prohibited</hi> this about <hi>swearing,</hi> and also did <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie</hi>
of the time to come after his <hi>Resurrection</hi> and his <hi>scension,</hi>
that those <hi>visible things</hi> which were as a Ministration for a time,
should end as to the outward <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>typical</hi> and <hi>figurative ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi>
of them, and that all these things should be revealed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94649:23"/>
by the Spirit and felt in the <hi>power of God</hi> in all that did believe;
when the Holy Ghost should be poured forth, and the <hi>Promise of
the Father</hi> be made manifest. Fifthly, Now considering that the
name of <hi>God is believed in,</hi> and he is confessed unto, and his <hi>Christ,</hi> and that there is not that Idolatry (especially outward) as there
was in the Nations before and after the <hi>flood</hi> especially in that
which is called <hi>Christendom,</hi> though we dare not conclude that all
are <hi>Israel</hi> that are of <hi>Israel,</hi> or that all are Christians that have the
name, yet generally I say the name of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Christ</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
and <hi>worshipped,</hi> and not <hi>Idols</hi> and false <hi>Gods;</hi> therefore
there is not the necessity of <hi>swearing</hi> by the name of God, as there
was at the time of the giving forth of the Law, but especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them that the Father will reckon as truly <hi>his subjects and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Christ,</hi> who are partakers of his <hi>divine nature,</hi> here is not
that necessity among them, <hi>for they through the Law being dead to it,
it hath no more power over them;</hi> and therefore no reason that they
should be kept as under <hi>Tutors and Governours,</hi> seeing <hi>that the age
and ages is come,</hi> which the Apostle spoke of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 7. wherein
Christ is revealed the hope of glory, and <hi>whom he makes free are
free indeed, Joh.</hi> 8. 32, 36.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and lastly, The command of Oaths was given for the
ending of strife and controversies among Men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. which hath
relation to the <hi>Law,</hi> and to the state of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
proceedings</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> brings but that in, as an instance or
an <hi>example,</hi> and it is but <hi>A. S.</hi> his groundless supposition that it
seems it was used in the Apostles time, the Apostle speaking of an
oath only as among <hi>men,</hi> and not of <hi>Saints,</hi> who as concerning
strife the occasion of swearing, and consequently concerning
swearing should not <hi>walk as men, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. but <hi>A. S.</hi> should
consider this as every one ought that when men that hath been
once in <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>contention,</hi> and <hi>variance,</hi> come once <hi>into Christ,</hi> and to be in him <hi>New Creatures,</hi> (Christians) to walk no more as
carnal, not as men, but as men of <hi>God,</hi> and as spiritual, and as <hi>true
Saints and Christians,</hi> they come both out of strife and swearing,
which was added to <hi>endstrife;</hi> and what ever <hi>A. S.</hi> may conclude,
we say these and divers more are great and weighty <hi>Reasons</hi>
wherefore Christ did prohibit all swearing, and puts it out of use
and date, and no necessity of it as among true Christians, seeing
that every true saying or testimony is equivolent with an oath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:94649:24"/>
His ninth Argument is, That either these words swear not at
all must not be extended to a total prohibition of swearing, or
else Christ thereby gave a new moral command, but Christ gave
no new moral command, for that had been contrary to Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
will, thou shalt not add unto the word which I command; &amp;
besides he ordained no new law in the matter of the <hi>6th.</hi> and <hi>7th.</hi>
Commandments, and shall we think that he who vindicated the
other Commandments from the leud depravations of men, hath
abrogated this only, as though it had not been framed by the same
wisdom, and acted by the same God, and further Christs oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is only against the Pharaseical misinterpretations of the Law,
and if only so, then Christ did not forbid such Oaths as was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
before enjoyned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> What ever <hi>A. S.</hi> call a new moral command, sure I am,
he commanded that which was more <hi>exact</hi> then the <hi>Law,</hi> so that
Doctor <hi>Gauden</hi> himself says, that Christ gave many singular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of more eminent <hi>diligence, patience, charity, moritification,
self-denial, sincerity,</hi> and the perfection of obedience required now
under the Gospel is above what ever the Letter of the <hi>Moseical
Law seemed to exact,</hi> or by the Pharaseical interpretation were
taught by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> &amp;c. in which he speaks the truth: it was
said in the 21. of <hi>Exod.</hi> and 42. of <hi>Levit.</hi> an eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth; but in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 39. Christ commanded that
which the Law had not spoken of, and not only a further thing,
<hi>but another thing,</hi> but I say unto you that ye resist not ill, <hi>but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also, ver.</hi> 40,
41. <hi>And if a man shall sue thee at law and take away thy coat, let him
have thy cloak also;</hi> where said the Law this, <hi>And whosoever shall
compell thee to go a mile go with him twain;</hi> where did ever the Law
of <hi>Moses</hi> command this? and though the Law said, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.
Thou shalt love thy Neighbour, and <hi>hate thine enemy;</hi> which he
saith was but a <hi>Pharaseical</hi> innovation, which if it be, I query of
<hi>A. S.</hi> where in the Law it is written, <hi>love thine enemy,</hi> and as was
said before, whether did not Israel fight with their enemies, and
<hi>kill them,</hi> and destroy them, and whether they had not a command
so to do, yea or nay? as in <hi>Deut 2. 24. chap. 3. 3. Numb.</hi> 21. 23,
24, 25. <hi>Josh.</hi> 10. 19. 23. And whether this be not <hi>another thing</hi>
that Christ saith, <hi>ver.</hi> 44. But I say unto you <hi>love your enemies, bless
them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, &amp;c.</hi> But it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94649:24"/>
that in the second Covenant under the Gospel that a more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
and exact obedience then was exprest in the Letter of the <hi>Law,</hi> which so far as it was <hi>typical,</hi> was only a <hi>temporary dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;</hi>
for as I said before the Letter of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be <hi>avenged on enemies, Aegiptians, Amalckites, &amp;c.</hi> And I
hope that <hi>A. S.</hi> will not conclude that they <hi>killed</hi> them in love to
them, and they might be avenged and take an <hi>eye</hi> for an <hi>eye,</hi> and a
<hi>tooth</hi> for a <hi>tooth,</hi> whose Gospel in other points which the Law had
not said forbids and condemnes <hi>rash anger, lust after women, polligum,
divorce, except for Fornication,</hi> and yet it was <hi>indulged</hi> and <hi>connived</hi>
at as under the Law, yet the Lord saith by the Prophet <hi>Malachy,
Mal.</hi> 2. 16. He <hi>hateth putting away;</hi> while the Letter condemned
no more but actual murder, and adultery, indulging and conniving
Polligume and divorce: And though under the Law, <hi>stripe for
stripe, wound for wound</hi> was permitted; but under the Gospel <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
not evil, avenge not, forbear, forgive,</hi> for the whole Law of <hi>Moses</hi>
was given by the dispensation of Angels in the hand of that <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
for a time;</hi> and so some swearing and such swearing as even <hi>by
God,</hi> was used in order to end strife, where it was yet standing, yet
Christ the Mediator of a better Covenant, in whose hand the Law
is now unto all <hi>Christians,</hi> he forbad not only that which the Law
<hi>allowed,</hi> and <hi>indulged, connived</hi> at and <hi>commanded</hi> in divers things,
as is manifest in this fifth of <hi>Mathew,</hi> where he prohibits all <hi>swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi>
so that it is evident that Christ doth not only reprove the
false glosses, and the abusive loose interpretations of the Law which
they allowed, but even <hi>divine indulgence</hi> dispensed with and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
at in the things before mentioned, because of the hardness
of their hearts: And let <hi>A. S.</hi> or any man living shew us wherein
Christ requires a <hi>righteousness</hi> or <hi>perfection</hi> that exceeds that of the
Law, for the Law said, swear not by any Creature but only by
God, and <hi>forswear not,</hi> and if Christ said no more but swear not
by any <hi>Creature,</hi> as Heaven and Earth, and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where is that
higher state of <hi>perfection,</hi> and that <hi>righteousness</hi> which exceeds that
of the <hi>Law,</hi> and of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though <hi>A. S.</hi> will not grant that he ordained a new Law in
matter of the 6. 7. Commandments, no more will he grant of the
fourth, which I suppose <hi>A. S.</hi> doth not keep as it was commanded
under the Law where ever he will have his <hi>dispensation</hi> I know not;
so to conclude in answer to this, he did more then reprove the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94649:25"/>
tenets and vicious manners of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and their false
<hi>interpretations</hi> and glosses which they had given upon the Law, but
he doth disallow also something which the law had allowed before,
as is proved before, and that he disallowed something, yea <hi>divers
things</hi> which the Law had allowed and <hi>connived,</hi> and <hi>indulged,</hi> as
<hi>divers Polligume, killing enemies, or in seeking revenge upon them that
had done ill unto us, which the law allowed as an act of justice, Deut.
19. 21. Eye for eye, &amp; tooth for tooth;</hi> but this Christ exhorted unto,
<hi>Overcome evil with good, avenge not, resist not, do good to them that
hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you:
Likewise the Law,</hi> Deut. 42. 1, 2. <hi>When a man takes a wife, and it
comes to pass she finds no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some
uncleanness in her, then let him write her a bill of Divorcement, and
send her out of his house, and when she is departed out of his house she
may go and be another mans wife: But</hi> Christ <hi>saith, Mat. 5. 32. who
shall marry her that is divorced, commits adultery:</hi> which is a clear
<hi>prohibition</hi> of that which the <hi>Law allowed,</hi> and what <hi>A. S.</hi> will call
this, whether a <hi>new moral</hi> command, or promulgation of a <hi>new
Law</hi> I know not, but it is evident enough that some things were
prohibited by Christ, which the <hi>law commanded,</hi> or at least allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and therefore we conclude from the 23. and 24. Verses of the
<hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>Mathew,</hi> that Christ <hi>did prohibite all vain swearing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
swearing,</hi> which was disallowed before <hi>under the Law,</hi> but
even <hi>all swearing</hi> which was <hi>commanded,</hi> or at least <hi>permitted under
the Law,</hi> for the reasons and ends given before, and this will stand
as truth, notwithstanding <hi>A. S.</hi> his Argument.</p>
            <p>His tenth Argument is, That if the high Priest charged Christ
to swear, and he without exception answered upon oath, and that
<hi>some years</hi> after he had said, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> from hence follows
that when the Magistrate imposeth an oath, the person charged to
swear may lawfully answer upon oath as Christ did, notwithstanding
<hi>his prohibition</hi> of <hi>swear not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> First that was a time when the <hi>administration</hi> of the first
<hi>Covenant</hi> was not fully ended, for Christ was not yet offred up,
and so the high Priest as being a <hi>Jew</hi> might from the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or permission of the Law as being one that sat in <hi>Moses chair</hi>
might require Christ to speak upon oath, <hi>as persumeing</hi> he had
authority so to do, being he looked upon it as a work of God;
and what though it was some years after Christ had said, <hi>Swear
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94649:25"/>
not at all;</hi> what doth <hi>A. S.</hi> infer from this, Christ knew that the
high Priest and Pharisees were about the work of their <hi>Father the
devil;</hi> and though the high Priest did say, <hi>I
adjure,</hi> which <hi>A. S.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Adjure doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sign sie to charge or oblige, by bare promise as well as <hi>Oath;</hi> for if the phrase, I adjure <hi>thee by God,</hi> be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to swear by God then this would make, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 13, 13. abusurd; when the Exorcists did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the evil spirit in the name of Jesus, (not to swear) but to come out or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of the man.</note> tells us is, <hi>I command
thee to swear to us;</hi> Christ answered in his own
authority, and in the power and wisdom of the
Father; and if he had answered as taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the high Priests adjuring, who was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to crucifie the Just, which was not the
work of God, neither was jurations or oaths,
ever intended to be instrumental in the Devils
work, then I argue that if Christ had answered
to his <hi>adjureing,</hi> knowing the end was to ensnare
him the <hi>Son of God,</hi> then Christ had consented
unto his evil work which were <hi>blasphemy</hi> to
think or speak, and therefore as it was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
of him, he was led as a Lamb to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
sometimes he <hi>opened not his mouth,</hi> the <hi>other sometimes</hi> he did
in the authority and power of the Father which was with him, and
in him, and though the high Priest charged Christ <hi>by the living God
that thou tell us whether thou be Christ the Son of the Living God, Mat.
26. 36, 37.</hi> Jesus answered, <hi>thou hast said,</hi> and what is this the
oath that Christ sware, <hi>A. S.</hi> tells us before that an oath was, an
<hi>attestation of God</hi> to the truth of what was said, but now the words
(<hi>thou hast said</hi>) barely of themselves without any <hi>attestation of God</hi>
is an oath; if the high Priest had said, art thou <hi>Peter,</hi> or art thou
<hi>John</hi> that was with <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Gallilee,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>I am Peter and I am John</hi> that was with him; what will
<hi>A. S.</hi> conclude now that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> hath <hi>sworn?</hi> away with
such <hi>perverting</hi> and <hi>straining</hi> and screwing of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> from
their <hi>genuine sence</hi> only to uphold that which was added because
of transgression, now when sin and transgression is finished the
end of Christs coming is witnessed to uphold that which Christ
came to end, to wit sin, and also an oath which was added be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of sin and unbelief, and the hardness of their hearts only to
remain till that part was done away, and untill the time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. to wit the bringing in of everlasting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and it cannot be reasonably concluded, that because Christ
answered the high Priest, <hi>thou hast said,</hi> that therefore he took
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94649:26"/>
notice of commanding to swear, or at least approving of his <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration,</hi>
knowing that he was about an evil work, and doing the
work of the Devil, which must needs be judged that Christ did
neither <hi>approve of,</hi> nor <hi>consent</hi> unto, what ever <hi>A. S.</hi> may say or
think, but only in his own authority spoke the truth, and made
a <hi>good confession</hi> as he did before <hi>Pontius Pilate to the glory of the
Father,</hi> who had sent him, whose will he came to do: And <hi>Luke</hi>
22. 70. Art thou then the Son of God? and he said unto them, <hi>ye
say that I am;</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> was as much a Magistrate as the high Priest,
and he asked art thou the King of the <hi>Jewes?</hi> and he answered
him, and said, <hi>thou sayest it:</hi> And <hi>Herod</hi> was as much a Magistrate
as either <hi>Pilate</hi> or the <hi>high Priest,</hi> and he questioned with him in
many words, but Christ answered nothing, so that he did not so
much take notice of their questions, or <hi>examining</hi> or <hi>charging,</hi> or
<hi>adjuring</hi> as <hi>A. S.</hi> would seem to make of it, but according to the
<hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>power of God</hi> which was in <hi>him</hi> spoke, and answered in
his own authority, without taking so much notice of them as he
would infer, he knowing what they were going about, though
they had the name and bore the title of <hi>Magistrates</hi> yet were out
<hi>of the power of God</hi> (in the persecuting nature) which is the ground
and foundation of all authority which is of God, but <hi>A. S.</hi> says
<hi>Marke</hi> 14. 62. relates plainly that Christ answered, <hi>I am;</hi> but yet
neither <hi>Marke, Luke,</hi> nor <hi>John</hi> takes so much notice of the high
Priests, <hi>adjuring</hi> or makes so much for <hi>A. S.</hi> his Argument as he
would have them, <hi>Marke</hi> saith only, <hi>Mar. 14. 61. the high Priest
asked him and said unto him, art th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u Christ the son of the blessed,</hi>
he doth not say, <hi>I adjure</hi> thee, <hi>or I charge</hi> thee to <hi>swear</hi> unto us,
as <hi>A. S.</hi> would have it; but thought <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 63. say, (<hi>I adjure</hi>
thee to tell us whether thou be Christ the Son of God?) is not
much material; for <hi>A. S.</hi> hath made more matter about it then is
to any great or good purpose, but I say he was as much bound to
answer <hi>Pilate</hi> or <hi>Herod</hi> as the <hi>high Priest,</hi> and as much directly to
one as to another, we see his answers was not all alike, but I would
not have <hi>A. S.</hi> nor my self neither sit as Judges over <hi>Christs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,</hi>
and <hi>squeeze</hi> and <hi>serue</hi> them beyond or contrary to <hi>Christs
intention;</hi> for the summe of the matter is this, <hi>thou hast said,
I am,</hi> and <hi>thou sayest I am King;</hi> and is Christs answers
to the high Priest and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and nothing to <hi>Herod;</hi> and
<hi>A. S.</hi> might as reasonably have concluded that the high Priest rent
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94649:26"/>
his Cloaths and cryed blasphemy, not so much at, <hi>thou hast said</hi> or
<hi>I am;</hi> as of this the next words, nevertheless I say unto you, <hi>ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in
the Clouds of Heaven;</hi> for then the next words are, <hi>then the high
Priest rent his Cloaths and cryed, blasphemy;</hi> and then <hi>A. S.</hi> goes on
it was enough that Christ denyed not to swear, and the summe of
all or the most that he can make when he hath twined about with
many Circumstances to prove that he did swear or consented to
<hi>Caiaphas adjuring,</hi> and answered his adjuring, this is all, <hi>I am,</hi>
and <hi>thou hast said;</hi> and therefore what either may be or can be said
<hi>A. S.</hi> hath concluded Christ did swear; and yet Sect. the 27. he
tells us that the essence of swearing is in <hi>calling God to witness,</hi> and
how or where did Christ call God to witness? then this overturns
his own argument, seeing we do not read that Christ sayed any
more in his answer, then as is aforesaid, <hi>I am,</hi> and thou <hi>hast said;</hi>
and he says to alledge that Christ sware not, because he laid not his
hand upon a <hi>Book</hi> or kissed, or lifted up his hand, is but to trifle,
yet he says that ceremony is ancient, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tells him that
it's above 1250. years since, if it be but to trifle, why are so many
conscientious people in bonds this day in <hi>England,</hi> under a Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nirey
for these trifles, a very shame to Christianity, for where any
or all of these have been denyed, though they have answered the
truth, and the whole truth, and as much as <hi>A. S.</hi> calls an oath, yet
this hath been counted insufficient, and we know <hi>Justinian</hi> the
Emperour ordain'd the ceremony that Men should swear by the
<hi>Gospel</hi> or Book, and lay their <hi>hands thereon</hi> and kiss, or the like;
and though it be so many years since it was ordained, as <hi>A. S.</hi> says,
this adds nothing to the warrantableness thereof, but custome is
proof enough to such a <hi>Ceremonious age as this,</hi> when <hi>formalities,
ceremonies, jestures</hi> and <hi>postures</hi> are more <hi>regarded</hi> then the <hi>power of
God and godliness,</hi> and we say such a <hi>ceremony</hi> about <hi>swearing</hi> are
not without the appearance of evil, for the <hi>Bible</hi> is a <hi>Creature</hi> made
up of <hi>many Creatures,</hi> and laying the hand, and kissing and adore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in such <hi>manner</hi> is I know-looked upon by many to be <hi>swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by it,</hi> and so the most takes it, and this were <hi>unlawful,</hi> and
therefore better to be <hi>whollyavoided</hi> then so many suffer because
they cannot <hi>do it,</hi> besides as I said, the evil appearance of it, for
it is not any <hi>Gospel institution,</hi> but an <hi>innovation</hi> since the <hi>Apostacy
entred in;</hi> and if God had ever judged any necessity thereof, or

that it had rendred an <hi>oath</hi> more <hi>solemn,</hi> the Law would have said
something of it, and it was never a practice among the <hi>Primitive
Christians,</hi> and therefore a vain <hi>humane tradition</hi> crept in since;
which ought to be <hi>avoided;</hi> and though <hi>A. S.</hi> say to reply that
Christ swore not, (though <hi>Caiaphas</hi> adjured him is vain) for an
examinate is to answer both in <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme</hi> according to what
is proposed, I say its <hi>A. S.</hi> his vain <hi>supposition</hi> and <hi>presumption</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ground so to judge that <hi>Christ swore,</hi> I say sometime he held
<hi>his peace,</hi> that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of him before that he should be as a <hi>Lamb dumb before the
shearer,</hi> as sometime he was, both to the <hi>chief Priests and Elders,</hi>
to <hi>Pilote,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Herod,</hi> which was all in some authority, and sometime
he answered them in the wisdom of God, and sometime he spoke
and bore witness to that, and prophesied unto them, which was
not at all either as to the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>forme</hi> of the high Priests <hi>adjure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
for the very next words, (<hi>but thou hast said,</hi> nevertheless I say
unto you, <hi>hereafter shall you see the son of man sitting on the right
hand of the power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven) Mat.</hi> 26. 64.
and therefore this showes <hi>A. S.</hi> his argument to be frivilous and
vain; and <hi>Marke</hi> saith, the chief Priests accused him of many things,
<hi>Marke</hi> 15. 3. but he answered <hi>nothing</hi> either to their accusations,
or took notice of the high <hi>Priests adjuring</hi> to answer him in <hi>matter
and forme,</hi> as <hi>A. S.</hi> would have it, neither did he look upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so oblig'd, but answered sometime, and spoke the truth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
when he spoke, and that which always displeased and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
the Jewes</hi> when he <hi>answered,</hi> and for ought can be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his arguing that every Examinate is to answer directly to
every matter and forme to any that <hi>pretends power</hi> to administer an
oath, or to adjure, he goes about to establish the <hi>Popes inquisition,</hi>
and create matter, as sometime they did here in <hi>England,</hi> in the
heighth of the <hi>Popes domination</hi> forged matter out of their own
<hi>wicked hearts</hi> to ensnare the <hi>Lambs of Christ</hi> and then to require
them to <hi>swear</hi> that they might <hi>destroy them,</hi> and accuse them out of
their own mouths, even as the <hi>high Priest</hi> sought to destroy Christ
and to ensnare him, which methinks <hi>A. S.</hi> hath sayed too much in
vindication of his <hi>adjuring,</hi> and will needs have Christ to be of
his mind, and at last concludes that Christ swore, but its but upon
his own <hi>presumption</hi> and <hi>supposition,</hi> and is more then ever he is
able to make evident from what is written: And <hi>A. S.</hi> tells us
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94649:27"/>
over and over again, Swearing was a part of Gods Worship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Gods <hi>wisdom, power,</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> is acknowledged, and then
incommunicable to any Creature or <hi>false God,</hi> as is answered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
so was <hi>Circumcision</hi> then, and the <hi>Oblations,</hi> and <hi>Burnt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
and <hi>Offrings,</hi> and <hi>new Moons</hi> to be performed only to the
<hi>Lord,</hi> and was peculiarly to be performed unto <hi>God,</hi> and not
<hi>communicable</hi> to any Creature; and we say and prove, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. 10. 20. that these was a part of the service and worship of God,
and which as we shall grant that an oath under the Law was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
as well as these services, or in his own terms an oath was
equally commanded with his service as is proved above; In this
he hath no adversary, but what doth this prove in respect of his
argument which makes it more (then <hi>equally commanded</hi>) for he
will yield that these services were but <hi>temporary,</hi> but swearing is
<hi>perpetual,</hi> and so he hath given it a <hi>priority</hi> above the rest, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
all along hath been chiefly drawn from the <hi>Moseick Law,</hi> that
it was joyned equally with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>service</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> and so
hath striven without an adversary, but now it must needs be above
the <hi>service of God then,</hi> and yet from the same <hi>command</hi> he would
only <hi>prove it,</hi> for he hath no better strength nor ground, and we
may as well alledge as he doth, and say consequently to this <hi>sort of
service</hi> that was <hi>commanded</hi> by the <hi>Lord</hi> as well as <hi>swearing,</hi> for
God hath joyned them together in the text above said, &amp; obligeth
<hi>equality</hi> at all times, as well under the Gospel as under the Law;
yet then <hi>A. S.</hi> would call this absurd it it be so as it is indeed,
then we may as well conclude the other absurd, because one is
standing as well as the other, and binding as well as the other by
the vertue of this command; although he tells us that an oath in its
substance; hath not any type at all, so we say, for the substance is
Christ the oath of God, in whom all the promises and oaths are
fulfilled, and this is its substance but as under: the Law it was a
type of the substance, and not the substance it self, and that <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi>
the Passeover, and the <hi>legal Offrings</hi> under the Law had
as much <hi>goodness in them</hi> as <hi>Oaths had,</hi> what ever <hi>A. S.</hi> say: and
<hi>served</hi> to as <hi>good ends</hi> and purposes in that <hi>Ministration</hi> as they were
ordained, and conduced as much to the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and were
subservient to, but not against the <hi>morality</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> for the
shadows were not <hi>against the substance,</hi> nor the <hi>Ceremonials</hi> against
the <hi>Morals,</hi> though the Apostle says, the <hi>Law is not of faith,</hi> yet
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94649:28"/>
not <hi>against it</hi> for as ministerial as the Ordinances of the Law was
to the Gospel then, yet the Gospel may be and now is <hi>without it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to conclude this Argoment <hi>A. S.</hi> were it so indeed that
oaths were ceremonial, then it follows that Christ in this text did
not forbid them, for he didnot forbid the Ceremonial Law, but
observed it all his life, eating the Passeover with his Disciples the
night before his death, unless some would interpret his words (I
command you that you do not swear) yet I am content for a year
or two you may swear by <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth</hi> as you have been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed,
but after my Crucifixion and Resurrection swear no more,
and there let these that disallow swearing as a part of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law, argue no more the unlawfulness of swearing from
these words,(<hi>swear not at all.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Though Christ did observe the Ordinances of the Law,
as being that Ministration appointed by God untill the time of
Reformation and the bringing in of a better hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
him to fulfill all Righteousness, so was he Cireumcised, and
eat the Passeover, and was <hi>Baptized, washed the Disciples feet,</hi> which
were not enjoyned by the Law, (though not against it) and that
Ministration not fully ended, though he see it must end, and spoke
of a further thing, and of the time then, and also it should be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
more afterward after his Resurrection, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 20, 21, 22,
23. the time cometh and <hi>now is, neither at Jerusalem, nor this
Mountain, but they that worship the Father shall worship him in spirit
and truth;</hi> so that he prophesied of the end of all those things, and
of the cessation of them, which were sometime commanded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
both the <hi>place and the worship,</hi> and to them that did believe
the <hi>Disciples,</hi> unto whom it was given to know the Mysteries of
the Kingdom of God, (<hi>then was the time</hi>) to them it was come,
even (then) before Christ suffred; and therefore <hi>A. S.</hi> his conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is not true (that Christ did not forbid all swearing from this
text) and though he had both prophesied of a clearer Ministration,
and laid down in Doctrine a more Evangelical precept then the
Law, yea and more strict obedience, yet notwithstanding many
did still hold up these things, which the Law commanded, though
they believed well of Christ, yea and after his suffring and Resure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and that a long time, though that the Apostles told them
the substance was come, and that there was no more Offring for
sin, nor Oblations, neither legal observations to be minded any
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94649:28"/>
more, yet still many observed them, and doubtless as to that <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
swearing</hi> that was among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and that vain swearing
too many did continue in it afterward notwithstanding <hi>Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
but then not submitting, <hi>made not his command void in it self,</hi>
and there is no necessity to make such an absurd interpretation as
that he permitted them to swear for a <hi>year or two,</hi> by Heaven and
Earth, and then at his passion to swear no more, for after he gave
forth the command there was no permission, and yet afterward
as I said the Apostles declared against the <hi>shadows.</hi> and <hi>preached up
the</hi> substance, and as <hi>A. S.</hi> confesseth the types <hi>ceased</hi> of themselves,
but let him know that there was a time of dying to them, and
they <hi>ceased not all at once</hi> to them that had <hi>observed the Law,</hi> neither
was the Mysteries revealed all at <hi>once,</hi> but as they grew in faith and
<hi>knowledge,</hi> for the Righteousness of God is revealed from faith to
faith, and though the <hi>legal observations</hi> were observed in Christs
time, so were they after, by many, but by <hi>right ended</hi> in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and when he was come, though many did not see it till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward:
But I come to his <hi>11th.</hi> Argument.</p>
            <p>Eleventh Argument, no exposition of the text or any other
is to be admitted, that puts inconsistancy betwixt the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the New, seeing both are inspired by the same God, who
is incapable of falshood or alteration; where upon if we be not
so atheistical as to deny, the varasity or immutability of the most
high, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. it must be granted that his word is of eternal
truth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. his promises yea and amen, his precepts more
unalterable then the Lawes of the <hi>Medes and Persians,</hi> nor did our
Saviour come to destroy but to fulfill the Law, thereupon he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes
obedience to the commands of the Pharisees, as sitting in
<hi>Moses</hi> chair, <hi>Mat. 23. 2, 3.</hi> from all which it is apparent that the
Old Testament is so far from being contradicted, that it is fully
confirmed in the new; therefore I may well draw this conclusion
that these words (swear not at all) ought not to be interpreted as
to render all svvearing unlawful, <hi>Deut. 6. 13. psal. 63. 11.</hi> not
without promise of reward, <hi>Jer. 12. 16.</hi> and it was prophesied
before by <hi>Isaiah</hi> that Christians under the Gospel should swear,
<hi>Isaiah</hi> 19. 18. and 4. and 23. and I look upon it as a piece of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,</hi>
and extremely derogatory both to the Scripture and God
himself, therefore what moral duty one man was commended in
the Law, another should be condemned in the new.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:94649:29"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> 'Tis true no exposition of this text or any other is to
be admitted that puts such a difference, betwixt the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new
Testaments</hi> in matter of substance, but shall agree with <hi>Austin: the
Law is the Gospel vailed, and the Gospel is the Law revailed;</hi> and
what was prophesied and typefied in the first is fulfilled in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but what shall be thought of them, that holds up the <hi>types and
figures of the first,</hi> as though they were not <hi>fulfilled,</hi> or as though
the <hi>promise</hi> were not come: and he made manifest in whom all
shadowes end; and though God be unchangable in himself, and
incapable of falsehood or alteration, and I know none, who denies
the <hi>varasity</hi> of his word, or the <hi>immutability</hi> of the most high:
yet notwithstanding I cannot set up the <hi>changable Priesthood, and
Covenant:</hi> and the <hi>Ordinances</hi> belonging <hi>thereunto,</hi> against the
<hi>unchangable and everlasting Priesthood and Covenant,</hi> and as hath
been said before, as though that all the precepts, therein were so
unalterable, as that of necessity they must needs continue, as <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
to generations, I might <hi>truss</hi> up together many Scriptures,
and thwack them one on the back of another, which belongs to
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the first Covenant most properly, (till the Seed
Christ was revealed, and offred up) and I might bring in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to prove that many things was commanded by the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
God, and by him who is uncapable of alteration, and multiply
many words, as <hi>A. S.</hi> doth to little purpose, and say what was
written in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> was by the <hi>inspiration</hi> of God, and
that his precepts is no more alterable then the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi>
and <hi>Persians,</hi> and therefore they must needs still be <hi>observed</hi> by
all Christians to the worlds end, or else conclude they that
do not are <hi>atheistical,</hi> and denies Gods <hi>varasity,</hi> and makes the Law
of <hi>God</hi> void; and what would all this in arguing prove, nothing
at all; the <hi>Jewes</hi> will confess as much, and plead as hard as <hi>A. S.</hi>
can, who yet have not believed in him, of whom the Prophets
prophesied, neither hath received him who is the <hi>substance</hi> of what
<hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> bore witness, and in whom the <hi>Law</hi> is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
and the <hi>Promises</hi> made <hi>good,</hi> and confirmed with, and in
whom all the <hi>shadows</hi> ends, and the vaile done away, and all the
worship and precepts belonging thereunto: who hath manifested
and revealed the Father in all that believe, who is the <hi>new and
living way,</hi> whose worship is not now in the Letter, nor in the
shadows, nor types, nor in any outward observations, but in <hi>spirit
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94649:29"/>
and truth is he worshipped, for he seeketh such to worship him;</hi> for the
great promise of reward was to, as ever was to swearing; yet
when they resisted him <hi>whom the Father had sent,</hi> all their <hi>observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
though never so strict did not avail; but their <hi>Circumcision
became Vncircumcision,</hi> and their worship and service became
<hi>prophaneness,</hi> when they dispised the substance by whom grace and
truth came to all the children of promise: and we grant with
<hi>A. S.</hi> that he came not to destroy the Law but to fulfill it, and to
end both <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>transgression,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> which was added be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of it, and to bring in everlasting Righteousness, and it to
rule in the hearts of all that believe; and against such there is no
Law; and though Christ enjoyned the Disciples, <hi>Mat,</hi> 23. to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
what the Scribes and Pharisees bad them who sat in <hi>Moses</hi>
Chair and read the Law, and performed those services in part,
commanded; that was the time before he was offered up, and the
Ministration of that Covenant was not fully ended; yet I hope
<hi>A. S.</hi> with us will grant that they were not to <hi>heed them</hi> or to
<hi>obey them</hi> in their <hi>vain Traditions</hi> and false glosses, and <hi>interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and evil manners which he cryed wo against, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 13, 14.
neither after his Resurrection did he enjoyne them to hear the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> neither to observe the Legal Ordinances of the first
Priesthood, but they declared against them and <hi>their practice,</hi> which
continued in the <hi>observation</hi> of those things <hi>which did not make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as pertaining to the Conscience, Heb. 8. 9. Heb.</hi> 9. 9. and for all
these texts he alledges out of the Old Testament, <hi>Mat. 6. 13.
Psal. 63. 11. Jer.</hi> 12. 16. unto these it hath been answered that
this proves nothing that Christians under the second Covenant
should swear as they did in the first, for these Precepts were only
to keep them from Idolatry, for <hi>Jer. 12. 16. If you will diligently
learn the ways of my people to swear by my name (the Lord liveth) as
they taught my people to swear by (Baal) then shall they be builded in
the midst of the people:</hi> And the 6. <hi>of Deut.</hi> 13 14. is to the same
effect, <hi>You shall fear the Lord and serve him, and swear by my name:</hi>
And Verse the 14. <hi>Ye shall not go after other Gods.</hi> All these only
prove that the Nations went after <hi>other Gods and sware by them,
and served them, and Israel</hi> too prone to follow their manners did
so also, and therefore he gave them these Precepts to <hi>serve</hi> him,
and <hi>fear</hi> him, and acknowledge him, to keep them from Idolatry,
as hath been said; in the state of their Minority and weakness, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94649:30"/>
that before the seed was revealed; and that which <hi>A. S.</hi> calls a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
by <hi>Isa.</hi> 19. 18. of <hi>Christians swearing</hi> under the Gospel, its
no such thing but a prophesie of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> his joyning to the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
and owning their worship, and their God, and acknowledge him;
<hi>and do sacrifice and oblation, yea and vow a vow unto the Lord and
performe it, ver. 21.</hi> Which clearly hath relation to the Law and
the Worship of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and not to the <hi>Gospel;</hi> so that <hi>A. S.</hi>
might have as well said it was a <hi>promise how Christians under the
Gospel</hi> should <hi>offer sacrifice and oblations</hi> as under the Law, as well as
<hi>swear.</hi> But the Doctor hath traversed many paths which are
crooked, winding, and turning, to gather something together, and
hath fetched it farre to prove swearing under the Gospel, but all
his proofe falls short of his matter by much: And that of <hi>Isaiah</hi>
the 5. 23. is a prophesie of <hi>Israels</hi> return out of the Captivity of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> in the days of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom the <hi>Lord called his anoynted,
and shepherd,</hi> Isa. 44. 28. 45. who made a Decree for all <hi>Israel</hi> to
go out of <hi>Assyria</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and build their <hi>City,</hi> and their
<hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Worship their God</hi> according as he had commanded; as
may be seen at large in the Book of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nebemiah,</hi> and this
was fulfilled (then) when they builded the <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>Temple in
those days,</hi> (long before Christ was manifest in the flesh) and then
did <hi>Israel</hi> return, and every knee did bow, and every tongue did
<hi>swear</hi> by the <hi>Lord,</hi> which before the Captivity had not <hi>bowed,</hi> nor
<hi>served,</hi> nor <hi>acknowledged his Name,</hi> but <hi>Idols</hi> which provoked the
Lord, and therefore gave he them into the hand of the <hi>Babylonians</hi>
for <hi>seventy years</hi> till they were humbled, and then brought them
back according to <hi>Jeremiah, Isaiah, Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,
for this was fulfilled; then is spoken by <hi>Isaiah</hi> in this
Prophesie, <hi>Isaiah 5. ver. 23, 24, 25.</hi> (without contradiction to
Christs command) and his command entrencheth not upon this
prophesie, neither doth this make the Gospel thwart the Law,
beyond all terms of reconciliation, as <hi>A. S.</hi> vainly suggests in his
margent, for this prophesie was fulfilled long before Christ gave
forth this command, swear not <hi>at all:</hi> Moreover, if this prophesie
have any relation to the state of the Christian Church (as <hi>A. S.</hi>
supposes, upon what ground I know not, saving his own affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
then we shall consider and see how it is fulfilled under the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> and what the Gospel allowes of in this particular; the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> a Minister of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> not of the Letter, as he saith
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94649:30"/>
himself, which some interprets to be the Law, citeth this prophesie
of <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 23. compare it with <hi>Rom.</hi> the 14. <hi>ve.</hi> 11. for it is written
(where? in <hi>Isaiah</hi> before cited,) <hi>As I live saith the Lord every knee
shall bow unto me, and every tongue shall confess to God;</hi> and in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians
the 2. v. 10, 11. that at the Name of Jesus whom the Father
hath sent, whom all is to obey,</hi> unto whom all power is given in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth;</hi> the Apostle citing again the very words of the
Prophet says unto him <hi>(viz.) Jesus, every knee shall bow;</hi> and ver.
the 11. <hi>and that every tongue shall confess to the glory of God the Father;</hi>
so that it cannot be reasonably thought or judged that if God had
required swearing by his name among Christians as among the
<hi>Jewes</hi> that the Apostle thus should alter the words as to put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
instead of swearing, seeing he says he used always plainness
of speech, for this had not been plainness, and we have better
reason to believe the Apostle, unto whom the Gospel was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
whom the son was <hi>revealed in,</hi> who declared the whole
<hi>Council</hi> of God, and yet never either <hi>commanded</hi> or <hi>exhorted</hi> any
to <hi>swear,</hi> or reproved them for not <hi>swearing</hi> by the <hi>name of God</hi>
(as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did) in all his writings that are extant, I say we have
better ground to believe him and his rendering of the words of
the <hi>Prophet</hi> to be according to the <hi>mind of Christ,</hi> where he puts
in confession to the <hi>Christians</hi> (which before was <hi>swearing</hi> to the
<hi>Jewes</hi>) as being acquainted with the command of Christ, <hi>Mat.
5. 23. Swear not at all:</hi>) and what ever <hi>A. S.</hi> look, upon it as to be
<hi>Heresie,</hi> and derogatory both to the Scriptures and God himself,
it is not much matter of Man's judgment, he might as well accuse
<hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apostle,</hi> the one forbidding <hi>to swear,</hi> and the other
for <hi>deminishing</hi> from the Scripture, and <hi>altering</hi> the <hi>Prophets words;</hi>
and though it seems strange to <hi>A. S.</hi> yet it is not to us that some
Men was commanded in the Old Testament for observing some
things, yea many things, which is condemned in the New, and
yet God is not dishonoured, neither the Scripture broken; if we
see the end of every command, and the time for which it served,
and the service for which it served, as this about Oaths, hath been
sufficiently declared before, to keep the <hi>Jewes</hi> from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to
<hi>end strife</hi> among them where it was; (but among true Christians,
indeed) <hi>strife</hi> is <hi>ended</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> is <hi>come,</hi> and they seek it with all
Men; and that is <hi>done away</hi> (for which the <hi>Law was added</hi>) to
wit <hi>sin and transgression, diffidence and unbelief, and strife,</hi> and no
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94649:31"/>
necessity of them among them; and all the morality that doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
is confession, or saying, or testimony in true words in any
matter is that which is equivolent with an oath, and is that which
is the most conforme to Christ and the Apostles Doctrine, under
the Gospel: but I come to his last Argument.</p>
            <p>Twelfth and last Argument, The consent of the Christian
world; the practice of <hi>Emperours, Kings, Princes, Councils, Bishops,</hi>
and people of all sorts, confirme this truth that Christ notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
these words, (<hi>Swear not at all</hi>) had never forbidden swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
as altogether unlawful; 'Tis true, some of the Fathers in
their Homilies, &amp; to the People inveighed much against swearing,
as though it had been altogether unlawful, but it was only against
Customary Oaths; <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his Homily to the People of
<hi>Antioch</hi> preached so much against <hi>Swearing</hi> that the People was
offended, he told them he would never leave that Sermon till
they would leave that prophane custome of <hi>Swearing;</hi> but the
Fathers were less cautelous, but with great vehemency enveigh'd
against common swearing in ordinary discourse; but not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to take away necessary Oaths; but <hi>Origen</hi> in his first
Book against <hi>Colsus,</hi> God is witness of my Conscience; and <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
yet vehemently declaimed against prophane swearing, yet
in his Apology to the <hi>Emperour Constantius,</hi> he sware again and
again, the <hi>Lord is witness,</hi> and his <hi>Christ is witness:</hi> All which
clearly shews they did not disallow the voluntary taking an oath,
much less in <hi>Judical proceedings,</hi> and the Reformed Churches, and
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the whole Catholick Church in all
times and places approved this Doctrine, that all swearing is not
unlawful; so that it follows that the Church in all Ages was so
ignorant as not to understand Christs meaning, or so wicked as to
teach and practise quite contrary, or else Christ never meant to
forbid all kind of swearing, (to assert the former) were to profess
all that went before either dunces or devils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> What ever <hi>A. S.</hi> conclude and think he hath not such a
consent among Christians, as he makes a great flourish of; it's
manifest by what hath been said, Christ prohibited it <hi>amongst his
Disciples, Swear not at all;</hi> and likewise <hi>James</hi> the Apostle agrees
in the same Doctrine, and the rest of the Apostles, also all the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians</hi> were esteemed so <hi>strict, exact,</hi> &amp; <hi>cautious</hi> of their <hi>asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
or <hi>promising,</hi> that there was no need of an Oath among them,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94649:31"/>
they kept up the <hi>sanctity, credit</hi> of their <hi>profession,</hi> yea among un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,
that it was security enough in all cases to say, <hi>Christianus
sum,</hi> I am a Christian, as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> asserts; and if they were
urged any further to any oath, for matter or manner they repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this as the only satisfaction they could give, there needed no
more then the veracity of their bare record; and thus much
Bishop <hi>Gauden</hi> confesseth, and also in the 36. page of his Book he
says, <hi>the ground or foundation for swearing now is the wickedness and
unbelief of men;</hi> but Christians (truly such) are brought out of
evil and wickedness, unbelief and distrust, and there is no necessity
among them either publick or private to swear at all: <hi>Polibus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
in the better, and simpler ages of the World, <hi>Oaths
were seldome used in Judicatures, but after unbelief and lying increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
Oaths increased,</hi> as a only remedy to cure and restrain those
evils: (but let it not be said that those are Christians) that names
Christs name and departs not from iniquity, and since the peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
times came on that the Apostles spoke, that Men would not
abide <hi>sound Doctrine</hi> but be lovers of themselves, that should have
a <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>godliness and deny the power thereof;</hi> such went out of
the truth, and went into the world, and the <hi>world went after them,</hi>
and the false Church began to rise to dignity, and have the name
of Christian, though she consented not to the <hi>wholsome Doctrine
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, swear not at all,</hi> but perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this, as she hath done many other Doctrines, and beguiled the
<hi>Kings of the Earth, and held out her golden cup of Fornication,</hi> and
made Emperours, Kings, and Princes drunk with her Fornication,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 18. Councils, Bishops and People are in their Judgments,
and by tradition one age after another have holden that lawful
which Christ did not <hi>prohibit;</hi> but what doth all this prove, for
it's manifest that most of the ancient Fathers of the Church, as
<hi>Origen, Chrysostome, Theophilact, Hillary, Athanasius, Jerome,
Theodoret, Laurentius,</hi> and others in their Sermons and Homilies
to the People, vehemently and frequently enveighed against all
swearing without any <hi>Limitation,</hi> without any <hi>reserve</hi> amongst
<hi>Christians</hi> swearing as to private Conversation, yet they did not
disallow the voluntary taking an oath, much less in <hi>Judicature he
says;</hi> but those are but terms of his own shufling in, and what he
speaks only of his own head, by mingling his own <hi>words</hi> with
<hi>theirs,</hi> for his own ends, for there is no such distinction made by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94649:32"/>
them, as he makes, as lawful <hi>swearing</hi> and prophane swearing, and
<hi>voluntary swearing,</hi> and swearing in <hi>Judicature;</hi> and it's to be
desired that <hi>A. S.</hi> had but produced their testimonies, and have
cited only their own words without adding to them, that they
would have made much against him, for it's plain their judgment
and witness was against all swearing what ever. But <hi>A. S.</hi> tell us,
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his Homily to the People of <hi>Antioch</hi> preached so
much against that prophane custome of swearing, that the People
were offended, and he told them that he would never leave that
Sermon till they did leave swearing; It were to be desired that
more in this age who pretends to be Christian Ministers would
follow his example, for the like I believe hath not been in any age;
Oh what customary, vain, rash, prophane, ungodly oaths (in their
acceptation) take <hi>Gods holy Name</hi> upon every <hi>trivial</hi> occasion in vain
in their mouths, and daily inventing new oaths and execrations,
even <hi>daring God to confound them and damn them;</hi> yea it grieves
my heart to think, and the spirit of the Lord in me, to consider
what sounded in my ears not long since, which I mention with
<hi>detestation</hi> and <hi>abhorrency,</hi> that some when they had sworn even all
the customary oaths, and all the new invented oaths, did profer
10. <hi>shill.</hi> to any that could invent ten new oaths, even glorying in
sin, and making a mock at it; and indeed it is fearful to hear, how
without any reverence unto God, or dread of his Majesty, oaths
(these late years) are broke out like a <hi>land-flood</hi> over all the banks,
and no where so much to be found, nor no where so common as
among them that reckons themselves <hi>conformable men,</hi> (loyal) and
<hi>members of the Church of England,</hi> which is one crying sin that
draws down the judgment of God upon this Land, and what cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
can be given to such Men in Judicature, shall we not say as St.
<hi>Austin</hi> says, <hi>It disposes men to false swearing and gross perjury, nor
can indeed much credit be given any more then to a Lyar to any man
that swears never so solemnly, and in Judicature, who is a common
swearer:</hi> But instead of beating down that for <hi>which the Land
mournes, Jer.</hi> 23. 10. many are even <hi>propagators of it,</hi> and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for it, and glories in it, and its become almost the only mark
of a <hi>conformable man:</hi> Oh what a sad time are we fallen into, and
what a sad state that they that depart from this great <hi>iniquity</hi> are
become a <hi>prey;</hi> I say it had been more time for <hi>A. S.</hi> to have used
his utmost endeavours this way, rather then to have opposed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94649:32"/>
Christ's Doctrine, and added affliction to the <hi>bonds</hi> of <hi>conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sufferers,</hi> who dare neither <hi>swear</hi> nor <hi>lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to digress <hi>A. S.</hi> he would make the Fathers as he doth
with Christ and the Apostles, he would make all <hi>dance</hi> after his
<hi>Pipe,</hi> and make them all of his mind, and <hi>construe</hi> and <hi>interpret</hi> all
their words to his end though never intended, and therefore he
says they were not <hi>cautelous</hi> enough, and so doth with them as he
doth with Christ, he makes their <hi>words one thing,</hi> and their <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
another;</hi> though saith he, <hi>Origen</hi> in his 25. Tract upon <hi>Math.</hi>
says that Christ did forbid all swearing, yet he himself swears in
his Book against <hi>Celsus,</hi> for he said, <hi>God is witness</hi> of <hi>my conscience;</hi>
and <hi>Athanatius</hi> though he declaimed against swearing, yet in his
Apology to <hi>Constantious</hi> he swears again and again, and why he
wrote as the Apostle did (the <hi>Lord is witness</hi>) and <hi>Christ is witness,</hi>
and these must needs be oaths, and voluntary oaths; it's not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that they should use voluntary oaths when they declaimed
against all <hi>Oaths;</hi> and therefore <hi>Origen</hi> saith, <hi>It behoves not a man
who lives according to the Gospel to swear at all:</hi> And <hi>Jerome, the
Gospel truth admits not of an Oath:</hi> Likewise <hi>Chrysostome</hi> who was
Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> (in Commendations of whom much is
said in the Ecclesiastical Histories, <hi>Acts and Monuments, vol. 21. fol.</hi>
70. too) blames them greatly who brings forth a Book to swear
upon, charging the Clerks that in no wise <hi>they constraine any body to
swear, whether they think a man swear true or false, saying it's a sin to
swear well.</hi> So that not only swearing upon a Book was reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but even all swearing, such as <hi>A. S.</hi> calls lawful: <hi>Theophilact</hi>
upon the place in controversie, <hi>Learn hence that under the Law it
was no evil for men to swear, but since the coming of Christ it is evil, as
Circumcision, and in some what ever is Jewdeical:</hi> to omit <hi>Wickliffe,
John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> who were faithful Men and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in their Generation, which the Reformed Churches is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to for their Testimony in other weighty things against the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though <hi>A. S.</hi> will not own them in this, but
rather takes part with them who burned his Bones 41. years after
his decease, and burnt his Books and these Articles condemned by
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> who also burned <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi>
of <hi>Prague,</hi> who maintained his Articles, <hi>that all Oaths be made for
any contract or evil bargain betwixt man and man be unlawful under
the Gospel; and</hi> Walter Bevite <hi>whose testimony with many others was,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94649:33"/>
that as the perfection of the Old Testament was not to forswear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
so the perfection of Christ was not to swear at all, because they
are so commanded of Christ, whose commandement in no case must be
broken:</hi> the Testimony of many worthy Men and godly <hi>sufferers</hi> at
this time is suitable to many of the Fathers before mentioned;
But this <hi>A. S.</hi> calls error; <hi>who said so?</hi> the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> with whom <hi>A. S.</hi> joynes rather then the
sufferers of Christ, and they who hold it an error not to swear at
all, and yet no error to break it when they have a mind, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with it as the <hi>Papists</hi> doth to this very day, And these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Church doubtless were the best of Men in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
age, and were neither dunces nor devils, but understood
by the signification of Gods spirit in them the Doctrine of Christ,
(and that which was consentaneous thereunto) was witnessed by
divers in after ages before mentioned, which <hi>A. S.</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and why the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had called them
so, and them that sat at the sterne, who always called themselves
<hi>Orthodox,</hi> and others <hi>Heterodox</hi> that did not sing to the
same tune in swearing, and every thing else, when they had once
got up into a <hi>pompious lordly dominion over Mens faith:</hi> but what
doth this prove? nothing at all; and what doth this prove which
<hi>A. S.</hi> inserts in his Marginal notes? that the Ministers who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Transilvania,</hi> swear <hi>Canonical obedience</hi> to
their <hi>Bishops,</hi> or the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Confessions of
<hi>Helvetia, Basil,</hi> or others whom he calls reformed: what of all
this? what doth this prove from the Scripture of truth, or as
to the <hi>convincement</hi> of them who hold it unlawful to swear under
the Gospel, because Christ hath <hi>prohibited it</hi> by his Doctrine, what
is all that <hi>A. S.</hi> hath said in his Arguments to dissenters satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
who know hundreds of things wherein as much as they fall
out and fight even to blood with each other about their <hi>fancied
formalities,</hi> they all agree in against the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>godliness,</hi>
and against the very <hi>appearance</hi> of the Image of him in his holiness,
who is the <hi>substantial truth</hi> it self, we say what is all this to some,
that dissents from <hi>A. S.</hi> his judgment, and others he calls reformed
whose faith stands higher then the wisdom and thoughts of Men
who cannot consent so as to lead their <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> captive after
them to try this or any other truth, seeing it is the <hi>gift</hi> of God,
and the <hi>inspiration</hi> of the Almighty gives understanding, &amp; though
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94649:33"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and you agree in this, though you damne one
another in other matters what is this to us? it shewes only they
erred from the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, and you <hi>in
this and many other things are not separated from them;</hi> and thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
which thou accords with is false, that though God in the
Old Testament commanded it, yet it doth not follow that Christ
in the new did not forbid it, (neither that Christ and his Apostles
practised it) who were under another Covenant, and for ought
can be perceived by <hi>A. S.</hi> by that he calls voluntary swearing
which he hath no ground for, though in other places he seem to
condemn vain swearing and customary oaths, yet in this he looks
not like himself, but seems to tollerate a kind of oaths we find no
mention made of in the New Testament, and yet we shall not
conclude as <hi>A. S.</hi> says, that all were so ignorant as not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
Christ's mind, nor so wicked as to teach the quite contrary to
his mind; for it is manifest many have been of the mind of Christ
in former ages and latter, though we shall never strive to bring in
all the world, or the <hi>heathen,</hi> or Nations, that became as <hi>waters</hi>
after the publication of the Gospel, nor that <hi>Rable</hi> which he calls
the Christian world, which hath wondered after the Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.
4. and yet there hath been still some Testimony borne through
ages unto the Doctrine of Christ, and Christs Doctrine stands in
force and in that latitude that he intended it, notwithstanding
<hi>A. S.</hi> his Reasons and Arguments, and many more as to forbid all
oaths in the second Covenant to his Disciples (truly such) <hi>in these
words, swear not at all:</hi> Many instances might be brought of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Bishops might be instanced, as <hi>Otha</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi>
in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Bosilius</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> who refused to swear;
and though <hi>A. S.</hi> cannot trace it beyond <hi>Pelagius</hi> or <hi>Manacheus,</hi> yet
we know that both Christ and the Apostles confirmes it, and also
the <hi>Essarus</hi> among the <hi>Jewes</hi> did refuse to swear at all, even in
<hi>Judicature;</hi> for <hi>Josephus</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> saith of them, whatsoever they
say is as firme as an oath, and to <hi>swear</hi> among them was counted
a thing <hi>superfluous:</hi> Likewise St. <hi>Basil</hi> commends <hi>Chinas</hi> a famous
<hi>Greek</hi> that he suffered a fine of three Talents rather then he
would save it by swearing, to the loss of his honour; and shall
Christians (truly such) with whom truth abideth, and in whom
it dwelleth, come short of that exactness that was among some
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94649:34"/>
of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and the best and the virtuousest of them called
<hi>Heathen;</hi> shall not this kind of Christianity which is professed in
this day, who is in <hi>unbelief, frauds, infirmities, contentions,</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by these? shall not this <hi>circumcision</hi> become <hi>uncircumcision?</hi>
and shall not they that fear to swear and deny all oaths be set above
this, whose <hi>yea</hi> is <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay, nay, in all their communication,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto Christs Doctrine? shall not this inherit the promise?
and is not this more Gospel like, to say <hi>speak, testifie,</hi> and do the
<hi>truth,</hi> rather then to go back to <hi>Judaism,</hi> or into <hi>contention, strife,
emulation</hi> and <hi>distrusts</hi> that the Swearers are in? (falsly reputed
Christians) and yet abides not in his Doctrine? But having done
with <hi>A. S.</hi> his negative part, I come to his affirmative part which is
no other then hath been answered over and over again, yet he
thinks he hath said more in clearing of it then others hath said,
that Christ only forbad swearing by Creatures, and that indeed
is the sum of his affirmative discourse, and the Pharisees inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.
And he brings the judgments of divers Expositers
upon this text, first promisary oaths are here principally forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
2ly. others think that Christ only here forbad such oaths
as then was used in common discourse; 3ly. others say that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
false and rash, and vain Oaths are generally here prohibited;
4ly. many understand that by these words of <hi>Christ,</hi> all swearing
by Creatures is forbidden, but not that by <hi>God himself;</hi> and last
of all <hi>A. S.</hi> gives his thoughts, which are as follows.</p>
            <p>That Christ did not forbid what the Law had commanded, but
only the Pharesaical corrupt glosses thereon, and the irreligious
practices of the misinformed <hi>Jewes;</hi> and cites <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi>
who says upon this place they were accustomed to swear by
Heaven, and by Creatures; and further <hi>A. S.</hi> says, the Pharisees
taught them to affirme what ever they had promised, swearing <hi>by
God;</hi> they under a spacious pretention that they would not take
God's name in vain upon a sleight occasion, fell to swear <hi>by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
which <hi>Grotius</hi> showes out <hi>Philo Judeos,</hi> which the Pharisees
did not disallow, the easier thereby to delude such credulous
people as believed those oaths which themselves neither thought
obligatory, nor meant to keep, and it's certain the Scribes and
Pharisees taught the people that to swear by several Creatures, as
by the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> was not binding; Christ reproves them
as blind guides upon that account, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 16. and further they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94649:34"/>
taught it was perjury indeed to break an <hi>Oath</hi> if a man had sworn
<hi>by God,</hi> but not if he had only sworn by Creatures: In exposition
of which Christ forbids all swearing by Creatures, and teaches
contrary to the <hi>Jewes</hi> Rabbies that such oaths ought not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
yet being taken are binding in respect of Creatures relation
to the Creator, and Christ reckons them among sinful oaths, and
teacheth them to use only bare <hi>affirmations</hi> or <hi>denials</hi> in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
and this is the very summe of his judgment; and the
words of Christ is only to be limited to this sense and no further,
this is not to swear at all by Creatures in their mutual converse
and communications; and this he hath repeated over and over in
his Book, and this is the furtherest latitude that he will allow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ's prohibition, <hi>swear not at all;</hi> and this interpretation
before mentioned he looks upon to be the genuine meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and is the judgment of Doctor <hi>Gauden</hi> also, who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as hard for some swearing as <hi>A. S.</hi> hath; and I perceive
that <hi>A. S.</hi> hath read the answer to Bishop <hi>Gauden,</hi> published by
that precious servant of the Lord <hi>Samuel Fisher,</hi> who finished his
Life in bonds for the Gospel truth against <hi>all swearing,</hi> whose an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
stands firme, and his demonstrative arguments of force, and
is yet unanswered, though <hi>A. S.</hi> hath a little here and there carped
at, and hath bitten at the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>el, but hath not made void at all his
answer, which will live as a living testimony in generations to
come, as consonant unto Christ's Doctrine, wherein he prohibites
all oaths under the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Though there be some truth in the different Authors
which is alledged, and also in <hi>A S.</hi> his words, that swearing by
Creatures, as <hi>heaven,</hi> and <hi>earth, Jerusalem,</hi> and <hi>vain oaths,</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
and customary <hi>oaths,</hi> and the <hi>corrupt glosses</hi> of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi>
and the false <hi>interpretations,</hi> yet all this comes short of <hi>Christ's
mind,</hi> and of the true <hi>genuine sense</hi> of the words and the scope of
<hi>Christ's Sermon</hi> as is manifest in the Chapter, and in his Testament,
and all he hath said will not help him to carry on that work he
hath undertaken, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Justification of any, or the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of any swearing, or the defence of that limited sense, he
would put upon the universal terms in the 2. texts wherein Christ
and the Apostle forbids all swearing: And though <hi>A. S.</hi> often tells
us Christ did not forbid what the <hi>Law</hi> had commanded, neither
gave any <hi>new possitive Law</hi> before his death; he sure hath forgot
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94649:35"/>
himself much; what will become of the two great Ordinances
still upheld, as <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and breaking of <hi>Bread?</hi> and whether
was this a new Institution of Christ, or was it an Institution in the
<hi>Law?</hi> and if it was an Institution of Christ (as the Church of
<hi>England</hi> doth hold) and not of the Law, nor of <hi>Moses,</hi> (as indeed
it was not (then <hi>A. S.</hi> his argument is fallen to the ground, that he
gave no new commandment, neither instituted any new ordinance?
and then what is become of these two great Mysteries as they
have been called? but he hath ravelled out and spun out his threed
so long, that he often runs off his legs; and though <hi>A. S.</hi> do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
urge that he came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it:
and therefore hath said falsly that Christ sware before the High
Priest after he had given forth this Commandment, swear not at
all, which if it had been true it had been no more president for
Christians then eating the Passeover; and though he sometimes
urge that such oaths as were commanded under the Law are not
forbidden by that text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 38. because it was spoken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
before his death, and the Ministration of the first Covenant
was not ended till his death; and therefore he concludes that all
oaths would not be forbidden by Christ in this text, for saith he
Christ did not forbid what the Law commanded; but though
this prohibition was given out <hi>before his death,</hi> yet with reference
<hi>to the Gospel times after his death:</hi> It is evident by the texts before
it and behind it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of divorce and of deportment towards
injurious ones and enemies, so in this of oaths Christ prohibites
and condemnes not only those gross abuses of those things that
they had a dispensation for under the Law, and that by divine
indulgency, which abuses crept in by the Pharisaical false glosses,
too much loosing the meaning of Gods Law by <hi>Moses</hi> by their
depraved examples or popular customes; but Christ <hi>condemned
and prohibited those very things,</hi> which in regard of the hardness of
their hearts, distrust and wicked cruelties, <hi>God himself in that
very Letter of the Law indulged them in,</hi> and gave them both a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,</hi>
and a precept for, <hi>in the Law;</hi> for the Law said of <hi>old
time,</hi> before the false gloss of the Scribes and Pharisees came in
some things; so <hi>as it was not said from the beginning,</hi> when Man
was in innocency, and was mercyful as his Heavenly Father was
mercyful, and the Law said, <hi>Deut. 24. 12. whosoever shall put away
his wife let him give her a bill of divorcement, and then she may go
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94649:35"/>
and be another mans wife, but I say who so putting away
his wife causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall
marry her that is divorced committeth adultery, Mat.</hi> 5. 32. So that
not only the <hi>corrupt glosses</hi> and irregular <hi>practices</hi> of the misinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Jewes</hi> is forbidden; but even that which the <hi>Law not only
permitted and allowed, and dispensed with, but commanded, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi>
(and another thing injoyned) and in cause of injury as he
hath done, so shall it be done unto him: ye have heard it hath been
said <hi>an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, this was the Law,</hi> Exo.
21. 44. Levit. 24. 20. Dent. 19. 20. and this was commanded:
<hi>But Christ saith, I say unto you that ye resist not evil, whosoever shall
smite thee on the one cheek turn the other also, and if a man sue thee at
law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also, and whosoever
shall compell thee to go a mile go with him twain,</hi> Mat. 5. 39, 40, 41.
So here is not only a further thing, but even <hi>another thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
by Christ. Further, the Law said, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 14. thou
shalt not <hi>commit adultery;</hi> but Christ the wisdom of God saith,
<hi>Mat. 5. 28. whosoever looketh upon a Woman and lusteth after her
hath
committed adultery with her in his heart,</hi> again <hi>yee have heard that it
hath been said that thou love thy neighbour and hate thy enemy,</hi> though
<hi>A. S.</hi> say that is not found in the Law, but a corrupt gloss of the
Pharisees; I say that is found which <hi>amounts to</hi> as much, as hath
been shewed: for the <hi>Jewes</hi> that was of the Law, might and did
spoyle their enemies, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Canaanites, Egiptians</hi> and
<hi>Amalekites, and had a command so to doe, &amp; kill them, &amp; root them out,</hi>
and yet to help his enemies Oxe or Asse under a burthen, if he
were belonging to a <hi>Jew</hi> that <hi>personally</hi> hated him, and not an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekite</hi>
one of the <hi>cursed race;</hi> but this is a ridle to many; <hi>But I
say unto you love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to
them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
you, Mat.</hi> 5. 44. and the Apostle exhorted, give no offence
to <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> so that his Doctrine went <hi>beyond the Law, put
up, pass by, forgive, forbeat;</hi> again you have heard it hath been said
of old time (where) <hi>Exod. 20. 7. Deut. 5. 11. Numb.</hi> 30. 2.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 33. thou shalt not forswear thy self, but shalt perform un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord thine oathes, but I say unto you <hi>Swear not at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Heaven for it is Gods Throne, nor by the Earth for it is his
Foot-stoole, neither by</hi> Jerusalem <hi>for it is the City of the great King,
neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou cannot make one hair
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94649:36"/>
white or black, but let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay,
for whatsoever is more then these cometh of evil:</hi> Its most evident
that Christ prohibits <hi>somewhat more here</hi> then was forbiden under
the Law, yea what ever <hi>Oathes</hi> were lawful under the <hi>Law,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must be <hi>all swearing</hi> at all, or else <hi>none at all:</hi> either all
such swearing as was used lawfully, and allowed as a Type for a
time, in the Law, Oathes made <hi>lawfully and acceptably to God,</hi> or
else <hi>nothing more at all then what was forbiden in the Law:</hi> for all
<hi>false swearing and forswearing, and all swearing by Creatures, or
breaking of solemn Oathes,</hi> made as unto God, was forbiden in
and <hi>by the Law:</hi> therefore swearing it self is forbiden or nothing,
but saith <hi>A. S.</hi> the grand objection falls of it self, which is either
all kind of swearing is forbiden, or else Christ forbids nothing,
which was not forbiden before, <hi>which is utterly improbable saith he;</hi>
and he grants that God had formerly prohibited all false and vain
Oaths, and all swearing by Creatures saith he, which I grant to
be true, then how is the grand objection fallen, for is not <hi>Heaven,
Earth, Jerusalem, the head Creatures:</hi> and this is the most that <hi>A. S.</hi>
and divers others affirms, that it is only <hi>Oaths by Creatures,</hi> such
as before mentioned that Christ <hi>only prohibits,</hi> and vain Oaths,
and swearing by Creatures: <hi>A. S.</hi> sayes Christ reckons among sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Oaths; then if so, as <hi>they are indeed,</hi> had not the <hi>Law</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
this before; in general tearms wherein <hi>all Creatures are included?</hi>
therefore the reason stands still in force, and the objection; that
either Christ <hi>forbad all swearing,</hi> or else he forbids <hi>nothing but what
the Law had forbiden before:</hi> Its manifest it stands still in force, for
Christ forbad even those <hi>Oathes</hi> the <hi>Law required,</hi> and all vain
swearing and swearing by Creatures, and all swearing <hi>whatsoever,
Mat. 5. Ye have heard it hath been said by them of old time,</hi> not of
<hi>late</hi> by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> only puting their false glosses on
the Law, as <hi>A S</hi> intimates <hi>Pareus</hi> and others, in his Annotations,
and hence conjectures, that by them of <hi>old time</hi> is only meant, the
<hi>Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> and not <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> and of old time
must be meant (a good while ago) or not very long, as Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
understand it, less then (twenty years) and thus he twists
and twines to make the true sense of <hi>Christs words void:</hi> its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by them of old time, is <hi>Moses</hi> time, the place before cited,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 2. is the place <hi>Christ alludes to,</hi> you have heard it said
thou shalt not forswear thy selfe: so saith the Law in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94649:36"/>
places, but performe unto the Lord thine Oathes; <hi>But I
say unto you swear not at all;</hi> no not by <hi>any oath at all,</hi> note
the opposition in the particle [but] which is between the
<hi>old lawful legal swearing,</hi> and no swearing at all, not between
no swearing, and such <hi>prophane swearing,</hi> as was unlawfull
<hi>under the Law:</hi> the whole summe is this, the Law said
<hi>break no oaths,</hi> but I say <hi>take none;</hi> for if Christ intend no more in
these phrases (<hi>swear not at all</hi>) not by any oath then thus, <hi>swear not
vainly, prophanely, ordinary, or by Creatures</hi> in your <hi>communication,
forswear not your selves,</hi> what forbids he more then the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad?
for Heaven and Earth, Jerusalem <hi>A. S.</hi> says, Christ reckons
among sinful <hi>oaths;</hi> and these are Creatures, and swearing by
Creatures was forbidden by the <hi>Law,</hi> I grant quoth <hi>A. S.</hi> then
this reason stands still good, <hi>he either forbad all oaths,</hi> or he forbad
no more then the <hi>Law forbad;</hi> and though it be granted that the
<hi>Jewes</hi> swore by the Creatures, as the <hi>Temple, Altar, Jerusalem,</hi>
and therefore Christ prohibits them, and reproves them for these
things, and likewise all swearing whatsoever; what doth <hi>A. S.</hi>
gain by this? for it's evident in divers passages of his Sermon in
the <hi>5th. Chap.</hi> of <hi>Mat.</hi> that he teaches a righteousness which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
that of the <hi>Law,</hi> as I have shewed before, which he came to
fulfill and not to destroy, by taking away the <hi>ceremony of Swearing,</hi>
and establishing the substance in its stead, which is <hi>speaking the truth,</hi>
as in the sight of God in uprightness of heart, yea we say again
what saith he more to his Disciples else? then the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
to theirs? they said, <hi>swear not falsly, prophanely,</hi> but by <hi>God,
only swear not falsly:</hi> For Bishop <hi>Gauden</hi> cites for his Author
<hi>Drusius,</hi> among the <hi>Jewes</hi> all thing in <hi>Judicials</hi> were confirmed
by the Religion of an oath, wherein the <hi>name of God was interposed,</hi>
therefore Christ says more unto his Disciples in express terms,
swear no oath at all, otherwise how would their Righteousness
exceed that of the Scribes and Pharisees, which except it did, they
could in no case enter into the Kingdom of God; the <hi>perfection</hi>
and <hi>Righteousness of the Law</hi> therefore in this point of <hi>Swearing</hi>
was not forswearing: the <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
in the same <hi>is not swearing at all,</hi> so though the <hi>Gospel</hi> be not against
the Law, yet the <hi>Gospel</hi> exceeds the <hi>Law</hi> in every point; the
Law said kill not, the <hi>Gospel</hi> be not <hi>angry;</hi> the Law <hi>commit not
adultery,</hi> the Gospel, <hi>look not on a woman,</hi> lust not; so in all the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94649:37"/>
prohibitions of Christ; the Commandements of Christ went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Law, also in this of swearing: yet it did not if now
there be any swearing at all among Christians and Disciples of
Christ, yet we shall also with <hi>A. S.</hi> agree that Christ not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
all swearing (even that commanded by the Law, sometime
lawful) but he also forbids and reproves, and condemnes swearing
by Creatures, and vain swearing in all communication, and their
perverting of the Law, and too much loosing it by traditions, and
making it void by their false glosses, and counts them blind guides
which said to swear by the <hi>Temple,</hi> by the <hi>Altar,</hi> by <hi>Heaven,</hi> was
nothing, he pronounced a woe against them, and concluded they
were bound to keep those oaths, though they ought not to have
sworn them: for as much as he that swears by the lesser swears also
by the greater; as he that swears by Heaven swears by the throne
of God, and him that sits thereon; <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22. We confess with <hi>A. S.</hi> this was but a <hi>sinful prophane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
swearing, an irregular forme of swearing;</hi> by the name of God
the <hi>Jewes</hi> indulged themselves in: but what doth <hi>A. S.</hi> gain by
this? it's evident enough that solemn oaths <hi>by God himself,</hi> as those
familiar oaths by Creatures, in which they tacitely sware <hi>by God
are forbidden</hi> by Christ, <hi>but I say unto you sware not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>A. S.</hi> tells us as <hi>Grotius</hi> tells him out of <hi>Philo Judeos,</hi> that
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> taught them to performe what ever they had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
swearing by God, they under a spacious pretence that they
would not take God's name in vain upon <hi>sleight occasions</hi> fell to
<hi>swear by Creatures,</hi> which the Pharisees did not disallow to cheat
people withal, which they themselves neither thought obligatory,
nor meant to keep: The name <hi>Elohim</hi> and <hi>Jehovah</hi> they might
possibly scruple at, but that name <hi>Adonai</hi> they oft, as superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
repeat in their much babling as they superstitiously decline
mentioning of the other, but that in serious cases of concerne of
<hi>justice</hi> and <hi>equity,</hi> and in <hi>judicature</hi> in matter of debate, or <hi>ending
of controversies,</hi> that they should wave and forbear swearing by the
<hi>name of God,</hi> when their Scriptures was so express for it, and that
they should <hi>chuse</hi> that way of swearing, there is no reason at all
to believe it, seeing <hi>Drusius</hi> says, <hi>among the Jewes all things in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature
were confirmed by oath, wherein the name of God was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi>
as above mentioned. 2ly. That they should wave swearing
by the name of God in matters of concernment, which they all
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94649:37"/>
believed were binding, and should swear by Creatures in order to
the giving <hi>satisfaction</hi> to one another, and <hi>security</hi> of each other,
and by such oaths as they judged not to be <hi>obligatory,</hi> and never
meant to keep them, seeing <hi>A. S.</hi> says it was in pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to God, they swear not by God but by Creatures, to
cheat and never <hi>meant to keep,</hi> they knowing this that he <hi>that
so</hi> sware by Creatures <hi>meant not to keep but to cheat and not performe;</hi>
such oaths were not very probably used in Judicature among
them, neither in serious <hi>cases,</hi> for such <hi>oaths</hi> instead of giving
satisfaction and putting an end unto jealousies and distrusts would
have sure created them more then before; for as much as he that
so swears believes himself not to be bound thereby, then if he
had not sworn at all, and he unto whom he swears also knows the
same that such oaths (as <hi>A. S.</hi> tells on that they did swear) is not
binding, neither can any more credit be given to them then to a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,
because in this sort of swearing there was <hi>no security;</hi> it is not
probable I say, that they should chuse this in Judicature or any seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
case of Controversie: And if it be that Swearing that Christ
only prohibits by Heaven, Earth, and Creatures, which the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
indulged them in, wherein (as to the point of swearing)
<hi>does he prescribe a Righteousness and perfection above or beyond Moses</hi>
his servant whom he was to exceed; for God by <hi>Moses</hi> in the
<hi>Law</hi> it self had universally forbidden all other oaths, either in
<hi>general terms,</hi> or sometime <hi>more particularly;</hi> but still all <hi>false oaths,
vain oaths,</hi> and <hi>oaths</hi> by <hi>Creatures</hi> are <hi>included,</hi> save only <hi>solemn
swearing</hi> by his own Name that there was no more swearing left
for Christ to forbid his Disciples, but <hi>swearing</hi> by <hi>God</hi> himself,
which the Law allowed of.</p>
            <p>Besides moreover, the opposition then which lies intimated in
that particle [But] being not between <hi>false swearing</hi> and <hi>prophane
swearing,</hi> and swearing by Creatures as <hi>A. S.</hi> would have it, but
between <hi>forswearing then,</hi> and no <hi>swearing now,</hi> shew <hi>Christs intent
to</hi> be to prohibit all swearing; for it is indeed as if he had thus said,
God under the Law commanded you to <hi>swear by his Name,</hi> &amp; when
you had <hi>sworn in truth by him</hi> to perform the <hi>oaths</hi> ye made <hi>by him,</hi>
whether to him or <hi>any other;</hi> but I say <hi>now</hi> God <hi>allowes you not to
swear at all,</hi> nor by heaven, earth, or <hi>any other,</hi> no not those <hi>oaths</hi>
which ye did, and might make of old unto the <hi>Lord your God</hi> in
things <hi>lawful;</hi> but no <hi>oath</hi> by a Creature did God account as an
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94649:38"/>
               <hi>oath</hi> made to him, provided ye performed it when ye had done
any more then he counted their, solemn Fastings to be to him,
<hi>Zachariah</hi> 7. 5.</p>
            <p>Again, Christ's own expressions in the affirmative part shewes
his meaning in the <hi>negative</hi> to be a prohibition of all swearing as
well as any, <hi>but let your Communication be yea, yea, nay, nay,</hi> so
the Negative of his words <hi>swear not at all,</hi> must be understood in
such an <hi>universal</hi> exclusive <hi>latitude as admits of no oaths</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
among his Disciples; and as hath been said that particle
[But] which stands between those two prohibitions of <hi>Moses</hi>
saying, <hi>forswear not but performe to God thine oaths;</hi> and of Christ
saying [But] <hi>I say unto you swear not at all,</hi> doth manifest it that
Christ forbids all <hi>swearing as much as any;</hi> even such swearing as
was not indulged to them by the <hi>Pharisees</hi> only but by <hi>Moses</hi> and
God himself, who by his servant dispensed with them in, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
even their <hi>swearing by God's own name,</hi> who never indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
or dispensed with any of that Creature swearing as <hi>A. S.</hi> speaks
of, but threatned woes to it under the Law; and by the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if it be said Christ only prohibited all such <hi>voluntary oaths,</hi>
which they sware to performe to <hi>the Lord</hi> by any Creature as
<hi>heaven, earth,</hi> in their Communication and mutual converse,
as <hi>A. S.</hi> says, but not solemn oaths <hi>by God</hi> in Courts or before
Magistrates, and not between man and man, and matter of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
as some other say, and have interpreted the words, <hi>let
not your whole Conversation be interwoven with oaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Christ does indeed forbid all such <hi>voluntary oaths</hi> as was
used by the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and all swearing by any thing
besides God or below God, also all swearing in common Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
and ordinary Conversation where <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay</hi> should
serve, yea and that which is called <hi>solemn</hi> and by some sacred and
lawful <hi>even by God,</hi> even all swearing, by God <hi>commonly, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
or <hi>generally,</hi> which is now in Courts and imposed by Justices,
Magistrates, than which, nothing almost is more ordinary frequent
and common; if our communication and conversation should be
without swearing, and our mutual converse one with another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Men should be without oaths of any kind whatsoever; is
not this exclusive of swearing in Courts and before Magistrates as
well as other men, whether in Courts and Consistories as well as
other places, where Men have their conversation and their mutual
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94649:38"/>
converse with each other, as ordinarily &amp; commonly as elsewhere,
which being considered I have with other often mused why some
Men have been so inconsiderate as to interpret <hi>Christs</hi> words and
<hi>prohibition</hi> as exelusive, of Mens swearing in their ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
in Courts, where oaths are as ordinary, frequent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
as in any places whatsoever, especially that some men
plead so much for oaths in <hi>Courts</hi> and before <hi>Magistrates</hi> only; (as
though they were <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>solemn</hi> there and no <hi>where else,</hi> and
<hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>lawful only there</hi>) and yet can bring no better proof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Gospel</hi> for them, nor of their right to impose them upon
Christians more then others? among the many false instances they
bring of <hi>Paul, swearing frequently</hi> to the <hi>Churches</hi> in his Letters;
and such pittiful proof as <hi>A. S.</hi> offers of Christ being charged by
the High Priest as he says to swear, though he swore, for I deny
that; (<hi>I adjure thee,</hi>) proves not that Christ swore, it being not his
but anothers charge upon him; and it's silly to think that Christ
who said, swear not at all, no not by heaven, for it's God's <hi>throne,</hi>
which who so swears by, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. swears <hi>by God that sits thereon;</hi>
that he should swear by the <hi>Living God,</hi> he was the Christ, at the
command or charge of the <hi>High Priest,</hi> who was his inferiour,
(though he had been a better Priest then he was) as being but the
<hi>type</hi> of himself; but indeed there was no such matter as <hi>A. S.</hi> and
others have affirmed, for when the high Priest barely asked him
only whether he was the <hi>Christ</hi> or not? he answered I am: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Law was not in the shadow of it fully ended, although
Christ had instituted divers things among his Disciples which was
not in the Law, and yet not against it, but all these instances that
many opposers with <hi>A. S.</hi> hath brought of the Apostles and Christ
swearing, are but shrouds and shelters they make for themselves,
because they have a mind to obey the commands of Men rather
then <hi>Christs Doctrine,</hi> for avoiding of persecution and suffering,
and therefore would make all things they take in hand look like
their own Image: But having discoursed of this before I come to
<hi>A. S.</hi> his last part of his Discourse, and his interpretation upon
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and <hi>James</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>In his 41. Section he says, If any still urges the universality of
the expression, (<hi>swear not at all,</hi>) and that of <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 12 (above all
things my brethren, swear not neither by heaven, nor by earth,
neither any other oath) to the first he says, its plain that they that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94649:39"/>
thus argue break off our Saviours sentence in the midle, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
him not to come to his period, for he saith not, <hi>swear not at all,</hi>
there fixing a point, but <hi>swear not at all, neither by heaven, nor by
earth, &amp;c.</hi> and for that of <hi>James</hi> must of necessity be understood,
with restriction; quotes <hi>Austin</hi> upon the Text, it cannot be that
swearing is <hi>worse</hi> then <hi>forswearing,</hi> theft, adultery, murther, these
are hainous crimes, <hi>nulla autem culpa est verum jurare;</hi> but if no
sin to swear the truth, why then above all things swear not; not
that swearing is so great an offence as many others, but least we
contract a habit thereof, then probably by rash oaths we shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
God by false swearing, which is no more then <hi>in an especial
manner, forbear forswearing,</hi> and any other oath must be restrained
in a <hi>limited</hi> sense, for there is not meant any oaths what ever, but
such as the Apostle speaks of, neither by <hi>heaven,</hi> by <hi>earth,</hi> nor any
other oath, that is any oath taken by other <hi>creatures,</hi> for so must
they be understood, unless we interpret his words to make
them contradict Gods, and set the <hi>servant</hi> in a manifest op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positon
to his Master.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> We who are of a contrary judgment to <hi>A. S.</hi> do still urge
the universality of the Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 33, 34, &amp;c. and we shall not
break off the sentence of Christ in the midle; swear not at all &amp;c.
but shall render it as it is, neither was it ever intended otherwise,
but for brevities sake, because the innumeration of <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth, &amp;c.</hi> are only <hi>inclusive</hi> in the prohibition, and we shall speak
on, and what Christ hath joyned we shall not separate: but read
the words as they are, <hi>Yee have heard it hath been said of old time,
thou shalt not forswear thy self, but shalt performe unto the Lord thine
Oaths, but I say unto you swear not at all, neither by Heaven, for it
is Gods Throne; neither by the Earth, it's his Foot-stoole; neither by
Jerusalem, for it's the City of the great King; neither shalt thou
swear by thy head, because thou cannot make one hair white or black:
But let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay, whatsoever is more
then those cometh of evil; James 5. &amp; 12. But above all things my
Bretheren, swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by Earth, neither by
any other Oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, least you
fall into condemnation:</hi> In which two Texts we say (in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative)
all manner of swearing is forbiden, for the truth of which
many reasons have been and may be given.</p>
            <p>First, Because all manner of swearing is here expresly instanced
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94649:39"/>
in these two <hi>disjunctive clauses,</hi> which are expresly <hi>conclusive,</hi> and
consequently (<hi>because spoken by way of prohibiton) exclusive, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive</hi>
of all swearing, that can be thought on, swear not, swear
not at all, sayes the Texts, yea that none may imagine, as <hi>A. S.</hi>
would make Men do, that this general <hi>Rule admits</hi> of any <hi>exception:</hi>
but all know the prohibition is so strickt, as to allow, of no <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
in the point to swear, by any thing but <hi>God,</hi> he addes <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Heaven, neither by Earth, neither by Jerusalem, neither by thy head;</hi>
and these are only more ample expressions, of that <hi>prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and are not exclusive or disjunctive, from the <hi>prohibition,</hi>
but <hi>conclusive</hi> of the <hi>prohibition</hi> of all swearing whatever.</p>
            <p>But least any should think he forbids only, and no more then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
<hi>Oaths</hi> of such as <hi>swear</hi> by <hi>Creatures,</hi> as <hi>Earth, Jerusalem</hi>
the <hi>head,</hi> and such like, when as whosoever swore lawfully under
the Law, was to swear by none but <hi>God himself.</hi> but that there be
no root at all for any reasoning, for swearing against the flat prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of it: <hi>James</hi> 5. he concludes and shuts up all in these <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
tearmes,</hi> and excludes all Oaths, and all possible pretence of
plea, at all; also for any swearing, adding neither by <hi>any other oath,</hi>
what words more plain words can be uttered, or can be <hi>more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
exclusive,</hi> both of all kinds or sorts of swearing, and of all
<hi>sorts</hi> of <hi>particular Oaths</hi> of <hi>every kind,</hi> and by Heaven, and by Earth,
and Jerusalem, are so far from signifying, that those <hi>Oaths</hi> by <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
are only the <hi>Oaths</hi> that <hi>Christ prohibits,</hi> that they are but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>innumerations</hi> and <hi>amplifications;</hi> of the <hi>former part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
swear not at all:</hi> which we grant were spoken to reprove
the Pharisees, and the Jews practise about their vain swearing.</p>
            <p>And why must those words (of <hi>James</hi> 5.) needs be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
with restriction, (above all things, swear not neither by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
neither by Earth, &amp;c.) why St. <hi>Austin</hi> scruples at the first
words, <hi>Quare ante omnia Jurare est quam furari, &amp;c. quàm
adulterare, &amp;c. quàm hominem accidere,</hi> it cannot be that <hi>swearing</hi>
is worse, and <hi>forswearing,</hi> then <hi>adultery, theft, murther,</hi> we do not
say it is, but if it be not; or that be not, the reason why he says,
<hi>above all things swear not,</hi> because swearing is a sin above all sins,
can no other reason then that be rendered? yes, yet we shall
agree with <hi>Austin,</hi> and <hi>A. S.</hi> too; if their judgment be one thus
far, that it was not sin to swear the truth when called unto it
<hi>under the Law:</hi> why then above all things swear not, not that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94649:40"/>
swearing is so great an offence as <hi>Murther</hi> or <hi>Adultery,</hi> but least
we contract a habit thereof; and then possibly by rash Oaths we
should offend God, which is no more saith he, then in especial
manner forbearswearing, and <hi>any other Oath,</hi> saith <hi>A. S.</hi> must be
restrained in a limited sense, for there is not meant <hi>any Oath what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi>
but such as the Apostle speaks of, by <hi>Heaven,</hi> by <hi>Earth, &amp;c.</hi>
though there be some truth in what is said; yet its too short to
answer the Apostles end and scope, and the reason falls short that
is rendered; but the man reason is, (they were <hi>Jewes</hi> unto whom
he wrote, the twelve Tribes <hi>scattered</hi>) whom we deny not, but
were run into that custome of vain swearing by Creatures, as
Heaven, Earth, Jerusalem, head and Temple, &amp;c. but that is not
all, though we grant it is some reason; but they being Jews, who
might under the <hi>Law swear serious or solemn Oaths,</hi> and were not
so fully informed of the <hi>end of the Law in Christ:</hi> under which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them some <hi>Oaths</hi> were lawful; they were apt to think, they
did as well in <hi>swearing,</hi> so now as they did before; so though
<hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Murther</hi> may be as <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>worse</hi> then <hi>Swearing;</hi> yet
the Law being so expresly against them, which yet in <hi>its time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
some kind of swearing</hi> in some <hi>Cases</hi> (it was more hard to
bring them of from some <hi>Ceremonious services of the Law</hi> that were
<hi>once lawful,</hi> as is evident long after Christs ascention, the Apostles
had much to do with them about the Rites of the Law, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
<hi>and times; and dayes, and new Moones, &amp;c.</hi> then from
such sins as were known and hated by them, and held accursed, by
the very <hi>letter of the Law;</hi> and therefore he says) above all things
my bretheren swear not; that they might not only take hold of
all vain swearing, and swearing by Creatures, that was ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful;
but if that they might know <hi>that now</hi> to be unlawful
which in former times was accounted lawful for them: And so its
ordinary to say to Men, <hi>above all things</hi> take heed of that to which
they have been long accustomed, and with which (through heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
of the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of the thing,) they are apt most easily
to be overtaken.</p>
            <p>Again, It is by <hi>Solomon,</hi> who spoke by the eternal wisedome of
God, and in it to fear an <hi>Oath</hi> is made the character of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man that sacrificeth acceptably to God (to swear at all) is
more the character of a <hi>wicked and uncleave sinner, Eccles. 9. 1. 2.</hi>
for how he it Men shall once return, and discern, the <hi>happiness</hi> of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94649:40"/>
him that serves God, from his woe who serves him not, yet he is
<hi>one event to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and to the clean,
and to the unclean to him that sacrificeth and him that sacrificeth not, as
is the good so is the sinner, as he that sweareth so be that fears an oath,</hi>
and so as above all things <hi>swear not,</hi> is to be taken not only of
those <hi>oaths</hi> which were <hi>ever unlawful</hi> by <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> but
even of those that sometime were lawful <hi>under the Law,</hi> in the
type which now when the substance the <hi>oath of God</hi> is come, and
the <hi>Covenant of Light</hi> given to all Nations, <hi>Isa. 5. 5. Luk.</hi> 1. 72, 73.
who ends all, not only vain oaths, but all oaths, and is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of all, even to the subsequent, neither <hi>by any other oath</hi> is
not only to be taken of such oaths neither by <hi>heaven, neither by
earth,</hi> which were ever unlawful; but even of those sometime
lawful, even all swearing and all oaths; and the <hi>servant</hi> is not in
opposition <hi>to his Master,</hi> but knew the mind of his <hi>master Christ,</hi> and
therefore taught like Doctrine and the same: but what ever <hi>Christ</hi>
or <hi>James</hi> had said <hi>A. S.</hi> would make them, if he could to mean as
he means, to set their plain express words against their mind: But
so much hath been said by many others who fear the Lord and an
oath too, and so many demonstrative and weighty things have
been offered to the Consciences and publick view of all, which
<hi>A. S.</hi> I perceive hath seen some of them, though he come not so
much as near as to answer them, but only asserts his own, being
a work it seems he was put upon by others to plead for swearing;
so that something he must say on that behalf, and draw that way,
and to make all things look towards that end, and to concur to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
(to justifie them) and the lawfulness of oaths under the
Gospel, and their work who persecutes the servants of Christ for
abiding in his Doctrine, who speaks the truth and dare <hi>not lie</hi> nor
<hi>swear at all;</hi> I say I shall be the more brief because I know many
things is extant by others, and of weight which hath not yet been
answered, nor is by <hi>A. S.</hi> though here and there a little in his
Annotations he carps sometime upon small ground, although he
hath asserted nothing but that which hath been answered over and
over again: But I draw on to his last refuge and plea, his answer
to both the Texts <hi>Conjunction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That these Propositions; says <hi>A. S.</hi> (how universally soever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest)
ought not in equity to be extended beyond the intention of
the Apostles, but be limited according to the subject matter,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94649:41"/>
               <hi>swear not at all</hi> (says Christ) <hi>neither by heaven, nor by earth, &amp;c. that
is, I universally forbid you all those oaths which you were wont to use
frequently to wicked purposes;</hi> and further he says all vain and false
oaths by God, even by the acknowledgement of the Pharisees
were sufficiently forbidden before, so there was no need either for
<hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>James</hi> to speak of them again, other places of Scripture
must of necessity be thus interpreted, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 23. Matthew</hi> 15.
<hi>Luke 2. 1. Mat. 12. Luke 8. 47.</hi> how universally soever exposed
must be restrained according to the mind of the speaker, and so
must these words <hi>swear not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> It's freely granted that these two Texts ought not to
be extended beyond the intention of the speakers, but be limited
according to the subject matter, as for <hi>general terms and universal
prohibitions,</hi> admitting of <hi>exception</hi> they do so, we grant now and
then they do, and <hi>of restrictions,</hi> but when they do these <hi>exceptions</hi>
and <hi>restrictions</hi> are usually in one place or other of the same <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
where they are made, or at least most manifestly amplified by
him that gave out these general prohibitions, &amp; so are most of these
generals and restrictions that <hi>A. S.</hi> hath instanced, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 23.</hi> all
<hi>things are lawful for me,</hi> to eat that which was sold at the shambles
was <hi>lawful,</hi> but that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was <hi>sacrificed to Idols, v. 12.</hi> there he mentions
the <hi>restriction</hi> himself, and so <hi>Luke 1. 3. It seemed good to me also,
having perfect understanding of all things from the very first,</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
matter whereof he writes &amp; the things are exprest, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
in the 2. Chapter, and in <hi>Mat. 12. 31. All manner of
sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto Men, but the blasphemy against
the holy Ghost shall not be forgiven,</hi> there in the same Verse Christ
makes the <hi>exception</hi> and <hi>restriction,</hi> and <hi>Exodus 20. 10.</hi> Thou shalt
do no manner of work, its abundantly expressed else where in the
Law; where the Priests service on every Sabbath are appointed
them, and the <hi>exception</hi> of dressing what every one was to eat, and
was expressed, and the <hi>exception</hi> of doing good, and of works of
mercy, in saving the life of Man or beast was to take place ever
against the <hi>Typical Sabbath (I will have mercy and not sacrifice)</hi> and
that of <hi>Luke 8. 47.</hi> and the Woman that was healed by touching
the border of Christs garment, <hi>she declared unto him before all the
people;</hi> what saith <hi>A. S.</hi> before all the people of the World, or
before all the people of the <hi>Land?</hi> no there is none so ignorant as
to understand it, for <hi>Mark. 5. 21.</hi> manifest the exception before
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94649:41"/>
all the people, only that were with him nigh <hi>unto the Sea;</hi> when he
returned from the Country of the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> or before all the
people of his own City that came out to meet him, <hi>Mat. 9. 3. Mat. 8.
34.</hi> many more I might add to what <hi>A. S.</hi> hath instanced, that Christ
uttered many truths in general terms which must admit of excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Luk. 13. 10. all the sinners</hi> Christ spoke to about him, in the
<hi>general terms,</hi> ye shall <hi>perish,</hi> but this was not without exception of
such as should <hi>repent;</hi> but that exception was not without expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>viz.</hi> except ye repent, again he said unto his hearers, <hi>ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter the Kingdom of God;</hi> that was not without exceptions,
nor these <hi>exceptions</hi> without <hi>expressions,</hi> viz. <hi>except ye be converted;</hi>
yea in the verses immediately before, <hi>this universal prohibition
swear not at all, Mat. 5. 30, 31.</hi> Christ says <hi>'twas said of old, if any
put away his wife let him give her a bill of divorce; but I say whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall put away his wife causeth her to commit adultery:</hi> But this
admits of an exception, and that exception is thus exprest, <hi>viz.
saving for the cause of Fornication;</hi> but though all this be granted,
even these and many more universal terms admits of exceptions
and restriction, yet we cannot grant that these two texts admits
of any such exceptions of restrictions as <hi>A. S.</hi> would interpret
them. My reason is this, because in this <hi>general term and universal
prohibition,</hi> swear not at all, it cannot in equity be taken and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
in that sense which <hi>A. S.</hi> puts upon it, not with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction,
for that sense would make it short of the subject matter
where all <hi>swearing is forbidden</hi> as well as any, because swear not at
all by heaven, earth, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Because there is not only no <hi>expression</hi> made any where (after)
of any such <hi>exception</hi> or <hi>restriction,</hi> but a fuller <hi>amplification</hi> of it, by
such particulars as is enumerated, and are more particularly <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of all kinds of oaths,</hi> and of all oaths of any kind, not only of
those that they used to wicked purposes, but even those they so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
used sometime to good purposes before the seed Christ was
revealed, and the Apostle <hi>James 5. 12. neither by heaven, neither
by earth, neither by any other oath;</hi> which is a re-inforcement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
of the said universal prohibition; whereas if Christ had
intended <hi>any exception</hi> here, he might as easily have exprest, and
would as assuredly as he did <hi>imediatly</hi> above, in the cause of <hi>divorce,</hi>
by (<hi>except in the cause of fornication,</hi>) and have so said, <hi>swear not at
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94649:42"/>
all, except it be solemn and sacred Oathes,</hi> and by the Lord to good
purposes in <hi>Courts</hi> where ye are call'd to swear before a <hi>Magistrate;</hi>
so <hi>James</hi> if he had intended as <hi>A. S.</hi> will needs in force yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ground, a limitation and restriction, <hi>above all things my
brethren swear not, neither by heaven, neither by earth, neither by any
other oath,</hi> except ye swear solemnly <hi>by God</hi> to good purposes, in
<hi>Courts,</hi> or before <hi>Magistrates;</hi> but as I said instead of excepting
any <hi>exception,</hi> he adds that which more strangthens and clears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all <hi>exception,</hi> the <hi>universality</hi> of his <hi>prohibition;</hi> and if all
vain oaths by God were forbidden before, and all swearing by
Creatures, so that there was no need either for <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>James</hi>
to speak of them again, as <hi>A. S.</hi> says; then this is still matter for
the argument on our part, that some oaths were <hi>prohibited</hi> by
<hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>James</hi> which were not prohibited before, and of which
there was necessity for them to speak, as there was indeed, not
only about those <hi>Oaths</hi> and other things which the Law before
had prohibited, but even of those things that it had allowed and
indulged, because of the hardness of their hearts, so we say there
was a necessity of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>James</hi> not only to mention those
things again which the Law had spoken of before, and disallowed
which we have instanced before, and is manifest in that <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.
which the Pharisees had perverted and loosened by their false glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and traditions; but even those things which were permitted,
indulged and commanded under the Law, and suffered to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the hardness of their hearts, and strifes, unbeliefes, inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities;
and therefore Christ teacheth and informeth his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as it was in the beginning before those things entered, and
in this cause about oaths amongst the rest prohibites <hi>all swearing</hi>
without <hi>limitation,</hi> not only that which was once forbidden, but
even that which was once <hi>permitted</hi> and commanded, and <hi>indulged;</hi>
and therefore it hath been said of <hi>old time</hi> thou shalt not forswear
thy self <hi>under the Law,</hi> (where in) <hi>Numb. 30. 2. Deut.</hi> 23. 21.
But I say unto you, swear not at all, neither by heaven, nor earth,
nor Jerusalem, no thy head, which is manifestly an <hi>exclusive</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of all oaths, without <hi>exception</hi> or <hi>restriction,</hi> or <hi>limitation,</hi>
and still will stand good (not withstanding all <hi>A. S.</hi> and others op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing)
among his Disciples and true Christians, in whose hearts he
hath put it to speak the truth, and confess in any cause wherein
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94649:42"/>
they are concerned to the glory of God the Father, and to keep
the commands of his Christ, and to glory him by abiding in his
Doctrine, <hi>swear not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then <hi>A. S.</hi> concludes here the grand Objection falls of it
self which is either all kinds of <hi>swearing</hi> is forbidden, or else
Christ notwithstanding his words, (<hi>but I say unto you</hi>) forbad no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which was forbidden before, which is utterly improbable,
and the reason is saith he, because God formerly had forbidden
all false and vain <hi>oaths,</hi> and all swearing by <hi>Creatures,</hi> all which I
grant to be true saith he; but the Pharisees had taught the people
otherwise by their wicked glosses, that made the Commandement
of small effect by their Tradition, and the practise of that Nation
was widely distant from the Commandement, both which were
necessarily to be reformed, which our Saviour did in these words,
<hi>But I say unto you swear not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Who ever denyed but that the Pharisees were blind
guides, and that they laboured to make void the Law, <hi>and made
the commands of God of small effect by their Traditions;</hi> or that the
practise of that Nation was not widely distant from the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
and that they sware by false Gods sometime, and vainly
by the <hi>true God,</hi> and <hi>took his Name in vain;</hi> and sware also by
<hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> like as many do now; all this we
grant, that they were out of the way both in <hi>oaths</hi> and other
things; also that Christ reproved in the fifth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and
elsewhere, which Christ reformed and reproved their Doctrine
and manners: I say again how is the grand Objection fallen by this
that either all kind of swearing is forbidden here by Christ, or
else Christ forbad nothing which was not forbidden before, which
is utterly improbable saith <hi>A. S.</hi> but it is more probable then any
thing that <hi>A. S.</hi> hath yet offered; for if only by <hi>Heaven, Earth,
Jerusalem, Head, Temple</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> by that which Christ forbad
that the Pharisees taught the people they might swear by; these
were forbidden before <hi>inclusive</hi> in false <hi>swearing</hi> or swearing by
Creatures though not expressed, or <hi>enumerated nominally,</hi> yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
among the sinful and vain oaths <hi>under the Law,</hi> and so were
forbidden before, and faith <hi>A. S.</hi> I grant that all vain oaths and
perjury, and all swearing by Creatures were formerly forbidden,
and if so as indeed they were, what more did he forbid then was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94649:43"/>
forbidden, if the words must only be understood of those sinful
and vain oaths by Creatures above mentioned, that the Pharisees
indulged the people in, and taught as <hi>A. S.</hi> would only limit his
prohibition and exception I shall leave to the Conscience of every
enlightened man to judge, and say that in these words it hath been
said of old time thou shalt not forswear, but pay thy vows unto
the Lord; but I say (who am come <hi>to restore man again</hi> into that
estate he fell from by transgression, and to redeem him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
out of strife and contention, and Idolatry, to have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with the Father) <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> neither by <hi>heaven</hi> nor <hi>earth,</hi>
nor any <hi>other oath,</hi> that as hath been said before here is a <hi>prohibition</hi>
of all vain oaths and false oaths, and perjury, and all oaths by
Creatures, and all the vain traditions of Scribes and Pharisees
about oaths, and somewhat more, even a prohibition of those
<hi>Oaths</hi> to his Disciples, which the <hi>Law allowed</hi> after sin had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for which cause the Law was added, and Oaths added, but
<hi>Christ ends</hi> it, (not by <hi>destroying it</hi>) but by fulfilling it, and hath
set up that which is more Evangelical, <hi>truth</hi> it self, in which there
is no shadow of change, and it is <hi>binding</hi> upon the <hi>souls</hi> of all true
<hi>Christians,</hi> and that by which they are <hi>bound</hi> one to another, and
every word, promise, or testimony that go out of their hearts and
mouths, they by it are bound to keep, least they fall into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<hi>but their yea is yea, and nay is nay;</hi> and whatsoever is more
then this cometh of evil, and therefore they do not, cannot, nor
dare not go beyond this or that which doth but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amount to as
much, and there needs no more among true Christians.</p>
            <p>Now as to them, who are in the contention and strife and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
and oathes, works of the flesh, as variance, discord, whom
the Law <hi>hath power over</hi> and is against, as long as they live in such
estate, its granted that the Law was added because of these trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
and is against such; and how far swearing can be binding
among evil, contentious, unconscionable Men, that make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of any thing, who cannot believe one another, nor give
credit to one another without swearing, experience hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
whether they judge one another to be believed better by
swearing then without swearing, thats little to us, neither shall
we meddle in contentious matters, nor have to do with striving
Men, as little as possible: but rather suffer wrong, then wrong
our consciences by swearing, which we are perswaded by Christ
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94649:43"/>
we ought not to right our selves, as hitherto we have done and
have peace, blessed be God in our hearts, however, we could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
and be glad to see all Men be at peace, and agree, and its our
desire to live in that love, and we shall seek it with Men, and to
be at peace as much as in us lyes, even in that love that works no
evil, nor <hi>thinks no evil, but believeth all things, and beareth all things,</hi>
and so carries beyond strife and oaths, but if they will not be
without Oathes in <hi>Courts</hi> and Judicatures, we are cleer in the
matter, if they exact upon us, and do as they have done, to the
undoing, &amp; ruining of many in this World, we must be content,
knowing it better to suffer wrong, then do it, and shall acquiesce
and rest in the will of God, till he plead our cause, and open the
hearts of Men to see through the Clouds of error and ignorance
that is over their consciences.</p>
            <p>Yet how ever this I must needs say, this frequent, common,
prophane swearing, that hath exalted its Horn, more of late
years, is one of the crying sins of <hi>England,</hi> that Gods anger is
against, and will draw down his judgment, and kindle the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which hangs over this Nation, not only, because of those
that command Men to swear, contrary to Christs command: (and
that for to establish cruelty and injustice) but also that swore
falsly and vainly, and that against their knowledge, for their own
profit, and the disadvantages of others; to accomplish their
wicked, malicious and revengeful designes, against the innocent,
who dare not swear at all, and thereby are made a pray to the
teeth of Wolves, and to the wills of corrupt Men, who take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
(as it were) <hi>to plow long Furrowes upon the backs of the poor
and needy, for which things sake the wrath of God will be poured out
upon the head of the wicked, and the Nation shall be on heaps, and
the wise Men shall be turned backwards, and their Table shall be a
snare, and the curse shall be upon the rebellious, and they shall fall
and be broken, and rise no more:</hi> and this may justly befall this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because of Oaths, and because of Oppression.</p>
            <p>And oh much pittied Nation, it may be said of thee truly as
the Prophet <hi>Hosea 4. 2, 3. (Because of swearing, and lying, and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and stealing, and whoring, they break out, and blood toucheth
blood, therefore shall the Land mourn, and every one that dwells
therein shall be cut off</hi>) Oh what sad times do we behold, nothing
but extreames of evil are presented to our eyes and eares, some
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94649:44"/>
do little but swear <hi>ordinarily, commonly and vainly,</hi> in all kind of
communication and conversation, not only in their <hi>usual outer
sourses in Courts,</hi> with <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> but in their ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

discourses also with other Men, in <hi>Cities, Townes, Princes,</hi> and
<hi>great Mens Courts, and places, Vniversities, Colledges,</hi> almost all
<hi>Houses,</hi> at least all <hi>Talvernes</hi> and <hi>Ale-houses,</hi> and in the open <hi>Streets</hi>
and <hi>Assemblies,</hi> almost every where, are full of dreadful Oathes,
and Mens discourses interwoven with execrable and direful Oaths,
even as it were daring God to <hi>confound them</hi> and <hi>damn them,</hi> and
such like, and though there be divers Laws against swearing vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and forswearing, yet these are not looked at, but how should
we exspect that they should look at the execution of the Laws of
Men which are good, who heeds not the Law of God; and are
so buzzed now a days, with over-executing those intangling Laws
that are extant for <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>forswearing,</hi> to <hi>intrap</hi> and <hi>insnare</hi>
poor innocent men, who dare not <hi>swear at all,</hi> but keep the
<hi>Commands</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> so that there is no leisure lost to look after
those most <hi>wholsome</hi> and <hi>profitable Laws</hi> of both God and the King,
which are against <hi>vain Oaths,</hi> and <hi>forswearing,</hi> which the Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with, the like hath not been in any age, which is a sad
presage of the Judgment of God to be at hand.</p>
            <p>And last of all, <hi>A. S.</hi> he says hath done, and he fears it's more
and time to have done with the Exposition of those words, and
so comes to application, and so he speaks to all in general; who at
that time or any other may be legally called to take their oaths,
which you have heard vindicated to be lawfull, notwithstanding
the seeming opposition of these words, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> but those
must be understood of necessary Oaths, and your Righteousness
is to exceed the Scribes and Pharisees, but they condemned <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi>
in the verse immediately before mytext, and your warrant for
swearing is in <hi>Jer. 4. 2.</hi> which thence appears not only <hi>lawful</hi> but
in some cases <hi>necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> It's more then time indeed to have done, to pervert
Christ's plain Doctrine with his imaginary Exposition, and what he
counts (legally called) seeing Christ prohibited it is not of much
force, neither will <hi>A. S.</hi> Vindication stand against the real oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Christs words, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> but his seeming Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(will in the day of the Lord when the secrets of all hearts shall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94649:44"/>
be manifest by Jesus Christ, when the book of Conscience shall be
opened) will be found to be in real opposition unto Christ, and
his reward will be according to his workes, who hath by his work
strengthen'd the hand of evil doers and persecutors, to the adding
affliction to affliction upon the Righteous; and if the words must
be understood of necessary Oaths, then there is none necessary
among <hi>Christs</hi> true Disciples, who commanded, let your yea be
yea, or your nay, nay, for whatsoever is more comes of evil, and
whether the Scribes and Pharisees condemned a perjury or not,
we are sure the Law did, which Christs words hath reference to,
<hi>It hath been said of old time thou shalt not forswear thy self;</hi> and if
the Righteousness of Christs Disciples be to exceed the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and they <hi>condemned perjury,</hi>
and all <hi>false swearing by God,</hi> and the <hi>Law condemned all false oaths,
and vain oaths,</hi> and Oathes by <hi>Creatures,</hi> as <hi>A. S.</hi> hath granted;
then the Righteousness of the Disciples is to be another, then the
Righteousness (of the <hi>Law</hi>) which condemned all perjury and
vain Oaths; then what is it, but not to <hi>swear at all any Oath?</hi> but
speak the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>confess it to the glory of God</hi> in <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay;</hi>
and this is that which exceeds the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and is only
<hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> under the Gospel; and as for <hi>Jer. 4. 2.</hi> this is
pittiful proofe and warrant for Christians to swear under the
Gospel, for that was only spoken to <hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Juda,</hi> who were
under the first Covenant, and yet were revolted from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
thereof, and were <hi>back-sliders,</hi> as is to be seen, <hi>Jer. 3. 22.</hi>
and hath not reference to the second Covenant: But I shall come
towards an end as well as <hi>A. S.</hi> and conclude and refer all (<hi>what
both he and I hath said</hi>) to the judgment of the Lord, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Gods holy Spirit in all Mens Consciences, to be received
or denyed by that as he and his witness bears evidence, so shall the
matter stand eternally.</p>
            <p>Yet I cannot but mind the Reader, though <hi>A. S.</hi> hath had, as
appeares, certain Books of the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> in which are weighty
things, about this particular of swearing; which he hath not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
at all, as to their Arguments, only carped here and there
at a word, which is not of great moment; but though he may
plead some reason, that it was not possible, to answer all things
in so short a Discourse, as a Sermon, wherein he was limited as to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94649:45"/>
time, yet since he had, I perceive, by his Annotations, time
enough to have answered them, having their Books extant by him,
but hath not, in the most weighty Considerations, therefore I
refer the Reader to them, for his further satisfaction, <hi>viz.</hi> to the
Answer of Bishop <hi>Gauden,</hi> by that faithful Servant of God,
<hi>Sam, Fisher,</hi> where this point is largely discussed, likewise his
<hi>Antedote</hi> against Swearing, in Answer to <hi>Henry Den,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah
Ives,</hi> likewise a Book published by <hi>Isaac Pennington,</hi> Titled, <hi>The
great Question concerning the Lawfulness or unlawfulness of Swearing
under the Gospel stated, and considered of;</hi> wherein are weighty
things declared in short; 1st. what an Oath is; 2d. the ground
and occasion of an Oath; 3d. the causes wherein an Oath was to
be used; 4ly. the end of an Oath; 5ly the suitableness of its
nature to the end aimed at by it; 6ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the persons to whom the
use of an Oath was proper and lawful.</p>
            <p>Wherein also is clearly showen the state of man kind from the
Creation, comprised in four heads or particulars: (First, <hi>The
State of Innocency</hi>) (<hi>when there was no Oath</hi>) Secondly, <hi>An estate
of Captivity,</hi> wherein an Oath was proper and lawful: Thirdly,
<hi>The estate of shadowy Redemption,</hi> wherein it was lawful also:
Fourthly, <hi>An estate of true and perfect Redemption,</hi> wherein, its
neither needful nor lawful, seeing its prohibited by Christ, all
which <hi>A. S.</hi> hath passed over, and hath not answered.</p>
            <p>Likewise a Book published by <hi>John Crook,</hi> Titled, <hi>The Case of
Swearing</hi> (at all) <hi>discussed with;</hi> and several objections answered:
These things <hi>A. S.</hi> hath not answered, I only instance them, for
the Readers further satisfaction, if unsatisfied in what hath been
said already; all which great and weighty things, are worthy of
the serious consideration of all.</p>
            <p>Likewise a Book, Titled, (<hi>Swearing denyed in the new Covenant</hi>)
by <hi>Morgan Watkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When all that hath been said, is duly considered and weighed in
the Righteous ballance of Gods holy Spirit, they will not think it
strange that some denies to <hi>swear at all,</hi> but rather wonder that
such a vaile of darkness should be so long over the minds and
hearts of them that believe not, notwithstanding so clear evidence
from Christ and his Apostles, or the example of the Primitive
Christians or holy Martyrs, who spoke the truth, but denyed to
<hi>swear at all;</hi> but that custome and tradition is often more minded
then the very truth it self.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:94649:45"/>
            <p>Oh that the Rulers of this Nation would once consider and
weigh what they are doing, and how many and great the suffering
of a conscientious people that fears the Lord in their hearts are,
who dare not disobey the commands of Christ, least they fall into
condemnation, and come under the rebuke of the Lord in their
hearts, who hath power alone to kill and to make alive, but rather
chuseth to suffer the loss of all, and undergo the manifold suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that some <hi>malicious Spirits</hi> causeth to be inflicted upon them;
when indeed there is no <hi>cause at all;</hi> while prophane persons
swears, and forswears, and takes Gods holy Name in vain, and
makes little conscience of any thing, but sometime for, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
against, whatsoever seems countenanced or discountenanced
by the Magistrates; so that neither the <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Kingdom</hi> is in any
more <hi>security</hi> notwithstanding all such swearing, how <hi>solemn</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they seem in <hi>swearing,</hi> neither any more credit to be given in
Judicature, then there is to be given to him that is a common
Swearer in his private occasions, or common communication;
and oh how doth the Land abound in this, in so much that he that
is not a curser or a swearer is looked upon as a <hi>Phanaticke,</hi> or some
<hi>disobedient person,</hi> or <hi>unconformable man,</hi> which ought especially to
be <hi>eyed</hi> for a <hi>dangerous person:</hi> Oh that the Heads and Rulers of
the People would but consider how near the Judgment of God is,
and how ready to break forth upon the Nation, and not without
<hi>cause,</hi> even great evils are begun, <hi>Pestilence</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> already
threatned, and <hi>Gods arrows flying abroad</hi> to wound and to destroy
them that continue in hardness of heart and rebellion against God,
and will not suffer him to rule and reign in the Consciences and
Kingdoms of Men, but vain men would set up their <hi>Thresh-hold</hi>
with his, and not only so, but against his, and great is the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and the sins of this Nation upon many accounts, which the
Lord will bring a scourge upon, especially that greivous sin of
Persecution, that <hi>Cain-like way,</hi> which the Generations hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
to add as they ignorantly suppose unto their <hi>Church,</hi> and so
builds up their <hi>Zion</hi> with <hi>cruelty,</hi> and their <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>iniquity:</hi>
Oh this is loathsome in the sight of God; had <hi>Zimri</hi> peace who
slew his <hi>Master?</hi> had <hi>Israel</hi> peace when she slew the <hi>Prophets?</hi> had
the <hi>Jewes</hi> peace when they had Crucified <hi>Christ?</hi> had the <hi>Romans</hi>
peace when they persecuted the first <hi>Christians?</hi> had <hi>Cain</hi> peace
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94649:46"/>
when he had slain his brother? If nay, let not <hi>England</hi> expect
peace, when they are persecuting them that are members of <hi>Christs</hi>
Church, so that this grievous sin (if <hi>England</hi> had no more) were
enough to bring the dreadful Judgment of God upon
the whole Land, and undoubtedly will, if not repented
of; but now it must not be counted so; and why?
because there are some <hi>Statutes</hi> and Lawes which they obey not,
and so it's for <hi>disobedience;</hi> consider, did not all the former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
one <hi>Law or other,</hi> did not all that ever <hi>suffered,</hi> even the <hi>best
of men</hi> and the <hi>best of Christians</hi> suffer as <hi>disobedient,</hi> and as offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
against some Law or other, (and <hi>as evil doers</hi>) in the account
of them, that inflicted punishments upon them; if so, as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
they did, may not <hi>England</hi> be deceived, while that they are
thinking they do <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> service to root out and destroy
some, under the notion of <hi>Heresie,</hi> and some under the notion
of <hi>disobedience,</hi> and <hi>factious,</hi> may they not be <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Christ in his members,</hi> or destroying the peaceable members of
their <hi>Native Country;</hi> the Lord open all their eyes and do away
the darkness and the vaile of ignorance that is over many hearts,
that they may turn to the Lord and submit unto his eternal and
unchangable power, that so they may escape the day of the Lord
which is at hand, and the Judgment of God that is ready to break
forth as an overflowing scourge to cut off and sweep away in his
displeasure even all them that would not have Christ to rule in
their hearts, neither have his Lawes fulfilled nor obeyed, which
he writeth in the hearts of all true Believers, unto whom all must
bow and be subject, because the <hi>Father hath committed all power
into his hand, and his glory he will not give to another;</hi> no, to none
but him whom he hath given for a Convenant of Light and life, to
be <hi>King, Law-giver, Saviour,</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> of his People, <hi>and to be
the head of the body, his Church,</hi> whom he redeemes out of the
world to himself, to glorifie him, who is the only Potentate and
King of Immortal Glory, God blessed for ever and ever,
<hi>Amen.</hi>
