         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

IT were an eaſie matter with coyning a new figure for every letter, to make their ſhape as well as ſound to be ſutable to their names.

               <head>The rules of Art in writing.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SUch as will learn to write with good proficiency, ought as a neceſſary ground or principle thereof, have a perfect skill in Reading: And being ſo farr prepared, they ſhould make it their firſt care to marke well their Copies, obſerving therein the ſhape of every letter in the likeneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſſe of each to others; for which purpoſe both ſorts of letters, ſmall and capitall are ranged for the Learners eaſier apprehenſion, in ſuch an order as they have moſt affinity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, the leading Characters in either Alphabet ſhewing the way how the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33023:24"/>
reſt that follow may be performed with the beſt advantage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Learners ſhould likewiſe know the terms of Art in writing: as for inſtance, they ſhould know the threads, as,- which do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and end all letters, joyning each to other in every word, and therefore ſhould be made as ſmall as Pen can draw them, to be thereby diſtinguiſhed from the main part of any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the down-right ſtrokes, as <hi>i u n m</hi> called Minims; the waved ſtroaks, as <hi>r ſ t v w a z:</hi> the rounds, as <hi>c e o x:</hi> the ſtems or pillars, as <hi>b d l h k:</hi> the reverſed or ſloape, as <hi>j p y g q:</hi> the full length, as <hi>f ſ:</hi> the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe or croſſe thread, as in <hi>t</hi> and <hi>f:</hi> Laſt, the parallels of foure ſorts, that is to ſay, the meane ſort, all contained in a double line, as <hi>a c e i m n o r s t u v w x z,</hi> the over-lines, as <hi>b d h k l:</hi> the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, as <hi>g j p q y:</hi> the over and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, as <hi>f ſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſhould be further underſtood, that the breadth or fulneſſe of every ſtroake (the thread excepted) ought to be made equall in all letters of the ſame ſort, whether ſmall or Capitall, proportionable to the reſt of the ſame ranke; for to make ſome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33023:24"/>
ſtroaks thicker, and others thinner, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame letters, or others of the ſame ſort, doth argue too much impetuouſneſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The fulneſſe of every ſtroak in all the ſmaller letters, ſhould be a juſt third part of the length of meane letters, and their length an even halfe length of the over, or under-line letters: But the over and under-line let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould have thrice the length of mean.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The diſtance between word and word in every line ſhould be the breadth of three down-right ſtrokes called Minims, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween letter and letter in every word the breadth of one ſuch ſtroke; in which ſpace the thread ſhould joyne the end of every let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the beginning of the next that doth ſucceſſively follow throughout the whole word: ſuch compoſures of letters keeping a juſt proportion of the ſeverall parallels in fulneſſe compaſſe, light and length, are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equidiſtances, adding a meet decency to all writings, neceſſary to be aimed at induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and attayned to by Learners: But an ignorance of the Premiſes will diſable both Maſters readily to informe, and Schollars rightly to underſtand which way to draw the letters, where and why the ſame being made
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33023:25"/>
may be allowed, or where and how they fail.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Teachers at firſt entrance of their Schollers ſhould draw before them a dry pen upon the letters in the Copy, and then give the pen unto the Learners, and make them do the ſame, and tell them when they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe; and if need require, guide their hand, and not give them over untill they doe it rightly, being a neceſſary helpe to a further progreſſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Pit Inſtruments being provided; that is to ſay, a viall of ſhining Inke, good Pens, a ſmooth Rule, and flat for ſteadineſſe, a little Compaſs, a keen ſoft-edged Knife, and ſtrong ſmooth Paper folded for ſhort lines, in the firſt Copy-book four leaves to a ſheet, and five or ſix ſheets to a Book. Then Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould be taught with their Compaſſe to prick their Paper-books at three lengths of Minims between prick and prick, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to take the Rule and draw a double line upon every prick with the Compaſſe points, or a forked quill made diſtant a Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims length, where all empty ſpaces between ſuch double lines will be two Minims length, for the over and under-line letters juſt height and depth to keep them from encroaching
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33023:25"/>
either upon the others places: Or the Paper-book may be ruled in a ſpeedier way with a piece of Iron or Ivory made comb-wiſe, with ſhort and ſharp teeth, fitted to draw lines e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſtant at a Minims length each from another; wherein every four lines, the firſt will bound the height of the over-line letters, and the fourth will bound the depth of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derline letters, and the two middle lines will bound both height and depth of mean let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Likewiſe the three firſt lines wil bound both height and depth of Capitals, ſorting therein with over-line letters: And each ſeveral bound being made familiar in writing, by ruled lines after frequent uſe thereof, will grow cuſtomary and habituall without ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p n="8">8. After preparation as aforeſaid, the Scholler ſitting at ſome diſtance from Deske or Table whereon his Book is layd, with an upright body toward the light, ſhould take his pen (dipt in Inke ſo full as none may drop from it) between the two fore-fingers of his right hand ſet out at length, &amp; the thumb meeting the foremoſt finger on the other ſide of the pen, having the back upward, and the cut ſide leaning cloſe under the naile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33023:26"/>
the top of the middle finger, having the two leſſer cloſed together, leaving under it for a certaine ſtay to give a quick impulſion, with all advantage to the Pen, being held gently and ſtedily, not griped hard, being a let to ſpeed, which doth give the luſtre and life to writing.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Then the Learner ſhould ſet out his pen, hand, and arme wel ſetled to the elbow, kept cloſe unto his body, ſtraight towards his Paper-book, having thereon a blotting piece, both to keep clean his Book, and to aſſay therein all difficult letters before he doth write them in his Book for good: And withall he ſhould lay his left hand fingers, two over and two under the writing place, or keep the point of a Knife in that hand, cloſe under the line that he doth write upon, either of both helps being needful to keep the paper-book ſmooth and ſteady in the writing place. In which poſture he ſhould begin with Minims, both as the eaſieſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and as the principles to all other letters, which will be a competent exerciſe for ſome dayes employment.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If any Novice prove ſo dull, that hee doth not underſtand how to frame his letters
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33023:26"/>
by the former rules, ſpecially when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſome difficult ſtrokes in the over and under-line letters, it will be requiſite that the Teacher with a leaden pen doth draw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him ſuch hard letters, giving him good notice at every turn, and afterwards require him in the ſame manner to draw his writing Pen, being full of Inke, upon thoſe letters; for after ſuch experiments a Learner can hardly miſtake right draughts: And ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of diligence will be moſt neceſſary in the firſt draughts of Capitall letters, whereof in their due place.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Young Writers muſt not be ſuffered at the firſt entrance to ſcribble, or follow their owne fancy, or frame letters in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way then according to their Copie, and the directions of their Teacher, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed faſter then they can make good profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, or to begin the tranſcribing of any letter in fewer draughts then a whole line, or more, as need requireth, and ſo to continue in their progreſſe untill they can attain a true and perfect ſtroke in all the Alphabet, according to the firſt Copy or Preſident.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:33023:27"/>
12. When Learners are well skilled in the draughts of the ſmaller letters, it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, before they enter upon the Capitall, to teach them upon freſh memory how to joyne the ſame together, firſt by couples with <hi>m</hi> after every letter in proportion of ſo many words, as in the ſecond Copy; and when that is performed regularly, to proceed unto the third ſucceeding preſident: both which will require much time to gain therein perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for Learners ſhould endeavour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in exact performance of all circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the third and fourth, and fifth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Rules.</p>
               <p n="13">13. After a good habite gotten in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing handſomely all the letters in ſeverall words, Learners may conveniently aſſay to form the Capitall or great letters, as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the tenth rule, and in the fourth and fifth copies: But that worke being the Maſter-piece, ſhould be done piece-meale to gaine therein the maſtery, being the knotti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt parcell in all the taske: and when that is well accompliſhed, Learners will only want a conſtant exerciſe of tranſcribing the ſixth and laſt Copie, to make the due joyning of ſmall and great letters alike habituall,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33023:27"/>
which is never performed dexterouſly, untill the Writer can finiſh any word with a light and nimble pul, before he taketh off the pen, the only way to make ſmooth cleer letters, which ſlow pen-men will never attaine unto with their oft correcting, the Art becoming thereby tedious to ſuch Dullards, which to ſwift Pen-men is delightful in diſpatch of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe with ſpeed and eaſe, the Authors chief end in theſe directions.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Writers ſhould add to their former knowledg a competent skill, to make and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Pens, which is ſooner learned by the guidance of a well skilled Teacher, then by Book-rules, be they never ſo exact; yet to ſupply defects, Learners may uſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions following, to wit, taking Gooſe quils, the ſtrongeſt and roundeſt that they can chooſe, let them firſt ſcrape cleane a quill, and rub it ſmooth, then cut ſlope-wiſe the fore-part thereof two inches long; next fork the back part at end. Afterwards, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it with their knife a ſhort ſtraight cleft in the midſt of the fork, let them ſlit the cleft with another quill an inch deep, ſtraight and ſmooth, without ſnarling: And laſtly, let them them cut the quill firſt on the ſide next
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33023:28"/>
to the thumb, then upon the fingers ſide, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the form of the pens wherewith they wrote before; ſo cutting ſmooth the nib, being left twice as long as the ſlit upon the naile of their left hands thumb, and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſlope of the fore-part, if it be not well neer an inch long, to avoid blurring. The work is done by rule and reaſon; which if tryal approve for good, it will not need cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Elſe if the pen will not make clean ſtrokes, and there is no haire therein, the fault is in a ſnarling and ragged ſlit, or in the unevenneſſe of the nib, which muſt be amended by a ſmoother and cleerer ſlit, and an evener nib: otherwiſe if the pen doth write too full, the ſlit muſt be made ſhorter, or the nib ſmaller, or happily both: And contrariwiſe, if the pen prove over-hard, the ſlit is too ſhort, or the nib too ſharp, and is to be reformed accordingly. Laſt, as the skilfull Swimmers do convert to another uſe the Bladders, formerly good helps, but ſince grown hinderances to their exerciſe: So may quick and ready Pen-men do with rule and compaſſe, when without them all their lines and ſtrokes prove irregular.</p>
