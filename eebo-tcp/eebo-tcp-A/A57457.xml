            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DEare and loving Brother with weeping eyes,
and bleeding heart, I am inforced to write
unto you the Cause of my unparallel'd heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
I have before this time sent you three several
Letters; to the which you sent me back answer that
you could not beleeve that which was written to be
true. But alas brother, the world is now grown to
such a passe, that men will not believe any thing
to be true, unlesse it be done upon their own
persons, or in their own houses. Therefore for your
further satisfaction, I have sent you my only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with two letters, that you may with a lamenting
heart behold her sorrow: there may you see the
body of her, whom the villains abused: there may
you see in what manner her hair was torn from her
head, because she would not yeeld to their lust:
there may you discern how her hair was cut off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she sought to resist their tyrannicall cruelty:
there may you also perceive, how her tongue was
cut out of her mouth, because she would not blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
against her Maker. This woful spectacle have
I sent unto you, that when you have seen her perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity
that she is in, you may bewaile her calamities:
<pb facs="tcp:65114:3"/>
and these Letters haue I sent by her, because her
tongue is cut out, that she cannot expresse her mind.
So hoping that you will with patience peruse <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

lines, and the other Letter. <hi>I</hi> remain your faithfull
brother, till death gives end to my life,</p>

Copie of the second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which was sent to the speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Damzell.</head>
            <p>VPon the eighth day of this present month of
Jan. a great part of the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
score in number, came to the House of Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Adams</hi> an English man who had long time li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in feare of their comming, and having in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
provided a way out of his back-doore: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that himself and the rest of his Houshold might
escape the enemies fury.</p>
            <p>On the backside of the house there was a running
River, over which they had placed a Draw-bridge,
that they might at any time weigh up and down, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as their need required.</p>
            <p>On the fore-part of the house they had framed a
goodly prospect, that they might the better descern
the enemies approach; in the house was Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
powder and shot, muskets, and other weapons
sufficient to furnish 30. men.</p>
            <p>About the house were four goodly Ricks of
<pb facs="tcp:65114:3"/>
wheat, with two great barns full of other grain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
in the stables there were 12. stout horses some
that belonged to the Plow, and some for other uses,
and four yoak of Oxen at the staul with abundance
of victuall, and all manner of good houshold stuffe, all
which was consumed in a moment of time by the
Rebellious Irish, as you shall hear in the following
discourse.</p>
            <p>Now for the better safeguard of the house, and
family, Mr. Adams, alwayes kept one on purpose to
watch through the Prospect, but the Rebels being
grounded in villany, had by some meanes learned
where the house stood, and how it was furnished, and
therefore went about the number of twenty first,
and came within sight of the house, which when the
watch-man had taken view of, hee m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de his Master
acquainted with the same, who presently gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that every man in the house should prepare for
battell; for why, said he, J see there are but twenty
in sight of the Rebels, and we are thirty in number:
let it never be said, that we will flee from them, and
forsake all that ever we have for fear of them that
cannot hurt us.</p>
            <p>You know that one stroke from the hand of a
true man, gains more victory then the force of
theeves.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us approve our selves to bee bold
hearted Englishmen, a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d fight for our Countries ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
against these Papisticall enemies of truth. At
which manly resolution, every one of his men-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
betook himself to his musket, and liking so
well of their masterr forwardnesse, eve<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y man see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

all: by tha<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> time the treacherous Rebels were come
within gun shot of the house, they marched 4 abrest,
and five in rank, and made an assault upon the house.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65114:4"/>
Whereupon the Master of the house and his men,
having their muskets charged in readinesse, gave
fire upon them out at the windows, and slew sixe of
the twenty at the first valley of shot; the other six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
of the Rebels which lay in ambush, hearing the
Guns make such a ratling noise, knew that their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
were in hot service, made all speed that might
be towards the house, who were presently descry'd
by the watch-man, which cryed out with a loud
voice, O Master now seek to save your self, or else
we are all dead men. When the Master and his men
perceived themselvs in such a grievous streight, they
kept fast the fore doors, and fled out at the backe
door, and some over the draw-bridg, together with
the Mistris and her Children, and the Maid-servants
all in generall, hoping thereby to save their lives. But
see how they ran out of one danger into another, the
men because they were constrained to help the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
kind, cast away all their armes, that the enemy
might not overtake them in running, and so for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
they ran into a wood to hide themselves from
their following foes, and having gathered together a
deale of Ferne, they made them lodging under the
trees: in which miserable night the Mistris was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
of a man-child in that desert place. But here
comes the griefe of all, it chanced so that in the dead
time of the night, a Wolfe that had bin chased the
day before, comming neere unto the place where
these distressed people lay, and having scented them
came to them, and ceised upon one of the maids, and
bit her by the arm, and by the left breast, before shee
could make any means to shift for her self.</p>
            <p>At last, crying out for help, one of the men which
had a sword, drew it to save the maids life, The subtle
wolf, finding himself like to be over-matcht, ran
straightways to asleep hill, and sat thereon, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
<pb facs="tcp:65114:4"/>
made such a howling noise, that hee called
such a number of wolves together, that all the power
they had was not able to resist them, some that had
swo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds fought for themselves, and some that could
climbe got upon trees, the rest were torn in pieces
by the ravening wolvs, to the number of 14. amongst
the rest, the tender mother and her new-born infant
served to suffice the hungry maws of the devouring
monstrous wolves. The next day went forth of the
town of <hi>London-Derry</hi> 500. <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmed men, thinking to
have met with the Rebels, but they were too swift
of foot for them: but as they passed through the
wood, they beheld what was done by the wolves.
There might they see the bloud of Christians which
was spilt by means of wolves and Cany bals. Their
hearts, livers, and entrails torn in pieces with other
wofull objects.</p>
            <p>Thus gentle brother have I sent you the cause of
my delay in my mournfull Letters, hoping that the
next time that I write to you, to send you better
newes, otherwise would I might never live to write
more.</p>
