         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Alſo</hi> John <hi>in the</hi> Revelations, <hi>when he ſtood upon the ſand of the Sea,</hi> ſaw the firſt Beaſt riſe out of the Sea, and the ſecond out of the Earth, which exerciſed the Authority of the firſt, and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon gave the power to the Beaſt, and them that worſhipped him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. And <hi>John</hi> ſaw the War he made with the Lamb, and with the Saints, and overcame them, for he was to continue 42 Months, <hi>which is by the account of the Spirit of God, according as it is recorded in the Scripture, above</hi> 1200 <hi>Years, which is fully compleated and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with many years over, ſince that great City</hi> Babylon <hi>had a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> with whom the Kings of the Earth have committed fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the Wine of her fornication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Angel carried</hi> John <hi>into the Wilderneſs,</hi> Rev. 16, where he ſaw the Judgements of this great Whore, and this woman which hath been arrayed in Purple, and Scarlet colour, decked with Gold and Precious Stones, and in her hand a golden Cup full of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; and the Woman which thou ſaweſt, <hi>ſaith the Angel,</hi> is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth. <hi>But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this,</hi> John ſaw another Angel, and he cryed mightily, with a ſtrong voyce, ſaying, <hi>Babylon, Babylon</hi> the great, is fallen, is fallen, and become the habitation of Devils. And <hi>John</hi> heard another voyce from Heaven, ſaying, Come out of her my People, that ye he not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her Plagues; for her ſins have reached unto Heaven, and God hath remembred her Iniquities. Reward her even as ſhe hath rewarded you, and

            <p>
               <hi>Glory, Glory to the Higheſt for evermore, her day of deſtruction and calamity and deſolation haſtens on apace, the darkneſs is paſt, the night is over, and the true Light now ſhineth; the Reſurrection of Jeſus Christ the Righteous, the Bleſſed Seed, is riſing in the hearts of People; the Son of Man is coming to be lifted up from the Earth, and will draw all men after him, and in his power and in his great glory is coming to reign, and to rule in the hearts and conſciences of men; and the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony is opened in Heaven, and is with men, and the Myſtery of Godlineſs is manifested in the hearts of People, and God is manifeſting himſelf in them, who hath ſaid he will dwell in Men, and walk in them; and he is making their Bodies his Temples; and he is coming to root out and race out of the hearts of Men and Women, that Man of Sin, that Son of Perdition, that hath ſitten in the Temple of God, and hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above all that is called God, and hath ſhewed himſelf as God; and now the Lord is diſcovering him by the Reſurrection of his Power and Spirit in the hearts of People, which he is coming to pour upon all fleſh according to his word and promiſe: and that Myſtery of Iniquity that hath wrought in a Myſtery, that Wickedneſs that hath poſſeſt the hearts of men and women, now the Lords Power and Spirit is coming to caſt him out, and take him out of the way, and throw him out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Chriſt Jeſus, that everlaſting Fountain, who ſaid,</hi> If any man be a thirſt, let him tome unto me and drink; for I am come a Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, <hi>which world is in every mans heart;</hi> And whoſoever believes in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>the Light,</hi> they ſhall not periſh, <hi>but have the Light of Life: And this Light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in the heart of every man and woman, turning their minds thereunto, it becomes their Teacher; and this is that by which the Lord teacheth all his People, who hath ſaid by his Prophets,</hi> They ſhall be all taught of God, <hi>John</hi> 6. Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of
<pb facs="tcp:54902:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Father, cometh unto me, <hi>ſaith Chriſt, who is</hi> that living Bread that endureth for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this is the Son of man which God the Father hath ſealed, that is come a Light and a Spirit, which every one that believes in, is ſealed with; therefore it is good for all People, not to</hi> quench the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>nor</hi> to grieve it, by which they are ſealed to the day of Redemption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>but that every one may turn to the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, that is within them, which preacheth in a Myſtery, and preacheth righteouſneſs very nigh in their hearts, and will cleanſe their inward parts, and make their hearts clean from that myſtery of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, that hath been long lodged in them and held them Captive, and led them into ſin, and tranſgreſſion, and wickedneſs. Oh that all hearts and ſecret parts might be cleanſed by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and that every one would walk in the Light, abide in the Light, as he is in the Light; and here is the fellowſhip and unity of the Saints in Light, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous ruling in their hearts; and who lives in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, they come to have fellowſhip with</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, <hi>as John had;</hi> and theſe things he wrote unto them that their joy might be full, <hi>and that they might partake of the ſame Light, Life and Spirit, and have Unity with him whoſe meſſage is,</hi> That God is Light, and in him is no darkneſs at all. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſaith he knows God and abides in darkneſs, is a lyar, and the Truth is not in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this hath been the Condition and Doctrine that hath been holden forth for many hundred years; they have walked in darkneſs, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if they had fellowſhip with God, and they have loved the world, and the things of the world, which the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> is not of the Father; And if any love the World, the love of the Father is not in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now Reader do but conſider, how theſe Teachers of the world live, and after what manner, and how they do oppreſs people for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and whether there is any ſort of people more covetous of the world than they are, and how they draw people from the Unction of the holy One, that the Apoſtle here turned people to, and deſired them to take heed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and to continue and abide in; that which they had heard from the beginning; and not to turn to thoſe Antichriſts that were then entering into the world: but they were to abide in the Anointing which thy had received, and it would teach them all things, and it was truth and was no lie,</hi> 1 John 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54902:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>But theſe Miniſters of darkneſs, that have been in this night of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, all their indeavours have been to draw people from the Light, and from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of the Holy One, after them, and after their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, dark Studies, and brain Divination, and ſo have deceived poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and have led them captive at their wills; and as the Prophet ſaid,</hi> Have born rule by their means, and the people <hi>have been ſo blind, that they</hi> love to have it ſo: <hi>And thus the Scriptures have been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and there hath been power given to the Beaſt, and people generally have ſaid in their hearts,</hi> Who is able to make war with the Beaſt? <hi>But glory to the higheſt Lord, his time is over, and</hi> the year of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is come, and the Spirit of the Lord is upon him, and the Lord hath anointed him to preach good tydings to the meek, liberty to the Captives, and the opening the Priſon doors to them that are bound, and to proclaime the acceptable Year of the Lord, and the day of Vengeance of our God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh Reader! The time is ſhort, the day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the night, and all this long-ſuffering of the Lord that hath been paſt, is becauſe</hi> he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance. And ſeeing that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, oh! what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs, looking for that bleſſed hope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that all may be found with him in peace, without ſpot or blemiſh, <hi>which is my deſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo read over this following Treatiſe, and weigh in the ſeriouſneſs of thy heart, and conſider the Scriptures of Truth, by which thou mayeſt judge, by the Light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in thee, how all the world have been befooled, and blinded, and led captive even at Satans will; and how this Antichriſt hath ruled in the hearts of People, and ſate in the Temple of God, and hath been decked and covered over with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Saints words, ſpeaking them forth with unclean lips, and from unclean hearts, and ſo have deceived the hearts of the ſimple; but this fine linnen, and purple, and ſcarlet, that Babylon hath been decked with, in one day ſhall be taken from her.</hi> Amen, even ſo Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</p>

            <head>A Touch-Stone, OR, A <hi>Perfect Tryal</hi> by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> of all the <hi>Priests, Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ME thinks I hear the <hi>Biſhops</hi> mutter, murmur, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, that I ſhould publiſh it out to the world, how I deſired the King to beware of their Counſels; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do hereby give them my Reaſons of the Cauſe why I did ſo, which Reaſons may ſatisfie them and the whole world, except they can by as good or better overturn them.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I deſired, ſince it pleaſed the Lord to bring the King to his outward Right and Propriety of the Crown of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, that he might have done that whereby he might Proſper, according to the words of the wiſe King <hi>Solomon,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but the honour of a King to ſearch out a matter. Take away the wicked from before the King, and his Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed,</hi> Prov. 25. And again he ſaith, <hi>The thoughts of the Righteous are right, but the counſel of the wicked is deceit: the words of the wicked are to lye in wait for blood, but the mouth of the upright ſhall deliver them; the wicked are overthrown and are not, but the houſe the righteous ſhall ſtand,</hi> Prov. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54902:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Alſo, it was my deſire that he ſhould follow the example of the good Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe way it was to ask counſel of the Lord, or of his Prophets; as King <hi>David</hi> enquired of the Lord, whether he ſhould go up againſt the Philiſtims? and the Lord ſaid, <hi>Go up,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. and again King <hi>David</hi> called <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, and told him that he would build a Houſe for the Ark of God, and the Lord ſent word again to <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. And when there was three years of famine in the Land, <hi>David</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the Lord, and the Lord anſwered him, <hi>it was for</hi> Saul <hi>and his bloody houſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>Alſo King <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Lord appeared unto him, and bid him ask what he would have, and <hi>Solomon</hi> asked of the Lord an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart to judge his People, that he might diſcern between good and bad, for ſaith he, <hi>Who is able to judge this thy ſo great a People?</hi> And this ſpeech pleaſed the Lord that <hi>Solomon</hi> asked ſuch a thing, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. And again the Lord ſpake unto <hi>Solomon</hi> the ſecond time, concerning the Houſe which he was building; <hi>If thou wilt walk in my Statutes,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and execute my Judgements, and keep all my Commandments to walk in them, then will I perform my word with thee, which I ſpake unto</hi> David <hi>thy Father.</hi> 1 Kings 6.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that good King of <hi>Judah,</hi> when he was ſent to, from <hi>Sennacherib</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> by <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> and others with a great hoaſt, who came up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who threatned the King and the whole City, as you may read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> ſent <hi>Eliakim,</hi> and <hi>Shebna,</hi> and the Elders of the Prieſts, covered with ſackcloth, to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Son of <hi>Amos;</hi> ſo the ſervants of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> came to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Thus ſhall ye ſay unto your Maſter, thus ſaith the Lord; Be not afraid of their words,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>And accordingly the Lord ſent an Angel and cut off all the men of Valour, and the Leaders, and the Captains of the King of</hi> Aſſyria; <hi>and the Lord ſaved</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>from the hands of the King of</hi> Aſſyria, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Joſiah,</hi> that good King, when he heard the words of the Book of the <hi>Law</hi> read, he rent his Cloathes, and commanded <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> the Prieſt, and ſeveral of the Elders of the People, ſaying, <hi>Go ye and enquire of the Lord for me, and for all the People of</hi> Judah, <hi>concerning the words of this Book that is found; for great is the wrath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54902:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Lord that is kindled againſt us becauſe our Fathers have not hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the words of this Book; and they went and enquired of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs,</hi> to <hi>Huldah,</hi> as you may read, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. This you ſee was the practice of the four principal Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover I am clearly convinced, and am aſſured, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as they are called, and thoſe of their Order and Coat, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any that have taken upon them that Function of the Clergy, theſe many hundred of years, that they are not according unto Chriſt Jeſus nor unto his Diſciples, nor the Apoſtles, and the Saints in the Primitive times, but are gone quite contrary, according to what the Scriptures of Truth hold forth; and that in all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular heads following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their <hi>Titles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their <hi>Eſtate,</hi> or <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Qualifications.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their <hi>Call.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Their <hi>Practiſe</hi> in matters of Controverſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Their <hi>Maintenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly</hi> and laſtly, Their <hi>Garbe</hi> and <hi>Habit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which we ſhall prove not only not according, but quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and contrary to Chriſt Jeſus his Example, and his Apoſtles and diſciples.</p>
            <p>Now they being men not only profeſſing Chriſtianity, but alſo taking upon them to be Actors, Leaders, Teachers, Preachers, and Feeders of the Peoples Soules, and that in and with Chriſtianity, there can be no ſound reaſon to the contrary, but that they ſhould be men principled, fitted, and furniſhed, yea, and filled with the ſame Spirit as was in the Apoſtles, whoſe words they take upon them to declare, and to make a Trade of, and to get their Living by; ſince they make poor people believe, that they have their ſouls in cure, and ſo by good words and fair ſpeeches, deceive the hearts of the ſimple, and ſo keep them ever learning, but they never come to the knowledge of the Truth.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the <hi>Firſt, viz.</hi> Their <hi>Titles,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is clear contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt; for when the Mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> Children came unto him concerning her two Sons, <hi>that one might ſit on his right hand, and the other on his left.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54902:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, ye know not what ye ask; and when the other ten heard it, they were moved with indignation againſt the two Brethren; but Jeſus called them unto him, and ſaid, ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe Dominion over them, and they that are great exerciſe Authority upon them, but it ſhall not be ſo among you; but whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your Miniſter; and whoſoever will be chief among you, let him be your ſervant. Even as the Son of Man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter; and to give his Life a ranſome for many,</hi> Matth. 20.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe again, when he told them, <hi>That one of them ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him; they began to enquire among themſelves, which of them it was.</hi> And there was alſo a ſtrife among them which of them ſhould be accounted the greateſt (mark that, you great Lords) <hi>And he ſaid unto them, the Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe Lordſhip over them; and thoſe that exerciſe Authority on them are called Benefactors, but ye ſhall not be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theit <hi>Titles,</hi> which are your <hi>Holineſs, Lord-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> and your <hi>Gra<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e;</hi> contrary to Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</note> 
               <hi>ſo; but he that is greateſt among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief as he that doth ſerve,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And again, when he ſaid unto them, <hi>Let theſe things ſink into your eares; the Son of Man muſt be delivered into the hands of men. And again they began to reaſon among themſelves who ſhould be the greateſt.</hi> And when he ſaid unto them, <hi>Behold we go up to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and the Son of Man ſhall be delivered unto the chief Prieſts, and unto the Scribes, and they ſhall condemn him to death.</hi> Even then did <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> come to deſire to ſit, <hi>one on his right hand, and the other on his left:</hi> But Jeſus again reproved them for it, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Ye know that they that are accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exerciſe Lordſhip over them, and their great ones ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Authority upon them; but it ſhall not be ſo with you,</hi> &amp;c. Mar. 10. Nay, he ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>Be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt, and all ye are Brethren. Neither be ye cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Masters, but he that is greateſt among you, let him be your ſervant: and whoſoever ſhall exalt himſelf, ſhall be abaſed; and he that humbles himſelf, ſhall be exalted,</hi> Mat. 23.</p>
            <p>And I do not find that the Apoſtles, either <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus,</hi> who were Biſhops indeed, were ever called <hi>Lord-Biſhops;</hi> but the Apoſtle, when he writes to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at</hi> Athens <hi>alone;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54902:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſent</hi> Timotheus <hi>our Brother and Miniſter of God, and Fellow-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Goſpel of Chriſt, to eſtabliſh you and to comfort you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Faith.</hi> This was the Title that the Apoſtle gave them, which was not, <hi>Our Reverend Father in God, Lord Biſhop,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle when he writes unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> calls him, <hi>His Son in the Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. And when he exhorts him, he ſaith, <hi>If thou put the Brethren in remembrance of theſe things, thou ſhalt be a good miniſter of Jeſus Christ, nouriſhed up in the word of Faith, and to good Doctrine whereunto thou haſt attained,</hi> Chap. 4. And in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle that he writes to <hi>Timothy</hi> he calleth him, <hi>His dearly beloved Son;</hi> and that he greatly deſires to ſee him: and he ſaith, <hi>Thou my Son, be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> And he bids him <hi>endure hardneſs as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.</p>
            <p>And when he writes to <hi>Titus,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>To Titus mine own Son af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the common Faith; for this cauſe left I thee at Creet, that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things that are wanting,</hi> Tit. 1. And again he ſaith to <hi>Timothy, Let no man deſpiſe thy youth, but be thou an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Believers, in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity. Till I come, give attendance to reading, and to exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</hi> 1 Tim. 4. I would know which of the Biſhops hath received ſuch a Gift as this? and whether by making proof of this Gift of Propheſie that is in them, they have attained to theſe Titles of <hi>Lord-Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Reverend Fathers in God?</hi> But ſince we find the Scriptures ſo much contrary to theſe Titles, it muſt needs follow that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Titles from men. But <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were made Overſeers of the Church of God by the Holy Ghoſt (but no <hi>Lord-Biſhops)</hi> and ſo was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>And <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks expreſly, <hi>My Brethren, have not the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord of glory, with reſpect of Perſons: For if there come into your aſſembly a man with a gold Ring or goodly Apparrel, and there come alſo a poor man in vile Rayment, and ye have reſpect to him that weareth the gay Cloathing, and not to him that is Poor; Are ye not partial in your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But if ye have reſpect to perſons, ye commit ſin, and are convinced of the Law as tranſgreſſours,</hi> Jam. 2.</p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle gives perfect judgement againſt the reſpecting
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54902:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of mens perſons, which moſt men do, becauſe of advantage; but with Chriſt Jeſus and his holy Apoſtles, you ſee it was not ſo, and therefore thoſe that take upon them the name of the Miniſters of the Goſpel of Chriſt, ſhould follow their examples, and not go quite contrary. And this I look upon to be ſufficient for the proof of the firſt head, which is their <hi>Titles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is their <hi>Qualifications, State</hi> and <hi>Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus ſaid to thoſe he preached unto, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt: take my yoak upon you, learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart,</hi> Mat. 11. This is contrary to highneſs and haughtineſs. And when he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his firſt Sermon in the Mountain, and his Diſciples came unto him, <hi>He opened his mouth, and taught them, ſaying, Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit: Bleſſed are they that Mourn: Bleſsed are the Meek;</hi> as you may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe when he ſent forth his Diſciples, he ſaid, <hi>Behold I ſend you as Lambs in the middeſt of Wolves; be ye therefore wiſe as Serpents, but harmleſs as Doves,</hi> Mat. 10. And when he had ſent out the ſeventy, by two and by two, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Go your wayes, behold I ſend you forth as Lambs among Wolves,</hi> Luke 10. This was one Quality of thoſe that Chriſt ſent forth, they were <hi>Meek,</hi> they were <hi>Harmleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They were ſuch as were to go into Sufferings, as he ſaid unto them in the next <hi>verſe; Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the Counſels, and they will ſcourge you in their Synagogues; and ye ſhall be brought before Governours and Kings, for my Names ſake, for a Teſtimony againſt them and the Gentiles, and ye ſhall be hated of all men for my Names ſake,</hi> Mat. 10. Mark 13. 9.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Peter</hi> rebuked his Maſter, when he told them that he was to go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſuffer; <hi>He turned, and ſaid unto</hi> Peter, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,</hi> contrary to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who were, 1ſt. <hi>Meek, Lowly,</hi> and <hi>Humble,</hi> 2. <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>taking up the Croſs.</hi> 3 <hi>Love and Charity to all men.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then ſaid Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto his Diſciples, If any man will come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me,</hi> Mat. 16. And when he told them, that <hi>tho Son of Man muſt ſuffer many things, and be rejected of the Elders, and Chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and be ſlain, and raiſed again the third day;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54902:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and he ſaid unto them all; If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily and follow me,</hi> Luke 9. Mark. 8.</p>
            <p>And according to this the Apoſtles of Chriſt went through many hardſhips and ſufferings, as may be read at large throughout the Book of the <hi>Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians, And I brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of ſpeech, or wiſdome, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring unto you the Myſtery of God; for I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him Crucified: and I was with you in weakneſs and fear, and in much trembling; For Chriſt ſent me not to Baptize but to Preach the Goſpel; not with wiſdom of words, leaſt the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect; for the preaching of the Croſs is, to them that periſh, fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. and Chap. 2.</p>
            <p>It is many ages ſince thoſe that took upon them the Preaching that which they have called the Goſpel, were in this ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for the Croſs of Chriſt which is the Power of God, which makes to tremble, as the Apoſtles did, hath been an offence unto them, and is mocked and ſcoffed at by them, to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They were alſo ſuch as were to live in <hi>Love;</hi> and of this Chriſt himſelf gave them an example, when he took a Towel, and girded himſelf, and poured water into a Baſon, and began to waſh the Diſciples feet, and ſaid, <hi>Ye call me Lord and Maſter, and ye ſay well, for ſo I am: If I then your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your feet, ye ought alſo to waſh one anothers feet. And a new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I give unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you; for I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you: By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another,</hi> John 13. and Chap. 15.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, when he wrote to the <hi>Theſſalonians; but as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye your ſelves are taught of God to love one another; and indeed ye do it towards all the Brethren. But we beſeech you, that ye increaſe more and more,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that ſaith he is in the Light and hateth his Brother, is in darkneſs: He that loveth his brother abideth in the Light,</hi> 1 John 2. And again he ſaith, <hi>This is the Meſſage that ye have heard from the beginning, that we love one another: not as</hi> Cain <hi>that ſlew his brother, and wherefore ſlew he him? becauſe his own
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54902:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
works were evil, and his brothers righteous. But we know that we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother, abideth in death: whoſoever hateth his brother is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer; and ye know that no murtherer hath eternal Life abiding in him. Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he hath laid down his Life for us: We ought alſo to lay down our lives for the Brethren,</hi> Chap. 3.</p>
            <p>And ſo this is contrary to what hath been the practiſe of thoſe that have taken upon them the function of the Miniſters of Chriſt, for many hundreds of years; for though they have profeſſed Chriſt and Chriſtianity, yet they have been killing, and ſlaying, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering one another, as many examples might be inſtanced in ages paſt. Thoſe that call themſelves Papiſts, and thoſe that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Proteſtants, one killing, and ſlaying, and murdering another, and yet all profeſſing and confeſſing themſelves to be Chriſtians, and would profeſs the Scriptures, Chriſt and the Apoſtles words; and in doing thus one to another, they have thought they have done God good ſervice; and ſo have fulfilled Chriſt's words, who ſaith, <hi>Yea the time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth God good ſervice: and theſe things will they do, becauſe they have not known the Father and me,</hi> John 16. And this may ſuffice for the ſecond head, which is their <hi>Quallifications.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> is their <hi>Call.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Jeſus when he came and ſpake unto his Diſciples, he ſaid unto them, <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth; go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I commanded you, and loe I am with you alwayes, even to the end of the world,</hi> Mat. 28. And he ſaid unto them, <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preaceh unto every creature, he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>Behold, I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you; but tarry ye in the City of Jeruſalem, till ye be endued with Power from on high; and he bleſſed them,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their <hi>Call</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which was by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial command and revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſt Jeſus. Theirs of men and from men.</note> 
               <hi>and they worſhipped him, and they returned to Jeruſalem,</hi> Luke 26. Which is rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again in the firſt of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and fulfilled in the ſecond <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the Spirit was poured upon them plentifully;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54902:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and there were ſome then that mocked and ſaid, <hi>Theſe men are full of new Wine; but</hi> Peter <hi>ſtood up with the eleven, and ſaid, Theſe men are not drunken as ye ſuppoſe; but this is that which was ſpoken of by the Prophet</hi> Joel, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, ſaith the Lord, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh; and your Sons and Daughters ſhall propheſie: and whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord in that day, ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This holy Spirit the Apoſtles received, when they were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; alſo <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, who was made an Apoſtle after them, he alſo was ſeparated for that work by the holy Ghoſt; for as the Apoſtles were met together with the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> as they miniſtred to the Lord and faſted; the Holy Ghoſt ſaid, <hi>Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them: So they being ſent forth by the Holy Ghoſt, departed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>And ſo the Apoſtle writes himſelf, when he wrote to the <hi>Romans. Paul a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, called to be an Apoſtle, ſeparated unto the Goſpel of God.</hi> And again, when he wrote to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he wrote thus; <hi>Paul an Apoſtle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father, who raiſed him from the dead, and all the Brethren which are with me, unto the Churches of Galatia.</hi> And he ſaith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>I certifie you brethren, that the Goſpel which was preached of me, is not after man; for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt: But when it pleaſed God who ſeparated me from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Heathen; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, I conferred not with fleſh and blood,</hi> Gal. 1. And again, when he wrote to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> when he was a Priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt, he wrote thus to the <hi>Gentiles; Ye have heard of the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the grace of the Goſpel of God, which is given me to you ward; how that by Revelation he made known unto me the Myſtery, as I wrote unto you in a few words; which in other Ages was not made known unto the Sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy Apoſtles and Prophets by the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 3.</p>
            <p>I do not know, neither have I heard, that the Miniſters, and ſuch as take upon them to teach People, neither thoſe that are their Lords, Biſhops, and Arch-Biſhops, that they have had their Calls after this Order; for there have been other wayes and meanes uſed for many hundred of years together; as Schooles, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54902:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Univerſities, and Nurſeries of Learning, which they call their <hi>Mothers</hi> with a heap of Stuffe, which are better known by them that exerciſe themſelves in them, than the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt is: and the Miniſters they make are by men, and of men, and they will have them Fitted and Ordained according to their Wayes and Orders. But if any one have received the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Jeſus Chriſt and his Holy Spirit, if any ſuch have a Word to ſpeak from the Lord, they muſt not be received nor admitted; this is not according to their Order; this they call an <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and a <hi>Sect;</hi> any that ſpeak, and meet together, and worſhip the Lord God in his Spirit, and in his Truth, ſuch are taken notice of, and are brought under the Whip, and the Scourge, and are apprehended and caſt into Priſion, if they do but pretend the Teachings and Leadings of the Spirit of God; and if they have not freedom in their ſpirits to pay them Tythes, or to maintain their Steeple-houſes, preſently they are brought into the Biſhops Court, and if they cannot for Conſcience-ſake ſwear, and take an Oath, then preſently they are caſt into Priſon; But of this more hereafter. And thus it is truly manifeſted, that the order of their Calling is not according unto Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles; for Chriſt ſaith expreſly, <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and no man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whom the Son revealeth him,</hi> Mat. 11.</p>
            <p>And again Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It is written in the Prophets, They ſhall be all taught of God; every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me: not that any man hath ſeen the Father, ſave he that is of God, he hath ſeen the Father,</hi> John 6. This may be ſufficient to prove the Third head, which is their <hi>Call,</hi> which is contrary to the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> their <hi>Worſhip and the manner of it,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt</hi> for the <hi>Worſhip it ſelf,</hi> Chriſt when he ſpake to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and ſhe told him, <hi>That their Fathers worſhipped in that Mountain of</hi> Samaria: <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman believe me, the hour cometh when ye ſhall neither in this Mountain, nor yet at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem worſhip the Father; but the hour cometh and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The true Worſhip it ſelf diſcovered.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>the Father in Spirit and in Truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him. God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54902:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> John 4. And to this purpoſe did Jeſus ſpeak to <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> when he came unto him by night, when he ſaid unto him, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> At which words, <hi>Nichodemus</hi> wondred; but Jeſus anſwered, <hi>Except a man be born of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the Fleſh, is Feſh; and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit: Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, ye muſt be born again; the wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> &amp;c. John 3.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe was the man <hi>whoſe name was John, ſent of God, to bear witneſs of Chriſt Jeſus the Light, that all men through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was ſent to bear witneſs of that Light, which is the true Light that lighteth every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him: which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God. John bare witneſs of him and cryed, ſaying, This is he of whom I ſpake; he that cometh after me is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; and of his fullneſs we have all received grace for grace:</hi> as may be read at large, <hi>John</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>And to bring People to this Light and Spirit of the Lord within them, did Chriſt Jeſus, and all his holy Apoſtles endeavour, by their Preaching: Therefore ſaith Jeſus Chriſt unto <hi>Nichodemus, we ſpeak what we know, and teſtifie what we have ſeen, and ye receive <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ot our witneſs. This is the condemnation, that Light is come into the world, and men love Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their deeds are evil. For every one that doth evil hateth the Light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved: But he that doth truth, cometh to the Light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God.</hi> This is Chriſt's Doctrine and Worſhip. And when he was preaching among his Diſciples, and alſo the Scribes and Phariſees heard him, and many believed among the chief Rulers, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">

and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him, the Word that I have ſpoken ſhall judge him at the laſt day:</hi> and ſo on, <hi>John</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt told the Phariſees, that the Kingdom of God came not by obſervation; but the Kingdom of God was <hi>within them.</hi> And when he ſent forth his Diſciples, he ſaith, <hi>As ye go, preach, ſaying, The Kingdom of God is at hand,</hi> Mat. 10. Alſo when he ſent out the ſeventy, he ſaid, <hi>Heal the ſick that are therein: and ſay, The Kingdom of God is nigh unto you,</hi> Luke 10. 9. And we alſo ſee by the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, which are left upon record, after what manner of Doctrine, and exhortation they ſpake unto the People; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John,</hi> which was the beloved Diſciple, what he hath written in that, which hath been already mentioned in the 1ſt. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapters of <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, ſaith; <hi>For we have not followed cunning deviſed Fables, when we made known unto you the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but we are Eye-witneſſes of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: For he received from God the Father, honour, and glory, when there came ſuch a voice to him, from the excellent glory, ſaying; This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy Mount. We have alſo a more ſure Word of Propheſie, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark place; until the Day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</hi> Here the Apoſtle directs them to a more ſure Word, than that which was heard in the Mount, which came from the Excellent Glory, which they taking heed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, might have the day to dawn, and the day-ſtar to ariſe in their hearts. This was a true and a right Miniſter; alſo he ſaith, <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this firſt, that no Propheſie of the Scriptures is of any private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. How is it then that it is kept ſo private, that none muſt interpret it but Learned men, ſuch as have been at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge.</hi> But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the Propheſie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But thoſe that have had learning at <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> will hardly give a right Interpretation of that which the holy Ghoſt hath ſpoken forth.</p>
            <p>But when the Apoſtle wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was a Biſhop, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54902:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Overſeer made by the holy Ghoſt, to him he ſaith, <hi>Continue thou <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

            <p>And when <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of his beloved Brother <hi>Paul,</hi> and of his Epiſtles which he had written, and what he ſpake; <hi>Some things,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>are hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable wreſt, as they do alſo the other Scriptures, unto their own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. So they that have not the Inſpiration of the Almighty, and motion of the Spirit of the Lord God, the ſame that gave forth the Scriptures, when they come to Interpret them, and give mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to them, being unlearned therein, they juſt wreſt them to their <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

               </gap> deſtruction, and therefore they do not profit the People at all: <hi>Theſe be they who ſeparate themſelves; men that are ſenſual, not having the Spirit,</hi> Judge 19.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was ſent forth to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, the voice that ſpake unto him, when he was ſtruck down unto the earth with the ſight of a Viſion, ſaid unto him, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, ſtand upon thy feet, for I have appointed thee for this purpoſe; to make thee a Miniſter and a Witneſs; both of theſe things thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe things in the which I ſhall appear unto thee; delivering thee from the People and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee; to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Acts 26.</p>
            <p>And according to this, the Apoſtle confeſſed himſelf, when he mote to the <hi>Romans; I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, both to the wiſe and the unwiſe; ſo much as in me is I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to preach the Goſpel to you that are at Rome alſo: For I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the Power of God unto Salvation, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that believeth; to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Greek: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the Righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith; and the wrath of God is revealed againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54902:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men; becauſe that which may be known of God, is manifeſted in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> And thus the Apoſtle goes on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting and teaching the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the 1ſt, and 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Chapters, and telleth them, <hi>That God will render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patience continue in well doing, ſeek for glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and immortality, and eternal life; but unto them that are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs; indignation and wrath. For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is no reſpect of perſons with God, for as many as have ſinned without the Law, ſhall periſh without the Law: and as many as have ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law, for not the hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he is ſpeaking of his hearts deſire and prayer to God for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he tells them, <hi>That Chriſt is the end of the Law to every one that believeth. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe; Say not in thy heart, who ſhall aſcend into heaven, that is to bring Chriſt down from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep, that is to bring Chriſt up again from the dead? but what ſaith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart, that is, the Word of Faith which we preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when he wrote to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he rehearſeth the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that the Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had propheſied of, and ſaith, <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with them, after thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord; I will put my Laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them,</hi> Heb. 10. Theſe with many more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture might be inſtanced of the Apoſtles, how they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred both in Preaching and Writing.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our eyes, and our hands have handled the word of Life; This we declare unto you, that ye may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Christ.</hi> Here was a right Miniſter of God, that would have had thoſe he wrote to, to have been in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him; who was in fellowſhip with the Father and with the Son: and therefore he ſaith unto them, <hi>Theſe things I write unto you, that your joy may be full: This then is the meſſage which we have heard from him, and declared unto you; that God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all. If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54902:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
walk in darkneſs, we lye, and do not the truth; but if we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> And again the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>A new Commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; becauſe the darkneſs is paſt and the true Light now ſhineth. Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning: If that which ye have heard from the beginning ſhall abide in you, ye ſhall alſo continue in the Son, and in the Father. Theſe things have I written unto you concerning them that ſeduce you; but the Anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you; and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame Anointing teacheth you of all things; and is the truth, and is no lye; even as he hath taught you ye ſhall abide in him: for ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye know all things,</hi> 1 John 2.</p>
            <p>Here is ſound, firm, and wholſome Teaching, that theſe holy men of God taught thoſe that they taught, but contrary to their teaching, have Inventions and Teachings of men, been for many Ages and Generations in this dark Night of Apoſtacy; in which the pure, and holy, and glorious Church of Chriſt, hath been gone into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe hath had a place appointed her of God, until the One thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes were accompliſhed, which <hi>John</hi> ſaw, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. But now ſhe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth again, glory to the Higheſt for ever: And the Man-child, which hath been caught up to God, and to his Throne, is coming to Rule all Nations; and now are theſe Miniſters of darkneſs, which have miniſtred in the night, coming to be ſeen, now that the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. For God that hath commanded Light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, and hath given us the Light of the knowledge of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, which is the Son of Righteouſneſs, by which we ſee and comprehend them all. So to proceed to the particulars.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that I except againſt in matter and form of their Worſhip: <hi>Viz.</hi> All ſorts of Preachers and Teachers that are out of Chriſt and his Apoſtles Spirit, Doctrine and Rule, is the taking a part or portion of Scripture for a Text, and adding thereto their own Inventions, which they ſtudy out of their own brain, and alſo bringing other Authors, who have done the like; many of them not Chriſtians but Heathens: and thus make an Image and ſet up,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54902:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and deceive poor peoples ſouls, and keep them everlearning, but never come to the knowledge of the Truth; and are more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God than many Heathens that never profeſſed Chriſt, nor the Scriptures; and ſo it is ordinary with them to bring the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens words in that which they prepare for them, and ſtir them up; and this is quite contrary to Chriſt and the Apoſtles practice.</p>
            <p>It is true, Chriſt took the Book when it was delivered unto him, and he opened and lookt upon it, and found a place where it was written in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 61. 1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor; he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of ſight to the blind, and ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed to preach the acceptable year of the Lord: and he cloſed the Book, and gave it again to the Miniſter, and ſate down; and he began to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears: And all bear him witneſs, and wondred at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth. And they ſaid, Is not this Joſephs Son?</hi> Luke 4.</p>
            <p>Now this was he that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſied of, and therefore when he began to preach, he turned to this Scripture, to let them ſee that this Propheſie was fulfilled, and ſo cloſed the Book. But when he preached among them, and taught, as ye may read through all the Evangeliſts; as firſt, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and in <hi>Luke</hi> 6. He opened unto them the Law, and alſo told them, <hi>That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did break one of the leaſt Commandments, ſhould be called leaſt in the Kingdom.</hi> And taught the Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven. Think not that I come to deſtroy the Law, or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy but to fulfill. For verily I ſay unto you, till heaven and earth paſs, one jot, or one tittle, ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law till all be fulfilled. For I ſay unto you, except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> This was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his preaching and teaching: And ſo he goes on, and opens unto them the Law; and tells them it had been ſaid ſo in the old time; <hi>Ye have heard it hath been ſaid in the old time, thou ſhalt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear thy ſelf: But I ſay unto you, ſwear not at all. And it hath been ſaid unto you in the old time, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: but I ſay unto you, reſiſt not evil. He that ſmites thee on the one
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54902:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cheek, turn the other.</hi> And thus he goes on in opening of the Law, of which he was to fulfill every jot and tittle; and alſo opening un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the Myſteries of the Goſpel, which is Love even to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is the fulfilling of the whole Law.</hi> And he told them, that ſo they might <hi>be the Children of their Father which is in heaven; for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good; and ſends Rain on the juſt, and on the unjuſt. Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the perfect Miniſtry indeed, of the true Circumciſion, which makes the true Jew indeed inward, which circumciſeth the heart with his holy Spirit. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Now I ſay unto you, that Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion, for the truth of God; to confirm the Promiſes unto Abraham: and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, and ſo the bleſſing of Abraham may be upon all, Jews and Gentiles: All that are in the Faith, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</hi> And this is he of whom the Apoſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have ſuch an High Prieſt, who is ſet on the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in Heaven: a Miniſter of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man,</hi> Heb. 8.</p>
            <p>And as he was a Miniſter of the ſame Sanctuary which God hath pitched, ſo alſo were his Apoſtles, they preached by his holy Spirit. <hi>For as God is true</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle) <hi>ſo our word to you-wards was not yea, and nay; for the Son of God, Jeſus Chriſt, who was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among you by us, even by me, and Sylvanus, and Timotheus, was not yea, and nay; but in him was yea: for all the Promiſes of God, are in him Yea, and in him, Amen;</hi> 2 Cor. 1.</p>
            <p>And by this Spirit and Power of the Lord Jeſus, did <hi>Steven,</hi> who was full of Faith and Power, do great wonders and miracles among the People; and when the falſe witneſſes came to accuſe him before the high Prieſt, and thoſe that ſate in Council, looking ſtedfaſtly on him, ſaw his face as it had been the face of an Angel: <hi>Then ſaid the high Prieſt, Are theſe things ſo? And he ſaid, Men, Brethren, and Fathers, hearken:</hi> And he began at <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he opened unto them the Royal and Holy Seed, throughout the Scriptures, until he came to Chriſt Jeſus, whom he ſaid they had crucified and ſlain. And he ſaid, <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked, and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye do alwayes reſiſt the holy Ghoſt; as your Fathers did, ſo do ye: Which of the Prophets have not your Fathers Perſecuted? and they have ſlain
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54902:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them which ſhewed before of the coming of the Juſt One of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers. When they heard theſe things, they were cut to the heart, and gnaſhed on him with their teeth: but he being full of the holy Ghoſt, looked ſtedfaſtly into heaven, and ſaw the glory of God; and he ſaid, Behold, I ſee heaven open, and the Son of man ſtanding on the right hand of God. And they cryed with a loud voice, and ſtopt their ears, and ran upon him, and caſt him out of the City, and ſtoned him: and they ſtoned</hi> Steven, <hi>calling upon God, and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit,</hi> Acts 7.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> when he came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and went into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue on the Sabbath day; after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the Rulers of the Synagogue ſent to him and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſaid, <hi>Men and Brethren, if ye have any exhortation to the People, ſay on. Then</hi> Paul <hi>ſtood up, and beckoned with his hand, and ſaid; Men of Iſrael, and ye that fear God, give audience.</hi> And he began to declare, how God brought their Fathers out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with a high hand; and how they were in the Wilderneſs; and how he deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Nations of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and how they were govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from that time unto Chriſt; and how that Chriſt care of the Seed of <hi>David;</hi> and likewiſe how the Rulers of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> dealt with Chriſt, and though they found no cauſe of death in him; yet deſired they <hi>Pilate</hi> that he ſhould be ſlain. And when they had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all that was written of him, they took him down from the Tree, and laid him in a Sepulchre; but God raiſed him from the dead, and afterwards he preached unto them his Reſurrection; as may be read at large throughout <hi>Acts</hi> 13. and how the Gentiles alſo ſhould partake of his-Reſurrection; but the Jews contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and blaſphemed againſt their Doctrine. Then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> waxed bold, and ſaid, <hi>It was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been preached to you Jews; but ſeeing ye put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, loe we turn unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, for ſo hath the Lord commanded us: I have ſet thee to be a light to the Gentiles, that thou ſhouldeſt be for ſalvation to the ends of the earth. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad,</hi> Acts 13.</p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee how the Apoſtles opened unto them the myſtery of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, as alſo Chriſt himſelf, when he met with the Diſciples, after his Reſurrection; and they not knowing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54902:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him, told him what things had happened concerning Chriſt. He ſaid unto them, <hi>O fools, and ſlow of heart; ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory. And beginning at Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf,</hi> Luke 24.</p>
            <p>And this is the matter, and manner, and method of all Chriſt's Miniſters, to preach the Reſurrection of Chriſt Jeſus, in his Light and Spirit, which is a myſtery to all carnal men and carnal minds: and this is not a deal of Imaginations, and divinations of the brain, and ſtudyings of men, who take one Verſe of Scripture, and add un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it what they pleaſe, out of other old Authors Writings, Heathen Philoſophers, or any thing that will make up an hours talk, till their Glaſs be run, which is quite contrary to the Apoſtles practice, and that which they witneſſed, and exhorted againſt. For he ſaith unto the <hi>Coloſſians, As ye have received Chriſt Jeſus, ſo walk ye in him; rooted and built in him, eſtabliſhed in the Faith, as ye have been taught. Beware leſt any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy, and vain deceit, after the Traditions of men, after the Rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2. Here is an expreſs command laid upon them, that they ſhould not be deceived by the teachings of men, who taught not after Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith alſo, that Chriſt ſent him, not to preach the Goſpel with wiſdom of words; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>It is written, I will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the prudent. Where is the Wiſe? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Diſputer of this world? Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world? For after that in the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God; it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching, to ſave them that believe. For the Jews require a ſign, and the Greeks ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wiſdom, but we preach Chriſt crucified, unto the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and unto the Greeks fooliſhneſs; but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God: Becauſe the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then men, and the weakneſs of God ſtronger then men: For ye ſee your calling, Brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called; but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe; and God hath choſen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty; and baſe-things of the world, and things which are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54902:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea and things which are not, to bring to nought things which are; that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence; but thoſe that glory, ſhould glory in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith further, <hi>And my ſpeech and preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power; that your Faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God. Howbeit, we ſpeak wiſdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wiſdom of this world, nor of the Princes of this world, that come to nought, but we ſpeak the wiſdom of God in a myſtery; even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the world. For we have not received the Spirit of the world, but that Spirit that is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God; which things we ſpeak not in the words which mans wiſdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghoſt teacheth; comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle teſtifies clearly againſt the wiſdom of mens teaching, which is a clear teſtimony againſt the teachings that have been in theſe laſt Ages; for that is all that hath been taught for many generations of Teachers, ſince the Apoſtles dayes; the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of men, and traditions of men, and inventions, and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, one quoting and rehearſing what another ſaith, quite contrary to the Apoſtles practice. We do not make our ſelves of the number, or compare our ſelves with ſome that commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and meaſuring themſelves by themſelves are not wiſe. But we will not boaſt our ſelves, above our meaſure, but according to the meaſure of the rule which God hath diſtributed to us; for we come as far as you alſo, in preaching the Goſpel of Chriſt, not boaſting of things without our meaſure, of other mens labours, nor to boaſt of another mans line made ready to our hands, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God; who hath alſo made us able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter but of the Spirit; for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. In this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtle gives his Teſtimony, that the Life of the Miniſtry is in the miniſtration of the Spirit. As alſo in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>But now we are delivered from the Law; that being dead wherein we were held, that we ſhould ſerve in newneſs of Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> which he calls, the <hi>Miniſtration of Death,</hi> in the afore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54902:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And when he writes to his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was a Biſhop, he ſaith thus; <hi>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead, at his appearing, and his kingdom; Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering and doctrine: for the time will come when they will not endure ſound doctrine; but after their own hearts lusts, ſhall heap to themſelves teachers, having itching ears, and they ſhall turn away their ears from the Truth, and ſhall be turned unto Fables,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.</p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle was a true Prophet, and ſaw the Apoſtacy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and therefore he laid a hard charge upon <hi>Timothy: For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>watch thou in all things; endure afflictions; do the work of an Evangeliſt; make full proof of thy Miniſtry; for I am ready to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the time of my departure draweth nigh,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.</p>
            <p>As alſo when he writes to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> of the Day of the Lord, and of the Man of Sin, the Son of Perdition, and thanks God for them, who had choſen them to Salvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth, <hi>whereunto he called you,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by our Goſpel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Therefore brethren, ſtand faſt, and hold the Traditions which ye have been taught, whether by Word, or our Epiſtle,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.</p>
            <p>This Scripture the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and many others, make a Cloak and a Covering for teaching their Traditions; becauſe the Apoſtle bids them hold faſt the Traditions that they had taught them, by their Goſpel; which in the words before, he ſaith, was to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the which they had good reaſon to hold faſt; for if they let that go, they were not like to attain to ſuch another. But there is no compariſon between theſe, and the Traditions of the Prieſts in the Apoſtacy, either <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> or others; for through their teaching of their Traditions, they have done nothing but brought people into a body of darkneſs, and into a heap of ignorance, keeping them ignorant both of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and all that is good. For if people had but liberty to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scriptures, they would ſoon be wiſer then their Teachers, and ſee their groſs darkneſs: But they tell them, they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, they muſt be expounded by learned men; and ſo will not let the Light of Chriſt ariſe in Peoples hearts, nor never direct their minds to it, but keep them in darkneſs, and make a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54902:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Trade of the Scriptures for their own advantage, and ſo deceive poor peoples ſouls. And theſe Scriptures may ſerve to prove this Particular of the fourth Head, which is concerning their Worſhip, which is, their matter and manner of Preaching.</p>
            <p>The ſecond particular of that head is their <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is alſo contrary to Scripture-example, they having Prayars formed and made by men as all their other Worſhip is, and ſo read their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Books; and ſet any fellow or ſchool-boy to read it, if he have but the name of Curate or Clark, if he read but that in the Book, they account it Praying: And if any of the greater ſort, as Biſhops, Deans, Vicars, or Parſons, if they pray, they either pray in a Book, or elſe they have a Prayer formed up, and made and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared before hand, that they pray: And many times they ſet wild and wanton Boyes, with Prieſt, and Clark, and all the People to ſing their Prayers: and this they account and call Praying.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt Jeſus was in his Sermon in the Mount, that he was teaching the People ſeveral things, (as was ſaid before) as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Alms, and many other particulars, in which he bad them not to do as the Phariſees did; he alſo ſpake to them that they ſhould not pray as they did, for they prayed ſtanding in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues: And ſaith he, <hi>When ye pray, uſe not vain repetitions as the heathens do; Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what things ye have need of, before ye ask. After this manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray ye: Our Father, which art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them ſeveral particular heads, what they ſhould pray for, and after he had done that, he rehearſeth theſe words again; <hi>If ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your treſpaſſes,</hi> Mat. 6. And again he ſaith unto one of his Diſciples, who deſired him to teach them to pray, He ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>When ye ſtand praying, forgive, if ye have ought againſt any, that your Father alſo which is in heaven, may forgive you your treſpaſſes: but if you do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your treſpaſſes,</hi> Mark 11. 25.</p>
            <p>Now how the Biſhops, and all their Officers which they imploy under them, forgive thoſe that treſpaſs againſt them, is manifeſted by their Courts they keep; as alſo all the Papiſts, Biſhops, Prieſts and Jeſuites, that make this Prayer be ſaid over ſo often by their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54902:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
People, how they forgive thoſe that treſpaſs againſt them, is alſo manifeſted by their Inquiſitions, Wracks and Tortures; and yet this Prayer they make their ground for all their Forms, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of prayers, which is quite contrary to the Apoſtle's practice and doctrine; for he ſaith, <hi>We are ſaved by hope; but hope that is ſeen, that is not hope, but if we hope for that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it. Likewiſe the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered; and he that ſearcheth the heart, knoweth the mind of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints, according to the Will of God,</hi> Rom. 8.</p>
            <p>And this Spirit is he that knows the minde of Chriſt, and the will of God, and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with underſtanding alſo,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. <hi>For the Spirit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God; for what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man that is in him; even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, ſave the Spirit of God: for the natural man knoweth not the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs to him, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> So how can theſe natural men, that read a Prayer in a Book, pray unto God, that know not the things of God? and what effect can ſuch Prayers have? Indeed <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Righteous avail much, if they be fervent:</hi> But can their Prayers avail that are unrighteous, and know not the things of God, neither have any fervency in them?</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We know the mind of Chriſt:</hi> and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Be kindly affectioned one towards another, with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another, not ſlothful in buſineſs, fervent in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſerving the Lord: Rejoycing in hope, patient in tribulation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing inſtant in Prayer,</hi> Rom. 12. 12. And again, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God: if any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God: if any man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth; that God in all things may be glorified,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.</p>
            <p>So here is a great difference between this ſort of praying that the Apoſtle here mentions, and that which is called the Common-Prayer;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54902:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which indeed is common, and may be common to any that have eyes and can read it; as alſo all the <hi>Paternoſters,</hi> and <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> of the Papiſts, though they call that which Chriſt taught his Diſciples the <hi>Paternoſter,</hi> but he did not call it ſo; though they <hi>patter</hi> it over, and teach all People to <hi>patter</hi> it over, but he did not ſo with thoſe he taught it, but he told them they ſhould not uſe vain Repetitions, nor vain bablings; and he taught them in the holy Spirit of the Lord, and ſo directed them that they might learn it in that Spirit, or elſe he would not have learned them to have prayed, <hi>That the Will of God might be done on Earth, as it was in Heaven.</hi> Vain-bablers and Patterers over of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words, do not the Will of God on Earth as it is in Heaven, but this Prayer is abuſed by them all, as many other places of Scripture are. And this may ſerve for the ſecond particular of their Worſhip which is <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is their Singing, which indeed is more like may-game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then worſhipping of God, playing and piping of Organs, and ſetting a company of wilde, ungodly, light boyes to ſing tunes to to them, which is ſuch a kind of Worſhip, as no Chriſtians in the Primitive times exerciſed.</p>
            <p>Its true, there was in <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes, ſuch as were appointed to miniſter in way of ſinging and giving thanks, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> when he had brought the Ark of God and ſet it in the midſt of his Tent, which he had made for it, he offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God; and he appointed certain of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites to miniſter before the Ark of the Lord, and to record, thank and praiſe the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael. Aſaph</hi> the chief, and next to him <hi>Zachariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattathiah, Eliah, Benaiah, and Obed-Edom,</hi> 1 Chron. 15. 16, and 27. and <hi>Jehiel,</hi> with Pſalteries and with Harps; but <hi>Aſaph</hi> made a ſound with Cimbals, <hi>Benaiah</hi> and alſo <hi>Eliezer</hi> the Prieſts with Trumpets, continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ark of the Covenant of God. Then on that day <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered firſt this Pſalm, to thank the Lord, into the hands of <hi>Aſaph</hi> and his brethren, who were the Singers. <hi>Give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his Name,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 105. This was upon a ſpecial occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when the Ark of God was brought up among them: And theſe that <hi>David</hi> committed this Pſalm unto, were ſuch as were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God for that Place and Office, as <hi>Aſaph,</hi> and thoſe that were called to that office.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:54902:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Alſo <hi>Solomen</hi> had Singing-men, and Singing-women, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 8. and them of this order came with them again out of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in <hi>Babylon, Ezra</hi> 2. 41. <hi>Neh.</hi> 7. 67.</p>
            <p>But theſe were all before Chriſt; and why may not Chriſtians as well imitate Circumciſion, Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices, which were in the time of the Law, as well as imitate Singing-Boyes? And we do not find that any of the Apoſtles and Saints in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times did Sing <hi>David</hi> Pſalms in Meeter and Rhime, and turn his Lamentations, and Groanings, and Sufferings, and Tears, and Anguiſh of his Bones, being burned like a Hearth, and that he was as a <hi>Pelican</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and like an <hi>Owl</hi> in the Deſart; when he cryed out, that his heart was ſmitten and withered, and his Prayers and Cries, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.</p>
            <p>We do not find that the Apoſtles turned this ſtate of weeping and lamentation of his into Rhime and Meeter, and ſang it: But Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and Chriſtians and Saints, when they ſung, they ſang with the Spirit in prayſes to the Lord, and in the joy and rejoycing of the Spirit. This was not to take another mans Sighs, and Groanings, and Lamentations, and Tears, and Cryes to turn this into a Song and ſing it: This is not the Truth, neither is it the practice of the Spirit of Truth. But when the Soul and the Spirit is joyful in the Lord, and enjoyes his Preſence, and feels his Life; then there is joy, and honour, and praiſes given to the Lord God in the Truth and in the Reality, in his own Spirit, and this glory and praiſes are acceptable to the Lord God: And therefore doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>I will Pray with the Spirit, and with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alſo: I will Sing with the Spirit, and with the Underſtanding alſo,</hi> 2 Cor. 14. Yet the Apoſtle did not turn his praying into ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor none that have the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus to pray and ſing with; but when they pray they pray unto the Lord, and when they ſing they ſing unto the Lord, yet both by his own holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt Jeſus and his Diſciples were at the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and that he had broken the Bread, and given them the Cup of the New Teſtament, he ſaid unto them, <hi>I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine, until the day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God. And when they had ſung an Hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives,</hi> Mar. 14. 26.</p>
            <p>And according to this, the Apoſtle in his Exhortation to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54902:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Epheſians,</hi> among many other particulars, he ſaith, <hi>Be not drunk with Wine wherein is exceſs: but be filled with the Spirit, ſpeaking to your ſelves in Pſalms and Hymns and ſpiritual Songs, ſinging and making melody in your hearts to the Lord; giving thanks alwayes for all things unto God the Father, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>And again in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Let the Word of Chriſt dwell richly in you in all wiſdom, teaching and admoniſhing one another, in Pſalms, and Hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> Likwiſe the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Is any among you afflicted? let him pray; is any merry? let him ſing Pſalms,</hi> Jam. 5.</p>
            <p>But he ſaith not ſing thoſe Pſalms which <hi>David</hi> ſung, but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſung in the Spirit, with grace in their hearts, as before; and ſaid, thoſe that do glory and rejoyce, let them do it in the Lord; and in ſo doing, they may worſhip and give thanks unto the Lord in rejoycing and ſinging, as well as in other parts of worſhip, in the Spirit of the Lord God: But theſe are not wild, wicked, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly people and boyes, who are imployed in this ſervice in our dayes; but the Lords holy Spirit, where it dwels, and rules, and lives, is the ſame as ever it was, and can worſhrp the Father in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in Truth; who is a Spirit, and his Worſhip is in his own Spirit; and this Spirit ſpeaking, or praying, or ſinging, worſhips him.</p>
            <p>More might be ſaid concerning their Altars, and bowing, and cringing to Stocks and Stones, and calling Wood and Stones ſet together by mens hands, and adorned with Inventions, <hi>A Church;</hi> but all this traſh and rubbiſh will fall together. Since that Temple that <hi>Solomon</hi> built, which God commanded, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>ſhould not be left one ſtone upon another</hi> of its building, but it ſhould be all thrown down; ſurely theſe Popiſh Houſes have no long reign.

               </gap>ody of Teachers and Preachers, who have called themſelves Chriſtians, both Papiſts and Proteſtants, in this Night of Apoſtacy, that the True Church of God hath been in the Wilderneſs, and the Witneſſes propheſied in Sackcloth; this hath been a Night of Darkneſs, but the Day is Springing, Glory to the Lord for ever; I ſay, for this Seeds ſake, we ſhall proceed to mention ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Heads of their practice, and try them by the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And the firſt is that which they call their Studying, and their placing the very Foundation of their Call, and all their practices in that Function, in that which they call Learning; which thing we never finde neither in the Old-Teſtament nor New, that they who were called to the Office of the Prieſthood, that obtained it by ſuch wayes and means as they uſe; <hi>viz.</hi> That which they call their Studies and Fountains of Learning, which is their <hi>Univerſities;</hi> and in them, ſo many ſeveral Orders and Degrees, to ordain and appoint ſuch as belong to that Function of the Miniſtry, which we do not finde in the Old-Teſtament, that either <hi>Aaron</hi> or his Sons, or thoſe that were of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> were ordained after ſuch a manner, and by ſuch Orders as they pretend to theirs; for when the Lord ſpake unto <hi>Moſes</hi> for the ſetting up of the Tabernacle, and after what manner he ſhould do all things about it; he ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſet the Laver betwixt the Tent of the Congregation and the Altar, and thou ſhalt put water therein, and thou ſhalt bring</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and waſh them with water; and thou ſhalt put upon</hi> Aaron <hi>the holy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and anoint him, and ſanctifie him, that he may miniſter unto me in the Prieſts Office; and thou ſhalt bring his Sons and cloath them with coats, and thou ſhalt anoint them as thou didſt their Father, that they may miniſter unto me in the Prieſts Office; for their Anointing ſhall ſurely be an everlaſting Prieſthood throughout their Generations: Thus did</hi> Moſes <hi>according to all that the Lord commanded him, for he ſet the Laver between the Tent of the Congregation and the Altar, and</hi> Moſes, <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons, waſhed their hands and their feet thereat, as the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes. Exod. 28, 29. <hi>chap.</hi> Levit. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>Take the Levites from among the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and cleanſe them, and thus ſhalt thou do unto

them to cleanſe them; ſprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them ſhave them, all their fleſh, and let them waſh their clothes, and ſo make them clean; then let them take a young Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, with his meat offering, even fine Flowre mingled with Oyle; and another young Bullock thou ſhalt take, for a ſin offering; and thou ſhalt bring the Levites before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou ſhalt gather the whole Aſſembly of the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>together, and thou ſhalt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall put their hands upon the Levites, and</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall offer the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites before the Lord, for an offering for the children of Iſrael, that they may execute the ſervice of the Lord; and the Levites ſhall lay their hands upon the heads of the Bullocks, and thou ſhalt offer the one for a ſin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering unto the Lord, to make an atonement for the Levites; and ſhalt ſet the Levites before</hi> Aaron, <hi>and before his Sons, and offer them for an offering to the Lord; thus ſhalt thou ſeparate the Levites from among the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Levites ſhall be mine; and after that ſhall the Levites go in, to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou ſhalt cleanſe them, and offer them for an offering; for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>inſtead of ſuch as open every womb, even inſtead of the Firſt-born of all the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I have taken them unto me; for all the firſt-born of the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>are mine, both man and beaſt, in the day that I ſmote the firſt-born in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>I ſanctified them for my ſelf, and I have taken the Levites for all the firſt-born of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and I have given the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites as a gift to</hi> Aaron, <hi>and to his Sons, from among the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to do the ſervice of the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to make an atonement for the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that there be no plague among</hi>

               <hi>them, when they come nigh my Sanctuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>and the Congregati- of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>did unto the Levites, according as the Lord commanded them; and the Levites were Purified, and they waſhed their Garments, and</hi> Aaron <hi>offered them as an offering before the Lord, and</hi> Aaron <hi>made an atonement for them, to cleanſe them, and after that the Levites went in to do their ſervice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before</hi> Aaron, <hi>and before his Sons: And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſaying, This is it that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

to the Levites, from twenty years old and upwards, they ſhall go in to wait upon the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and from the age of fifty years they ſhall ceaſe waiting upon the ſervice thereof, and ſhall ſerve no more; but ſhall miniſter with their brethen in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to keep the charge, and ſhall do no ſervice; thus ſhalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.</hi> Numb. 8.</p>
            <p>Now here is nothing of Studying, or going to the Univerſities, nor diving, nor divinining into the Body of Darkneſs, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files and polutes; but here was Waſhing, and Cleanſing, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, and an Offering of two Bullocks, one for a Sin-offering, another for a Burnt-offering, the Levites being offered with the Offerings, and they laying their hands upon the heads of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and <hi>Moſes</hi> making an Atonement for them, to Cleanſe them, before they could be admitted into the Service; and then they were to wait from twenty five years, and upwards unto fifty years, before they might ceaſe waiting, and then they were to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter with their Brethren in the Tabernacle; but they did not wait at the Univerſities, and at the Schools of Learning, but they waited upon the Service of the Tabernacle of the Congregation; for the Lord had called them for that end, that they might make an Atonement for the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that there might be no Plague among them.</p>
            <p>So that it is ſtrange that Miniſters that profeſs Chriſtianity, and profeſs themſelves to be Miniſters of Chriſt, and Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſhould run into ſuch extravagances, being that they profeſs the Scriptures, and that they ſhould not walk in by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths; but they go quite oppoſite to what the Scriptures of Truth hold forth concerning both the Firſt and Second Prieſthood. It is true indeed, the Lord complaineth by his Prophets, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was gone away from the Lord, and turned unto Idolatry and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and was in Rebellion againſt him, then he complains of their Teachers, <hi>That they ſpeak a Divination of their own Brain, and not from the Mouth of the Lord;</hi> But the Lord ſaith, <hi>That he will fruſtrate the Tokens of the Lyars, and make the Diviners mad, and turn the Wiſe men backward, and make their knowledge fooliſh.</hi> Iſa. 44.</p>
            <p>And again he complains of the Blind Watchmen, and ſaid, <hi>They are all Ignorant, they are all dumb Dogs, they cannot bark, ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54902:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lying down to ſlumber; yea, they are greedy Dogs, which can never have enough; and they are Shepherds that cannot underſtand, they all look to their own way, every one for his Gain from his Quarter: Come ye, ſay they, and I will fetch Wine, and we will fill our ſelves with Strong-drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> Iſa. 56.</p>
            <p>Again, the Lord complains of them by his Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiahs heart was broken within him becauſe of the Prophets, and his bones did ſhake like a drunken man, becauſe of the Lord, and the word of his Holineſs: For the Land,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is full of adulteries, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſwearing the Land mourneth: for Prophet and Prieſt are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; yea, in my houſe have I found their wickedneſs, ſaith the Lord. Wherefore their wayes ſhall be unto them as ſlippery wayes, in the darkneſs they ſhall be driven on, and fall therein; I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their viſitation, ſaith the Lord. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Hearken not unto the words of the Prophets that propheſie unto you; thy make you vain, they ſpeak a Viſion of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. They ſay ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that deſpiſe me, The Lord hath ſaid, ye ſhall have peace: and they ſay unto every one that walketh after the Imaginations of his own heart, No evil ſhall come upon you. But behold, the whirlwind of the Lord is come forth in fury, and it ſhall fall grievouſly upon the head of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the anger of the Lord ſhall not return, till he have executed, and till he hath performed the thoughts of his heart. In the latter dayes he ſhall conſider it perfectly. I have not ſent theſe Prophets, I have not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto them, yet they propheſied. I heard when the Prophet ſaid, that propheſied lies in my name, which cauſe my people to forget my name, as their Fathers have forgotten my name for</hi> Baal. <hi>Is not my word like a fire ſaith the Lord and like a hammer, that breaketh the rocks in pieces? therefore behold, I am againſt the Prophets, ſaith the Lord, that ſteal my words every one from his neighbour: behold, I am againſt the Prophets, ſaith the Lord, that uſe their tongues, and ſay, He ſaith; behold, I am againſt them that propheſie falſe dreams, and tell them, and cauſe my people to erre through their lies, and by their lightneſs; and yet I ſent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they ſhall not profit my people at all ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23.</p>
            <p>And again the Lord ſaid unto me, <hi>The Prophets propheſie lies in my name. I ſent them not neither commanded I them, neither ſpake I unto them: yet they propheſied unto you a falſe Viſion, and a divination, and a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54902:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart,</hi> Chap. 14. <hi>Therefore hearken not ye to your Prophets, nor to your Diviners, nor to your Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor to your Sorcerers: for I have not ſent them, yet they propheſie a lye in my name; that I might drive you out, and ye might periſh,</hi> Jer. 27. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, Let not your Prophets, nor your Diviners, that be in the midſt of you, deceive you, for they propheſie falſly unto you; I have not ſent them, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 29</p>
            <p>And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith, <hi>Her Prophets have daubed them with untempred morter; ſeeing vanity, divining lies unto them, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, when the Lord hath not ſpoken,</hi> Ezek. 22. 28.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Idols have ſpoken vanity, and Diviners have ſeen a lye, and have told falſe dreams, and have comforted in vain,</hi> Zech. 10. 2.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Then ſhall the Seers be aſhamed, and Diviners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; yea, they ſhall all cover their lips; for there is no anſwer from God,</hi> Micah. 3. 7.</p>
            <p>After the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> were fallen away from the Lord God, and from his Worſhip and Service, into Idolatry, and worſhiping of <hi>Baal,</hi> then their Prieſts, and Prophets, and Teachers fell to divining, and enchanting in the power of darkneſs, and fell into all manner of wickedneſs, and groſneſs, and prophaneſs, and drunkeneſs, in ſo much that the Lord complaineth of their drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wine in bowles; Ye that put far the evil day, and cauſe the ſeat of violence to come near; that lie upon the beds of Ivory, and ſtretch themſelves upon the Couches; and eat the Lambs out of the Flock, and the Calves out of the midſt of the Stall; that chant to the ſound of the Vial, and invent to themſelves Inſtruments of Muſick like <hi>David;</hi> that drink wine in Bowls, and anoint themſelves with the chief oyntment; but they are not grieved at the afflictions of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph;</hi> therefore they ſhall go into captivity with the firſt, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Surely the Diviners and Inchanters of theſe laſt dayes, in this night of Apoſtacy, in which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaid <hi>that Antichriſt ſhould come,</hi> have taken example by theſe falſe Prophets and falſe Teachers, that were fallen away from the Lord, and from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of his Law, that he gave out to thoſe that were to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at the Altar, and were to miniſter in the Prieſts Office: when they were fallen away into Idolatry, they then fell into Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and digging and diving into the darkneſs and imagination of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54902:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their wicked hearts, and ſo ſpake falſe Viſions, and falſe Dreams, and falſe Propheſies, and ſaid, <hi>the Lord ſaith,</hi> when the Lord had never ſpoken to them. So it hath been with our profeſſed Chriſtian Miniſters, in this time of Apoſtacy, ſince the Apoſtles dayes; they read the Prophets words and ſaid, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord;</hi> and they read Chriſt's words, and the holy Apoſtles words, who worſhiped the only true God, and ſpake in and by his holy Spirit: And they themſelves will confeſs the Lord never ſpake unto them, neither do they ever expect to know revelation, nor hear the voice of God, as the Apoſtle did; for they have preached to all people, that that is ceaſed.</p>
            <p>And though it is true, that it hath been ceaſed among them, in their dark night of Apoſtacy, yet the holy Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which ſpake in him, and in all his holy Apoſtles, <hi>is alive, and lives for evermore; which he ſent and ſignified by his ſervant John,</hi> Rev. 1. <hi>Who bare record of the Word of God, and the Teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and of all things that he ſaw.</hi> Who, <hi>when he ſaw him, fell at his feet, as dead; and he laid his right hand upon him, ſaying, Fear not; I am the firſt and the laſt; I am he that liveth and was dead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am alive for evermore, and have the keyes of hell and death. Write the things which thou haſt ſeen, and the things which are, and the things which ſhall be hereafter.</hi> And this Revelation which <hi>John</hi> ſaw of Jeſus Chriſt, will as ſurely be fulfilled, as all the other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that propheſied formerly of his coming in the fleſh; who in the fulneſs of time came and fulfilled all that was written of him: ſo certainly will he come and fulfil the Revelations that have been of him. And of his power and great glory, and of his coming in his Spirit, and in his <hi>Revelation</hi> by which he reveals the Father, as he ſaid himſelf in the days of his fleſh, <hi>Hereafter I will not ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you in Proverbs, but I will ſhew plainly of the Father,</hi> John 17. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.</hi> And this hath the Lord fulfilled, and will fulfill in his day and time appointed; <hi>For the times and ſeaſons are in the Fathers hand,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the night-owls, who have been in the darkneſs, have ſtriven always to put this Light out, when it would have ſhined in their time, which was dark.</p>
            <p>And therefore have they ſtriven together, and combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make their Mountain ſtrong, and ſet up Schooles of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54902:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as they call them; and educated youth up in that darkneſs, and kept them ſtudying and divining in their braine, till many have ſtudied themſelves out of their wits; and ſo they might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Orders, and Ordinations, and Degrees, one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one below another, with ſuch a rabble as is not worth mentioning; and none might ſpeak, nor preach, nor read, no nor teach School, but ſuch as take Orders, or Degrees, or Licences from them: and all this rabble is quite contrary to Scripture-Rule and Example.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Apoſtle exhorted the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to ſtudy to be quiet, and to do their own buſineſs, and to work with their own hands, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 11. And wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to ſtudy to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to God, a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</p>
            <p>This was not ſtudying in the power of darkneſs, to be approved of men, to ſtudy all their dayes to invent an hours talk to pleaſe men, and ſo they take the Scriptures, and garniſh, and adorn, and flouriſh this dark muddy ſtuffe with it, and when they have done, ſell it for money; and ſo bear rule by the poor peoples means, and the poor people are kept ſo in darkneſs, and ignorance by them, that the people love to have it ſo. But, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>What will they do in the end thereof?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſurely the Lord is coming to gather his flock, according as he ſpake by his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which Propheſie is not yet fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for it was to the Jewes: <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, becauſe my flock is become a prey, and becauſe there is no Shepherd, neither did the Shepherds ſearch for my Flock, but they fed themſelves and not my Flock: Behold, I am againſt the Shepherds, I will require my Flock at their hands; neither ſhall the Shepherds feed themſelves any more: I will deliver my Flock from their mouthes: As a Shepherd ſeeketh out his Flock in the day that he is among his Sheep; ſo will I ſeek out my Sheep, and will deliver them,</hi> Ezek. 34. So the Lord will fulfill his faithful Word, which changeth not, however they promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves peace, till ſudden deſtruction come upon them.</p>
            <p>For ſo Chriſt ſaid, when he was in his fleſh, when he ſpake of the coming of the Son of Man in his power and great glory, be bad them watch, and told them, that the Son of Man would come as a thief in the night: and he told them if the good man of the houſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54902:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knew at what hour the thief would come, he would not have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his houſe to be robbed: and he ſaid, <hi>Bleſsed is that ſervant that when his Lord cometh, is found watching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that the Scriptures are utterly againſt the practiſes of thoſe that have been in the Miniſtry, and Teachers of People, ſince the Apoſtles dayes, in the Apoſtacy; for they have neither Preſident nor Example from the Miniſters of the Lord, neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law nor under the Goſpel, as we ſhall prove more fully hereafter. For when the Lord reproves <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and their Prieſts, and told them they had offered polluted bread upon his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and they had offered the blind for ſacrifice, and lame, and ſick: and that from the riſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame, his name was polluted; as ye may read at large in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1, 2. chap. He told them that he would corrupt their ſeed, and ſpread dung upon their faces, even the dung of their ſolemn feaſts: yet he told them, <hi>That his Covenant was with</hi> Levi, <hi>even of life and peace, and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me; the Law of truth was in his mouth, and Iniquity was not found in his lips; he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn away many from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; for the Preiſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth; for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts, but ye are turned away,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So theſe are none of the Prieſts of our dayes, that come from the Univerſities, and have their Orders and Degrees from thence, for they confeſs themſelves to be all polluted and filthy, from the Crown of the Head, to the Soal of the foot; and they tell people they muſt never be free from ſin and iniquity, nor they muſt never look for Revelations: So theſe are none of <hi>Levie's</hi> Tribe, for he turned many from iniquity, and the People were to ſeek the Law at his mouth; becauſe the Law of Truth was in his mouth.</p>
            <p>And ſo by what hath been ſpoken before concerning their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Miniſtry, as alſo their Principles what they hold; you ſee that they are none of Gods Miniſters under the Law, neither did any that were ordained of God to be Miniſters under the Law, attain to it by ſuch means, or in ſuch a manner as they have done to theirs, <hi>viz.</hi> by School-learning: Neither are they God's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters under the Goſpel; ſo that they are neither Gods Miniſters under the Law nor Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:54902:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As alſo Chriſt, thoſe that he choſe to be Miniſters, you may read what ſort of men they were. When he was on the Coaſt of <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Naphthali,</hi> he preached unto them Repentance. <hi>And as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was walking by the ſea of Galilee, he ſaw two brethren, Peter and Andrew, and he called them: They were caſting their nets into the ſea, for they were fiſhers; and he ſaith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fiſhers of men: And ſtraightway they followed him,</hi> Matth. 4. Mark 1. <hi>And when he had gone a little further thence, he ſaw James the ſon of Zebedee, and John his brother, who alſo were in a ſhip mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their nets, and ſtraightway he called them: And they left their Father in the ſhip with the ſervants, and went after him. Matthew</hi> was a Publican, <hi>Simon</hi> a Canaanite. Alſo when Chriſt ſent forth the ſeventy, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. there were no Univerſities provided for them; nor had they Ordinations, or Degrees from thence; but ye may read they had their Command and Commiſſion from him.</p>
            <p>And again when he had wrought the Miracle on the man that was ſick of the Palſie, <hi>As he paſſed from thence, he ſaw a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> Matthew, <hi>ſitting at the Receipt of Cuſtom, and he ſaid unto him, Follow me; and he aroſe and followed him,</hi> Matth. 9. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo.</hi> Jeſus <hi>when he was going forth into</hi> Galilee, <hi>findeth</hi> Philip, <hi>and ſaith unto him, Follow me;</hi> Philip <hi>findeth</hi> Nathaniel, <hi>and ſaith unto him, We have found him of whom</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Law, and in the Prophets did write,</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>the Son of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>Alſo two of</hi> Johns <hi>Diſciples, when they had heard him ſpeak, and looked upon him, followed</hi> Jeſus; <hi>and one of them which followed him was</hi> Andrew, Simon Peters <hi>brother, and he ſaith unto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, We have found the Meſſiah, which by interpretation is Chriſt,</hi> John 1.</p>
            <p>And thus they had the teſtimony of Chriſt Jeſus in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, through which they gave up all, and forſook all, and followed him; and he having all Power in Heaven and in Earth given unto him, gave them power and authority over all Spirits; inſomuch, that they ſaid, the Devils were ſubject unto them: And when they came unto him, and told him, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Rejoyce not that the Devils are ſubject unto you; but rather rejoyce that your Names are written in Heaven:</hi> and this was their Power, and the matter of their Joy, that they had their Teſtimony and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him, their Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54902:22"/>
So here was no Ordinations of men, nor Degrees taken from Univerſities; nor no Nurturing up in Schools of Learning, as hath been in theſe latter dayes; for this hath all been ſince this Power and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus hath been loſt, and gone from, and rebelled againſt, in this Night of Apoſtacy. Alſo after this, when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was called to be a Miniſter, he was called by Viſion, and by the Voice of God, and ſent forth by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Word and Power, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 16. and yet he confeſſed himſelf, that he was brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and taught according to the perfect Law of the Fathers, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 3. Yet he deſires his brethren, <hi>to beware of Dogs, beware of evil-workers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the Conciſion; for we are the Circumciſion, which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh; though I might alſo have a confidence in the fleſh: If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might truſt in the fleſh, I more. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But what things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt: Yea, doubtleſs I count all things but droſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord; for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him,</hi> Phil. 3.</p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle clears himſelf concerning his choice, and ſees the Vanity of all tranſitory Things; and this was a fit Miniſter of the Eternal Goſpel of Chriſt, who forſook and laid away all his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Knowledge, and Learning, and filthy Wiſdom, and only choſe the holy Spirit of the Lord God, the Croſs of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſaid <hi>he was crucified to the world, and the world to him;</hi> and this is quite contrary to the miniſtration of mens wiſdom before mentioned. And ſo this may ſuffice for the firſt particular of the Fifth Head, which is their Practice, to wit their way and means to attain to the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>The ſecond particular of the Practice, is the limiting and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of People unto their way and worſhip, by their Laws and Courts, which they call Eccleſiaſtical, with the ſeveral Degrees of Offices to get money from people, and to bring them into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and keep them in awe and continual trouble, in tying of them up to their Inventions and Laws, which they make for their own gain and advantage, not leaving poor people to the liberty of their Conſciences, and to the freedom of their Spirits, but binde
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54902:22"/>
them to ſuch things as pertain to their own advantage, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, and in this lord it over poor peoples Eſtates, Perſons, and Conſciences, and yet they call themſelves Goſpel-Miniſters, and in words profeſs Chriſt and Chriſtianity; but this is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the practice and example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; for thoſe that he ſent forth, <hi>into whatſoever City they went, they were to enquire who was worthy, and there to abide till they went thence. And when you come into one houſe, ſalute it; and if the houſe be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you; and whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that Houſe, or City, ſhake off the duſt of your feet,</hi> Matth. 10. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>And whoſoever ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, nor hear you, ſhake off the duſt under your feet, for a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt them; verily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tollerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Judgment, then for that City,</hi> Mark 6.</p>
            <p>And again, when he ſent out the Seventy, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Into whatſoever houſe ye</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The ſecond particular of their practice, is binding and limitting people to their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by citing them to their Courts.</note> 
               <hi>enter, firſt ſay, Peace be to this houſe; and if the Son of Peace be there, your peace ſhall reſt upon it; if not, it ſhall return to you again: But into whatſoever City ye enter, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you not, go your way into the ſtreets of the ſame, and ſay, Even the duſt of your City, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off againſt you; notwithſtanding, be ſure of this, that the Kingdom of God is come nigh unto you; but I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tollerable in the day of Judgment, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 10.</p>
            <p>And according to this Command of Chriſt, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who were ſeparated by the Holy Ghoſt for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, when they had preached the Goſpel among the Jews, and witneſſed forth Chriſt Jeſus, and his Sufferings, among the Jews who had Crucified him, and alſo preached him unto the Gentiles, and the Jews contradicting <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry; <hi>Then</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas <hi>waxed bold, and ſaid they would turn to the Gentiles; for, ſay they, ſo hath the Lood commanded us, ſaying, I will ſet thee for a Light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gentiles, that thou ſhouldeſt be my Salvation to the ends of the Earth: but when the Jews heard this, they ſtirred up the devout and honorable women, and chief men of the City, and raiſed perſecution
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54902:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>and expelled them out of their Coaſts; but they ſhoke of the duſt of their feet againſt them, and came unto</hi> Iconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>This was that which the Miniſters of Chriſt, that he ſent forth, were to do againſt thoſe that would not receive them; not to hale them to Courts, and puniſh their Bodies and Eſtates, and make them give them money, by their citing of them; if they did not believe in their Doctrine, they did not deliver them up to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate, to lay their Laws upon them, and to Whip them, and Scourge them, as the Chriſtians of theſe Ages have done, both Papiſts and Proteſtants; what they cannot do with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions and Biſhops Courts, they can deliver them up to the Civil Magiſtrates, to their Racks and Tortures, and Hanging, and Baniſhment, and Impriſonment to Death; and this is the way that the Chriſtians of theſe late Ages have uſed, with ſuch as did not believe in their Doctrine of Darkneſs, as many thouſands of Witneſſes might be inſtanced, that have born their Teſtimony againſt them, even to the loſs of their Lives and Blood; and in this they have been like unto the High-Prieſts, and Scribes, and Phariſees, and manifeſted themſelves to be of that Generation, which Chriſt pronounced woe upon, <hi>That upon them may come all the Righteous Blood ſhed upon the Earth, from the Blood of Righteous</hi> Abel. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>But this was not the way that Chriſt taught his Diſciples to do; for he ſaid unto them, <hi>It is impoſſible but that Offences ſhould come, but woe be to them by whom they come; it were better for him, that a Milſtone were hanged about his neck, and he caſt into the Sea, then that he ſhould offend one of theſe little ones. Take heed to your ſelves; if thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him; and if he treſpaſs againſt thee ſeven times in a day, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times in a day, and turn again unto thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him. And the Apoſtles ſaid unto the Lord, Increaſe our faith; and the Lord ſaid, If ye had faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, ye might ſay unto this Sycamore-tree, Be thou plucked up by the roots, and be thou planted into the Sea, and it ſhould be ſo,</hi> Luke 17. Here is the power of their Miniſtry, Planting and Watering in the Faith.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he ſaith, <hi>If thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54902:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and tell him his fault, between thee and him alone: if he will hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word may be eſtabliſhed; but if he ſhall neglect to hear them; tell it unto the Church; but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen man, and a Publican.</hi> Here is no citing to the Biſhops Court, though he was to be brought to the Church, it was but to inſtruct him, and exhort him, and to ſhew him his fault; and if he would not hear, let him be as an Heathen, or as a Publican; not to deliver him up to the Civil Magiſtrate, or to be caſt into Priſon all his dayes, or to be Tortured or Racked. And when <hi>Peter</hi> heard theſe Exhortations of Chriſt, he came unto his Maſter, and ſaid, <hi>Lord, how oft ſhall my brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him, till ſeven times? Jeſus ſaith unto him, I ſay not unto thee till ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times, but till ſeventy times ſeven; therefore the Kingdom of God is likened unto a certain King, which would take an account of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 18.</p>
            <p>I deſire the Maſters, and Upholders of the Courts and Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Racks and Tortures, Impriſoners and Perſecutors, to read the remaining part of this Chapter, and ſee whether they be not the men that have owed much unto the Lord, and ſinned and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt him, and had need to crave his Pacience and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, though they have been cruel with their Fellow-Servants, and have laid violent hands on them, and have taken them by the Throat, and ſaid, Pay me the Debt, and would not have Patience, but caſt into Priſon; ſo that the Lord may well ſay unto them, O ye wicked Servants, I forgave you becauſe ye deſired me, and ſhould not ye have compaſſion on your Fellow-Servants; ſurely the Lord is wrath for theſe things, and will deliver you unto the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.</p>
            <p>Here ye ſee, to uſe Violence and Cruelty, is abſolutely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Doctrine and Command of Chriſt, though ſome bring that Scripture where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Go into the High-wayes and Hedges, and Compel them to come in;</hi> this Chriſt ſpake when he was in the Houſe of one of the chief Phariſees to eat Bread, and he exhorted them in ſeveral particulars; one of them was, That when they made a Dinner, or a Supper, they ſhould not invite their Friends, Brethren, and Kindred, and Rich Neighbours; but when they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54902:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made a Feaſt they ſhould invite the poor, which could not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe them again: and when one of them that ſate at meat heard theſe gracious words that proceeded from him, he ſaid unto him, <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat bread in the Kingdom of God; and then he ſpake a Parable unto them, and ſaid, A certain man made a great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and invited many, who made excuſes and did not come;</hi> as you may read in this 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter of <hi>Luke.</hi> And therefore it was that he ſent into the High-wayes and Hedges, becauſe thoſe that were bidden, were not worthy to taſte of his Supper, neither went he about to compel them. And there were great multitudes with him, and he turned and ſaid unto them, <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Siſters, yea, and his own Life alſo; he cannot be my Diſciple. And whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs, and come after me, cannot be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Scripture they abuſe, and make it a cover for their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and cruelty; but what is their Supper or Dinner, that people can receive, when they have compelled them? Is it worthy of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking Father and Mother, Wife and Children, Houſe and Lands, and ones own Life? I trow not. But this is but like the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> when they came to Chriſt, and ſaid, <hi>Why did his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples tranſgreſs the tradition of the Elders? in eating with unwaſhen hands: But he anſwered and ſaid, Why do ye tranſgreſs the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God by your Traditions? In vain do they worſhip me teaching for Doctrine the Traditions of men, Matth.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>And this hath been the Doctrine of our Ages laſt paſt, the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, and Imaginations and Inventions of men: By this they have holden up the Superiority, according as the Apoſtle ſaith, having mens perſons in Admiration becauſe of advantage, and ſo have Lorded over God's Heritage; and ſo have kept his People under the weight of Oppreſſion, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> did; binding heavy burdens grievous to be born: But this is contrary to Chriſt and his Apoſtles Doctrine, and Example; as hath been ſhewed already.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he writeth his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthins,</hi> chap. 1. and relateth the ſufferings and hardſhips that they had paſſed through, how that they had the ſentence of death in themſelves; he ſaith, <hi>Now he which eſtabliſheth us with you
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54902:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in Chriſt, and hath anointed us in God, who hath alſo ſealed us, and given us the earneſt of his Spirit in our hearts; not that we have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over your Faith, but are helpers of your joy; for by Faith ye ſtand.</hi> Here the Apoſtle did not bind them, and limit them, nor called them to Courts, to keep them under oppreſſion and penalty in thoſe things that were contary to their Faith and Principles, this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Pauls</hi> practice; for when he called the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> unto him, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Ye know that from the firſt day that I came unto you, after what manner I have been with you at all ſeaſons, ſerving the Lord with all humility of mind; and with many tears and temptations which befel me, and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have ſhewed you, and have taught you publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from houſe to houſe; teſtifying both to Jews and Greeks, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And when he goes on mentioning his ſufferings, he ſaith, <hi>None of theſe things move me, neither count I my ſelf dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I may finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the Goſpel of the Grace of God; for I have not ſhunned to declare unto you the whole counſel of God. Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to the whole Flock of God, whereof the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers: and feed the Church of God, which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his own blood,</hi> Acts 20.</p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle gives them no Commiſſion to oppreſs or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage thoſe that they were Overſeers over, but to feed them, and to watch over them; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>after my departure ſhall grievous Wolves enter among you, not ſparing the Flock. Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things; therefore watch and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This hath been fulfilled and largly manifeſted; Wolves and Devourers have had a large time ſince that day. Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>The Elders which are among you I exhort, who am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an Elder, and a Witneſs of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and alſo a partaker of the glory that ſhall be revealed. Feed the Flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof, not by conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being Lords over Gods he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, but being examples to the Flock; and when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a Crown of glory that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. Here is a perfect Example and Rule for all the Overſeers of the Church of God.</p>

Moreover, when the Apoſtle writes unto his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That the end of the Commandment is Charity, out of a Pure Heart, and a good Conſcience, and Faith unfeigned;</hi> Alſo he exhorts him, <hi>Firſt of all that ſupplications, prayers, and interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for Kings, and for all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty;</hi> and ſo he goes on, exhorting this Biſhop; but never bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him ſet up Courts, nor be a Lord over Gods Heritage; for he ſaith, <hi>This is a true ſaying, If any man deſireth the Office of a Biſhop, he deſireth a good work; a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs, the Husband of one Wife, vigilant, ſober, of good behaviour, given to hoſpitality, apt to teach.</hi> I believe our Biſhops are wanting here, becauſe they Hire and Imploy ſo many petty Teachers under them; but he goes on, <hi>Not given to wine, no ſtriker, not greedy of filthy lucre, but patient, not a brawler, not covetons,</hi> (now our Laws and Courts ſignifie the contrary of this) <hi>not a Novice, leſt being lifted up with Pride, he fall into reproach, and the ſnare of the Devil; Moreover, he muſt have a good report of thoſe that are without, holding the myſtery of Faith in a pure Conſcience;</hi> So the Apoſtle goeth on, exhorting the Biſhops and Deacons, that they may know how to behave themſelves <hi>in the Houſe of God, which is the Church of the Living God, the Ground and Pillar of Truth.</hi> 1 Tim. 2, 3, chap.</p>
            <p>So he goes on, exhorting them what to Teach and Preach, and how to order the Church, in the 4th and 5th chapters, concerning the Elders, Elder-men, and Elder-women, Younger-men, and Younger-women; as alſo Servants; he directeth him how to go by way of Exhortation to them all; and ſaith, <hi>If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholſom words, even the Words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Doctrine which is according to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he is proud, knowing nothing, doting about Queſtions;</hi> So he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on, dehorting them from thoſe things: <hi>But thou, O man of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>flee theſe things, and follow after righteouſneſs, godlineſs, faith, love, and patience, meekneſs; fight the good fight of Faith, lay hold on Eternal Life, whereunto thou art called, and haſt profeſſed a good profeſſion before many Witneſſes: I give thee charge in the ſight of God, who quickneth all things, and before Chriſt Jeſus, who before</hi> Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate <hi>witneſſed a good confeſſion, that thou keep this Commandment without ſpot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jeſus

Chriſt;</hi> O Timothy, <hi>keep that which is committed unto thy Truſt,</hi> chap. 6.</p>
            <p>Here is a weighty, and a hard Charge laid upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> the then Biſhop and Overſeer of the Church; but here is nothing of making of Laws, and ſetting up Courts, and oppreſſing people, and keeping them in Bondage and Slavery; for when he writeth his Second Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>My dearly beloved Son, Grace, Mercy, and Peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt firſt in thy grandmother</hi> Lois, <hi>and thy mother</hi> Eunice, <hi>and I am perſwaded, that in thee alſo: Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, that thou ſtir up the Gift of God which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands; for God hath not given us the ſpirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a ſound minde: That good thing which was committed unto thee keep, by the Holy Ghoſt which dwelleth in us: This thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that all they which were in</hi> Aſia <hi>be turned away from me;</hi> yet he doth not bid him Arraign them, nor call them up to Courts, nor Cite them, nor Excommunicate them, nor caſt them into Priſon; but he exhorts him to <hi>be ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and he layeth down how he ſhould teach the people; and commit thoſe things he hath heard of him unto faithfull men; <hi>And thou therefore endure hardineſs, as good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt: And if a man alſo ſtrive for Mastery, yet he is not Crowned, except he ſtrive Lawfully. Conſider what I ſay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and the Lord give thee an Underſtanding in all things: Study to ſhew thy ſelf Approved unto God, a Workman that needeth not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth; but ſhun profane and vain bablings;</hi> and ſo he goes on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting him, ſaying, <hi>Flee alſo youthfull Luſts; but follow Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Faith, Charity, and Peace with them that call on the Lord out of a Pure Heart: But fooliſh and unlearned Queſtions avoid, knowing that they gender to Strife; and the Servant of the Lord muſt not Strive; but be Gentle unto all Men, apt to Teach, Patient; Inſtructing them that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth; and that they may recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the Snare of the Devil.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.</p>
            <p>This is contrary to the Striving and Contention, that hath been by our Biſhops and Deacons, that have profeſſed theſe Scriptures, both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> one Striving with Inquiſitions, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54902:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Racks, and Tortures; the other Striving and Terrifying poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with their Courts, and Chancellors, and Priſons, and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and Subordinate Officers not a few; inſomuch, that there hath been ſuch a Yoke of Bondage upon the Necks of the Poor and Innocent, that Grievous Groans have aſcended, under it, from them unto the Lord: But of this the Apoſtle was a true Prophet to his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> the then Biſhop and Overſeer of the Churches of God: <hi>This know alſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that in the Laſt Dayes perillous Times ſhall come: For men ſhall be Lovers of their own Selves, Covetous, Boasters, Proud, Blaſphemers, without natural Affection, Falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, Fierce, Deſpiſers of thoſe that are Good; Heady, High-minded, Lovers of Pleaſures more then Lovers of God, having a Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but denying the Power thereof.</hi> See here, Is not this fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? But the Apoſtle ſaith unto <hi>Timothy, From ſuch turn away; for of this ſort are they which creep into Houſes, and lead Captive ſilly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, laden with Sin, and divers Luſts, ever Learning, and never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hath not this been our State and Condition in all this Night of Apoſtacy? Have they not crept into Houſes, and called them Churches? And have kept people ever Learning, but they never brought them to the Knowledge of the True Church, nor of the True God. And the Apoſtle ſaith further unto him; <hi>But thou haſt known my Doctrine, manner of Life, Purpoſe, Faith, Long-Suffering, Patience, Charity; Continue thou in the things that thou haſt Learned, and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Preach the Word, be inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon, Reprove, Rebuke, with all Long-ſuffering and Doctrine:</hi> this is not to uſe Violence, nor Compel, as hath been uſed for many hundreds of years; but he biddeth him, <hi>Watch in all things, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Afflictions, do the Work of an Evangeliſt, make full proof of thy Miniſtry,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. this was not the full proof of Gain and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon poor Peoples Eſtates and Livelihoods, as hath been made of in theſe late Dayes; for if that be it, they have done it to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when he writes unto <hi>Titus,</hi> his own Son, he ſaith, <hi>For this cauſe left I thee at</hi> Crete, <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

thee: If any man be Blameleſs, the Husband of one Wife, having Faithfull Children, not accuſed of Riot, or Unruly: for a Biſhop muſt be Blameleſs, as the Steward of God; not Self-willed, not ſoon Angry, not given to Wine, no Striker, not given to Filthy Lucre; but a lover of Hoſpitality, a lover of Good Men, Sober, Juſt, Holy, Temperate, holding faſt the Faithfull Word, as he hath been taught, that he may be able by Sound Doctrine, both to exhort and convince the Gainſayers; for there are many unruly and vain Talkers, &amp;c.</hi> Tit. 1. <hi>But ſpeak thou the things that become Sound Doctrine:</hi> And ſo he directs him to exhort the Aged-men, and Aged-women; Young-men, and Young-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Servants, how they ought to walk in their Places, and Callings, <hi>that they might all Adorn the Doctrine of God: For the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appeared unto all men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>teaching us, that denying Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, we ſhould live Soberly, and Godly in this preſent World, looking for the bleſſed Hope, and glorious appearing of the Great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might Redeem us from all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and Purifie to himſelf a Peculiar People, Zealous of good Works: Theſe things ſpeak and exhort.</hi> it. 2.</p>
            <p>This is contrary to the Doctrine of the Biſhops and Teachers of our Dayes; for they do not turn people to the Grace of God that hath appeared to all men, that teacheth to deny Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts; but they ſay we muſt never be redeemed from Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, nor never be purged nor purified from Sin while we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; and then how can we be Peculiar and Zealous of good Works: for the worſt of People are but Sinners: but ſurely this which they Preach is another Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle goes on with his Exhortation to <hi>Titus,</hi> and bids him <hi>Put them in mind to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, and to obey Magiſtrates, and to ſpeak evil of no man, to be no Brawlers, but gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſhewing all Meekneſs unto all men: For we our ſelves,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were ſometimes Fooliſh, Diſobedient, ſerving divers Luſts and Pleaſures, living in Malice and Envy, Hatefull, and Hating one another: But after that the Kindneſs and Love of God our Saviour towards man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, not by Works of Righteouſneſs that we have done, but according to his Mercy he hath ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour. Theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54902:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they which have believed in God, might be carefull to maintain Good Works; theſe things are profitable unto men.</hi> Tit. 3.</p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee that theſe Biſhops <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> are far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent both in Doctrine, Practice, and Example, from the Biſhops that have been for ſeveral hundreds of years laſt paſt, the Night hath been upon them, and come over them, ſo that they have erred from the Faith and Doctine of the Apoſtles, neither have they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt. For <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was a Biſhop, was a man that the Apoſtle had much confidence in, and belief of, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth in ſeveral of his Epiſtles; for he ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in his Firſt Epiſtle; <hi>Though ye have ten thouſand Inſtructers in Chriſt, yet have ye not many Fathers; for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you through the Goſpel: Wherefore, I beſeech you, be ye Followers of me. For this cauſe I have ſent unto you</hi> Timotheus, <hi>who is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, and faithfull in the Lord, who ſhall bring you into remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my Wayes which be in Chriſt, as I teach every where in every Church.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.</p>
            <p>And again, when the Apoſtle Exhorteth the <hi>Philippians</hi> in his Epiſtle, <hi>To let nothing be done through Strife, or Vain-glory, but in lowlineſs of Mind, let each eſteem other better then themſelves. Look not every man to his own things, but every man alſo to the things of others:</hi> And ſo he goes on opening the Myſtery of the Sufferings of Chriſt; <hi>But,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I truſt in the Lord Jeſus to ſend</hi> Timotheus <hi>ſhortly unto you, that I alſo may be of good comfort when I know your State: for I have no man like-minded, who will naturally care for your State: for all ſeek their own, not the things that are Jeſus Chriſts; but ye know the proof of him, that as a Son with a Father, he hath ſerved me in the Goſpel, him therefore I ſend unto you, &amp;c.</hi> Phil. 2.</p>
            <p>And again, when he writeth to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>We ſent</hi> Timotheus <hi>our Brother and Minister of God, and our Fellow La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer in the Goſpel of Chriſt, to Establiſh you, and Comfort you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Faith,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 3.</p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee that this <hi>Timotheus,</hi> who was the Biſhop and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer of the Church of God in the Apoſtles dayes, was a Faithfull Labourer and Miniſter of Chriſt Jeſus, and much truſted in, and approved of by the Apoſtle; for he laboured with him in the Goſpel, as a Son laboureth with his Father. And it is ſtrange that the Biſhops that have been in theſe later Ages, ſhould call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54902:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by that name, ſince they have both derogated from their Doctrine, and Principles, and added what their own dark minds and inventions would invent; for in that they have erected unto themſelves a ſupremacy and a ſuperiority above others, which they have practiſed and Lorded over peoples Faith and Conſciences for many hundreds of years together; under which many thouſands have groaned, and ſuffered even until death, and ſhedding of their blood, and in all theſe things, they have quite contradicted Chriſt Jeſus his Doctrine, Practice and Example; as alſo all his holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles after him, for he and they were alwayes ſufferers, as hath been ſhewed already, and as we ſhall ſhew hereafter. But they were never Oppreſſors, nor layers of Yoaks and Burdens upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men and People; but they alwayes preached Liberty and Freedom to others, though they ſuffered themſelves; and there was their Croſs that they took up, when they followed Chriſt. And ſo thoſe Church-Governors, as they call themſelves, that have been Blood-ſhedders, that have been Oppreſſors and Perſecutors, they have no Example neither from Chriſt, nor none of his Apoſtles; and ſo let the Blood that they have ſhed for ſo many hundreds of years return upon their own heads. Let <hi>Babylons</hi> Merchants have blood to drink, for they are worthy, for they have been made drunk with the blood of the Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus: ſo the Cup that they have given to others, let them have it double; for they learned none of this from Chriſt, nor from any of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
            <p>For Chriſt when he ſent his Meſſengers, and they entred into a Village of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and they received him not, becauſe his face was as though he would go to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and when his Diſciples <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaw this, they ſaid, <hi>Lord, wilt thou that we command fire from Heaven, and conſume them, even as</hi> Elias did? <hi>But he turned, and rebuked them, and ſaid, Ye know not of what manner of ſpirits ye are of; for the Son of Man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them,</hi> Luke 9. 55, 56. And to ſave mens lives, he laid down his own Life, and ſhed his own pretious Blood; as he ſaith himſelf. He <hi>hath laid down his Life for his Sheep, and they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver periſh;</hi> Yea, he hath laid down his Life for his enemies: For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour for his good and edification: For even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf, but as it is written,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54902:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me. Wherefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye one another, as Chriſt alſo received us, to the glory of God.</hi> Rom. 15.</p>
            <p>And again, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All things are in God who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled us unto himſelf, by Jeſus Chriſt; and hath given to us the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Reconciliation; to wit, That God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their trespaſſes unto them: and hath committed unto us the Word of Reconciliation. Now then, we are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors for Chriſt; as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.</p>
            <p>Here is no violence nor cruelty uſed, neither bondages nor ſnares laid upon mens Conſciences; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Give no offence in any thing, that the Miniſtry be not blamed; but in all things appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves as the Miniſters of God: In much Patience, in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in Neceſſities, in Diſtreſſes, in Stripes and Impriſonments, in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, in Labours, in Watchings, in Faſtings; by Pureneſs, by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by Long-ſuffering, by Kindneſs, by the Holy Ghoſt; by Love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, by the Word of Truth, by the Power of God, by the Armour of Righteouſneſs, on the Right Hand, and on the Left; by Honour and Diſhonour; by Evil-report, and Good-report; as Deceivers, and yet True; as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown, and yet Well-known; as Dying, and behold we Live; as Chaſtened, and not Killed; as Sorrowful, and yet alwayes Rejoycing; as Poor, and yet making many Rich; as having Nothing, yet poſſeſſing All things;</hi> 2 Cor. 6.</p>
            <p>Here is a Miniſtry of God indeed, which is quite oppoſite and contrary to what hath been ſet up, and practiſed in the Chriſtian world. Alſo read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and likewiſe in Chap. 4. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Therefore, ſeeing we have this Miniſtry, as we have received mercy we faint not: For if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt; in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Goſpel hath been hid all this time of darkneſs, for the god of the World, hath blinded the minds of all that have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the Light of the glorious Goſpel; and ſo they have been loſt from it, and kept from it, by the Miniſters of darkneſs, who have preached the divination of their own brain, and not from the Light of the Lord. But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We preach not our ſelves,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54902:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and our ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus ſake,</hi> (theſe are not Lord-Biſhops, nor Pope-Holineſs) <hi>for, ſaith he, God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give us the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. For we have this Treaſury in earthen Veſſels, that the excellency of the Power may be of God, and not of us: For we are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſsed; we are perplexed, but not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed; always bearing about in our body the dying of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that the Life of Chriſt might be manifeſted in our body: for we who live are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes delivered unto death for Jeſus ſake, that the life of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our mortal fleſh; ſo that death worketh in us, but life in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Apoſtles laboured in the work of the Miniſtry, even under cruel ſufferings; which Goſpel, it may well be ſaid, hath been hid; for the Goſpel that hath been preached ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, hath laid Oppreſſions and Sufferings upon others, and they themſelves have Ruled and Lorded over Peoples Conſciences: but the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I Paul am made a Miniſter of the Goſpel, that is preached to every Creature under heaven; now rejoyce in my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Chriſt, in my fleſh, for his Bodies ſake, which is the Church: whereof I am made a Miniſter, according to the diſpenſation of God, which is given to me for you, to fulfil the Word of God,</hi> Col. 1.</p>
            <p>But this Miniſtry and Miniſtration hath been loſt, and the Church for which the Apoſtle ſuffered, hath been in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and if there was any ſmall Appearance or Teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in any, ſuch have ſuffered Oppreſſions, and Hardſhips, and much Detriment, from ſuch as were the Profeſſed Miniſtry. So theſe Scriptures, with many more, which might be mentioned, ſhew the contrariety between the Miniſters of the Goſpel in the Apoſtles Dayes, and the Profeſſed Miniſtry that hath been ſince the Apoſtles Dayes, in the Apoſtacy: And as the Supremacy, and Superiority hath been contrary to the Apoſtles Way, and Manner, and Order, in laying Oppreſſions and Burthens upon the People: ſo alſo they have been contrary, and oppoſite to Chriſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Doctrine, Practice, and Example, in not preaching Liberty and Freedom to the Spirits in Priſon; for Chriſt Jeſus, who is the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54902:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Anointing of God, Preacheth Glad Tidings to the Poor, Liberty to Captives; his Commiſſion that he gave to his Diſciples was, to Preach the Goſpel to all Nations, to every Creature.</p>
            <p>And he ſaid to thoſe that believed in him, <hi>If ye continue in the Truth, the Truth will make you free,</hi> John 8. And the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>That the Law of the Spirit of Life had made him free from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> Rom. 8. And the Apoſtle ſaith, when he was ſpeaking of the Miniſtration of the Law, and the Goſpel; <hi>When</hi> Moſes <hi>is read, the Vail is over the Heart: Nevertheleſs, when it ſhall turn to the Lord, the Vail ſhall be taken away: Now the Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. And ſo this is that Subſtance the Apoſtle Preacheth from, and Preached to the Spirit of the Lord that takes away the Vail, and giveth Liberty, and Redeemeth from under the Power of Darkneſs, and from the Bondage of Corruption; and therefore they did not ſet themſelves to Rule over mens Faith, or to lord over their Conſciences, but they endeavour ſtill to be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt unto every ones Conſcience in the ſight of God; <hi>But we have,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Renounced the hidden things of Diſhoneſty, not walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Craftineſs, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully; but by Manifestation of the Truth, commending our ſelves to every mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the ſight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. <hi>Knowing therefore the Terrours of the Lord, we perſwade men, but we are made manifest unto God, and I trust alſo are made manifest in your Conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So here the Apoſtle preached to Gods Witneſs in Peoples Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and that anſwered to them again, and they were made manifeſt to that; and therefore did the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>That they needed not any man to Teach them, but as the ſame Anointing teacheth them, which is Truth, and is no Lye:</hi> And ſo this is unlimited, neither doth the Apoſtle limit this, when they were gathered into the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, and all drank into one Spirit, and all baptized into one Body, by one Spirit; he told them they might all propheſie one by one; and that though they were many Members, yet they were one Bread and one Body, and every Member of the Body had its ſeveral Office; the Head did not ſay to the Feet, I have no need of you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now concerning Spiritual Gifts, Brethren, I would not have you ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, there are diverſity of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit; and there are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54902:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
differences of Adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord; and there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Operations, but the ſame God which worketh all in all; but the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal; For to one is given by the ſame Spirit the Word of Wiſdom, to another the Word of Knowledge, by the ſame Spirit; to another Faith, by the ſame Spirit; to another the Gift of Healing, by the ſame Spirit; to another the working of Miracles, by the ſame Spirit; to another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, to another Diſcerning of Spirits, to another divers kinds of Tongues, to another interpretation of Tongues: But all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, dividing to every man ſeverally as he will: For as the Body is one, and hath many Members, and all the Members of that one Body, being many are one Body; ſo alſo is Chriſt. For by one Spirit we are all Baptiſed into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be Bond or Free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit; for the Body is not one Member, but many.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. And ſo the Apoſtle goes on to the end of the Chapter diſcourſing of the ſeveral Gifts, all given by one Spirit.</p>
            <p>So here is no binding nor limiting, nor Supremacy one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; not to ſit Judges one of another, but every one to wait in their ſeveral Gifts of the Spirit given unto them to profit withal: <hi>For I ſay,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>through the Grace of God given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himſelf more highly then he ought to think, but to think ſoberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of Faith: For as we are many Members in one Body and all Members have not the ſame Office; ſo we being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are one Body in Chriſt, and every one Members one of another. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then Gifts, differing according to the Grace that is given us, whether Propheſie, let us propheſie according to the proportion of Faith; or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſty, let us wait in our miniſtring; or he that teacheth, on Teaching; or he that exhorteth, on Exhortation; he that giveth, let him do it with ſimplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that ſheweth Mercy, with chearfulneſs; let Love be be without diſſimulation; abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.</hi> And thus the Apoſtle goeth on with gracious Exhortations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. to the end of the Chapter, not preferring one before another, but every one to abide and wait in their Gifts.</p>
            <p>Alſo when he writeth unto the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he writeth thus, <hi>I therefore the Priſoner of the Lord beſeech you, walk worthy of the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54902:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wherewith ye are called, with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in Love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace: There is one Body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one Hope of your Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme, one God, and one Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all,</hi> Epheſ. 4. And in this Chapter he alſo goes on in opening of the manifeſtation of the Gift of the Spirit of God, and in holy Admonitions, even to the end of the Chapter; <hi>Which Gift,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is given for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Doctrine and Miniſtry is contrary to thoſe Miniſters which have been of late, that limit and bind under their Power; which Power is contrary to the Power of God, and his Spirit, as they themſelves will confeſs; for they cannot ſay they have the ſame Power and Spirit that the Apoſtles had, and yet they inflict Puniſhments, and lay Oppreſſions, and Burthens, and Bondages by their Laws, upon thoſe that do not follow and obey their Doctrine and Practices, which is quite contrary to Chriſt and his Apoſtles: For there is but two Wayes, Truth and Error, Light and Darkneſs. So let the wiſe and honeſt in heart judge what a condition the Saints of God are in, while this Power of Darkneſs Ruleth. And thus much for the Second Particular of their Practice, which is Binding and Limiting, and keeping in Bondage thoſe that are under their Power.</p>
            <p>The Third Particular of their Practice is, That they upbold and carry on many of theſe Practices before-mentioned, by cauſing People to Swear in their Courts, or upon any other occaſion, what they like, and preach up Swearing, and allow of it, and hold it up in all occaſions whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And in this they are abſolute Breakers of the ſpecial Command of Jeſus Chriſt, and alſo out of the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and contrary to their Teſtimony: For Chriſt Jeſus when he was in his Sermon on the Mount, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing the Heads of the Law, as we ſaid before, he mentioned this alſo again, <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid to them of old time, Thou ſhalt not Forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt perform unto the Lord thine Oathes; but I ſay unto you, Swear not at all,</hi> Matth. 5. Now Chriſt being the fulfilling of the Law, and the end of the Law, as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54902:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Apoſtle ſaith, for Righteouſneſs; and being that one Offering, that hath been offered up once for all, in which he ſaid, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will O God,</hi> he hath taken away the Firſt, that he might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Second, and when he had offered one Sacrifice for Sin, for ever he ſat down at the right hand of God, expecting his Enemies to become his Foot-ſtool. And the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, when he is ſpeaking of his Prieſthood; <hi>And in as much as not without an Oath he was made a Prieſt: For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thoſe Prieſts,</hi> to wit, thoſe that were under the Law, <hi>were made without an Oath; but this with an Oath, by him that ſaid unto him, The Lord ſware, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchiſedec, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hebr. 7.</p>
            <p>So this is he that is the Oath of God, and the Promiſe of God, the Subſtance <note place="margin">The Third Particular of their Practice, in cauſing People to Sware, contrary to Chriſts and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Commands, Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and Doctrine.</note> and Performance of all that God ſwore and promiſed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and unto his Seed for ever; this the Apoſtle makes very clear in the foregoing Chapter; where he ſaith, <hi>When God made a Promiſe to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>becauſe he could Sware by no greater, he Swore by Himſelf, ſaying, Surely, in bleſſing I will bleſs thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thee: And ſo after he had patiently endured, be obtained the Promiſe. Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the Heirs of Promiſe, the Immutability of his Counſel, confirmed it by an Oath, that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to Lye, we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the Hope ſet before us: which Hope we have as an Anchor of the Soul both ſure and ſtedfaſt, which entereth into that within the Vail, whither the Fore-runner is for us entered, even</hi> Jeſus, <hi>made an High-Prieſt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchiſedec. Hebr. 6.</p>
            <p>Surely all will confeſs that this is he whom God the Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> by an Oath, as alſo of whom <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchiſedec. Theſe are the two Immutable things, which the Apoſtle ſaith here, in which God ſhews the immutability of his Counſel, which both here meet in Chriſt Jeſus, the Sum and Subſtance of all: For ſurely he is the Seed which God promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> if we will believe the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. Alſo he is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54902:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Prieſt that is for ever, that ever liveth to make interceſſion for us, and this is he that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>At his Name every Knee ſhall bow, and every Tongue confeſs.</hi> Then, I ſay, let all Mouthes be ſtopt, in ſpeaking againſt him, and oppoſing of him, who hath ſaid, <hi>But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all,</hi> he that is the Sum and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the Performance of all that God hath Sworn, and hath put an end to the Law, under which Oathes and Swearing was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; he had full Power as well to put an end to Oaths, as he had to put an end to the Sabbath: <hi>For,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> which was one of the Ten Words, and Swearing was none of them: And ſurely thoſe that diſobey Chriſt Jeſus his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, who is the Sum and Subſtance of Gods Oaths, and the fulfilling and end of the whole Law; ſurely they blaſpheme againſt that Holy One. For the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>He that deſpiſe</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, died without Mercy under two ar three Witneſſes; how much more ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall be thought worthy for them who have trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> Hebr. 10.</p>
            <p>All thoſe that are Fighters againſt God, and Holders up of Swearing, againſt Chriſts Command, they will find <hi>It a fearfull thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God.</hi> But they have three <hi>Objections:</hi> Firſt, That God Swore: Secondly, That the Angel Swore: Thirdly, That the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Men verily Swear by the Greater, and an Oath for Confirmation is to them an end of all Strife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to theſe three; Firſt, For what the Lord hath Sworn concerning Chriſt, it is already proved, and fulfilled in Chriſt; but it is ſaid in <hi>Iſa</hi> 45. where the Lord by his Prophet was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ſaved, and he ſaith, <hi>Look unto me and be ſaved all ye Ends of the Earth, for I am God, and there is none elſe: I have Sworn by my ſelf, the Word is gone out of my Mouth in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that to me every Knee ſhall bow, every Tongue ſhall ſwear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> rehearſeth theſe words again, when he writ unto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>If there be any Conſolation in Chriſt, if any Comfort of Love, if any Fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any Bowels and Mercies, fulfil ye my Joy; and let the ſame mind be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus, who being in the Form of God, &amp;c.</hi> Where he rehearſeth the Humility of Chriſt even to Death upon his Croſs, in which he became a Saviour, as the Lord by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaid, <hi>Even to the Ends of the Earth: Wherefore,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54902:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every name; That at the Name of Jeſus</hi> (that ſignifieth a Saviour) <hi>every Knee ſhall bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth; and that every Tongue ſhall confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the Glory of the Father.</hi> Philip. 2.</p>
            <p>So here the Apoſtle hath omitted thoſe words, <hi>Every Tongue ſhall Swear,</hi> and ſaith <hi>Every Tongue ſhall Confeſs,</hi> as a Faithfull Witneſs, and an Obedient Servant of Chriſt Jeſus, whom he ſaith is the Lord, who hath ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> Now ſince that the Apoſtle, as a Witneſs of Chriſtianity, and an Obeyer of Chriſts Commands, hath left out the word <hi>Swear,</hi> and hath put in <hi>Confeſs,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſts own Words, who ſaid, <hi>He that confeſſeth me before men, him will I confeſs before my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Now ſince that Chriſt and his Apoſtles have left us this Example; who ſaith not, <hi>Swear before men,</hi> but, <hi>Confeſs before men;</hi> who are they that dare Oppoſe and Gainſay Chriſt Jeſus and his Apoſtles, under a colour of what the Law ſaith, and what the Prophet ſaith, and that the Angel Swore; <hi>But,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son?</hi> Who ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> When he bringeth his Firſt-begotten into the World, he ſaith, <hi>And let all the Angels worſhip him;</hi> and of the Angels he ſaith, <hi>Who maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Miniſters a Flame of Fire;</hi> the Angels are his Meſſengers and Servants, as may be read in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.</hi> And what hath any one to do, to bring that where the Angel Swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, that Time ſhould be no longer, when he was upon his Meſſage and Service, which the Lord ſent him about? What is this to men that have the Command of the Son of God upon them? who hath ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> Unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, <hi>Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine Enemies thy Foot-ſtool?</hi> But unto the Son he ſaith, <hi>Thy Throne O God is for ever and ever, a Scepter of Righteouſneſs is the Scepter of thy Kingdom.</hi> Let all ſuch as contend with the Almighty in this matter, read <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. and ſee how they can anſwer him there.</p>
            <p>And as for that where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>An Oath is for an end of Strife:</hi> this he ſaith, when he ſpeaketh of the Aſſurance of the Oath of God, he bringeth a Compariſon of them that Swore, when Swearing was lawful under the Law; <hi>For men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Swear by the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54902:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
greater, and an Oath for confirmation, is to them an end of all ſtrife.</hi> Now there is none have the reaſon of a man, but they may ſee the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſuch as did uſe Swearing, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>An Oath for confirmation, was to them an end of all ſtrife;</hi> and ſo it was under the Law; but Oaths for ending of ſtrife were never uſed among the Chriſtians, for Chriſt had commanded to the contrary; and the Apoſtle manifeſted the contrary, when he wrote to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> as is proved before.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> who wrote to the twelve Tribes ſcattered up and down, who were they that had the Law, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Swearing, and under which they practiſed ſwearing, for a confirmation, and an end of ſtrife, as the Apoſtle ſaith before, even to them the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> when he writes to them of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of affliction, that they ſhould be as examples to endure, he ſaith, <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of</hi> Job, <hi>and have ſeen the end of the Lord, that he is very pittiful and tender of mercy; but above all things ſaith he, my Brethren, Swear not; neither by Heaven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Earth, neither by any other Oath: but let your yea, be yea; and your nay, nay; leſt ye fall into condemnation,</hi> Jam. 5.</p>
            <p>And into this ſtate of condemnation, are the Teachers and Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our Age fallen, who are not only Swearers, but Teachers, Upholders, and Forcers to Sware, and preach it up for Doctrine to Swear, and in this oppoſe and gain-ſay Chriſt Jeſus, and all his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and all that bear teſtimony to his Name, and Truth, and Word, and obey his Command; ſuch ſuffer by them, and under them, and if they bring them into their Courts for any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot pay them Tythes, or becauſe they cannot pay them Steeple-houſe Dues, and <hi>Eaſter</hi> Reckonings, when they have ſued them, except they will Swear, they cannot put in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers: and then they get out Writs, and caſt them into Priſon. And thus they that profeſs themſelves to be Miniſters of Chriſt, and the Goſpel, make havock of his Flock: But ſurely he will come and ſeek his Sheep, and ſearch them out. And thus much for the third Particular of their practice, which is their cauſing People to Swear.</p>
            <p>The fourth Particular that they practiſe without ground from Scripture, is Sprinkling Infants with water, upon their heads and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54902:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faces, and ſome plunge them all over, which we do not find Chriſt or his Apoſtles did the like with Infants.</p>
            <p>It is true, there was brought unto Chriſt Little Children, that he ſhould put his hands on them and pray; and he laid his hands on them, but his Diſciples rebuked them; but Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Suffer lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children, and forbid them not to come to me, for of ſuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 19. Now <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he took them up in his Armes, and put his hands upon them, and bleſſed them,</hi> Mark 10. And <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>They brought unto him Infants, that he might touch them; but when his Diſciples ſaw, they rebuked them; but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was diſpleaſed with them, and ſaid, Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, ſhall in no wiſe enter therein,</hi> Luke 18.</p>
            <p>Now by all theſe Scriptures it doth appear, that little Children were nearer the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note place="margin">The fourth particular of their practice, is Sprinkling of Infants without ground from Scripture.</note> of God, and readier for the Kingdom of God than any others; for Chriſt ſaith ſeveral times, <hi>Whoſoever will enter into the Kingdom of God, muſt be as a little Child.</hi> So by all theſe Scriptures we may ſee that he ownes little Children above all others. Now how it cometh that they throw water upon them, to give an addition to that Innocent ſtate while they are Infants, this is certainly an Invention and an Imagination of their own, for there is nothing in Scripture for it.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who was ſent before Chriſt to preach the Baptiſme of repentance, he baptized thoſe that received his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with water in <hi>Jordan,</hi> but we do not find that he put Infants in; that was not according to his Doctrine which was Repentance; for Infants were not capable to repent. And when the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſent the Prieſts and Levites to enquire of <hi>John</hi> what he was; they ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Why he baptized, if he was not the Chriſt, neither Elias, nor that Prophet? John anſwered them, ſaying, I indeed baptize with water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to repentance; but there ſtandeth one among you, whom ye know not, he it is who cometh after me, and is preferred before me, whoſe ſhoes latchet I am not worthy to unlooſe. This was beyond Jordan, where John was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing.</hi> Saith he, <hi>and I knew him not; but he that ſent me to baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto me, Upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54902:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deſcending and remaining on him, the ſame is he that baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> John 1. And <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>In thoſe dayes came John the Baptiſt, preaching in the wilderneſs of Judea, and ſaid, Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I indeed baptize you with water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whoſe ſhooes I am not worthy to bear; he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire,</hi> Mat. 3.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, in <hi>John</hi> 3. After that Chriſt had been preaching and ſpeaking to <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> and had been preaching the Light to him, that he and his Diſciples came to <hi>Judea,</hi> and there he tarried with them and baptized, and the diſciples of <hi>John</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were at difference about Purifying, and they came to <hi>John</hi> and ſaid, <hi>He that thou bore witneſs of, baptizeth; John anſwered and ſaid, Ye your ſelves bear me witneſs, that I ſaid, I am not the Christ, but I am ſent before him; he muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe. When Jeſus therefore knew that the Phariſees heard that he baptized and made Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples more then John, though Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; he left Judca, and departed,</hi> John 4.</p>
            <p>Alſo when <hi>John</hi> was preaching and baptizing, and preaching re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſſion of ſins, then cometh Jeſus from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jordan,</hi> unto <hi>John,</hi> to be baptized of him, <hi>but John forbad him ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have more need to be baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me? and Jeſus anſwering, ſaid, Suffer it to be ſo now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteouſneſs. And Jeſus when he was baptized, went up ſtraightway out of the water, and the heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove, and lighted upon him, and a voice came from heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3.</p>
            <p>This is the main Scripture that the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> build upon, for their Water-Baptiſm; and here is a ſecret in this, which they never came to ſee: For <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I knew him not, but that he ſhould be made manifeſt to Iſrael; therefore am I come baptizing with water. And John bare record, ſaying, I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, like a Dove, and it abode upon him, and I knew him not.</hi> Now how do the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> know him? And the end wherefore he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, ſince that <hi>John</hi> did not know it, nor would not have had him to have done ſo, who was a man ſent of God to Baptize with water, till he ſaid it was to fulfill all Righteouſneſs; which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54902:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
word was hid from <hi>John,</hi> as he afterwards ſaith, but that he ſhould be made manifeſt to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> therefore he came baptizing with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And ſo afterwards when Chriſt was teaching <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> when he told him, That thoſe that were to enter into the Kingdom of God, muſt be born of the water of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Theſe things were ſtrange unto him, but <note place="margin">The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with outward water condemned.</note> Jeſus ſaid, <hi>We ſpeak what we know, and teſtify what we have ſeen, and ye believe not our teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe them not, how ſhall <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To the ſame purpoſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There are three that bear record in the Earth; the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, and theſe three agree in one,</hi> 1 John 5. It were good for the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> to know this Water, and this Baptiſm, and this Spirit, by which they might he born again; and to know the waſhing of the Regeneration, and Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt: For this was the Waſhing and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Saints were waſhed with; <hi>They were made clean through the Word, by the waſhing of the water of the Word,</hi> Epheſ. 5.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> to ſtand waſhing with outward Water, which <hi>John</hi> baptized with, who was before Chriſt, which was a Figure of the inward waſhing, and cleanſing, and purging, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, the ſame, when he is ſpeaking of <hi>Noah</hi>'s preaching while he made the Ark, wherein few, that is, eight perſons were lived by Water; <hi>The like figure,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whereunto even Baptiſm doth now ſave us; not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. Whoſe Blood, and the Water, and Spirit, which he Baptizeth with, is the true and only Baptiſm. For <hi>John</hi> himſelf ſaith, He muſt decreaſe, and Chriſt muſt increaſe; and for them to ſtand waſhing here with outward water, and their hearts and Conſciences defiled and polluted, this will be of little value to them; for <hi>John,</hi> who was a man ſent of God, and bore a true witneſs of Chriſt Jeſus, yet after he was caſt into Priſon, he ſent his diſciples to ask, <hi>Art thou he, or do we look for another?</hi> He was <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r beyond the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> So it concerneth them to queſtion their ſtate and condition; For they that look at the outward element of Water to be the Baptiſm, they are far from the real and true waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from that Baptiſm that baptizeth into the body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54902:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and finding certain Diſciples, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Have ye received the Holy Ghoſt ſince ye believed? they ſaid, We have not ſo much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghoſt; he ſaid unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? they ſaid, Unto</hi> John's <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid,</hi> John <hi>Baptized with the Baptiſm of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and that they ſhould believe on him that was to come after him, that is, in Chriſt Jeſus. Then they were Baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus: And when</hi> Paul <hi>had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghoſt came upon them, and they ſpake with Tongues, and Propheſied.</hi> Acts 19.</p>
            <p>So here is the true and only Baptiſm, the Power and Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, which, as <hi>John</hi> ſaid, ſhall increaſe; who is that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fountain, that if any man be athirſt, they may come unto him and drink. And this was ſpoken of the pourings forth of his Spirit; and with this Spirit were they Baptized, while <hi>Peter</hi> was ſpeaking unto them, when the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them, and they ſpake with Tongues. And they of the Circumciſion which believed were aſtonied, and came to <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe the Holy Ghoſt fell upon the <hi>Gentiles. But</hi> Peter <hi>anſwered, Can any man forbid Water, that they ſhould not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghoſt? So he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and ſo they were united into the Body, and into the Chriſtian Faith;</hi> and into the Unity, as well as the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by this Spirit did Chriſt ſend forth his Diſciples, to go teach and Baptize all Nations, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 41. And this is not an outward Element of Water, neither is this poured only upon Infants, but upon all that are athirſt. And this is that one Baptiſm which the Apoſtle mentioneth, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. where he ſaith, <hi>There is one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and one Spirit; one Lord, and one Faith; one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all: So as there is but one Lord, and one God, and one Faith, and one Spirit, and one Body;</hi> ſo there is but one <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Apoſtle; who ſaith, <hi>By one Spirit we are all Baptized into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. Then we cannot believe that it is outward Water: So this one Baptiſm, and one Spirit, is not outward Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So the Baptizing of Infants, with outward Water, which both Papiſts and Proteſtants uſe, is contrary, and without any ground from Scripture; for if there be but one Baptiſm, ſurely outward Water is not it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:54902:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And whereas they ſay, They do it as a Sign or Signification, and call it a Sacrament; this is nothing but their own Invention, and Imagination, to keep People in ignorance and darkneſs, for they have no Scripture for it. So much for that Particular of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p>There is no Scripture that mentioneth a Sacrament, this word hath been invented at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi> who was the firſt that ſet up the Sacrament, and the Altar, and the Euchariſt, which they call the Real-Preſence; which, after their Prieſts have conſecrated Bread, they call it, <hi>The Real Body of Christ,</hi> and many have loſt their Lives by them, becauſe they could not believe this. Something of kin to this is that which our Proteſtants uſe, though it's not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo groſs; for they call Bread and Wine (after they have bleſt it) <hi>A Sacrament,</hi> as though the nature and property of it were changed from what it was before; but this is not the fruit of that Vine, which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>he would drink with his Diſciples new, in the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Chriſt was ſpeaking to his Diſciples, that the <hi>Son of Man muſt be betrayed,</hi> he ſaid unto them, <hi>I have deſired to eat this Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with you, before I ſuffer; for I ſay unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, untill it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God. And he took the Cup and gave thanks, and ſaid, Take this and divide it among your ſelves: For I ſay unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the Vine, until the Kingdom of God come. And he took Bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave it unto them; ſaying, This is my Body given for you; this do in remembrance of me. Likewiſe alſo, the Cup after Supper, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, which is ſhed for you,</hi> Luke 22. Mat. 26. Mark 14.</p>
            <p>Now if the Bread and the Wine had been the Real Body and Blood of Chriſt, which was given and ſhed for them, he needed not to have ſaid, as he ſaith in the next words, <hi>Behold the hand of him that betrayeth me:</hi> for he ate of the bread that betrayed him; which words make a diſtinction betwen him and the Bread and Wine. But he ſaid, <hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi> And with this the Apoſtle agreeth, in what he writeth to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>I received of the Lord, that which alſo I deliver unto you, That the Lord Jeſus, the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54902:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Body which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me. In the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup, when he had ſupt, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament of my Blood; this do ye as often as ye drink in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me. For,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to theſe <hi>Corinthians, As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. So that the eating of this Bread, and drinking of this Cup, is but the remembrance of his death, how <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed him, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> Crucified him, <hi>until he come,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. But where is the drinking in his Reſurrection, New in his Kingdom? It is manifeſted theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not come to that, by what the Apoſtle was ſpeaking to them of: in all the foregoing part of this Chapter, he is ſpeaking to them of the ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Man and of the Woman, and of their Praying and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying with their heads covered, and uncovered; and of their long hair; and of their heads being ſhaven, and of Nature it ſelf teaching them, but more eſpecially in this particular, he ſaith; <hi>When ye come together into one place, this is not to eat the Lords Supper, but in eating every one taketh before other; and one is hungry, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drunken.</hi> So any that read this Chapter may ſee, that theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were not come to the Power of his Reſurrection; they might well eat in remembrance of his Death; for they were one with them in ſinning, that Crucified him, and ſo Crucified him by their ſins afreſh, as the Apoſtle ſaith. And ſo are our eaters and givers of Bread and Wine; for they eat it in remembrance of his Death, and ſin again as ſoon as they have done; and this they call, <hi>A Communion;</hi> but it is a Communion in ſin and tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was the cauſe of Chriſt's Death, in the eating of this Bread, and drinking of this Cup: Yet in the foregoing Chapter he ſaith, <hi>Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from Idolatry: I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay: The Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs</hi> (here he taketh in himſelf) <hi>Is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? the Bread which we break, Is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> This is not the Communion in ſin and tranſgreſſion: <hi>For we being many, are one Bread and one Body, for we are all partakers of that one Bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.</p>
            <p>Here is no ſpeaking of Remembrance, but the real partaking of the one Bread; this is the living Bread that is come down from Heaven. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the living Bread that came down from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54902:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Heaven, if any man eat of this Bread, he ſhall live for ever: and the Bread that I give you is my Fleſh, that I will give for the Life of the World. The Jews wondered at this, and ſaid, Will this man give us his Fleſh to eat? Jeſus ſaid, As the Living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; So he that eateth me, ſhall live by me; and except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you.</hi> But this is not, except you eat Bread, and drink Wine, ye have no Life in you; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>My Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed.</hi> John 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe things ſaid Jeſus in the Synagogue, as he Taught. And many of his Diſciples when they heard this, ſaid, It was a hard ſaying, who can hear it? But Chriſt ſaith unto them, It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the Fleſh profitteth nothing: The Words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo it is the Spirit that is the Living Bread, and thoſe that live in the Spirit, and feed in the Spirit, and meet in the Spirit, they eat the Fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his Blood; and this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bread was that which the Apoſtles broke; and they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers, it is ſaid, <hi>They continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houſe to houſe,</hi> Acts 2. And this Bread was that living Bread, that Chriſt ſaid came down from Heaven. And when the Diſciples met together on the Firſt day of the week to break Bread, <hi>Paul</hi> preached unto them until midnight; ſurely this was Living Bread, elſe it could not have been the Communion of the Body of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>And this was a Myſtery, which Swearers and Drunkards know not; and therefore they ſet up that which is outward, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as the Apoſtle ſaith, becauſe they are blind of the Spiritual Eye; and ſo as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That which can be ſeen is Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but that which cannot be ſeen is Eternal,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 18. But this is hid from their eyes; and thus much for this Particular, which they call the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>They have alſo ſeveral other vain Practices, which they have no Example in Scripture for; as praying over the Dead, and for the Dead, which the Apoſtle exhorted from; when he writ to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>But I would not have you ignorant, Brethren, concerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not even as others,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54902:36"/>
which have not Hope; for if we believe that Jeſus died and roſe again; ſo they alſo that ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. Here is nothing of praying for them, nor over them, after they are dead: but they manifeſt by their prayers, that they have not a true Hope nor Belief in Chriſt Jeſus, who is riſen from the dead, <hi>And become the Firſt-fruits of them that ſleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
            <p>The like may be ſaid alſo of their Churching women, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying people with Rings: but it appeareth that the main end of theſe Practices, are to get money of people; for they have no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Scriptures, that the people were married with a Prieſt, neither in the Old-Teſtament nor New; ye do not read that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> were married with a Prieſt; and <hi>Iſaac</hi> took <hi>Rebecca</hi> to wife, and <hi>Laban</hi> gave <hi>Jacob Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> but not by a Prieſt. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Marriage is honorable, and the bed undefiled;</hi> but he doth not ſay that they ſhould be married by a Prieſt, or with a Ring: But it is manifeſted that this Generation of Prieſts, that have ſet up ſuch Imaginations and Inventions as theſe, are the ſame that the Apoſtle propheſied of unto his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> that good and true Biſhop; where he ſaith, <hi>Now the Spirit ſpeaketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that in the latter times, ſome ſhould depart from the Faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Devils, ſpeaking Lyes in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, having their Conſciences ſeared with a hot Iron, forbidding to Marry, and commanding to abſtain from Meats,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. Now let the Reader but ſeriouſly read this Chapter, and conſider whether theſe be not they, both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who marry peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as before mentioned, and yet forbid to marry all that will not marry according to their way, and will; though the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They may marry whom they will, only in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 39. Yet if they be not married with a Prieſt, and according to their way, they account it no Marriage: And thus they run themſelves quite off from the Scriptures, as bad as they that never heard of them; for though they profeſs them in words, they are utterly, and quite out of them in their Practices. And that they abſtain from Meats, and cauſe people ſo to do, this is well known to be their common practice, all which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Are the Doctrines of Devils;</hi> and ſo here I have found them in their practice, and I will leave them. Theſe with many more frivolous things, which might be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as their keeping of Idle dayes, and cauſing people to do ſo, but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54902:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what hath been ſaid before, may give people a ſight of their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they are quite contrary and oppoſite to the Rule of the Scriptures: And thus much for the Fifth Head, which is their Practice.</p>
            <p>The Sixth is their Maintenance, and this is as contrary to the Scriptures of Truth, as any of the reſt.</p>
            <p>They profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, and Goſpel-Miniſters, and yet will not be content with Goſpel-Maintenance; but their Goſpel is dead, and ſo cold, that they preach to People, that it will not quicken them out of their dead and natural eſtate; and therefore they dare not truſt themſelves upon their maintenance, nor caſt themſelves upon the freedom, or liberality of the people. And ſo when the Power and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus was loſt, and the Revelation of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by which the Apoſtles preached; then when the Apoſtacy came in, thoſe that got up into the Popes Chair, took upon them to find out a way, whereby they might compel peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to maintain them, however they maintained themſelves; and ſo they ſtarted back from Chriſts Rule, and his Apoſtles, and ſtept into the Imitation of ſome part of the Levitical Prieſthood under the Law, which beſt ſuited their own ends. And that being made ready to their hands, they ſoon go<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it ſet up, and eſtabliſhed by a Law; and then thoſe that were Chriſtians, and ſtood to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Faith of Chriſtianity, who knew that the Prieſthood was changed, and the Law alſo, and could not pay them Tythes; then they were ready prepared for them with Laws and Penalties, to clap upon them, and ſo force them by compulſion. And thus they have laid a weight of Oppreſſion upon poor people, ever ſince the dark Night of Apoſtacy came on, and have taken from them the tenth part of their Lands, and a tenth part of their Flocks, and Herds, and the tenth part of their Labours; and thus poor people been made a prey unto their wolviſh mouths.</p>
            <p>And in this they have not done juſtly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the Prieſthood under the <note place="margin">Tythes contrary to Goſpel-Maintenance.</note> Law, nor under the Goſpel. For the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were to come into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were utterly to deſtroy all the Places where they worſhipped their Gods, and they were to overthrow their Altars, and break down their Pillars, and burn their Groves with Fire, and hew down their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54902:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Graven-Images (and theſe Prieſts, we are now ſpeaking of, ſet Images up) and they were to come unto the Place which the Lord their God was to chuſe out of all the Tribes, to put his Name there; and ſaith the Lord, <hi>Thither ſhall you bring your Burnt-Offerings, and you Sacrifices, and your Tythes, and your Heave-Offerings of your hand,</hi> Deut. 12. <hi>And at the end of three years, thou ſhalt bring forth all the Tythes of their encreaſe the ſame year, and to lay it up within thy Gates; and the Levite, becauſe he hath no inheritance with thee; and the Stranger, and the Fatherleſs, and Widow which are within thy Gates ſhall come, and ſhall eat, and be ſatisfied, that the Lord thy God may bleſs thee.</hi> Deut. 14. 28, 29. and chap. 26. 12.</p>
            <p>But theſe Tythe-Mongers of the Goſpel Times, have neither fed Widows nor Fatherleſs; but what they could get of them, they have taken from them; and many poor Widows have been caſt into Priſon, becauſe they could not for Conſcience ſake pay Tythes; and many poor fatherleſs children have had their goods taken away for the ſame: but this is none of Chriſt's nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Example. And as they have taken up ways, that have been neither according to Law nor Goſpel, ſo let them ſtand Uſurpers, as they are, and Lorders over Gods Heritage: But let them know for all this, that they muſt come to Judgement, and the Lord will plead with them in his day and time.</p>
            <p>For when Chriſt Jeſus ſent forth his Diſciples; their great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was not to look after their Bellies; for they were not to provide neither Gold, nor Silver, nor Braſs in their Purſes; for they had received freely, and they were freely to give, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 8, 9. Alſo when he ſent out the Seventy, they were neither to have Bread, nor Money, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he took leave of the Churches, he told them, <hi>He knew that after his departure would come among them grievous Wolves, not ſparing the Flock:</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I have coveted no mans Silver, or Gold, or Apparel; Ye your ſelves know, that theſe hands have miniſtred unto my neceſſity, and to them that were with me: I likewiſe ſhewed you all things, how that ſo labouring, ye ought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the weak; and to remember the words of the Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, It is more Bleſſed to give then to Receive,</hi> Acts 20. 33, 34, 35.</p>
            <p>But the Miniſters in theſe dayes, think it more bleſſed to receive then give, for they accuſtom the one more then the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54902:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And again the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let a man ſo account of us as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and the Stewards of the Myſteries of God. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Its required of a Steward, that he be found faithfull: For I think God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles, as it were appointed to death; for we are made a Spectacle unto the World, to Angels, and to Men, We are Fools for Chriſts ſake, but ye are Wiſe; we are Weak but ye are Strong; ye are Honorable, but we are deſpiſed: Even unto this very hour, we both hunger, and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place, and labour working with our own hands; being reviled, we bleſs; being perſecuted, we ſuffer it; being defamed, we entreat; we are made as the filth of the world, and as the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.</p>
            <p>This is far different from thoſe that have called themſelves Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſters, they will be ſure of certain abiding places; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of working with their hands, they make all people work for them: So this Scripture tries them and thir Practice.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when the Apoſtle writeth to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Your ſelves, Brethren know our Exhortation was not of deceit, nor of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, nor in guile, but as we were allowed of God, to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, even ſo we ſpake, not as pleaſing men but God, which trieth our hearts: For neither at any time uſed we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetouſneſs: God is witneſs; nor of men ſought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burthenſom as the Apoſtles of Chriſt; but we were gentle among you, even as a Nurſe che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth her children: So being affectionately deſirous of you, we were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have imparted unto you, not the Goſpel of Chriſt onely, but alſo our own ſouls, becauſe ye were dear unto us. For ye remember, Brethren, our labour and travel; labouring night and day, becauſe we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached unto you the Goſpel of God. Ye are Witneſſes, and God alſo, how holily, and juſty, and unblameable we behaved our ſelves among you that believe: As ye know, how we exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.</p>
            <p>Here was a dear and faithfull Miniſter of God, that abhorred to be burthenſom or chargeable even to them that believed, as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth in his next Epiſtle, where he ſaith, <hi>For ye your ſelves know how ye ought to follow us; for we behaved not our ſelves diſorderly among
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54902:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you, neither did we eat any mans bread for nought, but wrought with labour and travel night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you: Not becauſe we have no power, but to make our ſelves an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for you to follow us. For even when we were with you, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, that if any would not work, neither ſhould be eat;</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.</p>
            <p>This is hard Doctrine for our Lords, Deans and Deacons, who are got ſo high, that many of them are almoſt the greateſt men in our Land; ſo that it will be no eaſie matter to bring them down into the Apoſtles Steps, and Paths, that they were in: But however it may let them ſee, that they are gotten up to the higheſt Pinacle of the Temple, whither the Devil carried our Saviour, and would have had him to have caſt himſelf down; but <hi>Jeſus</hi> was too ſtrong for his Temptations, and ſaid, <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> Matth. 4. But it is to be feared, that thoſe who have climed ſo high, have been taken with his bait; and it is much if they caſt not themſelves down; for it is contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt; for his Exhortation was, <hi>That they ſhould take the low<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt Seat,</hi> that it might be ſaid unto them, <hi>Friend, Go up higher,</hi> but they have not taken that way.</p>
            <p>But they have ſeveral Objections, or Colours for what they do, with which they do a little blind ſome ignorant people, which is an eaſie matter to do, <hi>While the Blind lead the Blind,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>they both go into the Ditch.</hi> One thing they alledge for Tythes, is, That <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> took Tythes when <hi>Abraham</hi> paid them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. when <hi>Abraham</hi> returned from the ſlaughter of the Kings; and this the Apoſtle cleareth himſelf, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. and taketh away the objection of all that can be ſaid for Tythes. For firſt of all, as for <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec</hi> King of <hi>Salem,</hi> Prieſt of the Moſt High God, who met <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in his return from the ſlaughter of the Kings, and bleſſed him, to whom alſo <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the tenth part of all, &amp;c. Here the Apoſtle deſcribes <hi>Melchiſedec, being without deſcent, having neither beginning of dayes nor end of life.</hi> So that our Tythe-Takers in theſe laſt days, cannot claim them by this Order; for they are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſcent, for the furtheſt they can claim was <hi>Levi,</hi> and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of them have ended their dayes, and their dayes are come to an end. Beſides, the Apoſtle ſaith, that this <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was greater then <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> had the Promiſe of God, and the Oath of God paſſed unto him, and unto his Seed, which the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54902:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Apoſtle ſaith, is Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He was made like unto the Son of God, and remaineth a Prieſt continually. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>how great this man was, unto whom, even the Patriarch</hi> Abraham, <hi>gave the Tythe of the Spoils, and verily, they who are of the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>who receive the Office of the Prieſthood, have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to take Tythes of the People, that are of their Brethren, though they came out of the Loins of</hi> Abraham; <hi>but he whoſe deſcent is not counted from them, received Tythes of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and bleſſed him, that had the Promiſes, and without all contradiction, the leſs is bleſsed of the better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So if our Tythe-Takers can ſay they are better then <hi>Abraham,</hi> then they may claim Tythes from <hi>Melchiſedec;</hi> but if they ſay nay, but they will claim them from the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> then they muſt own themſelves to be of the Levitical Prieſthood, and they muſt take Tythes of none but their Brethren the Jews: For ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the Prieſthood had a Commandment to take Tythes, according to the Law, that is of their Brethren,</hi> Hebr. 7. 5. And he ſaith further, <hi>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical Prieſthood, for <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>der it the people received the Law, what further need was there that another Prieſt ſhould ariſe, after the order of</hi> Melchiſedec, <hi>and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Aaron. But the Prieſthood being changed, there is made of neceſſity a change alſo of the Law; For he of whom theſe things are ſpoken pertaineth to another Tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the Altar. For it is evident our Lord ſprang of</hi> Judah, <hi>of which Tribe</hi> Moſes <hi>ſpake nothing coucerning the Prieſthood. And it is more evident, that after the ſimilitude of</hi> Melchiſedec, <hi>there ariſeth another Prieſt, who is not made after the Law of a carnal Commandment, but after the power of an Endleſs Life: For he teſtifieth, Thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the order of</hi> Melchiſedec. <hi>For there is verily a diſanulling of the Commandment going before, for the weakneſs and unprofitableneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better Hope did, by which we draw nigh unto God,</hi> Hebr. 7.</p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle teſtifieth clearly of the overturning and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prieſthood of <hi>Levi,</hi> and the diſanulling of the Law, by which they took Tythes, becauſe that made nothing perfect. And for this other Prieſt that remaineth for ever, <hi>Who purgeth and purifieth the Conſcience from dead Works, to ſerve the Living God;</hi> for the witneſſing of this Everlaſting High-Prieſt being come, hath
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54902:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many ſuffered, and do ſuffer by this Generation of Tythe-taking Prieſts, who are neither according to Law nor Goſpel; and though they take the Apoſtles words here, and it may be, may read them to the people, yet do they act quite contrary to the Apoſtles Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony here, and to all his practices that he practiſed while he was upon Earth.</p>
            <p>And ſo we that have a Teſtimony of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our Everlaſting High-Prieſt, that he is come, we cannot deny his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, in paying Prieſts Tythes, which was paid under the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Prieſthood, before he came, now we have another Prieſt, that remaineth continually, who is not made by a Law of a Carnal Commandment, (as they all are) but by another Law, <hi>Even the Law of the Spirit of Life, which maketh us free from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> Rom. 8. But they ſet up Laws againſt us, and make us ſuffer by their Laws, and by their Courts; and when we cannot Swear, caſt us into Priſon: But the Apoſtle taught his Son <hi>Timothy</hi> otherwiſe, when <hi>He beſought him to abide ſtill at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>that he might charge ſome of them, that they preach no other Doctrine: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give head to Fables, and endleſs Genealogies, which miniſter Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, rather then Godly Edifying, which is in Faith. Now the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure Heart, and of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Faith unfained: from which ſome having ſwerved, have turned again aſide into Jangling, deſiring to be Teachers of the Law, underſtanding neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm. But we know that the Law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully: Knowing this, that the Law is not made for a Righteous man, but for the Lawleſs and Diſobedient, for the Ungodly, and for Sinners, for Unholy and Prophane, for Murtherers of Fathers, and Murtherers of Mothers, for Man-ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for Whoremongers, for them that defile themſelves with mankind, for Men-ſtealers, for Lyars, for Perjured Perſons, and if there be any thing further that is contrary to Sound Doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.</p>
            <p>Surely theſe late Biſhops have learned another Leſſon, then this Biſhop <hi>Timothy</hi> did; for they execute their Law againſt the Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and the Innocent, and ſuch as abide in Sound Doctrine, and thoſe that bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit, which is <hi>Love, Peace, Long ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance, againſt ſuch the Apoſtle ſaith, there is no Law,</hi> Gal. 5. And yet theſe are they that are made the object of their Laws, and are kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54902:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Scourge of the Laws in theſe dayes; and this diſorder is, becauſe our Leaders and Teachers have cauſed the people to err, from the Faith, and from the Truth.</p>
            <p>But to come to the particular, which is concerning Miniſters Maintenance, where they object, and ſay, The Apoſtle alloweth them a maintenance, by what he holds forth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. where he ſaith, <hi>Have not we power to eat and drink? Who goeth a warfare at any time on his own charges? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? For it is written in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the Corne. If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap of your carnal things? Do you not know, that they that miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar: Even ſo hath God ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this we would freely allow them, and it would be joy and gladneſs to us, to ſee them come to this, upon the ſame tearms the Apoſtles did; for firſt of all he ſaith, <hi>Am I not an Apoſtle? Am I not free? Have I not ſeen Jeſus Chriſt? Are not you my work in the Lord? If I be not an Apoſtle unto others, yet doubtleſs I am to you, for the ſeal of mine Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord. If others are partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheleſs we have not uſed this power, but ſuffered all things, lest we ſhould hinder the Goſpel of Christ. For we have uſed none of theſe things, neither have I writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten theſe things, that it ſhould be done unto me, for it were better for me to die, than that in this any man ſhould make my glorying void; for though I preach the Goſpel, I have nothing to glory of, for a neceſſity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me if I preach not the Goſpel. For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, a diſpenſation of the Goſpel is committed unto me, what is my reward then? Verily, that when I preach the Goſpel, I may make the Goſpel of Chriſt without charge, that I abuſe not my power in the Goſpel. For though I be free from all men, yet I made my ſelf ſervant unto all, that I might gain the more, unto the Jew I became a Jew,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle maketh all clear; ſo that if they would come to preach the Goſpel in this Spirit and Power, they need not ſet up their Courts of violence, and lay ſuch heavy oppreſſion upon the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54902:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Conſciences of men and women. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Though we walk in the fleſh, we do not war after the fleſh; for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but ſpiritual, and mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds; caſting down imaginations of every high thought, that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God; and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into captivity every thought into the obedience of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is no need of Courts or Priſons, where the power of God is manifeſted in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; they need not want means nor maintenance, where every thought is brought down into the ſubjection and obedience of the Lord's Truth. But as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that ſow ſpiritual things, ought to reap carnal things;</hi> So he that planteth a Vineyard, ought to eat of the fruit thereof; and whoſoever feedeth a flock, ought to eat the milk thereof; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever treadeth out the corn, ought not to have his mouth muzzeld according to the Law; that ſo he that ploweth in hope, and threſheth in hope, ſhould be partaker of their hope.</p>
            <p>All this is juſt and equal, and ought to be without force or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Nevertheleſs we have not uſed this power, but ſuffer all things, leſt we ſhould hinder the Goſpel of Chriſt. The Lord hath ordained that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel, but I have uſed none of theſe things. Therefore,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Have I committed an offence in abaſing my ſelf? Becauſe I have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you the Goſpel of God freely. And when I was preſent with you and wanted, I was chargable to no man,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. Alſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I did not burden you; Did I make a gain of you, by any of them I ſent unto you? I deſired</hi> Titus, <hi>and with him I ſent a Brother. Did</hi> Titus <hi>make a gain of you? Walked we not in the ſame Spirit? Walked we not in the ſame ſteps? Think ye that we excuſe our ſelves unto you? We ſpeak before God in Chriſt, that we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</hi> Here the Apoſtle deſireth their growth into grace, that he preached to; not his growth into their eſtates, as ours do now in theſe dayes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>But this hath not ſerved our late Goſpel-Miniſters; they will not be contented, where they have planted to eat of the fruit; nor where they have fed the flock, to eat of the milk; nor where they have plowed or threſhed, to partake of their hope; but they will be paid of all within the compaſs of their power and Lordſhips, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they feed them or no; and where they never planted, nor never

plowed, nor never ſowed, there they will make them to pay them, and that by force and violence: And this all people may ſee, is contrary to the Apoſtles Doctrine, Life and Practice. Surely the Apoſtle ſaw theſe things coming on, when he wrote unto his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom the Holy Ghoſt made Biſhop and Overſeer; when he ſhewed him how he ſhould behave himſelf in the Houſe of God, concerning Elders, Fathers and Mothers, and concerning Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, ſaith he, <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they who labour in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for the Scripture ſaith, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the Oxe that treadeth out the Corn. The Labourer is worthy of his reward. I charge thee before God, and our Lord Jeſus Christ, and the elect Angels, that thou obſerve theſe things, without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality; laying hand ſuddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens ſins. Keep thy ſelf pure. If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholſome words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Doctrine which is according to godlineſs; he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about queſtions, and ſtrife of words; whereof cometh envy, ſtrife, railings, evil ſurmiſings, perverſe diſpute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute concerning the Truth; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that gain is godlineſs; from ſuch withdraw thy ſelf. But godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with contentment is great gain; for we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out; but having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. But they that will be rich fall into a temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while ſome have coveted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced themſelves thorow with many ſorrows. But thou, O man of God, fly theſe things,</hi> 1 Tim. 5, 6 Chapters.</p>
            <p>All that read this may ſee, that the bleſſed Apoſtle foreſaw the ſtate and condition the Church was falling into, and the time that hath been ſince, hath manifeſted the truth of it. And thus we ſee the good and wholeſome Doctrine, that the holy Apoſtle left with them that were Overſeers in thoſe dayes, that had the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus living and dwelling in their hearts, but this Goſpel hath been hid from them that have been loſt. And this may ſerve for the Sixth Head, which is, their <hi>Maintenance.</hi>

            <p>It is true, <hi>Aaron</hi> when he was to miniſter in the Prieſts Office, there were holy Garments to be made for him, for beauty and for glory: And theſe were the Garments which they were to make; a Breſt-plate, an Ephod, and a Robe, a broidered Coat, a Mitre and a Girdle; and they were to take two Stones, two Onix ſtones, and grave on them the names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſet them in four rows; and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhall bear the names of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Breſt-plate of Judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in into the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord continually: and thou ſhalt put in the Breſt-plate of Judgment the Urim, and the Thummim (which is, Lights and Perfections) and they ſhall be upon <hi>Aarons</hi> heart, when he goeth in before the Lord; and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhall bear the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon his heart before the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>Here was more than the long Gown and the Surplice, the Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet and the hood, here was the Urim and the Thummim, and the Judgement of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon his heart: Alſo <hi>Aaron</hi> had a Breſt-plate of pure Gold, and graven upon it like the engraving of a Signet, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> Verſ. 36. This is far beyond the long Robes of our dayes; for there is little holineſs graven upon them, neither Lights nor Perfections; and if they do take the long Robes and Surplices, Hoods and Tippets, from <hi>Aaron,</hi> they miſs the Garbe and Faſhion of this, for upon the Hemme of <hi>Aarons</hi> Garment there was Bells, and Pomgranets of gold; <hi>A golden Bell and a Pomegranet, a golden Bell and a Pomegranet round about the hem;</hi> and this was to be upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> when he went to miniſter, that his ſound might be heard when he was to go in the Holy Place before the Lord. But they ſet Bells upon the top of their Steepls in ſtead of theſe, to make People hear the ſound when they go to their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And ſo in this, as in all other things that have been ſhewed, they differ far from Scripture-Rule.</p>

               <hi>Moreover the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>Thus ſhall</hi> Aaron <hi>go into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place, with a young Bullock for a ſin-offering, and a Ram for a burnt-offering; and he ſhall put on the holy linnen Coat, and he ſhall have the linnen Breeches upon his fleſh, and ſhall be girded with a linnen Girdle, and with the linnen Mitre ſhall he be attired, theſe are the holy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, therefore ſhall he waſh his fleſh in water, and ſo put them on,</hi> Levit. 16.</p>
            <p>So here we ſee <hi>Aaron</hi> was to bring a Bullock and a Ram, for a burnt-offering, and a ſin-offering, and to waſh his fleſh before he put thoſe Garments on. It is to be feared, that our Long-Robed and Surplice-Men miſs it in this too, except they offer a ſin-offering, and a burnt-offering, and waſh their fleſh. We do not hear they uſe this, they calling themſelves Miniſters of Chriſt, and of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: but certainly they have not taken up the imitation of theſe things from hence, from <hi>Aarons</hi> Garments, but from the Scribes and Phariſees, for from Chriſt and his Apoſtle they had none at all, but the quite contrary: For Chriſt Jeſus when he ſpake to the Multitude, and his Diſciples, ſaid, <hi>The Scribes and the Phariſees ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>Seat, and that which they bid you obſerve and do, obſerve; but do not ye after their works, for they ſay and do not; and all their works they do to be ſeen of men. They make broad their Philactaries, or Frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and enlarge the borders of their Garments; and love the upermoſt rooms at Feaſts, and the chiefeſt ſeats in the Synagogues.</hi> But he ſaith, <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye ſhut up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven againſt men, for ye neither go in your ſelves, nor ſuffer them that would.

Surely the Diſciples and Apoſtles after they had heard Chriſt thus often to teſtify againſt them, that went after this manner, certainly they would keep themſelves clear, for ever going in this garb. Beſides, it is clearly manifeſted by their practices, that they never went after this manner, in long Robes and Surplices, for that would have been a great charge to them, that wrought with their hands, and were not chargable to any, except thoſe that were raiſed up by the power of Almighty God, by their preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt unto them, the Lord might move their hearts to give them what they ſhould ſtand in need of, which they could not want, if thoſe had it, that were one with them in the Spirit; for ſo the Apoſtle holdeth forth to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord greatly, that now at laſt your care of me hath flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, wherein ye were alſo careful, but ye lacked opportunity; not that I ſpeak in reſpect of want, for I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content. I know how to be abaſed, and how to abound, every where in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full and to be hungry; both to abound, and to ſuffer need; notwithſtanding ye have done well, that ye did communicate with mine affliction: for even in Theſſalonica ye ſent once and again to my neceſſity; not becauſe I deſire a gift, but I deſire fruit, that that may abound to your account: But I have all, and abound, and am full,</hi> Phil. 4. But ſurely they bought no long Robes, nor Surplices with this, ſince that Chriſt Jeſus had ſo often exhorted them, to beware of them that went in ſuch.</p>
            <p>And again <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith unto thoſe he wrote to, <hi>Let your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be honeſt among the Gentiles; that whereas they ſpeak of them as evil doers, they may be put to ſilence by their good works; and that they ſhould be as free, not uſing their Liberty for a Cloak of malitiouſneſs, but as the Servants of God.</hi> And thus much for the ſeventh and laſt Head, which is their <hi>Garb</hi> and <hi>Habit,</hi> which all that reade the Scriptures may ſee, that Chriſt nor his Apoſtles ever uſed ſuch.</p>
            <p>So now, let the Reader, as he readeth over this Treatiſe, weigh and try by the Scriptures, their wayes and actions, for Chriſt hath left us a rule, how we ſhould know them by their fruits. For, ſaith he, <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets, which come unto you in ſheeps cloathing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves: Ye ſhall know them by their fruit. Do men gather grapes of thornes, or figgs of thiſtles? Even ſo every good tree, bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree, bringeth forth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54902:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fruit; a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tree bring forth good fruit: Wherefore by their fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> Mat. 7. Luke 6. 43.</p>
            <p>So by this which hath been ſhewed and tried by the Scriptures, comparing their Doctrine, Practice, and Worſhip with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, let the honeſt in heart judge, whether this Goſpel that they have preached, and which hath been holden forth for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years, whether this Goſpel be not another Goſpel, than that the Apoſtles preached; and that which the Apoſtle feared is come to paſs, where he ſaith, <hi>I fear leſt by any means, as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtilty, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity which is in Chriſt: For if he that cometh preacheth another Jeſus, whom we have not preached; or if ye receive another Spirit which we have not received, or another Goſpel which ye have not accepted: I marvel ye are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt, into another Goſpel, which is not another; but there are ſome that trouble you, and would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt. But though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed. As I ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, if any man preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accurſed,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. Gal. 1. And thus you may ſee, that their Miniſtry hath been neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law nor Goſpel; and let the Lord judge between theſe two.</p>
            <p>And now a few <hi>Queries</hi> to the Biſhops, Miniſtry and Clergy, of what ſort ſoever, whether <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that have been in this time of Apoſtacy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether that Light, which <hi>John</hi> was ſent to bear witneſs of, <hi>John</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>which is the true Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;</hi> Whether this Light be not the ſame as it was, and hath the ſame Power that hver it had? ſince Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the Light of the world,</hi> John 8. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the New Covenant, which the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by this Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> which was a Light of the Gentiles, and was to be God's Salvation to the ends of the Earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42, and 49 Chapters. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31, and 24, Chap. Which Propheſies Old <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaw fulfilled, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 30, 31, 32. VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

this New Covenant, which the Lord ſaith ſhould <hi>be an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant in the laſt dayes</hi> (which Covenant the Apoſtle bears teſtimony of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.) whether this Covenant (which is the Law written in the heart) be not the ſame as ever it was, yea or nay?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Word of Faith,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is nigh in the heart,</hi> even the <hi>Word</hi> that he preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not the ſame as ever? ſince Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my Word ſhall not paſs away,</hi> Mat. 24. 35. Mark. 13. 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whether the Miniſtration of the Spirit, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaid, <hi>was glorious;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 17. Whether this Spirit hath not the ſame power and efficacy to work in the hearts of People, as ever it had, yea or nay?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whether the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, that was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Apoſtles by his Spirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. Whether this Spirit hath not the ſame power to reveal now, as ever it had? ſince Chriſt Jeſus ſaith, <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him,</hi> Mat. 11. 27. John 3. 35. chap. 6. 46. Whether this Revelation of Chriſt Jeſus, be not of the ſame force and power as ever it was, yea or nay?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And if ſo, that the Light of Chriſt which is the New Covenant, and the Word of Faith which is nigh in the heart, and the Spirit that he hath put in the inward parts, by which the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Jeſus Chriſt is known, be the ſame as ever: Then why is not the miniſtration of the Spirit, and thoſe that are inſpired by the Almighty, the Miniſters that are allowed of, and ſet up by the Powers of the Nation? And why is ſuch a Miniſtry ſet up and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of by the Powers of the Nation, who deny Revelation, and do not wait for Revelation, but ſay it is ceaſed? And why are ſuch Miniſters allowed of, and ſet up by the Powers of the Nation, who do not only deny Revelation, and ſo deny Chriſt Jeſus, but they alſo ſtir up the Magiſtrates, and thoſe that have the Civil Power, to Perſecute, to Impriſon, to Premunire, and to Baniſh ſuch as have the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, and are Inſpired by the Almighty, with the ſame Spirit and Power as the Apoſtles had?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54902:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Why is not the Church of Chriſt now in God, as the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> was? 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 1. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 1. And why is now a houſe made with Wood and Stone, called the Church? ſince Chriſt ſaith unto <hi>Peter,</hi> when he confeſſed that he was the Chriſt, the Son of the Living God; <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, Fleſh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee. Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I build my Church.</hi> But this Rock was not <hi>Peter,</hi> as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> ſay, but it was upon that <hi>Revelation</hi> which Chriſt ſaid his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father had revealed unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Why is not the Worſhip of God performed in the Spirit, and in the Truth, according as Chriſt Jeſus publiſhed and declared in the Mountain at <hi>Samaria</hi> unto the woman, which <hi>Jeſus</hi> confeſſed unto, and ſaid, when ſhe ſpake of the Meſſiah, and of Chriſt, <hi>I am he;</hi> he ſaid unto her, <hi>That the hour cometh, and now is, that the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth; for ſuch the Father ſeeketh to worſhip him; God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him muſt worſhip him in Spirit and Truth,</hi> John 4. And why is not this Spirit waited in, and for, in the Worſhip that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally performed, and allowed of in our Nation? ſince that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are the Circumciſion which worſhip God in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and have no confidence in the Fleſh,</hi> Phil. 3. 3. And why is the Worſhip which is generally performed among people, and their Doctrines taught from and by the Commandments of men, ſeeing they profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, being Chriſt complained of this Worſhip? And ſaith, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrine the Traditions of men; this people draweth near to me with their mouthes, and honoureth me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me:</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>Let them alone, they are Blind Leaders of the Blind: and if the Blind lead the Blind, both ſhall fall into the Ditch,</hi> Matth. 15. 8, 9, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> And why is not the Worſhip of God performed among thoſe that profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, and Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Unity of the Spirit? ſince the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led Captivity captive, and gave Gifts unto men, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt; till we all come into the Unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto the perfect man,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54902:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 13. And why is there ſuch Difference in Religion, and Opinions, as there hath been between <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and many others, even to the Killing and Slaying one of another, ſince that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves to be Chriſtians? and the Spirit of Chriſt is but one; and the Apoſtle exhorts them here, <hi>To endeavour to keep the Unity of the Spirit, and the Bond of Peace.</hi> And if they have received thoſe Gifts from on High, which are for the Work of the Miniſtry; then why are there ſuch Differences among them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Why is there not that Liberty, and Order in their Meetings and Aſſemblies, who profeſs themſelves to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as was in and among the Apoſtles and their Churches? For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace, for ye may all propheſie one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted: And the Spirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets; for God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. So if this was the Order of the Churches of the Saints, how is it that always one man is ſet up to Speak to all the reſt of the People, it may be for many years together? ſince that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That there is diverſity of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit; and there are differences of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, but the ſame Lord; and there are diverſities of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the ſame God which worketh all in all; but the Manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. Rom. 12. 4. Since that the Spirit is given to every man; how is it that poor people have had one man ſet up to teach them, it may be thirty or forty years together, and whatſoever was revealed to him that ſat by, they were not permitted to ſpeak? but they might be haled before Magiſtrates; and it may be ſtockt, or whipt, for doing that which the Scripture alloweth of; and here are Chriſt words fulfilled, where he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall be haled before Magiſtrates, and perſecuted for my Name ſake, for a teſtimony againſt them, and they that kill you think they do God good ſervice,</hi> John 16. 2.</p>
            <p>And theſe few Queries are for all the Clergy in the Chriſtian World to anſwer, whether they be <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

            <p>IT hath been an Old Proverb and Maxime among men, <hi>No Biſhop, no King;</hi> this is but a ſuppoſition that is got into the minds of people in theſe late times, which hath proceeded and riſen from among thoſe of that Function, and their Adherents, being that their power ſtandeth onely by the Kingly Power; for it might rather be ſaid, <hi>No King, no Biſhop.</hi> But to add to their Strength and Aſſiſtance, they have added this, and have got it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minds of people, that if there be <hi>No Biſhop, no King;</hi> but it is otherwiſe: for it is by experience known, and that by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Example.</p>
            <p>For in the Reigns of all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we do not read that there was a Biſhops Power, nor Eccleſiaſtical nor Spiritual Courts; neither <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the great; neither <hi>Cyrus,</hi> unto whom the Lord ſaid, <hi>Thou art mine Anointed, whoſe right hand I have upholden to ſubdue Nations, I will looſe the Loyns of Kings, to open before thee the Leaved Gates; I will give thee the Treaſures of darkneſs, and the hidden Riches of ſecret places, that thou mayeſt know, that I the Lord which calleth thee by thy name, am the God of</hi> Iſrael, Iſa. 45.

Then there was <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> which beheaded <hi>John Baptiſt;</hi> this <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were made Friends the ſame day that Chriſt was under Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for before they had been at enmity: And <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> being high Prieſts, they ſought how they might kill Jeſus; <hi>And the Band of Souldiers led Jeſus away to</hi> Annas <hi>firſt, for he was Father-in-law to</hi> Caiaphas, <hi>which was the high Prieſt the ſame year: Now</hi> Caiaphas <hi>was he which gave counſel to the Jews, that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that one man ſhould die for the people,</hi> John 18. 13, 14. <hi>And when</hi> Pilate <hi>had called together the chief Prieſts, and the Rulers, and ſaid unto them, Ye brought this man unto me as one that perverted the people, and I have examined him before you, and have found no fault in him, nor yet</hi> Herod; <hi>and they accuſed him vehemently,</hi> Luke 23. Matth. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The chief Prieſts and Elders ſought falſe witneſs againſt Jeſus to put him to death, and when they found falſe Witneſſes that witneſſed againſt him, Jeſus ſaid nothing: And the high Prieſt aroſe, and ſaid, Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou nothing? And he ſaid, I adjure thee by the Living God that thou tell us if thou be the Chriſt: Jeſus ſaid unto him, Thou hast ſaid it: Hereafter ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man ſitting at the right hand of Power. Then the high Prieſt rent his clothes, and ſaid, He hath ſpoken Blaſphemy. And when the morning was come, all the chief Prieſts and Elders took counſel to put him to death; and when they had led him away, they delivered him to</hi> Pontius Pilate, Matth. 27. Mark 15. <hi>And when</hi> Pilate <hi>asked of them, Will ye that I releaſe unto you the King of the Jews? But the chief Prieſts moved the people, that he ſhould rather releaſe</hi> Barabbas. <hi>And</hi> Pilate <hi>ſaid, What will ye then that I ſhall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? and they cried, Crucifie him, crucifie him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> Ananias <hi>ſent him bound unto</hi> Caiaphas, <hi>the high Prieſt, and he asked him of his Diſciples, and of his Doctrine; Jeſus anſwered, Why askeſt thou me? ask them that heard me: And one of the Officers ſtruck Jeſus with the palm of his hand, and ſaid, Anſwereſt thou the high Prieſt ſo? And Jeſus ſaid, If I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil; if well, Why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then they led Jeſus from</hi> Caiaphas <hi>the high Prieſt, into the Hall

of Judgment, and Pilate went unto them, and ſaid, Take ye him, and judge him according to your Law: the Jews therefore ſaid unto him, It is not lawfull for us to put a man to death,</hi> John 18. But they looked upon it lawfull to accuſe him falſely, and vehemently to accuſe him, and to cry out, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him,</hi> and to deſire <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas,</hi> that was found in an Inſurrection, and a Murtherer, to be releaſed, and to cry, that Chriſt the Lamb of God might be Crucified; alſo after the ſame manner did they with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
            <p>And thoſe Scribes and Elders that caught <hi>Stephen</hi> and brought him, and ſet up Falſe Witneſſes to witneſs againſt him, the high Prieſt with the Councel ſaid, <hi>Are theſe things ſo?</hi> And after <hi>Stephen</hi> opened his mouth, and ſpake unto them, and opened through the Scriptures; and when they heard thoſe things that <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpake from the Scriptures, <hi>They gnaſhed on him with their teeth,</hi> Acts 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>ſpake unto the people, the Prieſts and Captain of the Temple, and the Sadduces came upon them; and then</hi> Ananias <hi>the high Prieſt, and</hi> Caiaphas, <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>and</hi> Alexander, <hi>and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as were of the Kindred of the high Prieſt, were gathered together to take counſel againſt</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>after they had wrought the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle upon the Impotent man; and when they could find nothing againſt them, they threatned them, and let them go,</hi> Acts 4.</p>
            <p>And what ado made they with <hi>Paul,</hi> for all he was one of their own Nation, and made his Defence before them; and called them Men, and Brethren, and Fathers, and ſpake unto them in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Tongue, and told them how the Lord had converted him, <hi>As alſo the high Prieſts doth bear me witneſs, and all the Elders, from whom alſo I received Letters unto the Brethren, and went to</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>to bring them which were there in Priſon to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to be puniſhed,</hi> Acts 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> that had been one of their Servants, and had acted in the ſame way with them in Perſecution, after he was converted to the Chriſtian Faith, he received no more favour from them than others; for afterwards when <hi>Paul</hi> was brought before the Council to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, wherefore he was ſo accuſed; <hi>And Paul earneſtly beholding the Council, ſaid, Men and Brethren, I have lived in all good conſcience before God until this day: And the high Prieſt</hi> Ananias <hi>commanded
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54902:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them that ſtood by him, to ſmite him on the mouth: Then ſaid</hi> Paul, <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee, thou whited wall; and they that ſtood by, ſaid, Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thou Gods high Prieſt? Then ſaid</hi> Paul, <hi>I wiſt not Brethren, that he was the high Prieſt; for it is written, Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of thy People. Paul</hi> acknowledged, and confeſſed his Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Law, where it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the Gods, nor curſe the Ruler of thy People,</hi> Exod. 22. 28. But <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods, but ye ſhall die like men:</hi> And ſo it appeareth by this high Prieſt; for he was far from executing of his duty, where he ſate to judge according to the Law, when he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſmite the Priſoner contrary to the Law, and afterwards gave conſent to the People to bind themſelves in an Oath to murther <hi>Paul,</hi> but were prevented by the chief Chaptain and Souldiers, Acts 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And after five dayes</hi> Ananias <hi>the high Prieſt, deſcended with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who enformed the Governor againſt</hi> Paul, <hi>and ſaid, We have found this man a peſtilent fellow, a mover of ſedition among the Jews, throughout the whole world, a Ring-leader of the Sect of the Nazarens,</hi> with much more. <hi>And when</hi> Felix <hi>heard their Accuſations of him, he deferred the examination of him,</hi> Acts 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Likewiſe, when</hi> Feſtus <hi>was come into the Province, then the high Prieſt, and the chief of the Jews informed him alſo againſt</hi> Paul, <hi>and deſired favour againſt him, and beſought him, that he would ſend for him to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>lying in wait by the way to kill him: but</hi> Feſtus <hi>anſwered, That</hi> Paul <hi>ſhould be kept at</hi> Ceſarea, Acts 25.</p>
            <p>By theſe places, with much more that the Scripture maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, we may ſee the cruelty, and bloody-mindedneſs of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heſe high Prieſts, that were then Rulers of the Nation of the People of the Jews, under the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy: for they were always worſe in cruelty againſt the Chriſtians then the Heathens; and joyned with the Kings, and incenſed them what they could againſt the Chriſtians, as is manifeſted; for they joyned with that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> that crucified Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Alſo when King <hi>Herod</hi> heard that Jeſus was born in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> he gathered the chief Prieſts, and all the Scribes of the People together, to demand of them where he was to be born, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54902:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to kill him, but the Lord prevented him, who in his Rage ſlew all the young children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo</hi> Herod <hi>the King that killed</hi> James <hi>the Brother of</hi> John <hi>with the Sword; and becauſe that he ſaw it pleaſed the Jews; he proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and took</hi> Peter <hi>and caſt him into Priſon; and when Prayer was made to the Lord for</hi> Peter, <hi>and that the Lord delivered him out of Priſon, there was no ſmall ſtir among the Souldiers, what was become of</hi> Peter: <hi>And when</hi> Herod <hi>had ſought him, but found him not, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the Keepers of the Piſon ſhould be put to death. But when this</hi> Herod <hi>was arrayed in Royal Apparel upon his Throne, the Lord ſmote him by his Angel, immediately he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghoſt,</hi> Acts 12.</p>
            <p>This with much more might be inſtanced concerning this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men, of their cruelty and oppreſſion, joyning with the Heathen Monarchs in the crucifying and perſecuting of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and all his holy Apoſtles, and all the Primitive Chriſtians: But we never heard of any Biſhops, neither in the time of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor in all the four Manarchies before Chriſts time; neither in the dayes of the Apoſtles, nor in the Primitive times, there was no ſuch Biſhops as had Courts, and Laws, to make people to Swear, and to impriſon them if they would not; ſuch, as there could not be Kings without there were Biſhops.</p>
            <p>For Chriſt Jeſus, nor none of his Apoſtles, ſought not after, neither looked after Earthly Kingdoms; for he ſaid, <hi>His Kingdom was not of this World, neither could his Servants fight.</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſaid, <hi>The Weapons of their warfare, were not Carnal, but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; neither did they wreſtle with Fleſh and Blood, but with Spiritual Wickedneſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo they that are true Chriſtians, and of the ſame Faith and Principle that Chriſt Jeſus was of, they deſire not <hi>Caeſars</hi> due nor right, but give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which bears his own Image, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward earthly Image, and the money that bears the Superſcription of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Prerogative, this they can give unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and not wrong any man of his outward Propriety or Prerogative; for they ſeek not after earthly Crowns nor Inheritances, but after heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Apoſtle when he wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> exhorted, <hi>That firſt of all Supplications, Prayers, and Interceſſions, might be made for all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54902:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men; for Kings, and all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all godlineſs and honeſty; for this is good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, who would have all men to be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he wrote to him that was a Biſhop, which if any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth the Office of, he deſireth a good work, for it is no more then to be an Overſeer of the Church of Chriſt, and not to look after carnal means, or carnal maintenance, neither to be a burden or an oppreſſion to the People, nor to be upholden by men, or the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Earth; ſuch Biſhops and Overſeers of the Church of God as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were, and all thoſe holy Apoſtles the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mention, we ſhould be glad of, <hi>Such as are lovers of Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, lovers of Good Men, not given to Wine, not greedy of filthy Lucre, but Patient; not a Brawler, not Covetous;</hi> for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The love of Money is the Root of all Evil; which, while ſome have coveted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows.</hi> Such things as theſe the Apoſtle exhorted <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> from, which many of the Biſhops in our dayes, and for the laſt twelve hundred years and upwards, it is to be feared, they are fallen into <hi>Demas</hi> his way, and trodden his paths, and have forſaken the Apoſtles Spirit, Doctrine and Principle, and have embraced this preſent world; and here hath been the miſery of theſe Ages laſt paſt: But this is that which Chriſt Jeſus foreſaw, which he mentions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24, and 25 Chap. As alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> foreſaw, when he told them, That <hi>grievous Wolves ſhould enter into the Church, not ſparing the flock, Acts</hi> 20. 29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 18. All theſe had a true ſight of the dayes of darkneſs, and night of Apoſtacy that was coming on.</p>
            <p>As alſo the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>which he ſent and ſignified by his Angel to his ſervant John; he ſaw the Beaſt riſe out of the Sea, and out of the Earth, and power was given to him for forty and two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths-</hi>(and this power began at <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the foundation of the Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual Power; and here was the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that was called, his Holineſs, and his Children are called as high as they can; but <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not ſuch) <hi>who made war with the Saints, and overcame them, and power was given unto him over all Tongues, Kindreds and Nations, and his power was to endure above twelve hundred years. And one of the ſeven Angels, that had the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54902:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeven vials, ſhewed him the judgment of the great Whore, with whom the Kings of the earth had committed fornication, and the Inhabitants of the earth had made themſelves drunk with the wine of her fornication. And he ſaw a Woman ſit upon a ſcarlet-coloured Beaſt, full of names of Blaſphemy, having ſeaven Heads, and ten Horns, which Beaſt he had ſeen before,</hi> Chap. 13. And when <hi>John</hi> marvelled, the Angel ſaid unto him, <hi>Wherefore doſt thou marvel? I will tell thee the Myſtery of the Woman, and of the Beaſt that carrieth her,</hi> Chap. 17. And ſo, <hi>He that hath wiſdom may reade, and count the number of the Beaſt, for it is</hi> 666.</p>
            <p>And this Proverb which hath continued ſo long, <hi>No Biſhop, no King,</hi> hath riſen out of the Bottomleſs-pit, and muſt go into Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for there were no ſuch Biſhops in the times of the four Monarchies before Chriſt, neither among the Primitive Chriſtians, that had Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and toſſed poor people up and down, and cauſed them to ſwear, contrary to Chriſt's command, which they have nothing to do with, wrangling among them for getting of money. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They ſhould be no Brawlers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now this uſurping power is gotten up under the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and becauſe it is upholden by Monarchial Power, it hath hatched a Cockatrice into the minds of People, <hi>No Biſhop, no King:</hi> but this we can ſay, That Kings have reigned by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord God, and may reign as long as it pleaſeth him; and God ſent his Prophet to anoint a King.</p>
            <p>So can we ſay that this uſurping Power hath been alwayes againſt and contrary to the power of the Lord God, and hath ever been the Oppreſſour of the Innocent and the Juſt, and Gods Heritage and People have alwayes been Sufferers in all Ages by this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this generation of Prieſts hath been the cauſe of all the Saints ſufferings; they ſtoned the Prophets, and ſlew them before Chriſt, and ye may ſee how they uſed Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And now in the Apoſtacy, O the Inquiſitions, the Racks, and the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Courts, Citations, and Impriſonments that have been, and are continually impoſed upon poor People: ſo that the very miſery of Nations cometh by theſe Uſurpers (and their Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in having Power) and Oppreſſors, and Layers on of Burdens, grievous to be born, that upon this Generation might come, all the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54902:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
righteous blood ſhed upon the Earth, from <hi>Abel, Mat.</hi> 23. 35, 36.</p>
            <p>But the Lord is coming to Redeem his People, and his Flock out of their covetous mouthes, and bloody hands; and the Lord hath ſent the Spirit of his Son into the hearts of his People, and his Light is riſen in their Conſciences, and the Lord will Teach them all Himſelf, and ſet them free from the bondage and ſlavery of theſe Taskmaſters; and he hath committed all Power in Heaven and Earth unto his Son, and he hath all Times and Seaſons in his hands; and it is good for Kings that are ſet up by the Lord, to fear him, that by his Power they may ſtand; and not uphold that power that God will throw down; for he is come to Reign, and Teach his People himſelf.
