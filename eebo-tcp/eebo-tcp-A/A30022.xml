            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my former Books I thought my ſelf obliged to Apologize for my writing againſt the Errors of the Quakers, becauſe ſome People then, even the Author of <hi>the Snake in the Graſs,</hi> &amp;c. thought I might wrong them, as the Quakers ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, who ſince are better ſatisfied therein, their Mask being taken off: But yet ſome objections ſtill remain, to obviate which, I ſhall proceed to do.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Obj. 1.</label> But ſay ſome, <hi>Fra. Bugg</hi> in his Book Entituled, <hi>The Qua. Detected,</hi> &amp;c. gave a tollerable account of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers reſpecting their beginning; and now to write contrary ſeems contradictory.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſ.</label> I do acknowledge, that in the year <hi>1686.</hi> when I wrot that Book, I had better thoughts of them, reſpecting their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="tcp:40372:3"/>
than now I have; neither did I then in <hi>1686.</hi> know them guilty of holding ſuch pernicious Principles and Fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, as now I know they do; having then not ſeen many of their Books, which ſince I have both ſeen and peruſed. But grant I did not ſo clearly ſee them then as now, nor underſtand their Fundamental Errors ſo clearly then as now; yet I ſaw enough to juſtifie my ſeparation from them, from the charge of Apoſtacy, as I made fully appear, not only in that Book, but alſo in my Book, <hi>i. e. New Rome unmask'd,</hi> &amp;c. neither did my acknowledging them and their deportment, and the ſimplicity and plainneſs of their Carriage, which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them and their Doctrine [which I ſince underſtand was only a decoy to catch ſimple Souls] to be a reaſon for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Orthodox, and my ſelf an Apoſtate from the Chriſtian Faith, ſince not only I, but Men more Learned, and of better Judgments than I have been miſtaken; Witneſs that famous Man and worthy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of Jeſus Chriſt, Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer.</hi> See <hi>Fox</hi>'s Acts and Mon. p. <hi>1488.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Taught in the beginning a pure Doctrine; but after ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:40372:3"/>
fell into the new Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, I marvel that any one could allow it if they knew it: But, whatever they bear the people in hand, that which they write in their Books hath neither Truth nor Comfort. Again p. <hi>1325. ibid.</hi> I am [ſaid <hi>Huge Latimer</hi> that worthy Martyr] Ignorant of things which I truſt hereafter to know, as I do now know things in which I have been Ignorant heretofore; ever learn, and ever to be learned to profit with learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I thought in time paſt that the Pope was Chriſt's Vicar, had been Lord of all the World as Chriſt is: So that, if he ſhould have deprived the King of his Crown it had been enough, for he could do no wrong: Now I think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. I thought in time paſt that if I had been a Fryer in a Coul I could not have been Damned, nor afraid of Death; and by reaſon thereof, I have been minded many times to have been a Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, namely when I was ſore ſick and diſeaſed: But now I behold my Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Fooliſhneſs. It were two long to tell you what blindneſs I have been in,
<pb facs="tcp:40372:4"/>
and how long it were e'er I could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſuch Folly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Reader, Theſe two Inſtances (if there were no more) ſhew forth, that the beſt of Men are fallible and may err as I did, and be miſtaken; as alſo the Humility of theſe two learned Prelates and worthy Martyrs are exemplary in their Chriſtian acknowledgment thereof, and forſaking ſuch a corrupted Church, infected with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Superſtition, which cleared them from the charge of Apoſtacy; and the ſame cauſe leads to the ſame thing: And if I once had a good opinion of the Quakers, you ſee theſe famous Men had as good, if not a better opinion of the Papiſts, who yet left them and forſook them as I did the Quakers; and for which I bleſs God, who put it into my heart to forſake ſuch a manifeſt Hereſie. <hi>Amen.</hi>

<q>O thou filthy Beaſt, no Prayers can we ſend to thee, but for thy Deſtruction, thou Man of Sin and Enemy of Chriſt.—O thou impudent and brazen fac'd;—thou Hypocrite and Phariſee thou art damn'd openly.—Thou art in the Sorcery, in the Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and in the Adultery, and in the corrupt Seed, whoſe Bleſſings are Curſed.—O thou ſlanderous Beaſt;—thou na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Brute-beaſt:—and here I charge thee to be a Witch, and to bewitch the People.—Thou deaf Adder and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,—thou child of the Devil, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Enemy of all Righteouſneſs.—O thou falſehearted diſſembling Hypocrite; the Plagues of God are due to thee, and that is thy portion,—thou blind Sot,—thou dark Sot;—thy Torment is but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and ſo fare thee well:</q> 

Thus far <hi>Fox.</hi> Again, hear another of the ſame Praternity, viz. <hi>Ed. Burrow</hi> in his Works p. <hi>29, 30, 31.</hi> In Anſwer to certain Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſent to the Quakers by one Mr. <hi>Bennet, Burrow</hi>'s Anſwer runs in this Channel, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>All which idle Drollery and ridiculous Nonſence is vindicated by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> in his Epiſtle prefixed to this <hi>Sam. Fiſher</hi>'s Works, ſaying, <q>It was ſo ordered by God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that his <hi>[Fiſher</hi>'s] part fell to be moſt Controverſial, in which to carry a clear Mind, and an even Hand, is very difficult: However allowing him, in ſome paſſages, the freedom of the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> againſt the Prophets of <hi>Baal [1 Kings 18, 27.]</hi> ſometimes expoſing abſurd things

            <p>Now, if the Quakers will have allowance from the Prophets to vent this ſort of wild Gibberiſh, I hope I may take a little li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to expoſe their abſurd Principles to the juſt abhorrence and deriſion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

The one to the World, to decoy people, the other to their Friends to be read in their Meetings, inſomuch as 'tis hard to know a Quaker, who, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaid in his third Book againſt Hereticks, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Whil'ſt Hereticks ſpeak like the Faithful, they not only mean otherwiſe than what they ſay, but clean contrary; and by their Tenets full of Blaſphemy, they deſtroy the Souls of thoſe, who with their fair words ſuck in the poyſon of their foul Opinions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And no marvel (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) for Satan himſelf is transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into an Angel of light: therefore it is no great thing if his miniſters be alſo transformed as the miniſters of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, whoſe end ſhall be according to their works, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>13. 14.</hi> And for our pattern we have the famous <hi>Wickliff,</hi> who

               <head>The PROLOGUE.</head>
               <p>WHen I firſt heard of the ſaid Hiſtory, I thought it might have ſpared me this Labour; hoping it would have given an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Account; not only of the coming in of that Sect, of the names of the Perſons, of the places of their abodes, of their Handicraft profeſſions, of their tumultuous behaviours, of their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40372:9"/>
out their Defamations, and ſcurrilous Languages to Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and of their frequent diſturbing the Churches, and contemning the Ordinances of Chriſt and all Inſtituted Religion: <hi>But alſo</hi> the ways and methods by which Quakeriſm have grown and increaſed, and prevailed to this heigth it is now arrived at: But when I came to view it, and ſeriouſly to conſider the Contents of it, as I find it in many things very well done, with reſpect to the former particulars, and thereby will ſpare me ſome pains and coſt; ſo with reſpect to the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſet forth their pernicious Doctrines, their horrible Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, their diſſembling Cheats and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Frauds; [by which they have not only deceived Thouſands, but almoſt perſwaded many well meaning and worthy Gentlemen to have a better eſteem of them, and their Tenets, than they deſerve] I found it very deficient, <hi>viz.</hi> In ſhewing the methods by which they have riſen, and their Hypocriſie and wretched ways by which they have ſpread their blaſphemous Errors, and pernicious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and how they have unchurched all but themſelves; and thereupon it ſeemed to me, that the ſaid Hiſtory rather tends to ſtrengthen them in their Errors, then to help them out of them; for it bends too much to the left hand, and reflects on our Engliſh Magiſtrates as Perſecutors, and on our Church as not well diſciplired; which I charitably preſume, was occationed by that Learned Authors giving
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40372:9"/>
too much credit to the Books and Manuſcripts, and his converſation with ſome of them, for ſaith he, p. 5. <q>Since therefore I have had the fortune of a long time to be familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and much converſant with theſe men call'd Quakers, and that in many places, and beſides, many of their Writings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, of which ſome are in print, ſome not, having fallen into my hands I thought it would be an acceptable Enterpriſe to write upon this Subject, leaving it for every Man to judge as he thinks fit, of their Actions, Tenets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And ſince I find the ſaid Hiſtory as above obſerv'd, to be deficient in the main Part, at leaſt, in many main Points, I ſhall write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of Correction, which I hope neither he, nor any other indifferent Perſon will take amiſs, ſince I pretend to have as much experience and knowledge of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers as he can pretend too, having the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be many Years converſant with them and their Teachers, as alſo the good fortune to know their Methods, to have of their Writings and Manuſcripts by me, ſome in print, ſome not, whereby I have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to derect them, and to confute their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; and ſo I ſhall leave it to every Man (as he ſaith) to judge as he pleaſeth of their Actions, Tenets, Cuſtoms, way of Church-Government, and principles of Religion, and Doctrine, which I ſhall produce from Book and Page of their moſt Authentick Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40372:10"/>
Firſt then, that it may appear I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to know the Quakers as well as this Learned Author, and thereupon as warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a Motive to write on this Subject: In the Year 1657. I went firſt amongſt the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; and in 1659. became one of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and continued amongſt them about 25 years; and ſince that time I have been a narrow obſerver of them, and much acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with many of them: I have near 300 of their Books by me, beſides Manuſcripts and old Records; and beſides all this, I was Clark to their Monthly and Quarterly Meetings for the Iſle of <hi>Ely</hi> and County of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> at <hi>Haddenham, Sutton</hi> and <hi>Chatteriſe,</hi> for about 16 years and more, in all which Service I ſerved <hi>gratis,</hi> without Sallery, as others had. My Houſe was a place of Entertainment for their Teachers for many years together: I ſuffered Impriſonment at <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Niſlech</hi> for their cauſe, in which I was then Embark'd 3 Years and about 4 Months: I ſuffered the loſs of more than a hundred Pounds for Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting contrary to an Act of Parliament, made the 22 King <hi>Charles</hi> II. beſides many other affairs in which I was concern'd whil'ſt with them: Sometimes choſen to go to <hi>London-</hi>Meetings, ſometimes choſen to end ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which happen'd amongſt us, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to aſſiſt in Marriages, about ſettlements of Eſtates in that caſe, as in the Inſtance of <hi>William Read</hi> Widower; and the Widow <hi>Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of <hi>Brund,</hi> and divers others, as <hi>Stephen</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40372:10"/>
                  <hi>Clackson</hi> and the Widow <hi>Young;</hi> I ſay put all together, and I think I may venture upon my own experience, to ſay as much as the Author of the ſaid <hi>Hiſt.</hi> and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I ſhall not impoſe upon my Reader; but in the main of what I ſhall write, I ſhall prove from matter of Fact, and then, as he ſays, ſhall leave every one to judge as he thinks fit, being at all times ready to appear and maintain what I write according to <hi>G. W.</hi>'s own propoſition in his printed Sheet, ſtiled <hi>The Quakers Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. And when I meet Mr. <hi>Croeſe</hi> I ſhall go along with him, in this Hiſtory, as far as he goes my way, and when he turns aſide to the right Hand or to the left, I ſhall part friendly with him, and deal kindly by him as we us'd to do to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. But ſince his Book came over the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and reflects upon the Government, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly charging the Magiſtrates with the crime of Perſecution, a thing they are much averſe to; I ſhall therefore endeavor to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie it, and ſhew him 'tis not perſecution, but proſecution; and to ſhew that I am not alone in this matter, I received a Letter wrot by a dignifyed Clergy-man of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to a Neighbouring Miniſter. An Abſtract thereof is as followeth, <hi>viz</hi>

                  <hi>GEorge Fox</hi> was born <hi>Anno</hi> 1624. in a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage call'd <hi>Draton</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire;</hi> his Father's Name was <hi>Chriſtopher Fox,</hi> his Mothers Name <hi>Mary,</hi> who gained their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by Weaving. This <hi>George</hi> afterwards learned the Trade of a Shoomaker, and wrought Journy work with <hi>George Gee</hi> of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40372:11"/>
                  <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> who having gained ſo much Learning as that he could read print pretty well, but writing he could read but little of, neither could write except very rudely. And this was the only piece of Learning he attained too all his Life long: For neither then nor any time after did he apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to any Liberal Study: So that he not only knew no other Language, ſave his Mother-Tongue; but even in that he was ſo little expert, and ſo ill qualified, either for Speaking or Writing, all the whole courſe of his Life; that what he underſtood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, he could not explain or inlarge upon, in any tollerable good <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and far leſs could he deliver it in Writing: And this I thought worth the remarking, becauſe a great many Books are extant in <hi>Geo. Fox</hi>'s Name, writ not only in Letters of Engliſh but alſo in Latin, and interlarded with Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of many other Languages which are but little known to the learned World, which whether it was an effect of ſimplicity in him, or of his Ambition and Oſtentation I will not determine, only 'tis plain he had not the gift of Tongues, p. 10. The Quakers Doctrine is for a great part of it New, or taken from ſome Ancient Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and rejected by the Church, which have lain ſo long dormant, are revived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new by them; and as to the reſt 'tis a medly or hotch-potch diametrically oppoſite to that of ours, and their manner of Life ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40372:12"/>
from all Chriſtians as poſſibly can be: And theſe are the Tenets they have ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſpread both at their firſt riſe, and in the further progreſs of the Sect; and all that are capable of Speaking or Writing, do diligently apply themſelves in all places, to the Explaining, Defending and Propagating their Doctrines, inveighng and railing againſt the contrary opinions in others, with as bitter and reviling expreſſions as they can invent. And ſuch their accuſatory Libels they diſperſe abroad into all Countries, p. 11. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Mother and Nurſe of the Quakers is <hi>England,</hi> a Country once famous, for Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and Extirpating Hereſies, now the Seat and Centre of all manner of Errors, p. 25. Nay when their Number increaſed they became bolder, going into Peoples Houſes when not invited, intruding themſelves into company, Litigiouſly ſtarting Controverſies. Thus would they <hi>belch</hi> out ignominious Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Slanders againſt Religious Men; and eſpecially the Miniſters of Churches, p. 26. And now would they publickly appear on the High-ways, in the Market-places, yea enter into Churches and that boldly too; finding fault with the Diſcourſes and Prayers of the Miniſters, diſparaging and defaming them and their actions with all manner of Inſolence and Impudence, p. 32. Charging them to Preach only for love of Lucre and Reward. But in all theſe controverſies he <hi>[George Fox]</hi> never conſidered how near of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40372:12"/>
Kin his own caſe was unto theirs; for tho' he pretended to take all this pains and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in running about to Preach Gratis, yet thoſe he Preached to, ſupplyed his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before he ask'd it of them, at leaſt-wiſe he never was denyed the Liberty of coming uncall'd for (as the Flies) and like (Mice) feeding upon others Proviſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Read the Gen.

Fox</hi> himſelf, gives the whole Relation: And I affirm, there is not one Charge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered or taken off as it ought to be, but rather all confeſſed: I muſt confeſs <hi>G. W.</hi> I believe is aſham'd of his Brother <hi>Fox,</hi> and of his Brother <hi>Milner</hi>'s Blaſphemy; but yet cannot, nay, will not condemn the Book; they have ſaid it and will ſtand to it, which puts me in mind of a ſtory I once heard of a Woman whoſe Son was going out Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, even at the Door; hold ſaid his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have ſomething to ſay, pray have a care of Lying, yea ſaid the Son; ay ſaid She my Son, I charge you not to tell a lye, and the Lad going out, ſtay Son ſaid the Woman, I ſay again, be ſure you do not tell Lies, but if it happen at any time that you do tell a Lye, beſure you ſtand in it, and ſo farewel.</p>
               <p>The Quakers ſay in print, that he that hath the Spirit that raiſed Jeſus Chriſt is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with God; <hi>He</hi> yea <hi>He,</hi> the Man; and all the Quakers that hear of this Book, I am perſuaded [becauſe the World's People have got it] would wiſh it were burnt; yet for a thouſand Worlds they would not have

the World know they burn it, ſo beloved a Point is Infallibility.</p>
               <p>The Quakers ſay in print, that 'tis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration to ſpeak out of the Scriptures, and not a Quaker is to be found that will condemn it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>George Fox</hi> ſaid he was Chriſt, the Way, the Truth, and the Life; not a Quaker found to condemn it.</p>

               <p>I could enumerate a hundred Blaſphemies like theſe, but the Quakers cannot condemn one.

                  <q>why, they ſee that the wicked Clergy's Intereſt is more proſpering than the juſt freedom of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And this I ſay unto you (the Parliament) in the Name of the Lord, that whil'ſt that Intereſt of the Prieſthood is ſo much favour'd and defended you can never proſper, nor the Nations be happy under you; for it is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40372:20"/>
one of the greateſt Oppreſſions this day of the Nation, the maintaining and upholding of this Miniſtry by Tythes, and the very Land groans under the Oppreſſion of this Church and Miniſtry, which lies as a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burthen, both upon Perſons and Eſtates, and Conſciences of many good People, even of your deareſt Friends: Their own doings are a ſufficient Teſtimony of the malice of their Hearts againſt you, and all good Men in the Nation; yet nevertheleſs ſome of you ſeem to ſhut your Eyes, crying up your Godly Miniſters; and thus are you blinded and ſee not were the Cauſe lies of your interruptions; I ſay 'tis the favouring of that Intereſt which ſtops the iſſue of good things, and while you oppreſs peoples Perſons, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and Conſciences to uphold this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Prieſthood aforeſaid, the Lord ſhall never proſper you, nor make the Nations happy under your charge; wherefore I do ſay unto you, it is high time for you to lay aſide the Intereſt of this oppreſſing Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſo much levened of the Whore of <hi>Rome;</hi> your ſelves do know that the Spirit of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy was in the late Biſhops, which you caſt out for their wickedneſs, and the very Spirit of thoſe Biſhops is entered into theſe Prieſts, and bears Rule in their Hearts, and thus by ſucceſſion, hath the Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> levened the Clergy of <hi>England.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore clear your ſelves; do not any longer Drink the Whores Cup, neither be you car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40372:20"/>
of her, and leave this falſe Church and Miniſtry to themſelves; for while you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and uphold this Miniſtry, Church and Worſhip, you do but cauſe People to drink the Whores Cup; and you are but them which carry the Whore, <hi>viz.</hi> the falſe Church, and this is plain dealing to tell you the truth, whether you will reject it or receive it: Wherefore caſt them off, and let them not ſurk under your Wings, for one day they will rebel againſt you, and another day flatter you; and for a ſeaſon they will ſhew forth much love and kindneſs to you in Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy; you had better be in a juſt oppoſition againſt them, than in an unjuſt peace with them. I know it appears to many of you a thing very hard to be born; what! to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our Godly Miniſters think ye? to hear tell of laying them aſide is an amaſement to ſome of your minds; was it not the ſame concerning the King and Biſhops? Was it not as much terrible to him and his Lords, and Councils to think of the overthrow of the then called Godly Fathers and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; but better had he caſt them off and ſaved himſelf, than to have periſhed with them; for I tell you again, that the very Spirit of the old Idolatrous Biſhops is ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Hearts of theſe Men, and there is as great a meaſure of Tyranny and Injuſtice, and Abomination lying upon theſe, as once was upon the Biſhops; and theſe are no leſs free from the abomination than they

were, and theſe are nigh as ripe for Vengeance, <hi>&amp;c. Burrows Epiſtle,</hi> &amp;c. And the word of the Lord we ſounded and did not ſpare, &amp; cauſed the deaf to hear, and the blind to ſee, and the dread of the Lord went before us and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us, and terror took hold on our Enemies. And firſt of all our mouths were opened, and and our Spirits filled with indignation againſt the Prieſts and Teachers, and with them and againſt them we firſt began to War, as being the cauſers of the People to err, and the blind leaders that carried the blind into the Ditch; and againſt them as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all wickedneſs abounding in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and as being the iſſue of Profaneſs, and againſt them we cryed, ſhewing unto all theſe People that they were not lawful Miniſters of Chriſt, but Deceivers and Antichriſts; and we ſpared not publickly, and at all ſeaſons, to utter forth the Judgments of the Lord againſt them, and their Ways, and their Churches, and Worſhips, and Practices; and this was our firſt Work we entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to threſh down the Deceivers and lay them open, that all People may ſee their ſhame and come to turn from them.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Truth,</hi> Prayer in the Spirit the Saints pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed, but thou art degenerated and hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſuch Prayers as the Lord hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, neither doth he open his Ear to them; and that which thou call'ſt the Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, be thou ſilent and make no mention of it, for thou haſt nothing to do with it;—Oh thou Adulterous <hi>Tradition!</hi> What Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous births haſt thou brought forth? Thy <hi>Common Prayer Book</hi> is ſeen to be conceived in thy <hi>Adulterous Womb,</hi> and to branch forth from the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tradition,</hi> but, what if my Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Book do not fully agree with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the Saints practice, yet there are many good things in it, and many Scripture ſentences which may edifie and comfort.</p>

                  <hi>Truth,</hi> that which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh, and that is againſt the Spirit, and can neither edifie nor comfort; though good Words and Scripture ſentences may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for it is not ſpeaking the Words of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that doth make a true Prayer, but in receiving a meaſure of the ſame Spirit of Prayer, which is not in thy Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Book to be found; therefore it is made of none effect becauſe thy bowels bring it forth, and the <hi>Pope</hi> gives <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Breath</hi> unto <hi>it,</hi> and from his Loyns it draws its Strength, and not from the power of God.</p>

                  <hi>Truth,</hi> now Tradition harken what Truth ſaith, and give thine Anſwer to what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of thee: Who made thy Archbiſhops and Lord Biſhops, and who gave them theſe Names? And who firſt divided unto them their ſeveral Dioceſſes, and appointed them to Rule within their own Dioceſs? And who firſt made Deans and Prebends, Doctors, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars, and Curates, and who gave them their Names? And who firſt ſet up certain Places for Schools? And who gave them the Names of Univerſities? And how came they to be call'd <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Colledge, and <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>John</hi>'s Colledge, and <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Colledge?

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40372:27"/>
that a Man muſt be made Batchelor of Art, and Maſter of Art, before he can be approv'd to be made a Miniſter in thy Order? And who firſt made that Law which forces and compels the payment of the Tenth part of things encreaſed, to ſuch a Miniſtry, and whether are ſuch the Miniſters of Chriſt, who make uſe of that Law to force their maintenance? Are theſe thy Biſhops and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters which thou ſay'ſt there can be nothing ſaid againſt them? Open thine Eye and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, for they are <hi>Monſters</hi> which from thy adulterous Conception are brought forth, and they are ſtamped with thy Image, and all thy abominations are denyed and teſtified againſt; this is a Charge againſt thee.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Truth,</hi> that which doth diſcover thee and thy deceitful Practices is the Truth <hi>[i. e.</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers] of God, which was before thou had'ſt a Name, and will be when thy Name is loſt; and it doth boldly reprove thee, and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fear of thee or thy power; and hath opened thee, and <hi>ript</hi> up thy <hi>Bowels,</hi> and diſcovered thy <hi>adulterous Womb,</hi> and all the falſe Conceptions that hath been conceived their; and now behold! ye Archbiſhops, Lord Biſhops, Deans, Prebends, Doctors, Vicars, and Curates, and all Prelaticals; here is the

                  <hi>Truth.</hi> Reader, marvel not too much at the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence of this Man, for it is the Heart of Quakeriſm: He was a right Quaker and no Mungril, and Eminent Teacher, and a ready Sail.

in the ſight of God and Men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> is Lawful King of this Realm, and all the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereun to belonging; and that neither the Pope nor the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any elſe by their Authority, have Right in any Caſe to depoſe the King, or diſpoſe of his Kingdom, or upon any ſcore whatever to abſolve his Subjects of their Obedience, or to give leave to any of them to Plot or Conſpire the hurt of the King's Perſon, his State or People; and that all ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Power, are Falſe, Pernicious, and Damnable?</p>
                  <p>And I do further ſincerely profeſs, and in good Conſcience declare, that I do not believe that the Pope is Chriſt's Vicar, or <hi>Peter's</hi> Lawful Succeſſor; or that he, or the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> joyntly, or ſeverally, are the Rule of Faith, or Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, or that they can Abſolve Sins; nor do I believe there is a Purgatory after Death; or that Saints ſhould be Prayed too, or Images in any ſenſe to be Worſhiped: Nor do I believe that there is any Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Lord's Supper; or Elements of Bread and Wine, at, or after the Conſecration thereof, by any Perſon whatſoever.

That <hi>George Fox</hi> had in one nights time 24 Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages given him by Divine Inſpiration, and I did believe it, and divers others of us for near 20 years; I alſo ſpake to a Quaker now living and ſtill eminent amongſt them, who told me he ever did believe it until the late diviſions. Thus by his counterfeit Miracles, his gift of Tongues, he ſtill like <hi>Simon Magus</hi> gave out that he was ſome great Man; for thus he wrot in the Introduction, viz. <hi>All Languages are to me no more than Duſt, who was before Languages were,</hi> &amp;c. and towards the end of the Book thus; <hi>next follow a few words to the whole matter by</hi> George Fox, <hi>who is before confuſion and many Languages were,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40372:38"/>
This, together with what I elſewhere have quoted out of his Books and Journals, ſhew that he was willing to be eſteemed a great Man, an old Man, a learned Man, a wiſe Man, an Angel, one that ſee the Heavens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> did, and much more to this purpoſe: By all which it appears, that he was a great Deceiver. And thus, Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm grew, and by deceit prevail'd in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: And ſince this learned Author hath given ſuch a full proof of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Pride, who being an Ignorant Fellow, as he ſtiles him, and yet deſirous to be taken for the Author of the ſaid Battle-door, containing Thirty Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40372:40"/>
ſomewhat to the purpoſe; but if ſincere then there is a vaſt Change in their Minds, both from their frequent diſputations, as well as their printed Books; and becauſe we cannot well try them by the firſt, therefore we will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Sincerity by the latter; and if their Books teach the contrary, then until they firſt condemn thoſe Books, we have no ground to believe them ſincere in what they ſay to ſerve a turn; I will at this time quote only two of them, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <q>Your imagined God beyond the Stars, and your carnal Chriſt is utterly denyed and teſtifyed againſt by the Light; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you [the Prieſt] ſay, that Chriſt is God and Man in one Perſon, it is a lye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now, if they believe as they write; how can they be ſincere in what they ſay, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove? for contraries cannot be the ſame; white is not black, neither is black white; Men never gathered Grapes of Thorns, nor Figs of Thiſtles; ye ſhall know them <hi>[i. e.</hi> Deceivers] ſaid Chriſt by their Fruit; this is an infallible rule.

So then, if the Scriptures, be Duſt, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Serpents-Meat, how are they Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; nay, how were they given forth by Divine Inſpiration? What did <hi>George Fox</hi> mean? Divine Duſt, Divine Food for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; a Divine Carnal Letter. No ſure: Then doubtleſs theſe expreſſions were caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scriptures by way of contempt, againſt ſuch as profeſſed them to be given by Divine Inſpiration; and that they were in earneſt the rule of our Faith and Behaviour, againſt which the Quakers have both Preached and Diſputed this 40 years, as I can make appear by 40 of their Books now by me. One more I ſhall quote to ſtrengthen what I ſay. Howthen can they be ſincere in this their Confeſſion? How can they at one and the ſame time believe the Scriptures are Death, Duſt, Beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ware, Serpents Food, and alſo that they are Divine and left us by Men Inſpired of God for the rule of our Faith and Practice; I ſay, how can theſe contraries be reconciled; nay, it's impoſſible. If they ſhall ſay in anſwer to what I now affirm, that their Minds are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally changed and better informed I could be heartily glad of it; but then let us have a ſign of it, and ſome, ground to believe them, <hi>viz.</hi> Let them condemn theſe Books that Teach contrary to their Confeſſion; for whil'ſt then I boldly aver, to thoſe who know them and their Doctrine, and their Books [which they prefer above the Scriptures,] they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,

They alſo have written, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are Death, Duſt, Serpents-meat, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Beaſtly Ware; and though they have made a confeſſion that the Scriptures are Divine, and left by Men Inſpired of God; and that they are a rule of Faith and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; yet they believe alſo that <hi>Geo.

And to confirm the Quakers pretend to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſee <hi>Fox</hi>'s Journal p. 370. where one of them by himſelf is left upon Record, as alſo many more, but this I will recite, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>There was one <hi>John Jay</hi> being to try a Horſe got upon his back; and the Horſe fell a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and caſt him down upon his Head, and break his neck, as the people ſaid. They that were near him took him up dead and carried him a good way, and laid him on a Tree: <hi>I</hi> got to him as ſoon as <hi>I</hi> could, and feeling on him concluded he was dead; and as <hi>I</hi> ſtood by him pitying him and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>I</hi> took hold of his Hair, and his Head turned any way his Head was ſo limber; whereupon throwing away <hi>my</hi> Stick, and <hi>my</hi> Gloves, <hi>I</hi> took his Head in both my Hands, and ſetting <hi>my</hi> knees againſt the Tree <hi>I</hi> raiſed his Head, and perceiving there was nothing out or broken that way, then <hi>I</hi> put one Hand under his Chin, and <hi>my</hi> other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his Head, and raiſing his Head two or three times with all <hi>my</hi> Strength and brought it in, <hi>I</hi> ſoon perceived his Neck began to grow ſtiff again, and then he began to rattle in the Throat, and quickly after to breath; the People were amazed, but <hi>I</hi> bid them have a good Heart, and be of good Faith, and carry him into the Houſe; they did ſo, and ſet him by the Fire, but <hi>I</hi> bid them get him ſome warm thing to drink and put him to Bed. After he had been in the Houſe a while,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40372:43"/>
he began to ſpeak, but did not know where he had been the next day. We paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and he with us, about 16 Miles to a Meeting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Now this is one of the Miracles directed too, in the third Table or Index, under the Letter M thus. <hi>Miracles wrought by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And amongſt the reſt this being the chief, and to me ſeem moſt remarkable, I have ſet it down at large; and whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, 1. That it was wrought in his own Name <hi>I, I, I,</hi> did ſo and ſo, and not as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did, <hi>In the name of Jeſus of Nazareth ariſe,</hi> no, no, <hi>Geo.

               <p n="2">2. This is ſaid to be done in 1672. and brought to light but in 1694 which is 22 years after it was ſaid to be done; and there let me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and ſee how far they run parallel, read Acts 8. 9, 10. <q>There was a certain Man called <hi>Simon,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time in the ſame City uſed Sorcery, and bewitched the People of <hi>Samaria;</hi> giving out that <hi>himſelf</hi> was ſome <hi>great one,</hi> to whom they all gave heed from the leaſt to the greateſt, ſaying, this Man is the great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This account the Holy Apoſtle gives on him, next let us hear what <hi>Juſtin Martin</hi> ſaid of this <hi>Simon,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:40372:44"/>
                  <q>Many adored him as the ſupreme God; they gave heed to him; they believed and obeyed what he Taught; they placed their hopes and confidence in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> See <hi>Pools</hi> Synopſis of the Criticks, p. 14. 62. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his paraphraſe on that place, ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>A Man there was among the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> called <hi>Simon,</hi> a Deceiver of the People, and a Practicer of Deluſions; who before <hi>Philip</hi> came there, practiced in that City Magick-Art, and by his <hi>counterfeit Miracles</hi> had made the <hi>Samaritans</hi> fond of him, who by means of ſuch falſhood and deceit vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf before the ſimple and plain Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, boaſting that himſelf was an excellent Prophet, unto whom the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> from the higheſt to the loweſt gave good heed; <hi>But nothing had he done in the name of Jeſus:</hi> And therefore they as a People aſtoniſhed at ſuch monſterous ſights ſaid, this Fellow is God's own right hand, who is called Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Many a day had he been with them, and long had he made them, with his Sorcery, to dote upon him; and therefore when he had oncegotten himſelf a name with them of great eſtimation, many believed all he Taught.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence we may obſerve, by way of parallel, 1. That this <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer was a great while, and many days with the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans;</hi> ſo was <hi>George Fox</hi> with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. 2. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> wrought counterfeit Miracles in his own Name only, and never
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40372:44"/>
in the Name of Jeſus; ſo did <hi>George Fox,</hi> and thereby (like <hi>Simon)</hi> got himſelf a great Name of eſtimation amongſt the Quakers. 3. That the <hi>Samaritans</hi> adored <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and call'd him the power of God; ſo did the Quakers, whil'ſt living, witneſs <hi>Joſiah Coal</hi>'s Letter, and others in the firſt part recited, and now dead, they have printed him to be the power of God, ſaying, Miracles wrought by the power of God. Third Table under the Letter M and for more of this Nature, ſee his Journal p. 167, 170, 103, 28, 29, 258, 370. Where he would make us believe he was an Angel; that he ſaw the Heaven opened; that he was ſeen at the Judgment Day; that he cured the Sick, reſtored the Lame, and wrought many other Miracles which will complete the parallel.</p>
               <p>But this ſtory of <hi>John Jay</hi> is ſurely as idle, and unworthy of being eſteemed a Miracle, as any thing can be found in the Popiſh Legends; for if ſetting a Man's Neck aright, that had gone awry by a fall, be a Miracle, then many Miracles have been wrought in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere, for it is very common, and yet was never called a Miracle until now, that theſe who publiſhed his Journal, have ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it; and like to this is, that one recovered from Sickneſs, after <hi>G. Fox</hi> had prayed, and if this was a Miracle, many ſuch Miracles are wrought by Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and others.</p>

               <p>And laſtly with ſome obſervations upon a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the General Hiſtory p. 110. <q>The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers alſo could not but Love King <hi>William,</hi> and embrace him as their moſt effectual Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo ſhall conclude theſe ſeven particulars.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Quakers have no Preſident in their Synod, which place they ſay is ſupplyed by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is the great Foundation upon which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> build their Faith, touching the Doctrine of infallibility; and of which they mightily boaſt over all Proteſtant Churches: For, tho' all true Proteſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Holy Ghoſt is with, and will continue with his Church to the end of the World, according to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. yet that thereby any Synod, Councel, or Church is infallible in their Precepts and Councels; that as ſuch, they are to be indiſpenſably obeyed, as was the Precepts of the inſpired Apoſtles; this they deny; and none hold it but the Papiſts and Quakers: And as this vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of infallibility in the Papiſts has been refuted, ſo it will be in the Quakers alſo; and in order to it let us examine how, and in what manner the Holy Ghoſt is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the Quakers Counſels and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is written John 5. 23. <hi>For the Father judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man, but hath committed all judgment to</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40372:47"/>
                  <hi>the Son</hi> v. 27. <hi>and hath given him Authority to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man:</hi> And to this agrees that Apoſtolical ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. <hi>Becauſe he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> Now this Text in St. <hi>John</hi> the Quakers do not like it as tranſlated, and therefore to bend the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to ſerve their deſign, and to quadrate to their principles, they have perverted theſe Scriptures in <hi>Joſiah Coal</hi>'s Works p. 93. <q>ſaying; All Judgment being committed to the Light that Lighteth every Man, the Light that is in every Man, muſt of neceſſity be Judge of all controverſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> So that, it plainly appears from hence, as alſo in my Firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Firſt Part. That whereas God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath committed all Judgment to the Son; and hath ordained him to be Judge of quick and dead, becauſe he is the Son of Man. Therefore the Quakers tranſlate this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from the Son of God, Chriſt Jeſus, to their Light, which by their Logick is the Son of Man which I deny; and this Light to whom they ſay all Judgment is committed, and which they have in them, muſt be Judge of all controverſies, and conſequently their Preſident, which deſerves the caſting Voice. No marvel then that the Quakers are not concern'd to vindicate our Bible againſt the contempt caſt upon it by the Papiſts, as ſaith
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40372:47"/>
the ſame <hi>Joſiah Coal</hi> ibid. p. 104. <q>I find the reſt of his Book <hi>[i. e. A. S.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick] conſiſts of divers Arguments, in which he controverts with Sectaries, and their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Miniſters whoſe cauſe I am not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in; therefore it doth not concern me to Anſwer his Charges againſt them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> No, what neither <hi>Sectaries,</hi> their <hi>Bibles</hi> nor <hi>Miniſters?</hi> Surely tho' he thought himſelf not engag'd to vindicate the Sectaries, nor their Miniſters; yet, if as they pretend to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they do believe the Scriptures to be Divine, and left us by Men Divinely Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and that they are a rule of Faith and Behaviour, they ought to have vindicated the Bible at leaſt. Well, but ſome may ſay what did this <hi>A. S.</hi> the Papiſts call the Bible, that they the Quakers think themſelves thus unconcern'd to vindicate. I Anſwer, 'tis his <hi>14th</hi> Chapter, and which the ſame <hi>Joſiah Coal</hi> hath printed, as an Abettor and Co-workers with him in p. 113. to 116 of his Works. The contempt the Papiſts caſt on the Bible, and which the Quakers are not at all concern'd to vindicate is, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Proteſtant Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarian Miniſters and Preachers, who ſtand in a Pulpit or Tub,</q> 
                  <hi>with ſuch a brazen Fac'd Book as is their unjuſt, corrupt, and perverſe Bible in their hand,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Oh the deceit of this People! What do they pretend to own the Bible only for their own ends, to obtain their Liberty? and when the Papiſts vilifie and contemn it, and call
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40372:48"/>
it a brazen Fac'd Book, a corrupt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Book, and they not concern'd hereat: Well, I do ſtill hope that ſome will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to vindicate the Holy Bible from the contempt of the Papiſts, calling it a brazen Fac'd Book, perverſe Book; and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Quakers who call it Death, Duſt, Beaſtly ware, Carnal, Serpents-meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Quakers at their Synods make Catalogues of Sufferers for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and what they Suffer, and by whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſpoken to this Head largely in the <hi>4th</hi> Chapter of the firſt Part, and therein ſhewed how they boaſt of their Sufferings; how they Augment and make them more than they are; yea, put them in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents Sufferers 20 <hi>l.</hi> when they are ſo far from that, that they have gotten 10 <hi>l.</hi> clear into pocket, as in the caſe of <hi>Samuel Cater.</hi> I have made it appear likewiſe, as my Author ſays, <hi>Gen. Hiſt.</hi> p. 137. that they amplify their Sufferings, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>A ſcratch, a pinch, or a blue ſpot for a grievous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bloody Wound, which may be well obſerved in moſt of the Monuments which theſe Men have left of their Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Quakers inſpect their Books to be printed after approved by their Cenſors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From whence let it be noted, that if their Books be thus inſpected and approved by their approved Cenſors then are the whole anſwerable for the Errors contained in thoſe Books, and for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40372:48"/>
all the horrible Blaſphemies in them. But their caſe is ſtill worſe; for ſuppoſe any one or more of them, be moved as he pretends to write a Meſſage, Warning or Exhortation to a Nation, People, or Society, as the Word of the Lord God, their frequent pretence. This Book is firſt ſent up to <hi>London</hi> for inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and approbation, to one of theſe Meetings or Synods; where their Light is <hi>Preſident,</hi> and made infallible Judge, having all Judgment committed to it in Heaven and in Earth: this Synod thus Aſſembled ſhall afterwards vary the Title and change the Matter to make it harmonize with their deſign; and when this Writer Dyes and leaves 20 or 30 Books thus approved, and thus ſent abroad; the ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Synod ſhall take theſe Books, and again alter them; put in and take out a ſecond time what they pleaſe, then re-print them again: And what is become of their Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility now? They had their Preſident at their firſt inſpection; what, could he not then ſee and diſcern clearly? but that here muſt be a new inſpection? was not their Preſident [their Light] the ſame? For, either the Quakers write as they are moved by the Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, or they do not; if they do, then they are equal with the Apoſtles Writings, and then the Judgment denounced <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18, 19. <hi>If any man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto them the plagues that are written in this Book: And if any man ſhall take away from the words of the book of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40372:49"/>
                  <hi>God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book,</hi> &amp;c. This reward they muſt expect; Again, if they do not, then are they moſt horrible Deluders and great Deceivers when they write thus, <hi>this is the word of the Lord God to you the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of</hi> Briſtol, or the like; and they believe it not; they do not believe the Author to be ſo moved and commiſſioned; and foraſmuch as they ſerved the Works of <hi>Edward Burrow, W. Smith, George Fox, Iſ. Pennington;</hi> ſo <hi>viz.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, added and diminiſhed to my certain knowledge: I do thereupon affirm that they are not the Works of <hi>Fox, Burrow, Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> but the Quakers in general, and they are anſwerable for their Errors not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding each title aſſert the ſame. Thus hath Quakeriſm been carried on; thus hath it grown and taken its progreſs, by Cheats Frauds and Hypocriſies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>About their Womens Meetings, and their manner and way of their Female Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having by my Book <hi>de Chriſtiana Liberta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> &amp;c. not only treated at large on this head, but alſo been inſtrumental thereby, in giving that Image a deadly blow, inſomuch as that in ſome part of the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as well as in divers other Counties in <hi>England,</hi> there is not a diſtinct Womans Meeting to be ſeen nor heard of: But yet ſince 'tis mentioned in the <hi>Gen. Hiſt.</hi> p. 50. <q>They have likewiſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40372:49"/>
Meetings like thoſe we call Claſſes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, and National Synods, or Councils. Theſe Conventions are celebrated oftner or ſeldomer as the number of their Churches is, but ſo as to allot each Sex, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,their diſtinct and particular Meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> I ſay, ſince the Relation of their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Meetings are here brought to light, which many think are ſo dead and dying as that it's hard to find one in many places, and that by way of commendation as I take it, I ſhall therefore briefly touch upon the principal Heads, and Orders, both of its novel, riſe, and arbitrary Government; and chiefly for this reaſon, becauſe in all the Orders there is not ſo much as one Scripture proof mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to confirm and to ſtrengthen the ſame, even like <hi>William Smith</hi>'s Primmer and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, which contain more than a 100 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; yet, in all the Treatiſe there is not one verſe of Scripture quoted, nor that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, one exhortation to read the Scriptures in their Family; and in his Works in Folio do I find very few Scripures quoted, if any, and them that are quoted much perverted and abuſed; but to the matter.

               <p>I have recited the more of this Letter of <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> for that it ſhews, 1. That the Quakers believe that Womens Meetings are the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt. 2. That they pretend to have power to bind and looſe. 3. That the only way to find Mercy was to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>George Fox,</hi> and conſequently to obey and obſerve his Laws. 4. That this falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, delivered in the Name of the Lord, might be from Age to Age continued upon the Quakers, as a brand upon their pretence
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40372:52"/>
to Propheſy; for when the ſaid <hi>Solomon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered this Meſſage by Letter to <hi>John Story,</hi> the ſaid <hi>John</hi> was very ill, and not like to live; yet it pleaſed God for the honour of his Name, and that theſe falſe pretenders might be manifeſt, to give him length of days about 4 years after. 5. That they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>George Fox</hi> the great Apoſtle of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt from the Firſt Inſtance. 'tis no marvel then that the Quakers have thrown off and rejected the Ordinances of Baptiſme and the Lord's Supper, Inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf; ſince <hi>Fox</hi> their Apoſtle have ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Womens Meetings. From the <hi>2d.</hi> That they are one with the Pope, touching the power of the Church. From the <hi>3d.</hi> That the Merits and Satisfaction of Chriſt, as our Mediator and Interceſſor, of his Death and bitter Paſſion, are by the Quakers laid aſide, if the only way to find Mercy with God, be to be reconcil'd to the Quaker Church. From the <hi>4th.</hi> That the Quakers are not zealous for God by their cloaking and excuſing this falſe Propheſy of <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> as well as divers others of his Idolatrous Practices; and by their owning him and his Books to the laſt, and never paſſing a publick cenſure upon him and his Books. From the <hi>5th.</hi> That 'tis no marvel that they are ſo much concern'd to vindicate every little Pamphlet of their own with great charge and induſtry; but when the Papiſts call our Bible a brazen Fac'd, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and falſe Bible; this they ſay in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40372:53"/>
words, they are not concern'd to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, this they leave to the Sectarian and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopalians to do; for alas they have work enough beſides; and as to the Bible, though the Papiſts call it a <hi>brazen Fac'd Book falſe and corrupt,</hi> yet the Quakers are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to vindicate the Bible; and indeed how can they againſt the Papiſts, for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts would ſoon reply, what do the Quakers blame us for calling your Bible a brazen Fac'd Book, whil'ſt you your ſelves call it Death, Duſt, Beaſtly Wares, Serpents Food? How then can you blame us, ſince we are Couſin Jermains, and Dear Brethren in the common cauſe againſt the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Good God, when I conſider their deep Hypocriſy in their confeſſion to the Parliament, I am aſtoniſh'd at their impudence, and ſo I proceed to the next Head.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Moreover, ſaith the Hiſtorian p.</hi> 55. <hi>it's alſo their cuſtome in their Houſes, never to expreſs a Religious Duty with an outward Voice, as praying to God, craving his Bleſſing e'er they take Meat, or go to Bed, till they feel the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This alſo is the fruit of Quakeriſm; read one of their Books ſtiled <hi>A Muſick Lecture,</hi> &amp;c. p. 25. <q>For where they <hi>[i. e.</hi> Chriſtians] are, I was in Performances, in Ordinances, in Family Duties, in Hearing, in Reading, in Prayers, in Faſtings; well, but when I came to bend my Mind to that of God in me, which <hi>is Chriſt,</hi> then I begun to learn to be a Fool,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40372:53"/>
inſomuch, that I durſt not give God thanks for the Victuals that were ſet before me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, this their practice is ſo well known in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in <hi>Holland,</hi> that I need not to enlarge upon it; only take up a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation when I conſider how many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Families of Quakers there are in <hi>England,</hi> that never prayed to God in their Houſes, nor gave thanks for Bleſſings received with outward Voice, ſince they turned Quakers, perhaps 20 or 30 years: What account then will they be able to give at the great and terrible Day? Who have thus bewitched the People from the practice of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Saints and Martyrs, and all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches to this day, unto the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Heathen that know no God, read Jeremiah 10. 25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen, and upon the families that call not on thy name!</hi> But, poſſibly they'll ſay, they think of God when they go to Bed, and when they receive the Comforts of this Life; to which I anſwer; if that be enough, and that words are uſeleſs, why then do their Teachers ſpeak and pray in their Meetings with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Voice, and ſometimes at your own Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes when People are there? Is this their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice only that they may be ſeen of Men? a thing I am jealous of; for if they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it their Duty, why not a Duty incumbent upon the hearers alſo? But they ſay in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>'s Works p. 47. That is no command of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40372:54"/>
God to thee, which God commanded to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, unleſs they receive it a new as the Inſpired Apoſtles did. Thus have they taken away they Key of Knowledge from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I mean the uſe of the Holy Scripture, which would inſtruct them better: Nay, this is not all, but where the Spirit of Quakeriſm is in its full vigor; if they happen to be in company with a Man of another Profeſſion, whether Epiſcopalian, Presbyterian, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, or Baptiſt, who crave a Bleſſing upon what they receive, ☞ ſits the Quaker with his Hat on, as a Teſtimony againſt that lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Practice.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>They have Anniverſary Synods in every conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Kingdom, to whom belong the Care and Adminiſtration of all the Affairs of that Kingdom. In</hi> England <hi>they have a fixed Anniverſary Synod on the third day of Penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt. Gen. Hiſt. p.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>This may be true, but of how dangerous a conſequence both to Church and State I am not able to determine, but time will further manifeſt: But the more they encreaſe and gain upon their People, and believe that they are the only true Church, and as ſuch, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err; that they have power to bind and looſe; and that their Precepts and Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are of equal Authority to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and thereupon ought to be indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly obeyed; I ſay, as this comes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and embraced, the danger of theſe Anniverſary Synods will be ſeen more and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40372:54"/>
more, and it may be when 'tis too late; for they not only already think themſelves capable to teach Judges, Juſtices, yea, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament too. What is their Duty, what they may do, and what they may not do, and the utmoſt confines of their Juriſdiction? parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the caſe of Hereſy, of which I have recited ſome Inſtances, and can hundreds more; as alſo by two of their Anniverſary Synods they have virtually, tho' not verbally, repealed great part of two Statute Laws that of the 22 of <hi>C.</hi> II. and that clauſe of an Act of Parliament made in the Firſt of K. <hi>W.</hi> Ill. relating to Tythes by their yearly Epiſtles, enregiſtred by Authority of their Anniverſary Synods; I need not here relate what an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence their firſt Epiſtle had, and how little the Law was regarded or obſerved the whole Nation is witneſs; and as to the laſt about Tythes and Church-warden Rates, which the Parliament took care to preſerve in their old Channel, in the ſame Law which indulge the Quakers in the exerciſe of their perſwaſion; yet this very Law they <hi>Anno</hi> 1696. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged implicitly with Antichriſtianiſm, ſaying, p. 1. <q>That all due care be taken againſt that grand Oppreſſion, and Antichriſtian Yoke of Tythes; that our Chriſtian Teſtimony born and greatly ſuffered for, be faithfully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt them, in all reſpects, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Steeple-houſe-rates, or Lays; as alſo againſt the burthen and impoſition of Oaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Here we ſee Tythes are Antichriſtian,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40372:55"/>
and their Teſtimony Chriſtian; a perfect Map of their whole Doctrine; the Parliament An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, the Quakers Chriſtian; the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament great Oppreſſors, the Quakers Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, tho' they pay no more than their Neighbours; the Parliament lay Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Yokes upon the Quakers, the Quakers the only Chriſtian ſufferers, and perſecuted Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; whoſe ſufferings and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are greater and more unjuſt, than the ſufferings of Chriſt, his Apoſtles and Martyrs; for what was inflicted upon them, was duly executed by a Law; and to this practice of ours agree that Doctrine of St. <hi>Edw. Burrow</hi>'s, as it is written in our Goſpel, in the Book of our Holy Scriptures, which we at all times ſtand ready to vindicate; vulgarly call'd <hi>Ed. Burrow</hi>'s Works p. 501. <q>Witneſſes we ſtand againſt Parliaments, Councels, Judges, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, who make and execute Laws in their own wills over the Conſciences of Men; and to ſuch Laws, Cuſtoms, Courts, or Arbitrary Uſurped Dominion we cannot yield obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And therefore by this our Anniverſary Decree, we Ordain and Enact, that the Members of all our Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, and all other our Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates in every Kingdom, Nation and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that adhere to us, and believe us to be the univerſal Church of the Firſt born, who cannot err, but are led by an infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that all and every of our Diſciples throw off all theſe Antichriſtian Yokes of grand Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40372:55"/>
and from henceforth ſtand faithful Witneſſes againſt Tythes as Antichriſtian, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Church Rates, againſt lawful Oathes, againſt carrying Guns; and this, as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian ſays, is to go through <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> yea all the World over; and all that ſuffer for their Stubborneſs and Antimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical Principles, by the ſame Edict is to be taken into Record, who it is that ſuffer, for what cauſe they ſuffer, and on what account. I have not time to ſet forth the dangerous conſequences of theſe Anniverſary Synods, when they once gain upon the People that they are the only univerſal Catholick Church, and as ſuch cannot err; that as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> Teaches, the People are to believe as ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves: I ſay, on this Doctrine of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hangs a load of dangers; the Parliament ſay one thing, the Anniverſary Synod at <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire-houſe</hi> another; they now argue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, but in time may diſpute the Point publickly: Infallibility ſticks at nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be for the Holy Church in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts Dialect, or for Truth's ſake in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers: They are Terms Synonymous, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their Authors, and <hi>W. Penn</hi>s Books ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted declare plainly how vigorous he was for his near Friends and dear kindred in the late Reign; and the Quakers addreſſed from their Anniverſary Synods run in the ſame Channel, and flow from the ſame Fountain, for K. <hi>J.</hi> II. and againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> there came forth publick Addreſſes Annually, beſides
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40372:56"/>
Books every Month in favour of the then Government and againſt the Church: But ſince King <hi>William</hi> came to the Crown, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a publick Anniverſary Addreſs to King <hi>W.</hi> nor one Book wrot in favour of the preſent Governments, as anon will appear. And thus Quakeriſm, like the Snake in the Graſs, creeps on undiſcovered, or at leaſt little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken how ſhe ſecretly Smites, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately Stings, and throws out her Poyſon both at Church and State; She'll Arraign, Impeach, Try, Judge, Summons, Dialogue, Condemn both Magiſtrate and Miniſter, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and People; yet if ſhe be but toucht, Oh how ſhe winches and giffles up and down! crying ſhe's wrong'd, ſhe's abus'd, and all is malice that's ſaid of her; whil'ſt ſhe takes the liberty to abuſe, traduce, ſtigmatize and calumniate all other People. This is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of this clamorous Woman; and tho' I do ſolemnly profeſs, as in the ſight of God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, I am not for Perſecution, neither do I deſire, nor none need to fear that our King and Parliament ſhould follow the French King's example in what is of the nature of Perſecution or Cruelty; yet on the other hand, when they perceive the Ingratitude of this inſolent People, they probably may take ſome meaſures to ſtop the ſtream of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie which ſpreads like a Leproſie through the Nation: And foraſmuch as ſomething that is praiſe worthy on the French King's part, in granting the Miniſtry of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

Not to admit Strangers to ſit in their Synods. 2. Nor to hold correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with Forreigners. 3. Nor will they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about State matters. 4. Nor make any Orders relating to them. 5. Nor print Books unlicens'd. 6. Nor excommunicate Perſons that quit their Society; for they do not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to themſelves ſuch a power, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves the only true Church in the World, like the old Strumpet and the young Harlot. 7. Nor will they tollerate any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons [or Books] fraught with injurious and reproachful Language; nor will they ſuffer <hi>Money</hi> to be collected, which as it's called the Sinew of War, ſo <hi>it</hi> may be called the Nerve of Hereſie. I hope to ſuch as will read this Book, and others I have wrote, will not ſtand in need of proof that the Quakers are guilty of all that the Chriſtians are herein ſaid to be thus innocent of.

Mark Reader, here is Addreſs upon Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and Prayer after Prayer for the late King <hi>James</hi> II. which ſound his Fame from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from thence Eccoed back from <hi>Stotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> in the higheſt ſtrain, and moſt elegant Stile the Quakers could invent, ſutable to their ſingular Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. I do not mention this practice whil'ſt he was King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeated on the Throne as an Evil in it ſelf, or inconſiſtent with their Duty, and the Duty of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; for 'tis my Judgment that we ought to pray for <hi>all Kings</hi> which God in his Providence ſets over us, without diſputing their Titles; and to obey every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake, knowing that there is no Power but of God, the Powers that be are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, and who ſo reſiſt the Powers, they reſiſt the Ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 <hi>cap.

Hiſt.</hi> That I thought the Quakers could not but love K. <hi>W.</hi> III. and embrace him as their moſt effectual Defender; but when I came to prove them, and try them, and meaſure them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40372:61"/>
by their Fruits, and to conſider that in two years ſpace they made 4 Addreſſes to the late K. <hi>J.</hi> II. and that in 4 years time they had not made one Addreſs to K. <hi>W.</hi> III. I then altered my mind, and by reading of their ſaid Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, and their Books wrot by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> I found that the ſtream of their Affections did run like a mighty torrent to the late K. <hi>J.</hi> II. when there was not the leaſt iſſuing drop of Affection run to His preſent Majeſty; and this put me upon writing a Letter to the Quakers, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1690. p. 2. <q>Now if you would be conſtant; then, why do you not pray for, and addreſs your ſelves to K. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> as heartily, and as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly as you did to, and for, K. <hi>J.</hi> whom you call'd and ſaid, <hi>a Brave King, God</hi> and <hi>Ceſar</hi> are <hi>both</hi> of <hi>a mind, pray Godbleſs the King and His Royal Family.</hi> Theſe and many more [magnifying Expreſſions] were publiſhed thro the Nations: But no Salutation, no Meſſage, no Prayer for, nor no Addreſs to K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> as if you were ſtruck mute at the loſs of your brave King, whom you ſaid was of the ſame mind with God: What can you ſay for your ſelves? Are you like thoſe 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 27. <hi>viz.</hi> The Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> who ſaid, how ſhall this Man ſave us? And they deſpiſed him, and they brought him no preſents [no Addreſſes nor Prayers] but the King held his peace. Oh you unworthy and ungrateful Perſons! Hath not King <hi>William</hi> granted you the Liberty of your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40372:62"/>
and confirmed it by a Law? What, have you nothing to ſay for King <hi>William?</hi> Nay, you are ſo far from that, that when His Majeſty appointed a Faſt, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his Armies, you not only Preached againſt the Faſt, but alſo, to weaken the Hearts and Hands of his Friends, you did vehemently cry down all Wars and Fighting. Is your zeal for the Proteſtant cauſe, and the Proteſtant intereſt quite loſt and gone, or is it gone to <hi>Rome?</hi> You have had ſeveral yearly Meetings ſince this King's Reign, but not the leaſt publick acknowledgment of the ſpecial Favour ſhewed you by the King and Parliament; I will not ſay but ſome of your People may be heartily thankful, yet it plainly appears, that your Leaders and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers [and Anniverſary Synods] are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind; for had you been as hearty and zealous for the preſent Government, as in point of gratitude you ſhould and ought to have been, your People had not been ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and ſo confuſed touching the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant intereſt, as now they are; the ſad and evil Effects of which muſt, and will be laid at your doors.

                           <p>We the Kings peaceable Subjects, from divers parts of his Dominions, being met together in this City, after our uſual manner to inſpect the affairs of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Society <hi>throughout the World,</hi> think it our Duty humbly to repreſent to him the <hi>bleſſed</hi> Effects, the Liberty he has graciouſly granted his People to worſhip God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Conſciences, hath had both on our Perſons and Eſtates; for whereas we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had long and ſorrowful Liſts brought to us, from almoſt all parts of his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40372:63"/>
of Priſoners and the ſpoil of Goods by violent and ill Men, upon account of Conſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. We bleſs God, and thank the King, the Goals are every where clear, except in caſes of <hi>Tythes,</hi> and the repairs of Pariſh Churches, and ſome few about Oaths; and we do in all Humility lay it before the King to conſider the hardſhips our Friends are yet under for Conſcience ſake, in thoſe reſpects, being in the one chieſly expos'd to the preſent Anger of the offended Clergy, who have therefore impriſoned ſome of them till death, and in the other they are rendered very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to the publick and themſelves; for both in reference to Freedoms in Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Probats of Wills and Teſtaments, and Adminiſtrations, Anſwers in Chancery and Exchequer, Tryals of our juſt Titles and Debts, proceeding in our Trades in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome houſe, ſerving the Office of Conſtables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are diſabled and great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges taken againſt them; unleſs the King's Favour do interpoſe; and as we humbly hope he may relieve us, ſo we confidently aſſure our ſelves he will eaſe us what he can.</p>
                           <p>Now ſince it hath pleaſed thee, O King, to renew to all thy Subjects by thy laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, thy gracious Aſſurances to purſue the Eſtabliſhment of this Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, upon an unalterable Foundation; and in order to it to hold a Parliament in <hi>Nov.</hi> next at fartheſt; we think our ſelves deeply engaged to renew our aſſurances of Fidelity
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40372:63"/>
and Affection, and with God's help, intend to do our part for the effecting ſo bleſſed and glorious a Work; that ſo it may be out of the power of any one party to hurt another upon the account of Conſcience: And as we firmly believe that God will never deſert this righteous cauſe of Liberty, nor the King in maintaining of it; ſo we hope by God's Grace to let the World ſee, we can honeſtly and heartily appear for Liberty of Conſcience, and be inviolably true to our own Religion, whatever the Folly or Madneſs of ſome Men on that account may ſuggeſt to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Theſe are the ſayings of their Anniverſary Synod. Here you ſee is nothing wanting but bended knees; here is in <hi>all</hi> Humility, in <hi>all</hi> Fidelity, with <hi>all</hi> Affection, yea, <hi>all, all, all, all</hi> Prayers for him; for long Life, for a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Reign, Laud and Praiſe in the higheſt; for his Deliverance, for the defeating his Enemies [the excluders,] yea, it would be too long to enumerate them: Beſides, Book af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Book in favour of the Government; and Letter after Letter printed and diſperſed; a firſt, a ſecond and a third for the repealing the Penal Laws and Teſts, that ſo the Papiſts might ſit in Parliament to Eſtabliſh them a new Order, even St. <hi>George</hi>'s Order as compleatly as their Grandfather <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> had his Order confirmed by the Popes Bulls, <hi>October 3d.

Judgment deſerted their King, their Cauſe; and will in time more fully diſcover their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be of the ſame tendency, and carried on by the ſame Holy cheats, that <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi>'s Order of the Jeſuits was.

               <p>But Reader, did you ever hear of an Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary Addreſs to King <hi>William?</hi> No ſuch matter: Did you ever ſee a Book put forth in favour of the preſent Government? No ſuch matter; no, no, 'tis as in my printed Letter 1690. above recited. <hi>No</hi> Salutation, <hi>no</hi> Meſſage, <hi>no</hi> Prayer for, nor <hi>no</hi> Addreſs to, King <hi>William</hi> III from this their yearly Synod, nor a Book wrot in favour of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>no,</hi> in all Humility, <hi>no,</hi> in all Affection, <hi>no</hi> publick Prayers for his long and proſperous Reign, <hi>no</hi> Laud and Praiſe that his Enemies are defeated; here is <hi>no, no, no, no.</hi> Come <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and foreman of your Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary Synod; what can you ſay for your ſelves? Why are you mute? Why have you not brought forth one publick Anniverſary Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical Addreſs this ſeven years? nor publick Prayers; or, are you ſtill like thoſe we read on, 1 Sam. 10. 27. <hi>But the children of Beliel ſaid, how ſhall this man ſave us? and they deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and brought him no preſents</hi> [no Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, no Addreſſes] <hi>but the King held his peace.</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:40372:64"/>
But, that I may not leave out one cluſter of the Quakers Vine by which Quakeriſm has been nouriſhed, I ſhall now mention a notable paſſage, to diſcover the Quakers averſion to the preſent Government, <hi>viz.</hi> The Widow <hi>Whitrow,</hi> formerly a Quaker, wrot a Book in favour of the Government about four years ſince, but it did ſo croſs the Quakers current, that they made an Order for the calling it in, and ſuppreſſing the ſame; the which I have, together with their not addreſſing His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty, more largely handled in my Book <hi>New Rome unmask'd</hi> p. 26. to 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj.</label> Well, but may ſome ſay, tho' it be granted that ſince His Majeſty King <hi>William</hi> came to the Crown, the Quakers have made no publick addreſs to him, tho' it was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with them ſo to do to the late King, which we muſt acknowledge do ſhew of what ſtamp they are; yet <hi>Anno</hi> 95. they gave out a Paper they ſtil'd <hi>Their Ancient Teſtimony renewed, with reſpect to the King and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and touching the preſent Aſſociation;</hi> where they have theſe words.</p>
               <q>And we believe that the timely diſcovery and prevention of the late barbarous Deſign, and Miſchievous Plot againſt the King and Government, and the ſad Effects it might have had, is an eminent Mercy from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; for which we, and the whole Nation have great cauſe to be humbly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, and to pray for the continuance of his Mercies to them and us.

                           <p>Again, you ſay you cannot ſign the Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, in regard you cannot take revenge for our ſelves nor others: That's ſtrange; what, had you not a Quaker lately Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on the Road, between <hi>Kingſland</hi> and <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> you know you had; and did you not proſecute the Murtherer? you know you did, and profered 50 <hi>l.</hi> reward for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Perſon, and found him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him, and had him tryed at the <hi>Old-Baily, London,</hi> where he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and afterwards hang'd in Chains near <hi>Stone-Bridge,</hi> and all this proſecution by Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40372:66"/>
Can you revenge your ſelves of the Blood of a private Perſon, and can you not ſign the Aſſociation to avenge the Blood of your Prince for Conſcience ſake? what, are your Conſciences ſo nice, that you can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay nor do any thing for the publick good?

               <p>This Reply I preſented to the Lords on the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1696. which was very well accepted of; and ſoon after one of the Peers came out and ſaid to this effect: Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> this Paper of yours will not do, you muſt be plain, and declare what King you mean, and alſo ſign your Paper; and if you do ſo, and appear plain and ſincere, I will do the beſt I can for you, and poſſibly your Bill may paſs the Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this did ſo ſtartle the Quakers, and made them ſo angry with <hi>Fra.

But, this was not all, but by and by came out a Biſhop of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Whitehead,</hi> we have conſidered of your Bill, but we ſhall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40372:67"/>
inſert a clauſe for the payment of Tythes; and a power, in caſe of neglect of payment, to diſtrain for any ſumm not exceeding 10 <hi>l.</hi> what think you of that? If you will not accept of it ſo, it will be thrown out. But, ah poor <hi>George,</hi> methinks I ſee him how he rubb'd his Elbow, and ſcratch'd his Head, and look'd up as demurely as a Puritan, and ſaid, at leaſt thought, <hi>viz.</hi> What hard things are now upon us poor innocent Quakers? that our Papers will not paſs without ſigning, nor will our meaning paſs, but we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in plain words what King we mean; this does indeed pinch us, and forely trouble us; and, which is ſtill as had, we muſt have a clauſe put in to bind us to pay Tythes, and this will go down but ruggedly with the Friends: What ſhall I ſay, or how ſhall I come off? If I accept of it on theſe Terms I ſhall diſpleaſe many; if I looſe the Bill, and with it our Money ſpent to obtain it [tho' when all is done, 'tis no leſs, nor more an Oath then I took my ſelf in the Lord Mayor's Court, upon a Bill exhibited againſt me by <hi>Thomas Daniel</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, <hi>April 9th</hi> 1695.] I ſhall diſpleaſe others; what ſhall I do? I am beſet round on every ſide; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are fears, within are doubts; one ſort of Friends will blame me for accepting of it; thus <hi>I</hi> A.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40372:67"/>
there is ſuch Rider as enjoyns us to pay Tythes <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet this will not do neither, unleſs we <hi>ſign</hi> our Aſſociation, and mention King <hi>William;</hi> theſe things are hard, yet we will ſubmit to Parliaments for once, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, this is the caſe, their firſt Paper dated <hi>March</hi> 3 1695/6 not ſigned, nor King <hi>W.</hi> named, was thrown out, and poor <hi>G W.</hi> and his Aſſociates ſigned another dated the 3 <hi>d</hi> day of <hi>April</hi> 1696. A Copy thereof a Perſon of Quality ſent me, which Paper was ſigned, and the King's Name at large in it; that part of it which anſwers to the other part already recited I will ſet down, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>And we believe that the timely diſcovery and prevention of the late barbarous Deſign and miſchievous Plot againſt <hi>King William</hi> and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſad Effects it might have had is an eminent Mercy from Almighty God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>At a Meeting of the ſaid People</hi> the 3d of April 96. <hi>Signed</hi> by <hi>many</hi> of <hi>us</hi> on behalf of our ſelves, and the <hi>reſt</hi> of our Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note Reader, that this Paper preſented to the King <hi>April</hi> 8. 1696. dated <hi>April</hi> 3. 96. was never diſperſed among the Quakers, but kept private: But that Paper dated <hi>March</hi> 3. 1695/6. wherein the King is not named, and which therefore the Lords threw out; that Paper was diſperſed far and near; ſo the poor Quakers ſtill may be to ſeek what King their Teachers mean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, I have already put down the Form of the Quakers Oath, I <hi>A. B.</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall now
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40372:68"/>
add another clauſe in the ſaid Act, which will prevent them from coming into any ſhare of the Government, which they have long wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for; but thanks be to God Quakeriſm has by this Act got ſuch a blow, as they will not eaſily rub off, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Provided and be it Enacted, that no Quaker, or reputed Quaker ſhall by vertue of this Act be qualify'd or permitted to give evidence in any Criminal Cauſes; to ſerve on any Juries, or bear any Office or place of [Truſt] or Profit in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; any thing in this Act contained to the contrary, in any wiſe notwithſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having thus far ſhewed Mr. <hi>Croeſe</hi> his miſtake of the Quakers loving King <hi>William</hi> as their effectual Defender, as well as in ſome other things in his General Hiſtory: I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout leaving him until the next opportunity, hoping when he conſiders and ſees how Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm firſt roſe, and how it has grown, and by what means and methods it has had its progreſs, that he will not blame me for dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling plainly with them, eſpecially when he ſees and conſiders the ſcurrilous Names and ignominious Terms they have caſt upon the Learned Clergy of this <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, as Robbers, Thieves, Witches, Devils, Antichriſts, Bloodhounds, the Sir <hi>Simons</hi> of the Age, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts, Sodomites, and what not, which might render them and their function odious to the People; as alſo their Pamphlets to the Parliaments to leave and forſake them;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40372:68"/>
and ſo I take my leave of this learned Hiſtorian and bid him farewel.</p>
               <p>By this time ſome may ſay, you ſeem to know the diſtemper of this corrupted Body of Quakeriſm; pray let us know a Remedy to ſtop the gangreen; for many wiſe and learned Men have endeavoured to apply a Remedy, but have hitherto miſſed; yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Corraſives which have been too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to ſtop the running thereof; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Lenetives which have taken no place at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſ.</label> I do acknowledge, and experience teacheth us, that ſometimes the ableſt Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian for want of knowing the Diſeaſe has miſſed, when one not ſo noted, has with the help of Herbs, and what is common, wrought a Cure. Firſt then, the moſt proper way to Cure this Diſtemper which lies in the Brain, and affects the Heart alſo, is to let <hi>George W.</hi> and ſome few of the moſt eminent Teachers and Writers amongſt the Quakers, be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by Authority, and by the ſame exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, whether theſe Books quoted as theirs, be really ſo or no. Next, if proved upon them, let them either juſtifie or retract them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, after this is done, let them ſet forth certain Articles of their Faith, and if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Chriſtian Religion, then let them condemn all their Books which teach the contrary: This was the way of the French Proteſtants; and when ſo done, let each Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Quakers have their Teacher, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40372:69"/>
each Teacher have their Congregation, and take care of the ſame, that ſo the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Youth be not corrupted and poyſoned by ſucking in falſe Notions, and imbibing falſe Principles in their young years: This is what pleaſes all Proteſtant Diſſenters, both Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, Independants, and Baptiſts and for which they are very thankful to the Government, and in their Meetings pray heartily for the preſervation thereof, as I have heard in all their Societies. And if nothing leſs then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary Synods, and General Councels will pleaſe theſe aſpiring Quakers; before they have them, let them ask leave of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to hold them, and how long to continue the ſitting thereof; and if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment think good to beſtow that Favour of them, it would be very proper that there ſhould be a Commiſſioner or two, Ordered and Commiſſioned by His Majeſty to reſide in their Councel, the doors being open, and free ingreſs for their Deputies, and liberty for them to ſpeak freely; and their Acts put into Writing for preventing confuſion; and when this is done, it will be proper to limit and ſet them bounds (who of themſelves are boundleſs) and to reſtrain them from theſe things following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all their Miniſters who are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural born Subjects, but Foreigners, [whoſe coming may be to ſpy out the weakneſſes of our Country, to alienate the King's Subjects from their obedience to their Sovereign]
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40372:69"/>
may be excluded out of their Synod, and have neither place nor voice in their general Counſel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that during the time granted them by Authority to hold their Synod, they may have no communication with Forreigners, or other ſuſpected Perſons, as Jeſuits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And foraſmuch as the Quakers are not by any legal conſtitution a body Politick; therefore they ſhould not meddle in State Affairs, <hi>viz.</hi> to condemn Acts of Parliaments as Antichriſtian and Oppreſſive to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and thereby abſolve their Diſciples from their obedience to their Lawful Magiſtrates, whom they ought to obey as the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſet over them by God, entruſted with the ſupreme Authority, and their part is to yield a dutiful ſubjection and faithful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as whereunto they ſtand oblig'd by the commands of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the practice of God's faithful Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, holy Apoſtles and Martyrs in all Ages, by their Birth as natural born Subjects of theſe Realms; by the dictates of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and the many Favours they daily receive in being defended and protected in their Liberty and Property, and by all kinds of conſideration both general and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That they print no Books but what are licens'd by Commiſſioners, appointed by His Majeſty for that purpoſe, under pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the whole impreſſion; this would be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40372:70"/>
a great means to reſtore <hi>England</hi> to its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Glory, which once it had, when it was famous for extirpating Hereſie; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of latter years 'tis reported by the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian of the Quakers Hiſtory, to be a Nurſe for Hereſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That they do not arrogate to themſelves the power of excommunicating ſuch as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them, and conform themſelves to the Eſtabliſh'd Religion, nor treat them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully, but that they ſtudy to be quiet and mind their own buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That they be not permitted in their Books and Sermons to call legal Puniſhments Perſecution; calling the Magiſtrates Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, thereby rendering them odious to the common People.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That they be not permitted in theſe Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods to approve of ſuch Books, nor to teach ſuch Doctrine as call the national Miniſtry Witches, Devils, Antichriſts; nor the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, Judges, Juſtices, and other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, the Beaſts that carry the Whore, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of the Saints, nor to impeach their judicial Proceedings.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That they be not permitted to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Try, Judge, Arraign, Condemn, and Dyalogue the national Miniſtry, Magiſtracy and People, and thereby lift up and extol themſelves, as the only Catholick Univerſal Church of the Firſt-born, which cannot err; and Curſe, Damn, and Reprobate all other Chriſtians. This has been their frequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40372:70"/>
and a main Pillar of their Hereſie; for, when they gain upon the common People, that the Apoſtolick Order of the Church of Chriſt is re-eſtabliſh'd only amongſt them; and that all other Societies are Apoſtates, Antichriſts, Heathens, and Infidels, they then have gained the point, and will ſoon claim the Chair, and reach at the Scepter.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That they be forbidden to make Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Tax the People, and lay by Funds as their manner is; for, as Money is ſaid to be the Sinews of War, ſo may it be call'd the Nerve of Hereſie; but let each Society of Quakers maintain their own Teacher, and not have a common Bank at <hi>London</hi> and Feoffees entruſted therewith to give 8 10 or 20 <hi>l.</hi> at a time to their Travelling Teachers, who range all the World over, bantering all other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who have a ſettled maintenance, and are far leſs chargeable to their Hearers than are the Quakers Teachers, who come uncall'd for, like Flies and Mice eat up the proviſion of others, as ſaith the Hiſtorian.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That they be not permitted to call the Scriptures of the Prophets, Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, by thoſe contemptible Names of Death, Duſt, Beaſtly-Ware, Serpents-Food, and the like.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But that they be compell'd to condemn thoſe Books of theirs which ſo teach; for, thus do they bring the Chriſtian Religion into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, in order to raiſe Quakeriſm as the moſt excellent of all Religions.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:40372:71"/>
12. Let them not be permitted to call the Church of <hi>England</hi> an Adulterated Harlot, nor to charge her with Witchcraft and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries; to be an Adulterous Womb, which brings forth monſterous Births; neither let them be permitted to call the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer [which is grounded on the Holy Scriptures, compoſed and profeſſed by our Martyred Anceſtors, and confirmed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of King and Parliament] a branch which proceeded from the Pope, and from his Loyns [ſay they] it draws its Strength: Neither let them be permitted to print and publiſh to the Nations, that they have ript up the Bowels of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and diſcovered her Adulterous Womb, and all the falſe Conceptions conceived by her, and that without any fear of her or her power.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Neither let them be permitted to teach Schools, for there they read <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and <hi>Geo. Fox</hi>'s Primmer, and a certain portion every day of <hi>Geo. Fox</hi>'s Journal, all which enveigh bitterly againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all inſtituted Religion, which tends to inſtil corrupt Principles, whil'ſt the Bible and other good Books are laid aſide: Theſe things ought to be noted, and for the Generation of years ſake to be guarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Upon the whole matter, theſe ſayings contained in the 12 particulars being great contempt upon the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, upon the King and his People, and upon the

whole Nation: Yet thus do their Books Teach, thus do they print and publiſh, even in ſo many words, if they deny it, I am ready to prove it. And notwithſtanding this, and much more that might be ſaid of the ſame nature; yet they are ſo high and rampant, that when I printed my Book <hi>New Rome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd, &amp;c.</hi> and laid open ſome of theſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, they indicted me, and proſecuted me at Law, to my great coſt and damage; ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Books and proſecuted me with all the aggravations imaginable: And, that it may yet further appear how tender they are of their own Church, their own Miniſters, their own Writings, and Epiſtles, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite one of their Anniverſary Injunctions, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <head>A Supplement to the former Hiſtory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a further correction of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<hi> Croeſe</hi>'s General Hiſtory of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm.</head>

               <hi>GEN. Hiſt.</hi> p. 62. 'They (the Quakers) <hi>condemn no Man till they hear him,</hi> &amp;c. My Author, the Hiſtorian, is now ſo far beſides the matter, and gives a Relation ſo contrary to their practice, that He and I muſt part again; for I may not keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him at preſent, but I muſt ſhew him his miſtakes. <hi>1ſt.</hi> In general, They Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons all Archbiſhops, Lordbiſhops, Deans, Prebends, Doctors, Vicars, Curates, and all Prelaticals, as this Book ſets forth at large, not perſonally but fictiouſly; and when this is done, they Arraign, Try, and Judge them unheard, to be Monſters, Witches, Devils, Antichriſts, Bloodhounds, Conjurers, and falſe Prophets; but to come cloſer to matter of fact, <hi>viz.</hi> Particularly about the Year 1676. A difference happen'd between me and <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> and one of their Speakers touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fine of 15 <hi>l.</hi> which I ſuffered for him, for that his Name and Habitation was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Juſtices ſo as to levy a Fine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Goods and Chattels; and in regard I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40372:73"/>
thought it but reaſonable, that he ſhould make me reſtitution; and alſo finding by their Books that in the loſs of 13550 <hi>l.</hi> by Fines and Diſtreſſes, by an Act of Parliament made the 22 of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. Entituled <hi>An Act to prevent and ſuppreſs ſeditious Conventicles,</hi> &amp;c. The Preachers, where ſtrangers never loſt 50 <hi>l.</hi> and thereupon (not barely for my own ſake, but my Fellow Hearers) I proſecuted <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> for reſtitution of the ſaid 15 <hi>l.</hi> ſuffered for him as aforeſaid, in that he did not declare his Name and Habitation, when he ſaw the Informers convicting the Meeting, as at large ſet forth in my Book, <hi>The painted Harlot both Stript and Whipt,</hi> &amp;c. and that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing,</hi> &amp;c. and to which I refer the Reader for further ſatisfaction. Yet to ſhew that they condemn Perſons unheard, and that their judicial proceedings are Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Partial, as well as Illegal; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, like the high Court of Juſtice, which would not permit King <hi>Charles</hi> I. to give his Reaſons, nor to be heard in his juſt defence, as at large in <hi>The Hiſtory of Independancy,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall tranſcribe ſome paſſages of that Tranſaction, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1676. I went to the Yearly Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>London,</hi> and in the Face of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly I propoſed this Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends in the Miniſtry, where they are ſtrangers, ought not to tell their Names, and Habitations upon their apparent ſight of Informers coming into the Meeting, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Names of Friends in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40372:73"/>
the Meeting; that ſo they may ſtand in the ſame capacity, relating to ſufferings with the Hearers; and not the Miniſters in one capacity free from Sufferings, and the Hearers in another capacity <hi>i. e.</hi> always lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Sufferings, and not for themſelves only, but alſo for the Meeting-houſes, for the Poor and Indigent, for Strangers and Forreigners, and for the Preachers, unleſs they declare their Names and Places of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> This was ſuch an unexpected and terrifying Queſtion, that it ſet the Synod on Fire, and ſtartled the moſt Eloquent Orator of them all; inſomuch, that <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſteps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Form and adjourned the Meeting to <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly-down</hi> Meeting-houſe in <hi>Southwark,</hi> the next day at 7 in the Morning, where (after ſome private debate) it terminated thus; that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Magiſtrate, or a Conſtable with his Staff came to a Meeting to demand the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's Name and Habitation, he was at his liberty whether to declare it or no; upon which, finding which way the Hare run, I came home; and the Month of <hi>September</hi> following I gave <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> a perſonal Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to appear at our Monthly Meeting next following, at <hi>Chattiriſe</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> where I demanded Juſtice againſt <hi>Sam. Cater;</hi> but the Meeting refuſed and rejected my Reaſons; and then I appealed from thence to the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meeting as Superior; but that Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alſo, thro' the influence of <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> refuſed to do me right: Then I appealed from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40372:74"/>
thence to the Yearly Meeting <hi>Anno</hi> 1677. as Superior to them all; and as a preparatory for my matter, I wrot ſeven ſheets of Paper to <hi>W. Penn,</hi> called <hi>Speeches and Paſſages</hi> grounded upon an Edict made at the Yearly Meeting <hi>Anno</hi> 1675. Whereby the Hearers were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged neither to <hi>forſake, decline,</hi> nor <hi>remove</hi> their Meetings, like <hi>worldly, fearful</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> Profeſſors; and on that bottom, and for divers reaſons grounded thereupon, I ſet forth the reaſonableneſs that the Preachers [who thus adviſe and enjoyn the Hearers, and exhort them to ſtand valiant and give up all] ſhould likewiſe ſtand the brunt, and not ſhrink and turn back like Cowardly Officers, and become the ſame worldly and politick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors they adviſe us not to be like. I alſo wrot a Letter to <hi>W. Penn, J. Crook,</hi> and <hi>R. Barkley,</hi> referring the matter in controverſy to them. Thus being prepar'd, I went to the Yearly Meeting <hi>Anno</hi> 1677. and after ſome diſcourſe with <hi>W.

            <p>But when the Quarterly Meeting came, which was the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1677. I call'd for the written agreement; but <hi>Sam. Fulbig</hi> with whom it was entruſted, being <hi>Sam. Cater</hi>'s Creature would not produce it, neither would <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> allow, that the Meeting ſhould chuſe any but themſelves. Moreover, the Meeting reſolved againſt any other Election but themſelves, by which I perceived their deſign; but, being tired with an endleſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, I at laſt, tho very unwillingly, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Meeting, who choſe 12 out of themſelves to examine the matter, and to put an end to the controverſy, contrary to the condition of the recited agreement, which only impower'd the ſaid Quarterly Meeting to chuſe and elect, and not to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: However, they pretending they would do us equally Juſtice; I gave them my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which I had drawn from the Records of Conviction, and Warrant, and other things to ſet forth my right to the reſtitution of the ſaid 15 <hi>l.</hi> being Fined for my ſelf, for being at the ſaid Meeting 10 <hi>s.</hi> beſides this 15 <hi>l.</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:40372:75"/>
for <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> as by the Books above quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted I have largely ſet forth. Well, the 12 Perſons took my Writings, and going up <hi>Rob. Letchworth</hi>'s Chamber, thorow the Kitchen, one of the 12 threw all my Writings into the Fire, and burnt them unexamined, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, or ſo much as look'd on any one paſſage to demonſtrate my right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And about a quarter of an hour after, they ſent for us; and we being come up the Chamber to them, one of the ſelf-choſen Arbitrators directed his ſpeech to us, that they had determined the matter, and found <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> clear, and my demand unreaſonable; and that they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> and hoped that I would be quiet for the time to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom I replyed, that they had given away my right; and that I was able to demonſtrate the ſame if they would hear me; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd it was ended, and that they hoped I would now ſit down quiet, and reſt ſatisfied, but they would not give me the Award, and ſo me parted; but going home, one—<hi>Dan.</hi> a Quaker call'd me to him, and ſaid, <hi>Francis</hi> I am grieved to behold what foul play thou haſt had to day; wherein ſaid I? What doſt thou mean? Why reply'd—<hi>Dan.</hi> I ſat in the Kitchen as thy 12 Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors came thro' the Houſe to go up the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and I ſaw one of them throw all the Papers thou gav'ſt them in the Meeting to peruſe, and did burn them all without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on any one of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:40372:75"/>
Whereupon I ſent the ſaid Arbitrators a large Paper call'd a Preſcript, and Poſtſcripts with Summons to appear at the next Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meeting, concluding them accountable for their actions upon their own Principles, in <hi>Ed. Burrow</hi>'s <hi>Works p.</hi> 442. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>And we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all Governors and Rulers <hi>ought</hi> to be accountable to the People, and to the next ſucceeding Rulers for <hi>all</hi> their Actions, which may be enquired into upon occaſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> My charge to them was 1. In that they did not purſue the Terms of the recited A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. 2. That according to the ſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement they ought to have choſen Men, and not to Arbitrate the matter themſelves, when by the condition thereof they were only to chuſe and elect. 3. That contrary to all rules of Law in that caſe, they refuſed me a Copy of their Award, and thereupon I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my ſelf at liberty from their Award. 4. In that they burned my Evidences which ſet forth my Title to the reſtitution of the ſaid 15 <hi>l.</hi> without any examination, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon condemned me upheard; all which put me upon writing the ſaid Preſcript in Proſe, and Poſtſcript in Verſe; the latter follows in theſe words.</p>

               <l>Not minding Juſtice, Equity, or Laws.</l>

            <p>Having proceeded thus far in this old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, it will not be amiſs to let the World ſee how <hi>Sam. Cater</hi>'s caſe was manag'd. Firſt by partial Judges, as above told; and next by lying Lawyers: For, <hi>Tho. Rudyard, S. Cater</hi>'s Lawyer, thus ſaid in his defence, about the 15 <hi>l.</hi> I ſuffered for <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> as aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>The Fine of 15 <hi>l.</hi> was paid in Money volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, <hi>before</hi> diſtreſs was made, which is a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that our Teſtimony was ever againſt; and has been oftentimes 3 or 4 times the value of the thing demanded, and charge;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40372:79"/>
becauſe they could neither pay, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for ſuch ſpoiling their Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this went a great way with many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, that I ſhould pay the Money vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily before diſtreſs was made; and the further in that <hi>Geo. Whitehead,</hi> who ſays in his Preface to his Book ſtil'd <hi>Judgment Fixed,</hi> &amp;c. <q>If I did not feel the Lord my God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a real neceſſity upon me to be publickly concerned in this controverſy, I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to ſit down mute: But the Lord has laid the neceſſity, and in diſcharging my Duty, I neither conſult events, nor fear ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Now Reader obſerve, and I will ſhew thee one inſtance of many that might be mentioned, by which thou may'ſt meaſure the reality of this neceſſity which <hi>G. W.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends God [that cannot lye, nor move any to lye] laid upon him in ſuch a degree, that he in writing that Book, neither conſulted events nor yet feared effects: For, this <hi>T. Rudyard</hi> the Lawyer had ſaid in defence of his Client <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> that I <hi>Fra. Bugg</hi> paid my 15 <hi>l.</hi> Fine voluntarily, <hi>before</hi> diſtreſs was made. And Reader this was a lye, as I can prove by 20 Witneſſes ſtill alive; for my Goods were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and carried to an Inn, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>White Hart</hi> in our Town; and there lay until I entered my Appeal, at which time I paid the Money, and took my Goods again; and to the truth of what I ſay, and to prove <hi>G.

            <p>Again, ſee <hi>W. Rogers</hi> ſecond ſcourge for <hi>G.

For, this <hi>Dagon</hi> Money, raiſed by the <hi>Common Bankers</hi> amongſt the Quakers, has an ill tendency many ways. Well, let us hear <hi>W.

            <l>And yet when ſhe <hi>Rome</hi>'s Siſter is but call'd,</l>

            <l>Till both was ſcorn'd, and they grew worſe and worſe.</l>
            <p>Thus Reader, you ſee Teſtimony after Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt their raiſing Money for their Teachers in a clandeſtine way, pretending they do all things free, without Money, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reward. Now hear <hi>Tho.

            </p>
            <l>But that Chriſt's Miniſters ſhould be ſupply'd</l>
            <l>With neceſſaries by his Church, his Bride,</l>
            <l>Is ſuch a known and certain truth as none</l>
            <l>Perhaps has e'er oppos'd but thee alone.</l>
            <l>That 'tis the Churches duty to ſupply</l>
            <l>The needful wants of all her Miniſtry;</l>
            <l>And truth it is too plain to be deny'd;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:40372:84"/>
Chriſt's Church ſhould for Chriſt's Miniſters provide.</l>
            <l>What carps thou at then <hi>[William]</hi> would thy muſe</l>
            <l>Plead that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not this priviledge uſe;</l>
            <l>That what was lacking to him privately,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Macedonian</hi> Brethren did ſupply.</l>
            <l>Thus it appear'd the Apoſtle did partake</l>
            <l>Of that Proviſion that the Church did make;</l>
            <l>Chriſts Miniſters to furniſh, and their need</l>
            <l>Supply when they want money to proceed.</l>
            <l>Pretend thou can'ſt not that this Stock is given</l>
            <l>To ſuch as have no need thereof, but even</l>
            <l>Thy flurt at <hi>Richardſon</hi> for taking pay,</l>
            <l>For what as Clark he writes, do much bewray</l>
            <l>Thy folly and injuſtice, is't not fit</l>
            <l>Who works for others ſhould be paid for it;</l>
            <l>And that by them who him to work deſire,</l>
            <l>The labourer is worthy of his hire.</l>
            <p>Thus has <hi>Ellwood</hi> confeſt the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and tells us 'tis too plain to be denyed, as indeed it is. Thus you ſee, they confeſs their Miniſters take Money; their Clarks take Money. Why then do they ſo bitterly enveigh againſt the Clergy for taking Money; and pretend that their Miniſters take none? But if Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> would open his Books of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, we ſhould ſee how many Thouſand Pounds their Speakers have in a Year, beſides their private Quarters, who comes like Flies and Mice uncall'd, or unſent for; and ſo live on the Proviſion of others: And this I may ſay, that their Miniſtry hath coſt me as much
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40372:84"/>
in 4 Weeks, as the publick Miniſtry has coſt me in 4 Years; and yet, theſe are the free Preachers, free Writers, and free People if you will believe them. But, having been more large on this Head in my Book, <hi>Batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rams againſt new Rome:</hi> &amp;c.

            <head>A Poſtſcript by way of Dialogue.</head>
            <p>READER, by the Firſt Part of this Book I have ſet forth the Quakers claim to their Tytle, to be the true Church of the Firſt Born; and from their Books have proved the contrary; as alſo cleared the Magiſtracy from the <hi>Odium</hi> of Perſecution: And by the ſecond part I have Hiſtorically treated of the Riſe, Growth, and Progreſs of Quakeriſm; ſhewing not ſo much the Names and Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft Profeſſions of that People, the Places of their abode, with ſome other particulars thereabout; the ſame being excellently well done by the Author of the General Hiſtory of the Quakers, but how and by what means Quakeriſme hath advanced; and therein have modeſtly corrected the ſaid Hiſtorian, and ſhewed him his miſtakes in many things; as alſo corroborated and ſtrengthened him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is right; and now I am come, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion's ſake by way of Dialogue, to handle ſome points relating to both Parts, in which I ſhall ſuggeſt nothing, but what I ſtand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make appear: And this familiar Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between <hi>Thomas</hi> a Preacher, and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamen</hi> their Clark, I ſhall endeavour further to illuſtrate the matter in hand, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <speaker>Clark,</speaker>
               <p>Pretty well here away; only here are ſome Apoſtate Quakers that are like thorns in our ſides, who hinder the progreſs of Truth, and ſeem to follow the ſteps of <hi>Luther</hi> and others, who you know were great Enemies to our elder Siſter <hi>Rome.</hi> However, there is but few that go from us prove Champions for the cauſe of others againſt us; yet I muſt confeſs <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath done us more hurt than any that ever went from us; for, he does charge us boldly, without fear of us or our power, with theſe Four things. 1. To deny Faith in Chriſt, as he dyed outwardy, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to our Salvation. 2. Juſtification and Sanctification
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40372:87"/>
by the Blood of Chriſt outwardly ſhed. 3. The Reſurrection of the Body that dyed. 4. And that we deny Chriſt's coming out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in his glorify'd Body, to Judge both the quick and the dead; and the general day of Judgment, as in his Narrative p. 14. And I perceive the Apoſtate Chriſtians are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pleaſed with this his Work, both Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians, Presbyterians, Independants, and Baptiſts; for, they all acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to all theſe Points, tho' in ſome things they differ each from others; and to be plain with you, I fear there is too much truth in what <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſays; pray how is it in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Merryland, Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Jerſy, Penſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, Burmodoes, Antego, Mevis, Holland,</hi> and other parts where you Travel, holding forth Truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Teacher,</speaker>
               <p>I do acknowledge that our Friend <hi>Barkly</hi> in his Anarchy p. 16. ſaith, <q>I find Profeſſors make but ſmall boaſting of any Proſelites they get from us; I hear little of their proving Champions for the Principles of others againſt us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> But to be plain, they ſo far prevail, that I find <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> the cunningeſt Writer we have [except Friend <hi>Penn,</hi> and <hi>Ellwood]</hi> is hardly able to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; and to be free with you, <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath proved ſuch a Champion for them, and againſt us, as that the City and Country, as well as parts beyond the Sea, ring of his ſame, for he has lighted ſuch a candle as we cannot blow out, nor extinguiſh the light thereof,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40372:88"/>
for both he and others produce matter of Fact from our Books, which none of us, if we would ſpeak truth, can deny; ſo that, to deal freely, I am of your mind; I fear there is too much truth in their Allegations againſt us on thoſe four Heads, which are ſuch four Fundamentals held by the Apoſtate Chriſtians, and ſo proved by the Letter, which they call the word of God, that I know not what to think of theſe things.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Clark,</speaker>
               <p>Pray what think you of <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Miracles, mentioned in his Journal; ſome talk ſtrangely of them, eſpecially <hi>Fra. Bugg;</hi> and this I obſerve, that whereas the Miracle wrought by the Apoſtles in the Name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was a means to convert the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith, and to confirm the believing <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But, theſe of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s, in regard he wrought them in his own Name only, they ſeem to be a means to ſhake the Faith and Confidence that ſome well wiſhers to us had of our Religion; nay, and to be plain, many amongſt us begin to doubt of them, and to think them too like the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Legend, and the counterfeit Miracles of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that Sorcerer; and I my ſelf am almoſt at a ſtand about them, and divers others of his aſſertions touching himſelf, which before our adverſaries quoted them, I did not take ſo much notice of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Teacher;</speaker>
               <p>Friend <hi>Benjamen</hi> you are in the right of it; for, betwixt You and I, Chriſt never wrought Miracles in a corner, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40372:88"/>
them 20 or 30 years after they are ſaid to be done, but in the face of the World, before multitudes of mixt People, Friends and Enemies; witneſs that of <hi>Cand</hi> in <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> where he turned Water into Wine; likewiſe his feeding many Thouſands with a few barly Loves, and a few ſmall Fiſhes. He healed all manner of Diſeaſes, whether the Diſeaſe were preſent or abſent; and ſome of his Miracles he wrought on the Sabbath day, which the Pharaſees, his great Enemies, found fault with him for, though they could not deny matter of Fact. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his Followers, who preached in his Name the Reſurrection of the dead; they likewiſe wrought Miracles, ſaying, in the Name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> riſe up and walk; and he (the Cripple) walked, and leaped, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clark,</speaker>
               <p>Ah, theſe were Miracles indeed: But this <hi>Fra. Bugg</hi> makes the World believe that <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Miracles are meer ſhams, lying wonders, and deluſions: and I muſt tell thee, I fear ſo too; and to be free, ſome Friends (tho' they dare not ſay it openly) think ſo as well as I; and for my part I do not like them at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Teacher,</speaker>
               <p>Like them, who can? I was at a Friend's Houſe not long ſince, where I heard an eminent Friend ſay, that ſince ſome had wrot ſo much againſt the Journal and Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhe had a mind to ſee it; and I asked her how ſhe liked it; ſhe ſaid, ſhe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40372:89"/>
did not like it at all; and indeed, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a few things, who can like it? For, 1. His Miracles were done in a corner no body knows where no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> when, otherwiſe than by his own relation. 2. Never publiſhed till many years after they are ſaid to be done. 3. They were wrought in his own Name only, and not in the Name of Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> 4. Here is not one Cripple that ever he cured, nor one dead Perſon that ever he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; nor one blind that ever he gave ſight too, to come forth and avouch that he was cured, was raiſed, was blind and now he ſees: and to be very plain, I do believe there never was any thing of a Miracle at all, but only an Artifice to hold the people in admiration of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and to confirm them in the belief that we are the only true Catholick Church of the Firſt-born; and that the Apoſtolick order thereof, as well as Miracles, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and re-eſtabliſhed amongſt us. But, let us have a care that no body hear us; for if this diſcourſe were known to <hi>G. W.</hi> I ſhould looſe my place, and you might be in danger to looſe yours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clark,</speaker>
               <p>But pray what think you of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to diſcerning, who ſaid he knew who were Saints, who were Devils, and who were Apoſtates without ſpeaking ever a word. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſaid, none need to furniſh him with diſcerning or judgment; Chriſt has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd us already, and doth on all occaſions.</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:40372:89"/>
               <speaker>Teacher,</speaker>
               <p>Oh Friend, I have been a Quaker more than 20 years, and am aſhamed to hear of ſuch vain boaſting: For indeed, if we were always thus furniſhed with diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and judgment on all occaſions, ſo that we knew who were Saints, Devils, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates without ſpeaking ever a word, how came it to paſs that <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> in his Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative p. 18. 19. was ſo miſtaken; that <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> was ſo miſtaken in <hi>Thomas Murford, Ste. Criſpe, Tho. Rudyard, Ezekiel Woolly,</hi> &amp;c. And how came it to paſs that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> was ſo miſtaken in <hi>Chriſtopher Atkinſon, Tho. Leacock, W. Warwick,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clark,</speaker>
               <p>But if this Journal be ſo erronious, ſo ſtuft with falſe and counterfeit Miracles, ſo thick larded with Antichriſtian, as well as Antiſcriptural Principles, why do our Friends thus run a whoring after it, as to have it taught in Schools, and placed in all Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meetings in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and parts beyond the Seas. Why is it ſent to the Univerſity to be reſerved to poſterity in their Library? and to be free, I think our Friends run a whoring after it, as much as the revolting <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did after the golden Calf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Come Friend <hi>Benjamen,</hi> I will An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you by what I have heard in my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. 1.

               <p>Why? You need not ask the Reaſon why?

As for your Common Prayer, the Pope gives Life to it, and from his Loins it draws its Strength.</p>

If ſo, then we are in a better Station then the Church Eſtabliſhed; for thee knoweſt how we Write againſt both Prieſts and People; we Summon, Arraign, Try, and Condemn them, as I ſaid before; pray An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me Cordially; do you think this is good Arguing? that becauſe the Government have tolerated us, that therefore none may Write againſt us, that none may Challenge us. I am perſwaded, that the Epiſcopolians, are much kinder to us, then we ſhould be to them, had we the Swaying of the Scepter.</p>

In Anſwer to whom here our Brother <hi>Hubborthorn,</hi> an Eminent, and early Writer and Preacher, <hi>viz.</hi>

What Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is here? You will not tolerate Popery, nor ſuch as Worſhip a falſe God, nor any that ſpeak Contemptuouſly of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor any that deny the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Word of God; and yet you are not againſt the tolerating Epiſcopacy Presbytetry, or any ſtinted form: Why will you not tolerate Popery, as well as Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy? Have not the Profeſſors of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Murdered and Slain, and do Labour to Murder and Slay the People of God, as well as the Papiſts; and will you tolerate the Common Prayer among the Epiſcopacy, and not the Maſs-book among the Papiſts; ſeeing that the Maſs was the Subſtance, out of which the Common Prayer was Extracted. Here is nothing but Partiality to tolerate one Thing, and not another of the ſame kind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40372:93"/>
that the Pope gives Life and Breath to it; and that from the Popes Loins it draws its Strength; that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the Whore, and the Parliament the Beaſt that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her. That the Biſhops and Miniſters are Monſters, which from the Adulterous Womb of the Church are brought forth, that we have rip'd up the Bowels (of the Church) and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her Adulterous Womb.

Secondly, That Juſtification, and Sanctification; is by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt outwardly ſhed, being applyed by Faith and the Operation of his Holy Spirit in us. Thirdly, That after Death, there will be a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body that dyeth. Fourthly, And that Chriſt will come without us in his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Body, at the Day of Judgment, to Judge both the Quick and the Dead, and whoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples lead him to ſubmit to Authority; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

do not permit the Presbyterians to hold a Synod, unleſs they have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner Recide therein; but I confeſs, we are above that.

            <p>I think the Friends have ſpoke more truth in a corner in two or three hours time, than all their Leaders have Preached this 20 years. But ſay ſome, if theſe things be ſo in very deed, how came they to obtain ſo many and frequent Favours of the Government? I Anſwer, becauſe the Parliament do not know them, no more than <hi>Conſtantius</hi> knew the Hypocriſy of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who at length, thro' their ſubtle deluſions, and fair pretences, prevail'd and got the Pulpit and the Orthodox baniſhed; and I have heard ſome fear the like conſequence reſpecting the Quakers: But, let ſuch be ſatisfied that Quakeriſm is at the heighth and begins to tumble; and our Governours, both of Church and State, begin to ſee them. I remember that in 1693. They were very fair to obtain a Bill for their ſolemn Affirmation to go for an Oath; but when I deliver'd in my ſheet, ſhewing their Principles, in two hours time it was thrown out, and, as <hi>Col. Goldwell</hi> told me, there was not a Man appeared for them; and when I came to <hi>London, March</hi> 1696. ſome worthy Members of the Commons Houſe chid me for not coming ſooner, ſaying they wanted matter of Fact; adding that the Quakers frequent and unwearied Sollicitation prevail'd with too many worthy Gentlemen, who underſtand not their undermining Principles. However much good may their obtained Bill do 'em, ſince the 10 <hi>l.</hi> clauſe is in, and they barr'd from any place of Truſt, ſo much as of being Conſtable: And whereas their judgment is, <hi>whatever is more than yea, yea, and nay, nay, cometh of evil,</hi> and is Swearing, yet now they muſt call God to witneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is indeed not leſs nor more than an Oath; and this pleaſes ſome of them that could Swear before, but ſome it diſpleaſes who ſay, the Act do them no good; for whatever is more than yea, yea, nay, nay, is swearing. Well, but may ſome ſay, have not the Quakers Merrited the favour beſtowed on them, yea by the rule of contraries, for the Quakers have Recogniz'd the Parliament Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40372:96"/>
the Beaſt that carry the Whore; and that it's as commendable to give Liberty of Conſcience to the Papiſts, nay to a People that worſhip falſe Gods, graven Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to tollerate Epiſcopacy, the falſe Church, whoſe Bowels they have ripped up; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the Common Prayer Book is Popery, and from the Loyns of the Pope receiv'd its Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Parliament have, as they pretend and often boaſt, Recogniz'd them Proteſtant Diſſenters, give them their Liberty without any reſtraint; but how? not knowing them nor their Principles, but, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> was; are miſtaken in them, whoſe Books and Carriages are of two ſorts. I remember the laſt Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuntide in <hi>Northcoat</hi>'s Shop in <hi>George-yard Lombard-ſtreet, W. Mead</hi> the great Quaker, asked me, if I broke Bread with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I ſaid yea; what, ſaid he, doſt thou lick up thy old Vomit? I'll warrant you he ſaid no ſuch word to the Worthy Members of the Houſe of Commons, nor to the Biſhops of the Church; no, no, as their Books carry two different Faces; ſo do their Carrage; and if it be Criminal to conceal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt my natural Prince, what is it to conceal theſe Impoſtors? who undervalue the Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt; condemn his Laws, deſpiſe his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, revile his Magiſtrates, and reproach his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, which I hope this Book fully ſets forth; and which I ſtand ready to prove out of their Books upon <hi>G. W.</hi>'s Propoſition to the Parliament, as cited by me, in the Firſt Part p. 123. And until they do ſo meet, and if proved upon them, then Retract them, they are not to be believed, tho' in their Meetings they like the Magitians in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time may make the likeneſs of the ſame Confeſſion and Profeſſion that <hi>G, Keith</hi> and others do, as well as in their late Books; yet while their other Books, which teach the contrary, ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned, the Quakers are Quakers ſtill, and their Principles diametrically oppoſite to all Chriſtians, Saints and Martyrs in all Ages; and they ought to be guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt, as Enemies to Church and State.</p>

            <p>Reader, I have in this little Map, given thee a hint of the Doctrines of the Quaker Church: I think they are ſo abominable Erronious, Blaſphemous, and Uncharitable, that they need no Comment; and as to the Quaker Church, their Bride, and their Lambs Wife; if you ſtill ask me for a Diſcription of her; I tell you they are a broken divided Sect; who
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40372:103"/>
adhear to the Teachers of this Doctrine; tho' in their Meetings before the World's People; they ſometimes talk a little otherwiſe, but ſearch their Books, eſpecially their old ones (and they are not changed) and this is the perfect Figure, nay, plain Words of their Doctrine. But if any one, or more will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their Recited Errors publickly under their Hands; they thenceforth are not of their Church, but ought to be taken in as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, even as <hi>G. Keith</hi> and his Friends have done, whom I neither Interrogate nor Accuſe. And now if after all, their deluded Diſciples, will not be ſo noble, as to ſearch, and after ſearching to to Renounce them, and their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but will ſtill remain willingly Ignorant; it is a great ſign that God has given them up to ſtrong Deluſion.</p>
            <p>Reader, the deſign of the Recited Book, Intituled, <hi>Some Reflections upon the Quakers Proteſtation,</hi> &amp;c. And all that's Wrote againſt them, is only to bring them to a thorow Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their Errors; and to ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and Confeſſion of them, as is Indiſpenſible to a true Conviction; there is nothing more deſired of them than to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and diſown what is proved to be Faulty in their Writings, and ſuch Faults too, as are either Deſtructive to the Faith, or Scandalous (and ſo Sinful) to the Reputation of their Neighbours, in giving Falſe and Uncharitable Repreſentations of them: And this they are obliged to do by all the Rulers of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40372:104"/>
it being the ſmalleſt Satisfaction they can make, to repair (ſo far at leaſt) the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that are thereby done to the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the Good Name of thoſe they have Wrongfully Traduced; they are the Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, they have Attack'd our Religion in all the Parts of it, our Biſhops, and Clergy, and our whole Conſtitution; and we require no greater Amends for all that they have done againſt us, then to ſay that they are ſorry for it, and though they ſhould refuſe us, even this Juſtice, and reaſonable Security for the future; yet we preſs for no Perſecution againſt them, for no Fines, or Impriſonment; but only that we ſhould not be obliged to acknowledge them as true Proteſtants; and that we may have Liberty to Juſtifie our Selves and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, againſt the Calumnies with which they have loaded both: And if this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed us, the Cry of Perſecution will run on our ſide: Is it no Perſecution of the Tongue for the Quakers to Repreſent our Biſhops and Clergy, as the moſt odious of Mankind.</p>
            <p>We grant their is a Toleration, but 'tis only for Religious Worſhip, but with all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Doors be open; ſo as any may go in and ſee what they do; but not to hold General Councels, with their Doors Lock'd up, or a Guard of three or four Stout Men to keep all out, but whom they'll admit; and their Buſineſs is Government, that's plain, which is no way within the Act of Parliament; for there is a Clauſe in the Act, p, 307. <q>Be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40372:104"/>
it Enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, That if any Aſſembly of Perſons, Diſſenting from the Church of England, ſhall be had in any Place for Religious Worſhip † with the Doors lockt, bard <note place="margin">Mark, tho' they do not always Bolt and Barr, yet have they 3 or 4 luſty Fellows to keep Guard during their Convocation.</note> or bolted, during any time of ſuch Méeting together, they ſhall not receive any benefit from this Law; but be lyable to all the Pains and Penalties of all the aforeſaid Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> which Prohibit all Convocations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King's Licenſe; much more to Enact, Promulgate, or Decree any Orders or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Now if the Biſhops and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> tho' Recogniz'd and Eſtabliſh'd by Law, wou'd incur a Premunire; ſo much as to meet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, and debate, tho' concerning only their own Order and Spiritual Juriſdiction, without the King's Licence. How then have the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers this Authority to hold their yearly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation without controle; and with their Doors either lock'd and bar'd, or a Guard at them; and when there, not only to make Laws for their People to obſerve, but to Repeal, if not Verbally, yet Vertually the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>And further, If when the Clergy do meet in Council, Convocation, or Synod; the King may have his Commiſſioners preſent to Inſpect and even to Regulate their Proceedings, That nothing may be their Tranſacted prejudicial to the Government: How much more reaſonable is it to have the Quakers Synods Inſpected,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40372:105"/>
who have given ſuch demonſtration of their Antimagiſtratical Principles. If Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and Princes have had their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and Miniſters preſent in general Councils; If the Hugonots in <hi>France</hi> have ſubmitted, nay deſired and requeſted to have the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners preſent in their Synods, which by His Majeſties Grace and Favour they have been ſuffered to hold: If the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' now Eſtabliſh'd as the National Religion, have a Commiſſioner preſent in their general Aſſemblies, why ſhould the Quakers not be oblig'd to receive a Commiſſioner from the Government to recide in their Anniverſary Synods. If at their beginning they were too Inconſiderable for the notice of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they are now become a numerous and wealthy People; and in all reſpects worthy not to be neglected; eſpecially if their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be as their Writings ſet forth: And their not meeting <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and others who have in like manner challeng'd them, is not the leaſt demonſtration of their Guilt.</p>
            <div type="postscript">
               <head>The Poſtſcript to the Map.</head>
               <p>Being told that the Quakers had Anſwer'd my Book <hi>The Qua. Set,</hi> I went yeſterday to their Bookſellers Shop, in <hi>White-hart court</hi> for one, but found it not; but ſeeing <hi>G. Whitehead's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt the venome of the Snake,</hi> &amp;c. I found two Paſſages, which being Reply'd to, may indifferently ſerve for an Anſwer to the Book. For, no Charge can be undenyably true upon them: Why? Becauſe they can deny any Charge how true ſoever it be. Again, if they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40372:105"/>
will not Determin a Point in Controverſie, being proved out of their moſt Authentick Authors; unleſs we can produce the Original Manuſcript Copy, which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us to do; then farewel all Anſwering Books: Behold the Quakers run, and are ready to give up their Cauſe, the Paſſages are theſe. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Snake,</hi> &amp;c. ſaid, <q>That Mr. <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> was an Ancient, Worthy, and moſt Sincere Gentleman (as indeed none that know him, can with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Colour of Juſtice ſay the contrary) who had been invegled with their Falſe Shew and Pretence, to Piety, till he diſcovered their Groſs Immoralities; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complained of, tho' the Fact could not be denyed; yet they could not Senſure any, that remained in their Unity, for which Reaſon he at laſt left them:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. W's. Antidote,</hi> 252. Anſwer, as his Character of <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> is in the Superlative Degree, appears Flattery, and his Scandalous Story's on his behalf; and reaſon of leaving us, appears neither True, nor Impartial: I never had any undeniable Proof of the Matter of Fact heard from <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> Well done <hi>George,</hi> thou art in the right on't; for I never knew any Matter of Evil Fact Charged on the Quakers, and their Errors; but thou haſt had the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to deny it, at leaſt as Stated, or in ſome other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical manner: So that 'tis Morally Impoſſible to prove Matter of Fact againſt the Quakers undenyably True. Why? becauſe they have a Face of Braſs, to deny any Matter of Fact againſt them; how true ſoever it be, of which this Antidote is not the leaſt Inſtance; and for which Reaſon, I could wiſh the Author of the <hi>Snake</hi> may not trouble himſelf to Reply:</p>
               <p>Again, 2dly, p. 254. <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> has Cited a Paſſage in the <hi>Snake,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz. Quakers Regiſtring their Sufferings for the Truth</hi> (as they call it) would make them exceed all the Ten Perſecutions, and to be more Undeſcerving than the Sufferings of Chriſt himſelf, or the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> Anſwers. <q>Theſe are Falſe Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, we have no ſuch hopes he <hi>(i. e.</hi> Snake) Cites <hi>Edward Burrough</hi>'s Unfairly, and Partially in this Point: And yet the Compariſon of the Quakers Sufferings, as Greater, and more Unjuſt than in the Days of Chriſt,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40372:106"/>
and his Apoſtles, or any time ſince, is a miſtake. And whether it was ſo firſt Verbally Stated by <hi>Edward Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>'s, or ſome time ſince; I ſhall not Determin, unleſs I ſee the Original Copy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> I do poſitively Affirm, and before any Ten Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Proteſtant Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> Epiſcopal, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Independent, or Baptiſts, will prove that the from Recited Authors Charge is undeniably true Matter of Fact. But what then, <hi>G. W.</hi> ſtill complains of Evil Suggeſtions, of Unfair, and Partial Citations; tho' poor Heart he is ſo Stung with this Snake, that he is forced to acknowledge a Miſtake, ſome where, but duſt not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min where; oh horrible! what, a Book Wrote in 1657. by one of their Inſpired Prophets, as the Word of the Lord, and diſperſed 15 Years up and down the Nations, and then Reprinted, by thy own Approbation, dear <hi>George,</hi> with thine, and <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Epiſtles of Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. And now to tell us of a Miſtake, but know not where, and to call for Original Manuſcripts, Wrote 40 Years ſince; is ſuch a piece of Fallible Infallibility; that had I room, I ſhould farther enlarge upon it.</p>
