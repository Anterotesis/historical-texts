         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Esaiah 57. Verse 2.</bibl>
               <q>He shall enter into peace, they shall rest in
their beds, each one walking in his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Life of Man is compared in
Scripture unto sundry things upon
different and various accounts in
respect of the brevity and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it. St. <hi>Iames</hi> tells us it is
<hi>a vapour</hi> that appears for a little
while and soon vanisheth away. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it may be said of every one of us as <hi>Virgil</hi>
once did of his <hi>Marcellus, God shews him to the World
only, and so recalls him.</hi> God presents us here a
while upon the Theatre of the World for to act
our parts, and then sends us into the retiring
Room the Grave, the place appointed for all that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106452:3"/>
are living. So short is Mans stay in the World, that
<hi>Iob</hi> allows him none at all, <hi>Naked came I into the
World, and naked shall I return,</hi> saith he. Here is
coming and returning out, but not a word of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
here. The time of life is so inconsiderable,
that <hi>Solomon</hi> the wisest of men would grant him
none at all. <hi>There is a time,</hi> saith he, <hi>for every
thing under the Sun, a time to be born, and a time to dye.</hi>
As if he would have us to understand, that the
middle time betwixt our birth and our death (that
is the time of life) was not to be reckoned upon at
all. So that you see not onely every mans life is
a <hi>Vapour,</hi> but less in respect of its shortness. But
the good and holy man hath his Life compared to
other things upon other Considerations. Upon
the account of his hardship and perpetual fighting
and watching; his frequent encounter with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and his continual obligation to duty. A
good mans life is called a <hi>warfare,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4.
<hi>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but
mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds.</hi>
And upon the account of his toyl and trouble,
weariness and continual travel; upon the account of
his absence from the Lord, and his daily tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to Heaven, which is his proper home. So the
Life of a good man is called a <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> saith
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106452:3"/>
the Patriarch <hi>Iacob, Few and evil have been the dayes
of the years of the life of my pilgrimage.</hi> But as the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
fights not without a prospect of Peace, <hi>Pax
quaeritur bello,</hi> Peace is the end of War. And as the
weary Pilgrim doth not Travel but in hopes of an
after-rest, So God almighty for the encouragement
of his Soldiers in the Fight, and his Pilgrim in the
Journey, he hath set before him (as in the glass of
the Promse) these two most suitable things for
him, <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Rest,</hi> for so saith the Text,
<hi>He shall enter into peace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Where we have,
<list>
                  <item>1. A Promise or Priuiledg, <hi>they shall enter into
peace, they shall rest in their beds,</hi> like <hi>Issachar</hi> the
Son of <hi>Iacob</hi> here they do couch under the double
burdens of Warr and Weariness, of Want and
Weakness; but <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>rest,</hi> these will ease them
of all they suffer, supply all they want, recruit
them with new additions of strengths, <hi>They
shall enter into peace,</hi> &amp;c. And now I have but
named that word <hi>Peace,</hi> methinks I may say as
<hi>Leah</hi> concerning her Son <hi>Gad, Behold a Troop cometh.</hi>
For under this name are couched all those Favours
and Blessings of God, which have the Sweetest Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications.
All the Joyes and Beatitudes that are
so numerous and full bloomed here, but ripe in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106452:4"/>
Heaven. <hi>They shall enter into peace,</hi> Some read it,
and so your margin, <hi>Go in peace,</hi> depart the
World with Serenity and Satisfaction, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Quiet and Repose. But,</item>
                  <item>2. Others read it, <hi>He shall go into peace,</hi> (that is)
shall be received into Heaven where the God of
Peace is, the righteous man shall be there; <hi>he shall
enter into peace,</hi> that is to note, it is the priviledg of
the Soul (especially)</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, for this is the man, the He; the Soul is
the Jewel, the Body is but the Caskinet; the Soul
the principal, the other bnt the appurtenance:
and <hi>they shall rest in their beds,</hi> that is the priviledg
of the Body, (not Soul) it shall be laid down to
repose it self in the Grave which Jesus Christ hath
perfumed as in a bed, till such time the Morning
of the Resurrection begin to dawn, and the Trump
of the Arch-Angel to sound, then it shall rise from
thence and enter into the Souls Peace.</p>
            <p>2. Here is a description of the Persons to
whom these priviledges appertain; We need not
say as the Eunuch of Queen <hi>Candace,</hi> when he read
a passage out of this Prophet, <hi>Of whom spake the
Prophet this, of himself, or some other man?</hi> For the
Prophet hath told us, <hi>Each one walking in his upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
Whosoever he is that doth deal justly with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106452:4"/>
Man, and walks equally, that is, Conscientiously,
with God, he shall have this priviledg of <hi>Rest and
Peace, He shall enter into peace, and rest in his bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When this Priviledg and Promise shall be
imparted to them; When shall they be instated
and put into the actual possession, and injoyment
of this priviledge. It is true, that this is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Text, but strongly implyed, and is
fairly to be taken notice of as the words of the
Text have relation to the words going before,
<hi>The righteous perishing,</hi> (that is, dying) <hi>and merciful
men taken away,</hi> that is by death out of the World.</p>
            <p>Then it is told what Death takes them from, <hi>They
are taken from the Evil to come.</hi> And here followes
in the Text what death brings them to, <hi>They shall
enter into peace.</hi> So the intent is this, That as death
comes to a good man with a Dart in one hand to
kill him, and a Spade in the other to bury him;
So he brings him Flowers that shall be able to keep
him sweet, <hi>Peace</hi> for his Soul, and <hi>Rest</hi> for his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and this is the time he shall be put in injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it.</p>
            <p>From all the Point is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That when a Righteous man dyes, he enters upon the
estate of Peace and Rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will only give you two Scriptures for this,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106452:5"/>
which two Scriptures may be instead of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
<hi>Psalm 37. Verse 37. Mark the perfect man, and
behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace.</hi> His
end is as his death is, at that time he hath peace. It
may be not at the beginning, not in the middle of
his life, but at the end. It's possible that his morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may be cloudy and over-cast; his Sun may
suffer an Eclipse at Noon-day, a darkness may
come upon his Meridian glory; but his Night, his
End, this shall be Clear and Fair, Still and Quiet,
Pleasant and Delightful, that's the first place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other is in</hi> Revelat. 14. 13. And I heard a
voyce from Heaven, saying unto me, Write, Blessed are
the dead which dye in the Lord, from henceforth, yea saith
the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours, and
their works do follow them. <hi>They have at death both
Peace and Rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now this Point will require these things
to be spoken to.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Who or what the Righteous is.</item>
               <item>2. What Peace they shall have and be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
with at the time of their death.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, Who is the Righteous man? The Text
saith, he that <hi>walks in uprightness.</hi> Alas, where is
he to be found? A man must have very good
Eyes to find him out. Especially if we consider
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106452:5"/>
what is said <hi>Psal. 53. 1, 2. There is none that doth
good. God looked down from Heaven upon the Children
of men, and saw none righteous, no not one.</hi> Then
farewell Priviledge, for where is the Person?</p>
            <p>To answer this. There is indeed none that
are strictly legally Righteous, but there is in a
larger Evangelical sence. None that are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in themselves, but in another. We have the
Righteousness of Justification from Christ, and of
Sanctification from Christ; And they are the men
that <hi>shall enter into peace and rest.</hi> Those men, I
say, that are men of Sincerity, though not in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Those men that are righteous in the aim
and desire of their hearts; And in comparison of
others, Righteous by Gods acceptation, and by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the Righteousness of Christ; These
are the Persons that shall partake of this priviledg,
<hi>He shall enter into Peace, they shall rest in their beds, &amp;c.</hi>
But then,</p>
            <p>2. What <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Rest</hi> shall these men be
priviledged with at the time of their death?</p>
            <p>There are Singular Properties of this Peace.
For,
<list>
                  <item>1. It's a Peace that is unconceiveable. Man's
Eye hath bored the Sphears, and hath penetrated
into the very depth of the Ocean; it hath searched
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106452:6"/>
into the very Bowels of the Earth, and into the
wild Bellies of the Clouds above; it hath travelled
through all the expanded Firmament in all places
of the World, and hath rifled the Cabinet of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
below, but it could never grasp the nature
of this true <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Rest</hi> here spoken of: for as to
this, <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nor hath it entred
into the Heart of Man to conceive the Peace of God.</hi> The
Apostle tells us, <hi>it passeth knowledg.</hi> The Beatitudes
of Heaven are only known to us as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was to the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> of which she said,
<hi>Behold, I have not heard the tenth part.</hi> The glorious
Inhabitants of Heaven, the Angels and Souls of
Just Men made perfect, these indeed understand
more the nature of it than we, because they live
in it: Yet so, as the Apostle discoursing of Gods
Counsel was forced to cry out, <hi>Rom. 11. 33. Oh the
depth of the riches both of the wisdome and knowledge of
God! how unsearchable are his Iudgments, and his wayes
past finding out!</hi> So do these bright Spirits ravish
and loose themselves in the depth of Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
The Provision he hath made for them in
Heaven, doth excell even their own admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
                  <item>2. It is a most Perfect and a most Compleat
Peace; <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106452:6"/>
nothing shall offend them,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> And saith the
Prophet <hi>Esay, Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose
Mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.</hi> Both
these are in this Life, that which the Psalmist and
Prophet spake of. Oh that great Peace, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Peace! And if the gleanings of <hi>Abiezer</hi> be
such, what will be the Vintage of <hi>Ephraim?</hi> If
this is the Righteous man's Priviledge here upon
Earth, much more in Heaven; For it must needs
be a perfect Peace there, seeing no enemy shall
appear in the face of them, all shall be conquered
and subdued, overcome, escaped from, for there,
there will be a Peace from Sin. Whilst we are alive,
the best of men are pulled and pained by Sin;
they are under the continual Solicitations of the
corruption of their own Nature. There is a
body of death, that by the noysome stench of it we
are miserably molested and disquieted, and to that
height, that each of them is ready to cry out, <hi>Oh
wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the
body of this death?</hi> While they are here, there is a
Law in the members rebells against the Law of
the mind. What willingness soever there is in
the spirit, they find the flesh is weak. A treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Party dwells in their very bowels, and is
continually undermining those Fortifications they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106452:7"/>
vour to raise, and set open and to widen the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and to let in our worst enemies; <hi>These Sons
of Zerviah are too hard for us:</hi> but when once a holy
man cometh to dye, no more shall Corruption
sollicit, no more have they depraved Natures to
struggle with; No weights of Sin to weigh us
down, no more shall they complain of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their hearts, their indisposition to holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
of the weakness of the flesh, the power of
Corruption; No more complaining of the usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power of sin upon the Soul. Then,</item>
                  <item>3. It is a peace and rest from the Temptations
of Sathan. Here it is that we are in <hi>Arena, We
wrestle not only with flesh and blood, but with Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Powers, and spiritual wickednesses in high places.</hi>
Here it is that Satan doth desire to have us that he
may sift us as Wheat, as it was said of the Apostle
<hi>Peter.</hi> It is not <hi>David</hi> alone that Satan stands up
to provoke to that that is evil, but his fiery darts
fly fast and thick, his messengers are not only sent
to buffet <hi>Paul,</hi> but all the rest of Gods People; but
being once in this rest, they are out of the reach of
the roaring Lion. And they may say of Heaven
as <hi>Lamech</hi> of his Son <hi>Noah, Gen. 5. 29. This same shall
comfort us concerning our work and toyl of our hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the ground which the Lord hath Cursed.</hi> So this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106452:7"/>
Peace shall save us and keep us in freedom from
the Temptations of Satan.</item>
                  <item>4. Death giveth them peace and rest from the
violence of men. Read that of <hi>Heb. 11. 36, 37.
And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea
moreover of bonds and imprisonment; they were stoned,
they were sawn asunder,</hi> and what not. Here you
find the footsteps of the world's usage of the Saints.
But as when <hi>Ionah</hi> was asleep and at rest in the
bottom of the Ship, the blustring storms and death-threatning
Tempests were as nothing to him. So
it is with these, <hi>Iob</hi> 3. 17. That holy man speaking
of the Grave, <hi>There the wicked</hi> (saith he) <hi>cease from
troubling, and there the weary be at rest.</hi> In this Life
it is as <hi>Solomon</hi> observeth, <hi>Eccles. 4. 1, 2. So I returned
and considered all the oppressions under the Sun, and behold
the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,
and on the side of their oppressors there was power,
and they had no Comforter; Wherefore I praised the dead
which are already dead, more than the living which are
yet alive.</hi> As much as to say, These have escaped, these are sensible of no such matter, but are Quiet;
they are at <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Rest.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. At peace and rest from inward Troubles,
which a man is liable unto upon sundry occasions
in this Life; such as the death and departure of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106452:8"/>
ones best Friends, chiefest Relations. Here you
see a great King in the bitterness of his grief cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, <hi>O Absolon, my Son, my Son, would God I had
dyed for thee, O Absolon my Son, my Son.</hi> In <hi>Ramah</hi>
you hear a lamentation and voyce of weeping,
<hi>Rachel weeping for her Children and would not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
because they are not.</hi> Here you have <hi>Mary</hi>
bewailing <hi>Lazarus</hi> her Brother; And the Sons of
<hi>Iacob</hi> mourning over their Father. But in Heaven
there is Peace and Rest; once there, we shall lose
them no more: <hi>For then,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>we shall
ever be with the Lord.</hi> Earth only and Hell is the
Territory of death; but Heaven is the Land of the
Living, and there we shall find them again. And
this is something of the nature of that Peace which
Righteous men shall by death be instated in, and
made Possessors of.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I hasten to the improvement of this Point,
wherein I shall be short.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> If <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Rest</hi> is to be our Priviledg
hereafter, Then,
<list>
                  <item>1. It should be our desire here; So the Apostle
commandeth, <hi>Follow peace with all men.</hi> Such Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
as delight to live in the fire of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
these of all other men are most unfit for
Heaven, for that is a Place of Peace.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106452:8"/>2. Let the Priviiedges of good men allure us
to a resemblance of their Persons, and their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
All men like <hi>Balaam</hi> are ready to cry out, <hi>Let
me dye the death of the Righteous, and let my latter end
be like his.</hi> Would fain dye like them, with the
same Hope, Peace, Serenity, and Quiet of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
Let my latter end be like his, as <hi>Balaam</hi>
said. But such as will dye as they, must also live
as they.</item>
                  <item>3. If death is the time of Peace and Rest with
Righteous men, then it is to be understood that
the time of Life is to be a time of Labour and
Warfare. If so be Death is our Night to repose in,
then sure Life should be our Day to work in.
The best of men have business enough to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; head-strong Passions to quell, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
to mortifie, grace to grow, a race to run,
a battle to fight, therefore let us up and be doing,
and set about that that is our work; and that the
rather, because,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>They rest best that have laboured most.</hi> When a
man hath ordered his business, and disposed of his
affairs as he intended, then he hath charmed and
subdued his Care, and hath no disquieting thoughts
to disturb his repose. <hi>The sleep of a labouring man
is sweet,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon:</hi> So he that busied himself in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106452:9"/>
the Work and Service of God while he was alive,
goes to his rest with the greatest calmness and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity
of Soul that may be.</item>
                        <item>2. We know not how soon we may be called off
the Stage. <hi>For Man knowes not his time,</hi> Eccles. 9.
12. <hi>I am old,</hi> saith <hi>Isaac, and know not the day of my
death.</hi> And as he said when he was old, so may
every one say that is youngest, Though I am
younger, or middle-aged, yet I know not the day
of my death. The reason is, because it is Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
reservation; <hi>My times,</hi> saith <hi>David, are in thy
hand.</hi> Then,</item>
                        <item>3. Our Natures are brittle, exceeding brittle,
the Word of God tells us we are <hi>shadows, vapours</hi>
and <hi>flowers,</hi> that wither of a sudden. Then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the variety of accidents we are subject to,
<hi>Ioseph</hi> had his Tomb in his Garden, to mind him,
that Death might possibly meet him in that place
of Pleasure. A Tile from the house, a Worm, a
Hair, a little Spittle hath been as fatal to some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as if so be a Mountain had fallen on their
heads. Therefore considering these things, it is
but reason we set our selves to work, to labour in
the time of health, in the time of life.</item>
                        <item>4. If <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> be the Priviledg of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
man at his death, It shews us, That the death
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106452:9"/>
of Righteous men they are not to be lamented by
us upon their own account. They may seem to
call to us from Heaven, as Christ Jesus once did
to the Women of <hi>Iudea</hi> upon the Cross, <hi>Ye Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Ierusalem, weep not for me, but weep for your
selves.</hi> They are not to be lamented upon their
own accounts. They are gone to <hi>Salem,</hi> the City
of Peace, and why should we mourn for them as
they without hope: Death is no Enemy of theirs,
but as <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove returned with an Olive branch,
the Emblem of Peace, so Death brings a good
man (not an Olive branch) but the reality it self,
which is far more desireable. As the Ark carried
the whole Church of God to the Mountain <hi>Ararat,</hi>
(the name of which signifieth, <hi>Take away fear</hi>) so
Death shall waft us to Heaven, there where no
fear is. It is true, in respect of our selves we ought
to follow them with tears, and to have our hearts
deeply affected with their removal from us; and
God himself doth blame the stupidity of our
hearts, and insensibleness of this People, and such
men that can part with such Jewels as these with
indifferency, without Concern, in the Verse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Text, <hi>The righteous man perisheth, and no man
layeth it to heart.</hi> This is the great fault. As if he
had said,</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106452:10"/>For as to us they are dear losses. For,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>We loose the benefit of their Example for our
Guide.</hi> When a good man is gone, one of the
Lights of <hi>Israel</hi> is Quenched. As <hi>David</hi>'s Soldiers
reckoned of him, <hi>Thou shalt go no more with us to
Battel, lest thou quench the Light of Israel.</hi> Of these
the Apostle saith, <hi>Amongst whom you shine as lights in
the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>We loose the benefit of their good Works for our
Comfort.</hi> A good man is a useful man where he
liveth. The Poor have the benefit of his Alms,
and all that converse with him have the benefit
of his Counsel. For he of all others will not suffer
Sin to rest upon the Soul of his Brother (if he know
it): so that we loose the benefit of their good
works for our Comfort.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>And we loose the benefit of their presence too for
our Safety,</hi> which is not a thing inconsiderable
neither. When <hi>Elijab</hi> was ascended into Heaven
in a Chariot of fire, the Prophet below cryed,
<hi>My Father the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof;</hi>
As much as to say, His Presence was as great a
Security as an Army of Chariots and Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>These are they that stand in the breach when
the Judgments of God like a mighty Torrent are
ready to rush upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106452:10"/>These are they that like so many <hi>Aarons</hi> hasten
with their Incense, when any Plague is begun
with a People; And that stand betwixt the living
and the dead.</p>
            <p>I have read of <hi>Philo Iudeus,</hi> and <hi>St. Ambrose,</hi>
that coming to any Place and Town, if they heard
of the death of any able Minister or godly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
they would burst out into tears, as consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that place to have lost a considerable part of
its defence.</p>
            <p>You know <hi>Sodom</hi> could not burn as long as <hi>Lot</hi>
was in it; nor <hi>Hippo</hi> be taken as long as St. <hi>Austin</hi>
was in it: But still they were a defence to the
place where they were.</p>
            <p>In all these respects we have a considerable
Loss in the death of this great and good man,
whose Funeral we now Celebrate; Of whom
I will say this in short:</p>
            <p>He was a Person of such Real Worth, as is as
hard almost to express as imitate. Most of you
knew him well, but perhaps few of you better
than my self.</p>
            <p>And in Reverence to his Memory, To provoke
my self and you to an imitation of his Exemplary
Vertue and Grace, I shall give you this short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106452:11"/>He was a man of uncessant Labours, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
pains; as God had lent him a strong and
able body for many years, So he spared it not at
all, but made it serve him in that insatiable thirst
and desire he had after Humane and Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.
And this Diligence of his was Crowned
with an answerable Blessing from above, being
arrived in point of Ability as another <hi>Saul</hi> higher
than his Brethren by the head and shoulders;
Especially in Political and Polemical Divinity.</p>
            <p>He was like <hi>Nehemiah</hi> upon the Wall, a Sword
to defend, as well as a Trowel to build up. So
to this Eminency of Parts he adjoyned an equal
Humility, which set a lustre upon the former;
upon all occasions he would own what the Hand
of Providence had raised him up unto.</p>
            <p>This Humility made him even as a weaned
Child; a high valuer and applauder of the least
good that was in others, when he would own
little that was worthy commendation in himself.
This Humility made him mindless of the place
where he sate, and made him willingly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the meanest, when they stood in need of
his help.</p>
            <p>And his Charity was such, he denyed that help
to none that sought it; a liberal hand he had, and
yet a more liberal heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:106452:11"/>The Tenth part of his Estate for many years he
gave to the Poor; and had himself had more,
they had not wanted their share.</p>
            <p>He was the Censurer, the Condemner of no
man. If he saw a naked place, there was no man
more ready with the Skirt of his Garment to cast
upon it.</p>
            <p>He was a Censurer of no man for doing what
he could not do; but wherein he differed in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials;
in this his difference, it was his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and custome still to bewail his own want of
light.</p>
            <p>He was very circumspect and careful in the
course of his life to manage it like a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
Therefore he was constant in Christian
Duties; For which he usually had his stated times,
and then he would admit (by his good will) of no
interruption. His discourse was a kind of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Preaching; neither was he less careful of his
Thoughts than Words. His manner was every
day to run over a Catechisme in Greek, Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s
Poems, or some other of the Liberal Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And the reason I remember why he did this,
was to keep his Thoughts from roving and strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to worse matters.</p>
            <p>His Patience was remarkable during the time
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106452:12"/>
of his Affliction, no repining, no murmuring
words under his bodily pain, or the restraint he
was under.</p>
            <p>He observed a particular hand of God in his
Distemper, which (as he said) mocked the Skill of
the Physitian, and he chearfully submitted to it,
desiring Patience might have its perfect work.</p>
            <p>He was of a grateful spirit for the least office
of Love or Kindness shewed to him, whether in
Health or Sickness; So that few that came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
him, parted from him without a thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of his Love to them, and Prayers
that God would reward them with Blessings upon
their Bodies and Souls; and not only so, but the
greatest and worst of his Enemies had a share in
his Prayers.</p>
            <p>As he was thus Eminent for Grace, so as the
Crown of all he wanted not his share of Peace.
His Conscience was Quiet, and his Evidences for
a better Life undisturbed. He had that Hope
which was as an Anchor of the Soul, <hi>Sure and stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,
and enters within the vail.</hi> And he doubted not
but as he was in a state of Grace, so he was within
a step of Glory. And that when Death had done
his work, he should yet for all that live for
ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106452:12"/>He said of Death, That as to him the Sting of
it was taken away. And truly as it seems so were
the Terrors of it too. For Death came to him not
as an armed man, with Convulsions, and bitter
pangs, as upon many; but he parted from this
World without a Sigh or Groan, And as one that
was falling into a long but sweet sleep.</p>
            <p>This was the Comfortable End of this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Person; According to that of the Psalmist,
<hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the
end of that man is Peace.</hi> Peace in death, yea and Peace
after death too, for so saith my Text,</p>
            <p>He shall enter into Peace, they shall rest in their beds,
each one walking in his Uprightness.</p>
