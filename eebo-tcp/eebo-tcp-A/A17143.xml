            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This they haue doone, not of a holie zeale, and godlie deſire to haue the holie Scripture knowne and read of all people: but rather to keepe them, especiallie their adherents &amp; fauorers from reading it tranſlated &amp; ſet foorth by vs. In this their worke ſo long deferred, and now publiſhed, they haue committed two foule faults: The one in falſelie and fooliſhlie tranſlating it, by following the corrupt ſtreame of the Latin tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and forſaking the fountaine of the Greeke, wherein the holy ſpirit of God did indite the new Teſtament, and the bleſſed Apoſtles of Chriſt our Sauior did write it. The other in corrupting &amp; peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſenſe, and meaning of the holy Ghoſt by guilefull gloſes, and abſurd Annotations. Againſt the former of theſe faults I did, either almost, or altogether fiue yeers past, write the first part of this little diſcourſe vpon this occaſion: The right honorable and my verie good Lord, the L. Saint Iohns of Blet ſo ſhortlie after the comming foorth of the ſaid Testament, did let me haue for the ſpace of a month the
<pb facs="tcp:7228:4"/>
vſe of it. The which I did verie egarly read, and diligentlie confer. And for that the booke was hard to come by, I did write much out of it, concerning the diuerſitie, ſuperfluitie, and want of the ſaid tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in respect of the Greeke: and alſo their <hi>10.</hi> friuolous reaſons in their preface, which moued them to leaue the Greeke, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Latine, with diuers other things. Vnto the which <hi>10.</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I did then vpon a particular occaſion, &amp; for a priuat vſe write this anſwere, neuer intending (as both ſome men do know, and the long ſuppreſſing of it may ſhew) to publiſh the ſame in print. And the rather for that a full anſwere vnto the whole hath beene long looked for of manie, and wiſhed for of me. The which I would right gladlie haue ſeene, to the perpetuall ſuppreſſing of this as I firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. But when no ſuch anſwere came foorth, neither could I learne when anie would: hauing of late a little recogniſed my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that had lien long neglected by me, and added thereunto a diſcouerie of ſundrie corruptions committed in the ſaid tranſlation, I haue beene mooued by ſome that haue ſeene it, to let it paſſe in print. The which although I was a long time vnwilling to doo: yet for that it is thought the ſaid tranſlation and Annotations haue ſeduced ſome, and confirmed others in error, and manie doo not a little glory of them, I haue yeelded to the putting foorth of this little treatiſe: that as ſome haue alreadie in part diſcouered the abſurditie of the Annotations:<note place="margin">D.

               <p>NOw to giue thee alſo intelligence in particular, moſt gentle Reader, of ſuch things as it behoueth thee ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to know concerning our tranſlation: we tranſlate the old vulgar Latin text, nor the common Greeke text, for theſe cauſes. <hi>It is ſo ancient,</hi> that it was vſed in the Church of God aboue 1300. yeeres ago, as appeereth by the fathers of thoſe times.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is an vncertaine aſſertion, and a fooliſh reaſon. For although I grant the ſaid tranſlation to be ancient, yet to be ſo old as they affirme, I ſuppoſe it wil be hard for al the Rhemiſh rout of Ieſuits plainly to prooue. <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who liued ſomwhat aboue 200. yeeres after Chriſt, doth not follow it, neither hath any ſteps of it in the places which he alledgeth. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who liued about the yéere of Chriſt 284. doth not at all vſe it. <hi>Hilarius, Hierom,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in their allegations of the Scriptures diſſent from it. But to omit to ſpeake any more of the antiquitie of it: what a fooliſh reaſon is this; It is 1300. yéeres old, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true and vncorrupt. The Gréeke tranſlations of the Septuaginta interpretors, of <hi>Symmachus, Aquila,</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odotion</hi> were ancient, yet euen in S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> time wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not many and great corruptions.

grace) out of S. <hi>Hierom</hi> declare. Or what a fond reaſon is this: It is 1300. yéeres old, therefore to be preferred before the Gréeke, which being the originall is aboue 1500. yéeres old. So that if this matter be to be meaſured by antiquitie, the Gréeke were to be preferred, and this Latin tranſlation not to be followed.</p>

By the which it may plainly appéere, both that this vulgar Latin tranſlation was not <hi>Hieroms,</hi> for that he doth ſo much miſlike it, and find fault with it: and alſo what iarre in iudgement there is in this matter betweene our Engliſh Rhemiſh Ieſuits, who héere iudge it to be S. <hi>Hieroms,</hi> and this Spaniſh Ieſuit that doth denie it.

Whereunto I will adde further a ſaying or two of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who writeth thus:<note place="margin">Eraſmus in Scholijs in Hieronimum ad Algaſiam.</note> 
                     <hi>Multò rectius haec vertit Hieronimus, quàm habet vulgata aeditio.</hi> That is, <hi>Hierom</hi> doth much better tranſlate this, than our vulgar edition hath it, meaning that in 2.

Againe, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> writeth thus of <hi>Hierom</hi>:<note place="margin">Eraſmus in Scholijs in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. Hieron. ad Pamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium.</note> 
                     <hi>Apertè damnat ſuperiorem tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem qua nos tamen maxima ex parte vtimur.</hi> That is, He plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemneth the former tranſlation, which we yet for the moſt part vſe: meaning this old common tranſlation, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7228:8"/>
which he ſaith <hi>Hierom</hi> doth condemne.</p>
                  <p>But if I ſhould grant our Ieſuits that this were either tranſlated or corrected by <hi>Hierom,</hi> which they will neuer be able to prooue, and by that which I haue ſaid, is apparantly falſe, what haue they then gained? Doth it therefore follow bicauſe it was either truly tranſlated, or faithfully corrected by S. <hi>Hierom</hi> then, therefore it is true, ſincere, and void of corruption now?

That is, If we muſt beléeue the Latin examples, let them tell vs which? for there be as many diuers copies as bookes. But if they thinke that the truth is to be ſought out of the greater part, why do we not returne to the Gréeke ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and correct theſe things which either vnſkilfull tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators haue ill tranſlated, or of ignorant preſumptuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue béene fooliſhly amended, or of negligent writers haue béene either added or altered?
By theſe and many ſuch other places it doth appéere, how corrupt the Latin bookes of the new Teſtament were in thoſe daies, which faults yet were moſt ſpecially to be attributed to negligent writers. And if in thoſe learned times of the primitiue Church, in which ſo many learned and godly fathers liued, ſuch mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold groſſe and great corruptions crept into the Latin bookes of the Bible, what may we thinke of theſe latter times, in which all good learning was loſt; and blindnes, ignorance, and barbarouſnes haue raigned? Is it to be maruelled, though infinite great corruptions haue come into the Latin copies of the Teſtament? ſpecially ſéeing the ſame were much written and copied out by blinde ignorant Moonks, who all in a maner were ſo vnlearned, that it became a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, <hi>Monacho indoctior,</hi> that is, More vnlearned than a Moonke. By whoſe meanes ſuch good authors as were moſt occupied and written out, were moſt corrupt, as <hi>Ludouicus Viues</hi> doth iuſtly complaine in theſe words:<note place="margin">Ludouicus Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues de cauſ. corrupt. arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. fol. <hi>13.</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7228:9"/>
Héereby alſo it appéereth, that if this vulgar tranſlation had béene of S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> either tranſlation or correction, it doth not follow, that it is now ſound and ſincere. But foraſmuch as there be many faults and corruptions in it (as by Gods grace héereafter ſhall be ſhewed) we ought (according to the iudgement of S. <hi>Hierom</hi>) returne to the originall of the Gréeke, and thereby correct them. The which our Rhemiſh and Romiſh Ieſuits refuſing to do, in forſaking the water of the moſt pure fountaine of the original Gréeke: we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they drinke (to vſe S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> words) the mirie pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of the Latin.<note place="margin">Ad Marcellum.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, whereas our Ieſuits would make their ſimple readers beléeue, that <hi>Damaſus</hi> had ſuch ſupreme power as is now by the Biſhop of Rome claimed, by calling him Pope, and by ſhewing that S. <hi>Hierom</hi> by his appointment did correct the Latin copies: I thinke it not vnfit nor imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to ſet downe the opinion of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in this matter, who as he was excellently learned, ſo is he not to be counted as partiall.<note place="margin">Eraſmus in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. amico ex animo dilecto.</note>
He in the Epiſtle before alledged, ſpeaking of this matter hath theſe words: <hi>Quanquam hoc negotij non iniungit Damaſus tanquam ſummus orbis Pontifex, quod an fuerit in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio relinquo: certè nomen hoc nondum illis temporibus erat audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, quantum ex veterum omnium ſcriptis licet colligere, ſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iungit tanquam Romanus Pontifex Hieronimo hactenus Romano, quòd illic &amp; baptizatus ſit, &amp; preſbyteri conſecutus honorem.</hi> That is, Although <hi>Damaſus</hi> do not inioine this buſines, as the chéefe Biſhop of the world, the which whether he were or not, I will not define: ſurely this name in thoſe daies was not as yet heard of, as far as we may gather by the writings of all the ancient fathers: but he doth inioine it as Biſhop of Rome to <hi>Hierom</hi> hitherto a Roman, bicauſe both there he was baptized, and obtained the degrée and dignitie of prieſthood.
And as for the name Pope, in thoſe daies it was a title not peculiar to the Biſhop of Rome (as now they haue made it) but common to euery Biſhop. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth both S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Biſhop of Hippo in Afrike, and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> Biſhop of Salamine in Cyprus Pope.

of this ſecond reaſon, and plainly prooued that there is no probabilitie in this opinion, and that this vulgar Latin tranſlation, which our Rhemiſts haue followed, is not that which S. <hi>Hierom</hi> either tranſlated or corrected. Now let vs examine the third reaſon.</p>

                  <p>THere is ſmall reaſon in this reaſon, why this Latin tranſlation ſhould be preferred and followed before the Gréeke. Firſt, for that the Gréeke fathers haue followed the Gréeke originall, and not this Latin, from the which generally they do diſſent, as ſhall héereafter be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Secondly, the moſt ancient Latin fathers do not follow it, as <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Hilarie,</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> commonly in citations and allegations of places diſſenteth from, yea and findeth fault with it (as hath béene ſhewed:) <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> although they ſéeme more to incline vnto it, yet very oft they leaue it, and differ from it. Therefore the Gréeke fathers generally diſſenting from it, and the moſt ancient Latin fathers hauing no footſteps of it, and the other fathers often going from it: there is (as I ſaid) ſmall reaſon why it ſhould now be counted autentical, &amp; be preferred and folowed before the original of the Gréeke. As for the Church ſeruice, it was in the primitiue Church in that language, which of the people was vnderſtood.

alſo to be thought, but that moſt of thoſe faults and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which be now in the text, were not committed at the firſt by the tranſlator, but haue crept in ſince, either (as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith) by negligent writers, and copiers out of the bookes: or by preſumptuous and ignorant correctors, &amp;c. which are not to be imputed vnto him.

And Beza (in the place aboue mentioned) noteth the itching ambition of his fellowe tranſlators, that had much rather diſagree and diſſent from the beſt, than ſeeme themſelues to haue ſaid or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten nothing. And Bezas tranſlation it ſelfe being ſo eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in our countrie, that the Geneua Engliſh Teſtaments be tranſlated according to the ſame, yet ſometime goeth ſo wide from the Greeke, and from the meaning of the holie Ghoſt, that themſelues, which proteſt to tranſlate it, dare not follow it. For example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Luc. 3. v. 36. they haue put theſe words: The ſonne of Cainan, which he wittingly and wilfully left out.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7228:16"/>
as you imagine, and make <hi>Luther</hi> to affirme. Why? may not vnitie of faith ſtand with diuerſitie of tranſlations? There were in the primitiue Church fower ſeuerall Gréeke tranſlations of the old Teſtament. The firſt of the ſeuentie interpretors, ſecond of <hi>Simmachus,</hi> third of <hi>Aquila,</hi> fourth of <hi>Theodotion</hi>: and yet there was vnitie of faith in the true Church: or whatſoeuer diuerſitie of doctrine there was, I thinke you cannot prooue, that it came of the diuerſitie of tranſlations. There were in the Latin Church very many diuers tranſlations, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in theſe words ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:<note place="margin">August. lib. <hi>2.</hi> de doctr. Christ. cap. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Qui enim Scripturas ex Hebraea lingua in Graecam verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint numerari poſſunt: Latini autem interpretes nullo modo.</hi> That is, For they that haue tranſlated the Scriptures out of the Hebrew toong into the Gréeke may be numbred: but the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin tranſlators cannot. Héere you ſée that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, the Latin tranſlators of the Scriptures to haue béene ſo many, that they could not be numbred: yet he was ſo far from our Rhemiſts opinion, that they bred diuerſitie of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,<note place="margin">August. de doctr. Chriſt. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>12</hi>
                     </note> that he thought the ſame profitable, eſpecially for them which wanted the knowledge of the originall toongs: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that which is obſcure in one, may be made manifeſt by another. And if there may be diuerſitie of expoſitions of one place of Scripture without breach of vnitie of doctrine, why may not ſome diuerſitie of tranſlations ſtand with vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of faith and doctrine? Héerof S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth thus: <hi>Quos neceſſe est etiamſi rectae atque vnius fidei fuerint,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">August. epist. ad Hieron.</note>

                     </note> bicauſe that the hardnes thereof requireth the ſame. So ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom: <hi>Talis enim Scripturae mos est, vt in pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis verbis plurima ſaepè multitudo ſenſuum inueniatur.</hi>
                     </hi> That is, Such is the maner of the Scripture, that in few words a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7228:16"/>
very great multitude of ſenſes or expoſitions may be found.
And therefore as there may be diuers expoſitions of places of the Scriptures, which may all agrée with the analogie and proportion of faith: euen ſo may there be in tranſlations diuerſitie in words and phraſes, without diſſention in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or breach of faith. I write not this, that I allow the itching ambition of ſome (of whom Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> doth iuſtly complaine) who without ſufficient knowledge in the toongs, and ſound iudgement, take ouer raſhly vpon them to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that bleſſed booke of the holy Scriptures, which ought not to be handled with vnwaſhen hands, but with all reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and fidelitie in the feare of God ought to be dealt in. Neither do I thinke but that it were very expedient and profitable for the Church of Chriſt, that in euery toong there were one as exact and abſolute tranſlation, as might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed vpon, which ſhould either onely or principally be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. The which if it cannot be procured, I ſay that vnitie of faith may as well agrée with diuerſitie of tranſlations: as there might and would be diuerſitie of doctrine through the malice of Satan, and weaknes of mans iudgement, though there were but one onely tranſlation. And therfore I thinke you rather ſucke that out of your owne fingers, than find it in <hi>Luthers</hi> works, in ſuch ſenſe and ſort as you expreſſe it. And thereupon haue noted no place in his writings where it is to be found, but onely refer vs to a place of <hi>Coclaeus,</hi> who being a profeſſed and malitious enimie to Maſter <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> of what weight and force his report is to be accounted, let the indifferent Reader iudge. But whereas you charge Maſter <hi>Bezas</hi> tranſlation ſo much eſtéemed of vs, to go ſo wide from the Gréeke, and meaning of the holy Ghoſt, that we dare not (as you ſay) follow it: I anſwer, that as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the man for his great gifts of learning, and woorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtéeme his godly and learned labors, in tranſlating faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Teſtament of Ieſus Chriſt: ſo neither he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, nor we iudge our ſelues to be bound in all things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without exception to follow him. He is a man and may erre, and as we thankfully to Gods glorie acknowledge that he hath euen hit the marke in many: ſo we doubt not, but he might miſſe it in ſome, and peraduenture ſo hath
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7228:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
done, not in ſubſtance of doctrine, but in ſome proprietie of words and phraſes. Howbeit whereas you ſo maliciouſly and falſely accuſe him to haue gone ſo far from the Gréeke, and meaning of the holy Ghoſt, let vs ſée your proofes. You alledge héere but two places: the one <hi>Luc.</hi> 3. v. 36. the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out of the name <hi>Cainan,</hi> which we haue put in. This is a great matter whereat you make ſuch a tragicall exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in your marginall note vpon that place, which is but the leauing out of one name, whereas both in the old Latin, and your owne new Engliſh, there are left out not onely words, but alſo ſentences in at leaſt an hundred places. Thus you can ſtraine a gnat, and ſwallow a camell: ſée a mote in your brothers eie, and not behold a great beame in your owne. Touching the matter it ſelfe, which concerneth neither faith nor doctrine: Maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Beza</hi> hath not without great and good cauſe omitted the ſaid name of <hi>Cainan</hi>: partly bicauſe it is not in the Hebrew, Geneſ. 11. nor in the booke of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 11.12. 1. Chron. 1.18.</note> where the ſame Genealogie is ſet out: and partly for that it is not expreſſed, but omitted in one moſt ancient Gréeke and Latin copie, that of late yéeres came to his hands, which he hath ſent to the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Cambridge</hi> there to be kept, and is there reſerued. Whereupon Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> vpon good warrant hath omitted that name. And if we had had intelligence of that ancient Gréeke and Latin copie, we would not haue doubted to haue followed him. But whether it be expreſſed or omitted, it is a matter of no great moment, and concerneth no point of doctrine. <hi>Beda</hi> hauing ſhewed, that in the veritie of the Hebrew, the name of <hi>Cainan</hi> is in both thoſe places of the old Teſtament left out, and that S. <hi>Luke</hi> alledged it (as he thought) out of the Septuaginta in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretors,<note place="margin">Beda in Luc. <hi>3.</hi>

But you will ſay,<note place="margin">Act. 1.14.</note> the ſenſe of this place requireth to be tranſlated Women, and not wiues: and the ſenſe of the other, Act. <hi>21.5.</hi> Wiues, and not women. Then it followeth by your owne confeſſion, that Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> hath not gone wide from the ſignification of the word, howſoeuer he haue gone from the ſenſe of the place, and meaning of the matter. But if you examine that with an indifferent eie, there may as good reaſon be yéelded for the tranſlating of it Wiues, as Women: as appéereth by the reaſons which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> do bring. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his Annotations ſaith, it may be either way tranſlated, his words be theſe: <hi>Accipi potest &amp; cum vxoribus, propterea quòd ſeparauit Mariam à mulieribus.</hi> That is, It may be taken,<note place="margin">Eraſmus in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notat.</note> and with their wiues, bicauſe he did ſeparate <hi>Marie</hi> from the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

                  <p>THe tenth and laſt reaſon that hath mooued our Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Runnagates to tranſlate rather out of the olde Latin than the Gréeke, is a very ſtrange paradoxe, that the vulgar Latin tranſlation, is not onely better than al other tranſlations, but than the Gréeke it ſelfe when they differ. This I count and call a ſtrange paradoxe, bicauſe it is contrarie not onely to the generall iudgement of the ancient fathers and learned writers (as héerafter ſhall appéere:) but alſo to the common courſe of all learning. For whereas in all other authors and writings, the originall languages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the authors did firſt write themſelues, are preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all tranſlations, as in <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Xenophon, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes, Homer, Galen, Euclyde, &amp;c.</hi> and al tranſlations are examined and reformed by the ſaid originals: now by our Ieſuits new Diuinitie, onely the Teſtament of Ieſus Chriſt, written in Gréeke by his bleſſed Apoſtles, through the inſpiration of Gods holie ſpirit, muſt come behind the Latin tranſlation, tranſlated we know not when, nor by whom.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7228:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Latin muſt not now be examined by the Gréeke (as S. <hi>Hierom, Eraſmus,</hi> and other learned men haue labored to do) but the Gréeke by the Latin: for it is, they ſay, the better; and it is méete that the woorſe be reformed by the better. Now bicauſe héere is the principall controuerſie in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and héereupon depend all the diuerſities that be in the Engliſh tranſlation of the Ieſuits fetched from the Latin, and ours deriued from the Gréeke: (for if the Gréeke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they cannot denie but the Apoſtles did write, be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be preferred before that old Latin, then ours is true, and theirs falſe: if otherwiſe the Latin be more ſound and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere than the Gréeke, then is theirs true, and ours falſe) let vs therefore ſomewhat more exactly examine this matter, and weigh our Rhemiſts reaſons which mooue them to broach abrode this new doctrine and ſtrange opinion. And although that which I haue ſaid, may to any reaſonable man ſéeme ſufficient, that it is contrarie to all reaſon and all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: yet bicauſe our Ieſuits would ſéeme greatly to depend vpon the Doctors, and to carrie all their annotations, and guilefull gloſes in this Teſtament, vnder the viſor of ſome father, let vs ſée what the Latin godly and ancient fathers ſay in this matter. For to them in this point I muſt ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeale, and not to the Gréeke fathers, who followed the fountaine of the Gréeke, and medled not with tranſlations, as ſtreames flowing from it. And after I will come to other learned men, and euen ſuch as miſliked not the Romiſh religion. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> who was not onely excellently learned in the thrée learned languages, but alſo greatly occupied in tranſlating the whole Bible out of the Hebrew and Gréeke (as before appéereth) writeth thus:<note place="margin">Hieronimus aduerſus Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidium.</note> 
                     <hi>Non neceſſe eſt nunc de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarium varietate tractare, cùm omne &amp; veteris &amp; nouae Scripturae instrumentum in Latinum ſermonem exinde tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſit, &amp; multò purior manare credenda ſit fontis vnda quàm riui.</hi> That is, I néed not now to intreat of the varietie of the copies or examples (meaning the Latin) ſéeing that the whole inſtrument of the old and new Scripture was from thence tranſlated into the Latin toong, and the water of the fountaine is thought to flow more pure than that of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or ſtreame. In theſe words S. <hi>Hierom</hi> doth not onely
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7228:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
affirme the Latin to be tranſlated dut of the Gréeke, but alſo the Gréeke to be more pure than the Latin, as the water of the fountaine is more cleane and ſwéete than that in the ſtreame or riuer,<note place="margin">Hieronimus ad Lucinium.</note> according to the old true ſaying: <hi>Dulcius ex ipſo fonte bibuntur aquae.</hi> Againe, the ſame <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith: <hi>Vt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim veterum libroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fides de Hebraeis examinanda est, ita nouoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Graeci ſermonis normam deſiderat.</hi> That is, As the truth of the books of the old Teſtament is to be examined by the Hebrew: ſo the bookes of the new Teſtament require the triall of the Gréeke.<note place="margin">Hieronimus Suniae &amp; Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellae.</note> Againe he writeth thus: <hi>Sicut autem in nouo Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento ſi quando apud Latinos quaestio exoritur, &amp; est inter exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaria varietas, recurrimus ad fontem Graeci ſermonis quo nouum ſcriptum est instrumentum: ita in veteri Testamento, ſi quando inter Graecos Latinóſque diuerſitas est ad Hebraicam recurrimus veritatem: vt quicquid de fonte proficiſcitur, hoc quaeramus in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulis.</hi> That is, As in the new Teſtament if there ariſe any queſtions among the Latins, and there be varietie among the copies, we returne vnto the fountaine of the Gréeke toong in the which the new Teſtament was written: ſo in the old Teſtament if at any time there be diuerſitie among the Greekes and Latins, we returne vnto the Hebrew veritie, that whatſoeuer floweth from the fountaine, we may ſéeke the ſame in the ſtreames.

                  <p>But now let vs more particularly come to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this aſſertion. <hi>The proofe heerof is euident</hi> (ſay our Rhemiſh Ieſuits) <hi>bicauſe moſt of the ancient heretikes were Grecians, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that the diſproofe héerof is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.

And ſo it is come to paſſe, that their copies be more corrupt than the Latins, the which time <hi>Hierom</hi> reſpecteth.
Hitherto the Gloſer: from whom it moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appéereth, that you haue borrowed this reaſon, or rather accuſation of the corruption of the Gréeke copies, which is an author fit for you to follow: who hath in theſe words deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered almoſt as manie groſſe abſurdities and lies, as there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be lines. For firſt he maketh <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in iudgement: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> preferring the Gréeke and Hebrew copies, and <hi>Hierom</hi> the Latin: attributing to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:7228:23"/>
a ſentence which is not his, but <hi>Hieroms <hi>Ad Lucini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>,</hi> as I haue before alledged, whoſe words againe be theſe: <hi>Vt veterum librorum fides, &amp;c.</hi>
As the truth of the bookes of the old Teſtament is to be examined by the Hebrew bookes: ſo the truth of the new requireth the triall of the Gréeke toong.
And ſo this blind Gloſer attributing to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> a ſaying which indéed is <hi>Hieroms,</hi> maketh <hi>Hierom</hi> contrarie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Secondly, in alledging S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> words out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecond prolog of the Bible, and making him there to affirme the Latin copies to be more true than the Gréeke, he doth cleane peruert S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> meaning. For there in that very place he doth affirme the cleane contrarie in theſe words:<note place="margin">Hieronimus in prologo in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuchum.</note>
                     <q>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubi in tranſlatione tibi videor errare, interroga Hebraeos: diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarum vrbium magistros conſule.

It is another matter, if they haue allowed the teſtimonies afterward vſed by the Apoſtles againſt them, &amp; that the Latin examples be more true than the Gréeke, and the Gréeke than the Hebrew.
Héere S. <hi>Hierom</hi> doth infer this as abſurd, that the Latin copies ſhould be more true than the Gréeke, and the Gréeke than the Hebrew, which the blind Gloſer our Ieſuits Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thought he ſimply ment.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, whereas this barbarous blind Gloſer maketh <hi>Auguſtine</hi> preferring the Gréeke and Hebrew copies, and <hi>Hierom</hi> the Latin, he doth very fooliſhly and prepoſterouſly.
For <hi>Hierom</hi> in all his writings, and alſo as appéered by his tranſlations, did moſt earneſtly maintaine the contrarie: whereas <hi>Auguſtine</hi> by reaſon of his ignorance in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, did ouermuch attribute to the Septuaginta interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in Gréeke, and wiſhed that <hi>Hierom</hi> had tranſlated the old Teſtament rather out of them, than out of the Hebrew, as appéereth by his owne words in his Epiſtle to <hi>Hierom</hi> himſelfe,<note place="margin">August.

                     </note> which be theſe: <q>Ego ſanè te mallem Graecas potius ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicas nobis interpretari Scripturas, quae Septuaginta interpretum autoritate perhibentur.</q> That is, I had rather that you did tranſlate vnto vs the Gréeke canonicall Scriptures, which be confirmed by the autoritie of the Seuentie interpretors.
This is that woorthy writer vpon the Popes holie Decrées, who hath taught our Rhemiſh Ieſuits this leſſon, and lent them this reaſon or rather accuſation of the holy Scriptures. A méete author for them to follow.</p>
                  <p>But how falſe this accuſation of the corruption of the Gréeke text is, may euidently appéere partly by the writings of <hi>Chryſoſtom, Baſill, Theophylactus,</hi> and other ancient Gréeke and godly fathers, who generally agrée with the Gréeke text, and diſſent from the Latin when they differ, as héerafter ſhall be ſhewed: and partly by thoſe places of the Latin fathers before alledged. For whereas moſt of the Gréeke heretikes were before the time of <hi>Ambroſe, Hierom</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:7228:24"/>
and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> it doth appéere: yet in their daies the Gréeke bookes were ſound, pure, and vndefiled. Let them therefore ſhew vs in what age, and by what heretikes all the Gréeke bookes in the world were corrupted.</p>
                  <p>And if our Rhemiſh Ieſuits may thinke that the Gréeke text hath béene corrupted by old Gréeke heretikes: why may it not alſo be thought, that the Latin text hath in like maner béene corrupted by Latin heretikes? But they will ſay: There were not ſo many of them as of the other: Beſides that it is not greatly materiall for the multitude, yet what if it may be prooued, that all Papiſts be heretikes, may not they in number be compared with the Gréeke heretikes? I will not enter into this diſcourſe at this preſent, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that it hath béene effectually ſhewed,<note place="margin">In his booke againſt D. Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> and pithily prooued by my good and learned brother Maſter <hi>Whitakers</hi> of late: and alſo was ſo largely and learnedly handled in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> daies, by that reuerend and learned father <hi>D.

                  <p>Moreouer, I ſay that all the Ieſuits in Rhemes and Rome are not able to ſhew one ſuch a fowle corruption in al the Gréeke Teſtament, to the ouerthrowing of any article of faith, as I can ſhew a moſt notable place, concerning euen the very <hi>Deitie</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt corrupted fowly in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, which our Corrupt Rhemiſts in their Engliſh haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. The place is <hi>1. Timoth. 3.16.</hi> And in Gréeke thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is, And without controuerſie great is the myſterie of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. God was made manifeſt in the fleſh, iuſtified in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c. The vulgar Latin is thus: <hi>Et manifestè magnum est pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etatis ſacramentum, Quod manifestatum est in carne, &amp;c.</hi> And is by you engliſhed thus: <hi>And manifeſtly it is a great ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7228:25"/>
of pietie, Which was manifeſted in the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> Héer in ſtead of theſe words: <hi>God was reuealed in the fleſh,</hi> which plainly prooue both the Deitie and Humanitie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, agréeably to that other place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians:<note place="margin">Coloſs. 2.9.</note> 
                     <hi>In him dwelleth all the fulnes of the Godhead bodily,</hi> they haue put theſe words: <hi>Which was manifeſted in the fleſh:</hi> and ſo ſéeke to depriue vs of this moſt excellent teſtimonie, which maketh ſtrongly againſt the Arrians and other heretikes, and corrupted the place which briefly, yet very pithily comprehendeth the doctrine of our redemption. The which corruption is not onely contrarie to all Gréeke copies, and the ancient Syrian tranſlation: but alſo to <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> to <hi>Theophylactus,</hi> to <hi>Theodoretus dialog.</hi> 1. and to the Gréeke ſcholies which ſo alledge it, and expound it. Such a place ſo like to be corrupted by heretikes, I dare ſay that all our Rhemiſh rout is not able to ſhew in al the Gréeke text.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I omit to ſhew what a wide window theſe popiſh Rhemiſts do open to all heretikes, by this their abſurd aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and accuſation of the Gréeke originall text of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who if they be preſſed with any plaine place to the confounding of their hereſie, why may they not, as <hi>Heluidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and the Manichées of old time did, and our Iebuſites do now, ſay the ſame were corrupted by ancient heretikes. But wo be to them that cannot maintaine their doctrine but by ſuch ſhameleſſe ſhifts.
But for the further manifeſtation of this matter, and that the Chriſtian reader may ſée what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there is betwéene theſe Catholike fathers, I will ſet downe a place or two out of <hi>Iohn Driedon</hi> a Louanian,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> who writeth thus: <q>Eiſdem argumentis vtentes, poſſumus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrare Graecos noui Testamenti codices non eſſe de industria vniuerſaliter falſatos, &amp;c.</q> That is, Vſing the ſame arguments we may prooue, that the Gréeke bookes of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haue not béen of purpoſe vniuerſally falſified, as though any truth had béene raſed togither out of all the holy Gréeke bookes, being diſperſed ſo far abroad, and kept in the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not onely of the Grecians, but alſo of the Latins. Again the ſame <hi>Driedon</hi> of Louaine writeth thus: <hi>Quantum verò ad Nouum attinet Testamentum, veriſimile est, ſi Graeci ſuos codi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces noui Testamenti voluiſſent deprauare, &amp;c.</hi> That is, But as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7228:25"/>
touching the new Teſtament, it is likely that if the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would haue corrupted their bookes of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would chéefly haue done it in thoſe places, in which matters be handled, wherein they haue long agone begun to diſſent from the Latin Church: but we ſée and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſuch places to agrée with the moſt ancient Latin copies: Therefore neither any other place ought to be ſuſpected as corrupted by the common ſchoole of the Grecians. Laſtly, the ſame <hi>Driedon</hi> writeth héerof thus: <hi>Nam Scriptura ſacra ſi ſit iam olim in ſuo fonte ſuá<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        </expan> origine corrupta &amp; deprauata, iam non erit vlla in illis canonica autoritas, &amp;c.</hi> That is, Now if the holy Scripture haue béene long ago corrupted and depraued in hir fountaine and originall language, then there will be no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall authoritie in it, neither ſhall it be néedfull for Latin men to returne to the fountaine of the Gréeke toong, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the new Teſtament was written: or of the Hebrew, wherein the old Teſtament was ſet foorth. Hitherto <hi>Drie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
Whereby we may ſée, to what impudencie our Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts be growen, who by this impudent aſſertion, take all canonicall autoritie from the holy Scriptures. I might ſhew what vnfaithfull kéepers of Gods holy records they haue béene: who haue héertofore bragged, that they haue kept the holie Scriptures, and whence haue we had them, but from them? And yet now of their owne accord, they confeſſe that they haue ſuffered the originall and autenticall copies of Chriſts Teſtament to be corrupted. But omitting theſe things, which might be more amplified, I come to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proofe of this their ſtrange paradoxe, concerning the corruption of the Gréeke text.</p>

                  <p>HEre as touching <hi>Tertullian,</hi> vpon whom doth depend the ſpeciall proofe of this pretended corruption, to ſpeake in plaine words, you make one notorious lie. For <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth not ſay, that the truth of that text is as in the vulgar Latin tranſlation, neither he in his booke <hi>De reſurrectione,</hi> doth ſo alledge it, as héereafter I will ſhew. Indéed I grant that <hi>Marcion</hi> did mangle that place, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly cite it, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in theſe words ſheweth:<note place="margin">Tertull. aduerſus Marcionem, lib. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Primus inquit homo de humo terrenus: ſecundus Dominus de coelo.</hi> That is, The firſt man is of earth earthly: the ſecond is the Lord from heauen. Héere <hi>Marcion</hi> denying the true manhood of Chriſt, did leaue out this word <hi>Homo,</hi> that is, Man, and ſo did mangle that place, the which is not omitted, but expreſſed in all Gréeke copies. And therefore the Gréeke doth not agrée with <hi>Marcions</hi> corruption, as <hi>Gregorie Martin</hi> and his fellowes corruptly iudge.
I grant alſo that it ſéemeth <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> thought, that <hi>Marcion</hi> in the latter part did alledge this word <hi>Dominus,</hi> that is, <hi>Lord,</hi> which ought not: for his words after the text before alledged be theſe: <q>Quare ſecundus ſi non homo quod &amp; primus? aut nunquid primus Dominus ſi &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus.</q> That is, Why is he called the ſecond, if he be not man as the firſt? Or is not the firſt Lord, if the ſecond be? Héer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, I ſay, it ſéemeth, that <hi>Marcions</hi> corruption of this place, was partly in leauing out this word <hi>Homo,</hi> which is expreſſed in the Gréeke, and partly (as it ſéemeth <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſuppoſed) by putting in this word <hi>Dominus,</hi> which our Gréek copies alſo haue.
Now whether he did corruptly alledge this word <hi>Dominus,</hi> Lord, that is the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I ſée no cauſe why this is to be accounted a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Marcions,</hi> for that it doth no more maintaine his blaſphemous hereſie, in denying the true Humanitie of Chriſt, than doth the Latin. For how doth this, <hi>The ſecond man is the Lord from heauen,</hi> ſéeme more to fauor <hi>Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> falſe doctrine, than the other: <hi>The ſecond man is from heauen heauenly?</hi> Why might not <hi>Marcion</hi> haue abuſed this, to prooue Chriſt to haue brought his bodie from heauen,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7228:26"/>
and not to haue taken fleſh of the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> as well as the other? And therefore if this had béene a corruption of <hi>Marcions,</hi> he would no doubt haue otherwiſe corrupted it to the further furthering of his hereſie. Secondly, I ſay that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Gréeke text doth not onelie as well agrée with all true doctrine as the Latin: but alſo is more pregnant in ſenſe, and more agréeable to the meaning of the Apoſtle in that place, containing a more excellent <gap reason="foreign">

Thirdly, whereas <hi>Marcion</hi> did cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the 45. verſe going before (as moſt plainly appéereth by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the ſame place) and yet the ſame corruption is not in the Gréeke, but it is pure and ſincere as it ought to be, it is not likely that this corruption ſhould any more remaine than that. Fourthly, not onely all Gréeke copies, both old <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and new ſo haue it, expreſſing the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, Lord: but alſo the Syrian and Arabian tranſlations which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient, do agrée with the Gréeke. And how likely it is for ſuch a corruption of <hi>Marcions</hi> to be in all Gréeke copies, and in thoſe very ancient Syrian and Arabian tranſlations, I leaue it to the iudgement of all men to conſider. And where you ſay that other ancient fathers haue read according to the vulgar Latin: I grant that ſome Latin fathers following the old tranſlation ſo do: but <hi>Chryſoſtom, Theophylactus,</hi> the Gréeke Scholies, <hi>Damaſcenus <hi>De orthodoxa fide, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</hi> (who I trow were none of <hi>Marcions</hi> diſciples) agrée with the Gréeke: And <hi>Tertullian</hi> your author alledgeth it thus: <hi>Primus homo de terra choicus, id est, limaceus, id est, Adam:</hi>

                     </hi> That is, The firſt man of the ſlime of the earth: the ſecond man from heauen. So that theſe thrée Latin fathers, as they differ from the Gréeke in leauing out the word <hi>Dominus,</hi> Lord: ſo do they alſo diſſent from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, in leauing out the word <hi>Coelestis,</hi> Heauenly: And yet whether either of theſe words, or both of them be expreſſed or omitted, it is not repugnant to any article of faith, nor to the ſenſe of the Apoſtle. And therefore might <hi>Eraſmus</hi> be of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7228:27"/>
that opinion, to thinke it ſhould be as in the Latin: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hauing reſpect to the ſound of the oppoſition of words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene of earth earthly: and from heauen heauenly. And M. <hi>Caluin</hi> might ſo alledge it: And yet the Gréeke may be the true reading, wherein the Apoſtle wrote, as no doubt it is. But if I ſhould grant, that this word, Lord, crept in either by <hi>Marcions</hi> means or any others (which is vtterly vnlike, as hath béene ſhewed) yet it muſt néedes be confeſſed to be but a ſmall fault, to expreſſe this word, Lord, and to attribute it to Ieſus Chriſt, to whom it doth ſo properly appertaine: and of ſmall force to diſcredit generally the autenticall text of the Gréeke. Two hundred greater corruptions may be found in the vulgar Latin.</p>

                     </note> being a godly man, and <hi>Hieroms</hi> great friend, went about to ſuppreſſe them.

Héere <hi>Hierom</hi> doth not onely wreſt that place (for S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not there oppoſe, Good, to ſinne and euill, but doth take it for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,<note place="margin">In Annotat.</note> expedient and commodious, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſheweth:) but alſo doth ouer iniuriouſly ſpeake of matrimonie, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is euill to touch a woman, which God hath ordained and ſanctified.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Againe <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith: <q>Si prudentia carnis ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micitia est in Deum, &amp; qui in carne ſunt Deo placere non poſſunt: arbitror eos qui ſeruiunt officio coniugali, quòd prudentiam carnis diligant, &amp; in carne ſint.</q> That is, If the wiſedome of the fleſh

be enimitie againſt God, and that they which be in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God: I thinke that they which do the dutie of marriage, loue the wiſedome of the fleſh, and be in the fleſh.
How iniuriouſly <hi>Hierom</hi> héere ſpeaketh of Marriage, and how he abuſeth theſe places of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. <hi>8.</hi> it is ſo plaine that I néed not to ſhew. S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame place ſaith: <hi>Vos non estis in carne,</hi> You are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit: ſpeaking generally of the faithfull at Rome, of whom no doubt but many were married. Laſtly, to omit many other places hardly handled by <hi>Hierom,</hi> he writeth thus:<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>

                  <p>HEre be two witneſſes brought in to diſprooue the Gréeke text, whom they haue not far fetched: for they be brought vnto their hand, the one by <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and the other by <hi>Beza</hi> in their Annotations. But what if theſe two in ſhew, be in ſubſtance and déede but one. I aſſure thée good Chriſtian Reader, that héere is but one witnes: for the Tripartite ſtorie being by <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi> gathered and compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of <hi>Socrates, Theodoretus,</hi> and <hi>Sozomenus,</hi> it is moſt certaine, that he in the ſaid ſtorie alledged this place out of <hi>Socrates:</hi> for in the other it is not to be found. And therefore of what force this one ſingle witnes of <hi>Socrates</hi> is to condemne the Gréeke text, hath béene before declared. I grant that he writeth as Maſter <hi>Beza,</hi> and our Ieſuits out of him alledge. But let vs examine the ſame: Prouided alwaies that although <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> alledge, as is aforeſaid, the ſaid reading, which is in the Latin, yet neither of them do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame, but prefer that which is in the Gréeke.</p>
                  <p>The words of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> be theſe according to the Gréeke:
<hi>And euerie ſpirit that confeſſeth not Ieſus Chriſt to bee come in the fleſh is not of God.</hi> For the which in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latin is that which our Ieſuits ſet downe: <q>Et omnis ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus qui ſoluit Ieſum ex Deo non est.</q> That is, Euerie ſpirit that diſſolueth Ieſus is not of God.
Let vs now conſider whether of theſe two is more likely to be the true text of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Apoſtle. Firſt I ſay, that the Gréeke Text in this place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth no falſe, but very ſound and comfortable doctrine, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> therefore not very like to be a corruption of an heretike. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Gréeke reading doth much more fitly agrée with the circumſtance of the place, and the vſual phraſe of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that the other.
For in the verſe before, S.<hi>Iohns</hi> words be theſe: <q>Heereby you know the ſpirit of God. Euerie ſpirit that confeſſeth Ieſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh is of God.</q> 
                     <hi>And then immediately he addeth theſe words which be in queſtion:</hi> 
                     <q>And euerie ſpirit that confeſſeth not Ieſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh is not of God.</q>
Where we ſée how this doth aptly anſwer to that which went before. The
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7228:29"/>
which is a vſuall and common phraſe with S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie one thing with comparing of contradictories, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the ſame the more in our minds: as for example a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after in the ſame chapter, verſ. <hi>6.</hi>
                     <q>He that knoweth God heareth vs: He that is not of God heareth vs not. <hi>Againe, verſ.</hi> 7. Whoſoeuer loueth, is borne of God, and knoweth God: He that loueth not, knoweth not God. <hi>Againe, cap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. He that beleeueth in the ſonne of God hath the witnes in him: Hee that beleeueth not the ſonne of God hath made him a liar, &amp;c. <hi>Againe, verſ.</hi> 12. He that hath the ſonne hath life: He that hath not the ſonne of God hath not life, &amp;c.</q>
Euen after the ſame maner S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith in this place:
<q>Euerie ſpirit that confeſſeth Ieſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh is of God: And euerie ſpirit that confeſſeth not Ieſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, is not of God. Thus I doubt not but euerie indifferent reader may plainly perceiue, that this doth more aptly agrée both with the ſentence before, and with S. <hi>Iohns</hi> vſuall phraſe &amp; maner of ſpéech, than that which is in the vulgar Latin:</q>
                     <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie ſpirit that diſſolueth Ieſus is not of God:</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Eraſmus</hi> iudge.

Therfore I doo alwaies exhort you, and will not ceaſe to exhort you, that you would not onelie marke the things which are héere ſpoken, but alſo when you are in your houſes, you would continually giue your ſelues to the reading of the holie ſcriptures. The which thing I ceaſe not to inculcate and beat into them who pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatlie haue companie with me. Neither let anie man ſaie to me (for they be cold and vaine words, and ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither to be contemned) I am troubled with worldlie matters, I haue in hand publike affaires, I exerciſe an Art and occupation, I haue a wife and bring vp children, I haue care of familie, I am a worldlie man, it is not my duetie to read the ſcriptures: but theirs who haue left the world, who dwell in the toppe of the mountaines and lead ſuch a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent life. What ſaieſt thou O man? is it not thy part to read and ſtudy the ſcriptures, becauſe thou art troubled with manie cares? yea it rather belongeth to thée than to them: for they doo not ſo much néed the helpe &amp; defence of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as you doo, who are toſſed as it were in the middeſt of the waues of worldlie affaires. For ſolitarie men being frée from the court and courtlie cauſes, hauing their cottages in the wilderneſſe, and kéeping companie with none, but in that quietneſſe with much ſecuritie doo liue a ſtudious and diuine life, and as it were reſting on the hauen, doo liue verie

ſafelie: But we on the contrarie part toſſed as it were on the middeſt of the ſea, and falling will we nill we, into ſundrie ſinnes, haue alwaies néed of continuall ſolace and comfort of the ſcriptures. They ſit far from the conflict, and therefore receiue not manie wounds: But thou that ſtandeſt alwaies in the front of the battle, and receiueſt manie ſtrokes, haſt more néed of remedie. For as much as thy wife prouoketh thée, thy ſonne gréeueth thée, and mooueth thée to anger, thy enimie laieth wait for thée, thy friend enuieth thée, thy neighbour contendeth with thée, thy fellow ſupplanteth thée, the iudge often threateneth thée, pouertie troubleth thée, the loſſe of ſome of thy familie maketh thée to lament, proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie puffeth thée vp, and aduerſitie beateth and preſſeth thée downe: Bréefelie ſéeing that ſundrie occaſions, yea and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of cares, troubles, ſorrow, vexations, &amp; feare doo on euerie ſide compaſſe thée, and innumerable darts doo on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part flie vpon thée, thou haſt néed continuallie to receiue armor from the holie ſcriptures.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.</note> Know therefore that thou art in the middeſt of ſnares, and walkeſt on the pinacles of the citie: for the concupiſcence, of the fleſh doo more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentlie and ſharpelie inuad them which liue in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all companie of the people: whom both the faire face, and bewtifull bodie by the eies catcheth, &amp; filthie talke with arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall &amp; ſwéet ſongs by the eares mooueth, and manie times ouercommeth. But what doo I ſpeake of theſe things?

Séeing therfore there be ſo manie things that doo aſſault our ſoules, we ſtand the more in néed of thoſe diuine remedies, that we may both heale the wounds recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; repell thoſe that afterward ſhall be inflicted, and by the continual reading of the ſcriptures extinguiſh the fiery darts of the diuell. For it cannot be, I ſaie it cannot be, that anie man can obtaine ſaluation although we be continuallie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this diuine medicine. But if we be dailie wounded, and be deſtitute of remedie, what hope can we haue of life or ſaluation. Dooſt thou not ſée Ironſmithes, Goldſmithes, and Siluerſmithes, and all thoſe that occupie anie handie craft,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7228:48"/>
how they alwaies haue readie &amp; kéepe whole all the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their art, although famine pinch them, and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie afflict them, rather deſiring to ſuſtaine anie aduerſitie, than to ſell anie of the inſtruments of their occupation, and by the monie thereof to be nouriſhed: Yea and many times they will rather take vpon vſurie, than put in pawne and pledge the ſmalleſt of their tooles, and this they doo not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſt cauſe: for they know that if they be ſold, their art is altogither vnprofitable to them, and that the ſubſtance of their profit is loſt: but if they retaine and kéepe them, it may be that by exerciſing continuallie their occupation, at the laſt by progreſſe of time they may diſcharge their debt. But if they doo ſell their inſtruments to other before their debt be diſcharged, there remaineth no meanes to helpe their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and eaſe their pouertie. Euen after the ſame ſort ought we to be minded and affected: for as the hammer, the puntch and the tongs, are inſtruments to them, ſo the books of the Apoſtles and Prophets and all the holie Scripture which commeth by diuine inſpiration, &amp; is verie profitable, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to vs. And as they by thoſe their inſtruments doo worke and finiſh that which they take in hand: euen ſo we alſo by theſe our inſtruments doo forme and frame our ſoule, and when it is depraued, we amend it, and when it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, we correct and renew it. And they herein onelie doo vſe their art to adde a forme to things, for they cannot alter and change the matter and ſubſtance of veſſels, as to make Gold of Siluer, but they doo onlie make the forme and faſhion of things. But thou maiſt not onlie doo that, but more to: for thou maiſt of a wodden at the laſt make a golden veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, as <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, writing in this manner, <hi>2. Tim. 2.</hi> In a great houſe are not onelie veſſels of gold and of ſiluer, but alſo of wood and of earth, ſome for honor, and ſome for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor. If a man purge him from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſell vnto honor, ſanctified and made méete for the Lord, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto all good works. Therefore let vs not neglect to prepare and get vs thoſe diuine bookes, leſt we in things tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our life be wounded. Neither let vs hide and dig gold in the ground for vs, but let vs hide to our ſelues the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of thoſe ſpirituall bookes. Indéed gold when it moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7228:48"/>
it moſt deceiueth them that poſſeſſe it: but theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine bookes being repoſed and kept doo greatlie profit thoſe that haue them. For euen as where the kings armor and munition is repoſed and laid, although there be none that haue the ouerſight of it, yet it cauſeth much ſafetie &amp; defence to them that dwell there, whileſt neither open théefe, nor priuie piker, nor anie wicked perſon dare aſſault the houſe: euen ſo whereſoeuer thoſe ſpirituall bookes be, from thence all diuelliſh power is expelled, and to them that dwell there much comfort and conſolation is added. For euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſight of thoſe bookes maketh vs more ſlacke and ſlouthfull to ſinne, for whether we haue attempted anie thing which is prohibited and forbidden vs, and therewith haue polluted our ſelues, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we returne home, &amp; behold thoſe holie bookes, our conſcience dooth more ſharplie condemne vs, and we are therby warned and admoniſhed from committing the ſame againe: or whether we perſiſt in holines we are made by thoſe books more firme and conſtant: for aſſoone as one hath touched the Goſpell, by and by he frameth his minde, and withdraweth it from worldly matters, and that onely by the ſight thereof. But if diligent reading be ioined thereto, the ſoule being occupied in thoſe holy and diuine myſteries, is purged and purified, for as much as God ſpeaketh to it by the Scriptures. But what then (ſay they) if we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the matters which are conteined in the ſcriptures? Yes verily although thou vnderſtand not that which is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and obſcure, yet euen by the reading thou maiſt get much godlines: and yet it cannot be that thou ſhouldeſt equally and alike be ignorant of all. For the gracious ſpirit of God hath ſo diſpoſed and tempered the Scriptures, that euen publicanes, fiſhers, tentmakers, ſhepheards, apoſtles, and ſimple and vnlearned men might by them be ſaued, that no ſimple or vnlearned man ſhould flie to this excuſe of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie and hardnes, ſéeing that the thing which in thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine books be vttered, are ſo eaſie for all men, that euen craftſmen, ſeruants, women, and thoſe that be moſt void of learning may not a little profit euen by the hearing of them read. For they whom God from the beginning vouchſafed to indue with his ſpirit of grace, did not write and compoſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7228:49"/>
theſe books for vaine glory as did the ethnicks, but for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of thoſe which ſhould heare them. For thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Philoſophers, eloquent Orators, and fine Rhetoriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when they did write books, did not ſéeke what was moſt for the publike profit of the people: but onely had a regard héereto and ſtudied for this, euen to be in admiration, and therefore albeit they vttered any thing that was profitable, yet they did couer and hide it in the darknes of their wiſdom which they much vſed. But the Apoſtles and Prophets did al things contrary, for they vttered things in cleare and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt maner, and opened them to all men, being as it were the common teachers of the world, that euery man might learne the things that are ſet foorth by the onely reading thereof. And this the prophet foreſhewed before ſaieng, They all ſhall be taught of God,<note place="margin">Ierem. 31.</note> &amp; euery one ſhall not ſay to to his neighbor, know God, for al ſhal know me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>1. Cor. 2.</hi> And I brethren when I came to you, came not in gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of words or of wiſdom, ſhewing to you the myſteries of God. And againe: My words and preaching were not in the faire inticing ſpéech of mans wiſedome: but in the plaine euidence of ſpirituall power. And againe: We ſpeake (ſaith he) the wiſedome not of this world, nor of the princes of this world, which come to naught. To whom are not manifeſt the things that be written in the Goſpell? Who hearing bleſſed be the milde, bleſſed be the mercifull, bleſſed be the cleane in hart, and ſuch other ſaiengs, will require therin to be inſtructed, or to haue the ſame expounded? Alſo to whom be not ſignes, myracles and hiſtories plaine and manifeſt? This is but a vaine pretence, excuſe and cloke or couer of ſlothfulnes. Thou doeſt not vnderſtand the things that are conteined in the Scriptures? How canſt thou euer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, when as thou wilt not once vouchſafe lightly to looke vpon them? Take the booke into thy hands, read the whole ſtorie, and kéeping in memorie the things which thou vnderſtandeſt, often reuolue and read ouer the things which be obſcure and hard. But if thou cannot by continuance of reading attaine to the ſenſe and meaning of it, come to a wiſe man, go to a learned man, and communicate with them the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7228:49"/>
things which thou haſt read, ſhew them thy vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and flagrant affection. And if God do ſée thée hauing ſo willing a minde, and ſo deſirous an affection, he wil not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thy vigilancie and carefulnes. But though no man ſhould teach thée that which thou ſéekeſt, he without doubt will open it to thée.<note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> Remember the Quéene of Ethiopians chamberlaine, who being a Barbarian, and diſtracted with many cares, &amp; on euery ſide troubled with ſundry affaires, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he did not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what he did read, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he ſitting in his chariot did read the diuine Scriptures. If he ſhewed ſuch dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce laboring by the way: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider what he would do being in his houſe? If in his iourney he would not ceaſe or abſtaine from reading, much leſſe would he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine being quiet in his houſe. If ſo be whileſt he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, &amp; did not vnderſtand, yet notwithſtanding did read, and ceaſed not from reading, much leſſe would he ceaſe after he was inſtructed and did vnderſtand. For that thou maieſt know that he vnderſtood not what he did read, heare what <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to him: Doſt thou vnderſtand what thou readeſt? The which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard, he was not abaſhed nor aſhamed, but confeſſed his ignorance, and ſaid: How can I, vnleſſe I haue an inſtructor, whileſt as yet he had none to teach him, yet notwithſtanding he did read, and thereby quickly obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an inſtructor. God ſéeing his willing mind, embraced his good affection, and ſtraight waies ſent him a teacher. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Phillip</hi> be not now with vs, yet the ſame ſpirit which moued <hi>Phillip,</hi> is with vs. Dearely beloued, let vs not neglect our ſaluation, al theſe things were written to put vs in remembrance, whom the ends of the world are come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The reading of the ſcriptures is a great defence and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard againſt ſin: the ignorance of the Scriptures is a verie ſlippery meanes to fall into ſinne, and a great gulfe of ſinne. It is a great perdition and deſtruction to ſaluation to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the diuine Scriptures: this thing hath bred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, brought in corrupt life, and hath turned all things vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide downe.

For this maketh the ſoule endued with good maners, this lifteth the minde into heauen, this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man thankfull. This cauſeth vs not to looke vpon any thing that is preſent, but to haue our minds alwaies vpon another life: and that looking to the Lords reward we ſhould do all things, and chéerefully take in hand vertuous exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Out of the Scriptures we may learne the prouidence of God quickly helping vs, the valiantnes of iuſt men, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our Lord, the greatnes of his rewards. From hence we may be ſtirred to the imitation and following of the good life of godly men, that we waxe not cold and careles in vertuous exerciſes and battels, but euen before they come vpon vs to put our confidence in Gods promiſes. Therefore
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7228:51"/>
let vs giue our ſelues with great diligence to the reading of the diuine Scriptures. For ſo we get knowledge, if we read continually the things which be there contained. Neither can it be, that he who with great ſtudie &amp; feruent deſire gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himſelf to the reading of the holy Scriptures, ſhould be alwais neglected, but albeit we want the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man, the Lord himſelfe from an high entring into our harts, ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth our mind, illuminateth our vnderſtanding, reuealeth thoſe things which be ſecret, &amp; teacheth vs the things which we do not vnderſtand if we of our ſelues will do our owne endeuor. For you ſhall not, ſaith he, call any man maſter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. Therefore when we take that ſpirituall booke into our hands, all worldly care laid aſide, let vs kéepe our cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and reſtraining our minde that it be not caried away, let vs with good deuotion and great attention giue our ſelues to reading, that we may by the holie Ghoſt be lead vnto the vnderſtanding of the things that be written, and receiue great profit therby. That Barbarian an eunuch to the Quéen of the Ethiopians, who was in ſo great glorie, and did ride in his coach, yet in that time neglected not reading: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the prophet in his hand, vſed great diligence, and that not knowing what was contained therein, yet he did his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor, and vſed ſtudie, willingnes, and attentiuenes.

Let them heare and marke this example, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perſwaded to do this at home in their houſes, but thinke the reading of theſe things to be ſuperfluous, bicauſe they either liue in marriage, or be appointed to warfare, or haue care of children, ſeruants and other affaires, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinke that the reading of the holie Scriptures doth not appertaine vnto them.

paines and trouble my ſelfe, I read and haue none to direct me? That Eunuch did thinke no ſuch thing, being in toong a Barbarian, but in mind a Philoſopher. But rather he thought he ſhould not be neglected but helped with grace from aboue, if he did his owne indeuour, and vſed ſtudie and diligence. Therefore our gratious Lord ſéeing his deſire, did not forſake him, neither did let him want his helpe, but ſtraightwaies ſent a teacher vnto him.</q>

<q>HEnce innumerable euils haue ſprong, in that men be ignorant of the Scriptures. Hence hath come that great plague of hereſies, hence procéedeth diſſolutneſſe of life and vnprofitable labours. For as they that be depriued of this outward light, cannot walke rightlie: ſo they that looke not to the beames of the holie Scripture muſt néeds often and much offend in that they walke in farre woorſe darkneſſe, the which that it happen not to vs, let vs open our eies to the brightneſſe of the Apoſtles words: For his toong in cléere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe excéeded the ſunne, and in the deliuerance of doctrine he excelled all others.</q>
Infinit ſuch other earneſt exhortations for all men to read the holie Scriptures might be alledged out of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who of all other was moſt earneſt and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement in this point: but theſe ſhall ſuffice, both to ſtirre vp the godlie to this holie and fruitfull exerciſe: and to conuince the vanitie of our Rhemiſts, and their fooliſh ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillations,<note place="margin">In their Preface.</note> who ſaie that he ſpake theſe things not as a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in ſchoole, making exact and generall rules to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in all places and times, but as a pulpit man, agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that audience, and his peoples default, who were delicat, dull, worldlie, &amp; much giuen to dice, cards, ſtage plaies, and theaters, &amp;c.
What vaine cauils theſe be, let the Chriſtian reader indifferentlie iudge.
