            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Antichristian Treachery</p>
            <p>DISCOVERED AND Its Way Block'd up,</p>
            <p>In a clear Distinction betwixt the Christian Apostolical Spirit, and the Spirit of the Antichristian Apostate: Being an Answer to a Book put forth by <hi>William Rogers,</hi> falsly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Christian Quaker Distinguished from the Apostate and Innovator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shewing, the backsliding State of him the said <hi>William Rogers</hi> (and them of party with him) from the Gospel Spirit, the Life of Truth, and the first Love: Wherein he, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> (as principally concerned in an Apostate Work) have set themselves in opposition to Evangelical Church-care, and have asperced and abusively slandered the Instruments which God hath made use of touching the same.</p>
            <p>In Three Parts.</p>
            <p>First, shewing that under the Gospel despensation, Church-Government, Discipline and <hi>Visible</hi> Order is justifiable, necessary, and commendable in the <hi>Visible</hi> Family of God, (according to the Doctrine of Christ, and the Apostolical practice) Being brought forth by, and practiced in the invisible power of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> (together with <hi>William Rogers,</hi> who hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoused their Quarrel) and others of party with them, have opposed the aforesaid <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Discipline and Order (used in the Church of God) to the grief of Gods people, and to the Breach of the Churches peace.</p>
            <p>Shewing also, what Godly care, and brotherly Treating (according to Gospel order) hath been used to, and concerning the aforesaid <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> (and others of party with them) before the Judgment of Truth, according to the power of God in his people, was given out against them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That <hi>William Rogers,</hi> in a prejudiced malicious mind, that watcheth for evil, hath laboured to Asperce, and abusively to Calumniate the Church of Christ, with respect to the Government and Order setled therein; and particularly <hi>George Fox</hi> by name, and divers others whom by name he hath also with false Accusations treated on that wise; Several whereof are herein Inserted and spoken to, for the Satisfaction of the honest hearted to God, where this may come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the Table</hi> Luke, 22. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out, that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us,</hi> 1 John 2. 19.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THou mayest be satisfied that it hath been the Lot of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (the Birth of the Righteous Seed) ever since <hi>Abel</hi> to this Day (who have desired to live a Righteous and Godly Life, void of Offence towards God and Man, during their abode in this World, and to leave a Memorial that might not rot) to suffer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution; of which the Scriptures of Truth doth largely make mention, being also demonstrated by the Testimonies of Antient and Modern writers, touching the Affairs of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> from Age to Age, even to this Generation of which we are: And that we, the People called by the Name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have believed in the Light of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and testified thereof in Doctrine and Life, have had a large Portion thereof; let the many Reproaches, Mockings, Reviling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, the watchings for Evil, the Hatred, the Fury of malicious Men; we have undergone the many Slanders, and false Accusation that have been cast upon us, being numbered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Plotters and Peace-breakers, and the like (though not any thing of that Nature was ever proved against us, or we guilty of:) And for the Testimony of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and Word in the heart, have we been hated all the Day long, by a wicked and perverse Generation: Yea, let the spoyling of our Goods, and Imprisonments that we have sustained, that we might keep our Consciences clear in the Lords sight, testifie on this wise concerning us, ever since we have been a People, for the space of nigh Thirty Years. And blessed be the Lord who hath been our Defence, our Hiding-place, our Refuge, and the Rock of our Salvation unto this present time; that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the many perils and dangers we have met withall (to the undoing of us as Men, and to the causing of us to decline the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony God gave us to bear, if that Spirit had prevailed) we are a People at this Day saved by the Arm of the Lord, who is God and changeth not, let him, have the Praise for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94536:3"/>The good <hi>Apostle</hi> and faithful Servant of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and one who laboured truly in the Gospel, had his share in the tribulating Exercise that attends Gods Heritage; and making mention of the Perils that he had met withal in his Travels and concerns for the Gospels sake, speaks on this wise, <hi>Often in Perils of Water, Perils of Robbers, Perils by my own Country-Men, Perils in the City, in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, Perils on the Sea, and Perils amongst false Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be taken notice of, that amongst the Exercises that had happened to him in his Day, for the Gospels sake; he closes up the matter of his Lamentation and Grief, because thereof, with this, <hi>viz. And Perils amongst false Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath suffered the like Exercise to befal his People in this our Day; and of all the Enemies that we have met withal, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Antient Experience, the greatest (with respect to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Exercise for God and his Kingdom) have been them of our own House: And with respect to the general concern of Truth (the furtherance whereof is more in our eye then human Repute) that which we have met withal, from the Treachery of <hi>False Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> led aside from the Simplicity of the Gospel, to the wounding of their own Souls, and tending to the breach of the Church's Peace, hath been our Sorrow and Grief.</p>
            <p>That God which brought <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypts</hi> Land, and was their Rock and sure Defence, their Walls and Bulwarks against their Foes, their Conduct, Deliverance, and Rest, to the Joy of that People, and his own eternal Praise, hath been the God of our Salvation, and none other; whose eminent Hand hath so appeared for us, that not a Tongue that hath in Judgment risen, hath prevailed, nor a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon formed against us prospered. And this is the torment of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Serpent, the old Enemy to that innocent Life Man was placed in, in the beginning; and he hath once more attempted to set himself against the Lord and his People (who in sincerity desires to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in his sight, and hath a Witness in many Consciences accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly) and to break in upon the <hi>Heritage of God,</hi> by his subtil Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Transformings (when by no other means he can prevail) is the design that of late he hath had in Hand, and hath entered a few that came out with us, and were Eye-Witnesses of that inestinable Glory, through the bright shining whereof many were turned from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Light, to behold the excellency of that Kingdom that never
<pb facs="tcp:94536:3"/>
hath an end; and yet through an evil Heart of Unbelief are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from that eternal Power which once they knew, and from the fear of his name that appear'd for them, and only pretend to that they are gone from, that they may the more cunningly deceive, and lead back into a corrupt Fleshly Liberty again, to satisfie the Lusts of it, that's the center it tends to, and when it hath tired it self out, there will its end be.</p>
            <p>Impartial Reader, When thou hast with an unprejudiced mind, in sincerity of Heart, looked over and weighed this <hi>William Rogers</hi> his Work, the Champion of the backslided Ones, and the Enemy to the Churches Peace, and looks upon the Engine he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Work by; thou mayest easily see of what Spirit he is, and what his Work tends to, and escape the Snare he would take thee in: Its a false Spirit in which he would betray his Brother even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death; its malicious, bending it self with false Accusations and lying Slanders to defame such as have kept their Garments clean, and whose Integrity is approved in Gods sight, and in many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; its wicked in bringing the same to publick view, having for the most part little evidence of any sort to produce, but — <hi>If Reports be true;</hi> its a treacherous Spirit that talks of the Light, and would seem to vindicate Truth's Principles with such a false, malicious, slanderous wicked Work as his Book is stuffed with; and with seeming Imbraces, and standing for the Truth, and the appearance of it; betrays it, and would deliver it up, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of it into the hands of Sinners. Its a false libertine Spirit tending to Ranterism, that inveighs against Friends tender care in the <hi>Church of God</hi> according to Gospel Order; and vilifies with slanderous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful terms, the Government of the Power and Discipline therein Established in Gods visible Family, terming it the bringing into the Churches Mens Prescriptions, and lording it over Mens Consciences, the introducing of the Apostacy again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (All which in Subjection to Gods Power we abominate — and turn it back upon its own Head, to receive the stroke of the Eternal God, which will fall upon the Abbetters of this Spirit (if in time they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not) as a burden too heavy to bear: They of that Spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so cry against the seasonable Exhortations and Reproofs of them whom God is pleased to concern on this wise, as Imposing, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driving, and the like; they are letting loose, and gratifying a fleshly

mind, and to indulge the same, claiming a right in a wrong spirit, to be left to inward freedom, till they see the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings; or that it is their duty so to do. This sort of<note place="margin">Which wrong Spirit will never give them to see their duty, nor lead them into it.</note> abominable Work is clearly manifested to be the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Spirit, as his own Book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates, cleared to the understandings of the unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced and honest Hearted to God, and by the Answer thereunto, (called, <hi>The Accuser of our Brethren cast down,</hi> &amp;c. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Ellis Hook,</hi> in the name of the second Day of the Weeks Morning Meeting in <hi>London</hi>) may be plainly seen.</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, creeping Work, of this Spirit, is; that although <hi>William Rogers</hi> in his Title Page pretends his Book to come forth in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Question being often put (as Hundreds will Witness) and required of him or any to Answer to; <hi>Who would stand by it; Or say they had Unity with its coming forth in Print?</hi> We cannot yet find the Man that declares he owns it; or that will say, <hi>I am one that will stand by it:</hi> And yet a creeping sort of Men, backsliden (of a certain Truth) from God, and turned from the Truth, and work the Works of Darkness, hands it out amongst the loose sort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Truth; and many other, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> It may be cause of Wonder that this People that came out together in the Light and Unity of the one Spirit, and have stood together with Hand and Shoulder, against the many Heads and Horns that have pushed at them; and who have been struck at more or less, under every Government that hath been since they were a People, and none has been able to break them; but all has tended to their Encrease and Stability, in the way they have been led into, and walked in; that such should now, when their outward Ease comes to be enlarged, fall at Odds and Difference amongst themselves, apparently as some may expect, to the great damage, if not the Ruin of them.</p>
            <p>In the first place we would have all to know, and take notice, that in the Light and Life of Truth, our antient Unity stands, and
<pb facs="tcp:94536:4"/>
in it all are established, who keep Entire and Faithful to it: In it we are the same in Love, in Fellowship (through the eternal Power against which the Gates of Hell shall not prevail) that ever we were; our Life grows in God, our Testimony stands, we are on our way, the Lord is before us, and there's none shall be able to pluck us out of his Hand; our Faces are still <hi>Sion</hi> wards, and our Confidence through the Eternal Power thats inlarged amongst us, to have our Residence there, in that good Land which God hath given us to taste the Fruits of, and the earnest (blessed be God) we have with us of that Inheritance, that never hath an end; and we are comforted in our way, who keep to Truths Life, and if any turn out to the right Hand, or to the left, its their own fault, and will be their own loss; the Lord will be clear, and his People clear, having discharged our Duty thus far concerning them.</p>
            <p>Its confessed to the grief of our Souls, there are a few that came out with us, by an Eternal Arm, that have not eyed the Lord and his Power for Safety; but are gone out from us, (having betrayed the Life in which they were with us) and are become not of us: As it was said, <hi>They went out from us, because they were not of us, for if they had been of us, no doubt they would have continued with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may in truth be told you that have read <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Book, for your Satisfaction, if you desire it, what sort of Professors of Truth this Evil and Mischief (of being led back again from the conduct of Gods Power, to covet the Flesh-Pots of <hi>Aegypt'</hi>s Land, and satisfie the Lusts of a corrupt mind, in opposition to the Churches Care, in this Gospel day) hath befallen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They are such as although the Openings of life, and the hidden Wisdom of the pure God, were in some measure Revealed in some of them; and although in some measure they might have partaken of the Ministry of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> as <hi>Judas</hi> did amongst the Twelve; yet not giving God the praise, nor singly attributing the Glory to him that Worthy, deckt themselves therewith (as it was of old, the Lord said, <hi>I gave them of my Jewels, and they deckt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therewith,</hi> &amp;c.) So Pride and Spiritual Ambition prevailing, instead of Humility in the Lords <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> (the safe Habitation) the Lord became grieved, to the greatly withdrawing of his good Spirit from them, so that their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to others came to be in the Wisdom which is from below, and is Earthly, Sensual and Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
<pb facs="tcp:94536:5"/>
of which some of the principal of them were told, and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Evil thereof many Years ago: So that the mystery of Gods mind, which is revealed to Babes in Christ, they became shut up from; and the concerns of the Kingdom in the life thereof they became strangers to; and as to the concerns relating to the visible Family of God, being at a loss in relation to, they became par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with the loose sort in the opposition thereunto, till strife en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and to work Discord in the <hi>Church of God</hi> their Design broke forth; of which more may be said afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This opposite Spirit to Church Care, entred amongst such as became unfaithful, in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The opposition prevailed upon such as became (in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Truth's Life, and the pure fear) vain in their Minds, and inclined to liberty in the Flesh again in the Worlds Spirit, becoming Enemies to the Cross, and casting off he Yoke of (Christ to which Subjection is to be given) and entering into the Worlds loose Spirit again, a reproach to Truth, which the godly care for God's Honour, and Truths <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This Spirit of opposition to Church care (that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things were decent might be cherished, and the contrary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) hath wrought in such (and drawn them into a Separation) as through the Imaginations of a corrupt Mind, and in an airy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would have entertained things to be put in practice, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the honourable State of <hi>Marriage,</hi> inconsistant with Truths sweet Savour, with respect to Man and Womans duty therein, or were inclined to, inconsiderate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>We desire, that in every Country or Place, where a knowledge of this Separation, from the fellowship of the <hi>Church of God</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be, or where the aforementioned Book of <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s comes to be seen, all would take notice, if they that are fled off through a backsliding Spirit, into a distance as to the Antient fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of Brethren, and become disconcerned in Church affairs amongst Gods antient People, and labour to promote the Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s ungodly Book, be not clearly manifested to be some of the fore-going sorts of Professors of Truth; which as any finds them to be, let that which is pure, peaceable, and easie to be entreated, judge what they are, and what this Spirit and Work would lead unto.</p>
            <p>Thou needest not <hi>Reader,</hi> think it a strange thing, with respect to this backsliding People, whose Reproach to all hastens on (<hi>For Righteousness doth Establish a People or Nation, when Ignominy is the Portion of Fools</hi>) for the like hath happened concerning the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Gods Mind and Will made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Of them that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> through the Arm of the eternal God, under the conduct of <hi>Moses</hi> a Servant of the Lord, and an Instrument in his Hands, and of them that had seen the mighty Wonders God wrought for their Deliverance, Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty of the Princes of the People, mighty Men, Men of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, Rebelled against the Lord, and despised his Servant <hi>Moses,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated together to Work mischief in the Camp, and stood in their opposition, till the Righteous God caused the Earth to open and Swallow them up.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Twelve of <hi>Christ'</hi>s own choise, one of them became an Enemy to him, to the betraying him into the Hands of <hi>Sinners.</hi>

            <p>Some are made mention of to have tasted of the good Word of God, and of the powers of the Life to come; and yet afterwards

            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> made mention of the falling back of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> from the Simplicity of the Gospel, and lamented the case of their being <hi>Bewitched;</hi> and he Travelled that the Seed Christ might be again formed in them: He also made mention of false Brethren that had been his Exercise and Grief.</p>
            <p>The Lord suffers these things to be, and such to be over-taken on this wise, whose Hearts do not abide upright to God, who have known God in his Power, and yet do not Honour him as God.</p>
            <p>It is considerable, and worth the notice taking, to see what effects the Lord hath wrought, and what he hath suffered to be, through such Exercises as these are. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> with respect to the <hi>Heretage of God,</hi> the Family that does Believe, through the exercise that is met withal from false Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whose backslidings and opposite Work, and the tendency of it to Strife is the Churches Grief; there is a tender concern in all such wrought (upon the observation of it) to have a more inward Eye to God, by whose Grace all are saved that believe therein, that they may be kept to him, in the feeling of that Power which preserves every one upon the Rock, for help and salvation: So that the Lord being more eyed, the more he comes to be feared, and dependency comes to be laid on him; and on this occasion all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> comes to be laid down, seeing the Mighty and the Wise amongst Men are overcome, and a retirement to that antient Arm, that brought Salvation in the beginning, is wrought upon the Souls of them that believe; that Spirit in Children of the Night that would divide, being seen, and in Gods Name resisted; the Children of the Day are the more knit together in Soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and the delight of the Lord comes to be with them, and his Glory over-shaddowing them, to the encrease of Life and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to God amongst them: Love encreases, and Life springs in the Assemblies of the Righteous, a People saved by the Lord; and all srinking creeping hidden Works of Darkness are judged down; the snare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <pb facs="tcp:94536:6"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Through the workings of the Spirit that prevails on them whose Habitation is not in the Lord; the Negligent, the Careless, the Rebellious that dwell in the dry Land, and have wanted the vertuous Life of God through unbelief, into whom Looseness is entered, and the Works of the Flesh wrought; anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Testimonies for God let fall by them, to Truths dispraise, and the wounding the Hearts of the Innocent, whose Testimony abides sure, and through whose unfaithfulness, Afflictions are added to the Bonds of the Upright to God, to the Churches Grief; they having turned the many visitations of Gods Love behind the Back, and grown worse and worse, such as these comes to be shaken off, and the <hi>Camp</hi> cleansed of them, and they manifested to all; and that they who are approved may be made manifest; a Separation being wrought between them that truly serve the Lord, and them that serve him not, betwixt them that live in the Antient Power, and in Life and Faithfulness glorifies the same, and them that talk only of the Light and inward guidance of the Spirit of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and yet in Works deny him: Let but the <hi>Reader</hi> and the Innocent wait a little in the patience, and you shall see the end of this Spirits Work to its utter Reproach; its Memorial shall rot, and never rise again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That although this appearing Difference amongst us, may, and hath caused a Flutter amongst the Gazers and Wonderers that would not believe, and for the present might put a little discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for a time upon the unestablished in God, and obstruct a little the gathering unto us such as the Lord will deliver, and shall be saved; and what an expectation hath there been (through this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) in our publick Enemies (that have watched for it) of our disadvantage thereby in the way of Truth, if not our Ruin; yet it were well if such would take notice, that notwithstanding the worst of this Spirit's Work, how the Lord hath Blessed his People in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, even where the greatest Blunder hath been, with the more Zeal and Integrity for him; and that more is added to us since that day then for many Years before.</p>
            <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> That which we observe, and it were well if notice of it were truely taken, this talk of Difference amongst us, (which we do affirm is not in the <hi>Camp</hi> of God) but a Testimony is born by us against the Backslided and Apostate, it doth tend to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:94536:7"/>
of a disobedient and gainsaying People, that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Testimony of the Light and Life of <hi>Christ Jesus;</hi> to believe in him for Salvation, but have turned the visitations of Gods love behind their backs, in their rebellion against the Lord, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Grace, to their greater ruin, and the more speedy executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof (if in time they repent not) and it were well if such yet would fear Almighty God, and be subject to the Truth, before it be too late to find Mercy.</p>
            <p>In our Advice to the <hi>Reader,</hi> and Introduction to the ensuing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of what is before us to concern our selves with, we cannot but first take notice, that some may say,</p>
            <p>If it were true that the Author af the aforesaid Book, and those he seems so much to standby, are in a backsliding state, and seperated from you, whom you seem to disown as out of fellowship with you. What is the meaning of all this Writing against <hi>George Fox</hi> so vehemently (and more principally then any others) together with others also, whom by name he makes mention of? And what is the truth of the matters and things laid to his and others charge, which, if true, bespeaks a backsliding in him and others he speaks of, as well as in them you declare against?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> As for <hi>George Fox</hi> we say and Testifie, that as he was an Instrument in Gods hand through the Demonstration of the Spirit, being a Minister of the new Testament the everlasting Gospel, through whom many were turned from Darkness to Light, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Glory of the everlasting Day; and the Faces of many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands have been truely and livingly set Sion-wards, and their Feet established in the way thither: Let <hi>William Rogers</hi> say and do his worst; he is one who hath kept his Integrity to the Lord, and is honorable in Gods power amongst the Children of the Light, that keep their habitation in it; an Elder that hath ruled well, and is worthy of honour for the gift of Gods sake, that he hath been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the concern of, and is the same with an encrease of Life and pure Wisdom that ever he was, notwithstanding the fury of wicked and lying Tongues: And as it was in Christ and the Apostles days, because of the testifying against the World, by him and his Desci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that their deeds were evil, the World hated them above all; the <hi>Jews</hi> stumbled at him, because of his Testimony against the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous profession of the chiefest of them, and their Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb facs="tcp:94536:7"/>
which it was said must be exceeded, or no coming into Gods Kingdom; for which cause also they hated him, and put him to Death.</p>
            <p>The first and most Glorious appearance of the breaking forth of the more clearer Day, after an Apostatized state was ever resisted with great Indignation, by them upon whom the Apostacy from the Life and Power of God had prevailed, and the publishers of the same Testimony from God, the most hated and persecuted with the cry of — <hi>Help Men and Brethren;</hi> and withal the fury and might imaginable, to obstruct the breakings forth thereof.</p>
            <p>This Generation hath not forgot, that in a resolved combined Covenant made with <hi>Death,</hi> was the Testimony resisted that this Servant of the eternal God bore against the Sin, self Righteousness and false Judgment that a wicked and a pervers Generation lived in, and under the profession of, to the total stopping and crushing of it by all means Imaginable if they could, or that could be contrived, and far contrary to the work of a professing Gospel Ministry and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of a Gospel day, to the shame of such as were the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thereof, and stirrers up of Persecution therefore: It may be remembered what such an one he was rendered to be, even as the worst of Men, and yet nothing could be laid to his charge, save for his crying against Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and keeping a good Conscience to God, recommending his Testimony to the Witness of God in all Consciences, in the patience that possessed the Soul; the Lyes, the false Aspersions, Calumnies and Reproaches raised against him, and cast upon him with rage and fury, and gnashing of Teeth for grief, they are far beyond expression. To a gainsaying Rebellious Spirit, the Testimony of Light that condemns for Sin is an hateful thing, and the Ministers of Antichrist have bent themselves against it, and against them the Testimony is born by: And seeing that Early of this our day it was first and principally born by him, how could he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the wrath of Man that produceth evil things, and avoid the fury of it? Nay, this was his Lot (with others of Gods faithful Servants) whom God hath upheld and delivered through all; and he hath seen the travel of his Soul, and the fruit of his labour into his bosome manifold in recompence for all, to his hearts Joy, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the worst of Men imagine against him.</p>
            <p>The same enmity lodgeth still, and venteth it self again and again,
<pb facs="tcp:94536:8"/>
through any new occasion given to it, or that it can get hold of, in the wilful resisters of our principle and lifes appearance, and in all them that Backslides therefrom, and enters again into the old Cainisn Murthering Spirit, that crucifies the Lord of Life again, and would put him to open shame: Never a publick opposing Apostate from the life of Truth, that hath risen up in Judgment against it, since we have been a People, but in the old Enmity of the cursed <hi>Serpents</hi> Image, he hath run against <hi>George Fox:</hi> Oh, its admirable to us! (and renders <hi>William Rogers</hi> in this cursed work of his, to be a Man running on to Ruin) that he does not take notice, and that with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, of the breakings forth of the eminent hand of the Lord against such to their misery and shame, that thus tempts the Lord to deal with him, as hath been dealt with his predecessors gone before, whose footsteps he follows with all the haste and fury he can appear in; let him take heed, though his presumption be great in defying the Work of God in his Servants; let him vapour with the Bulk of the Weapon (his ungodly <hi>Book</hi>) he hath formed in his stout and ambitious mind; the Lord is risen to dash in peices, and is upon the Throne, who with the Antient (though dispised) Instrument of simplicity, and the naked truth which he hath in his Hand, will wound the head and glory of this uncircumcised One to its utter Ruin, and the perpetual reproach of all them that lean upon it; the Mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it, and it shall surely come to pass. And as to the particular matters of Accusations by <hi>William Rogers</hi> cast upon <hi>George Fox,</hi> we do testifie, and in the Truth affirm, and can commit the same to the tryal of the righteous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of God, and equal Law of doing as one would be done by; that if many of the matters in charge against him were true, (which we believe are malicious and false) the malice the rancour of his Spirit that appears in his perverting <hi>George Fox</hi> his words, his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construing and putting his own corrupt sence upon them, disingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and unlike a Man, and then placing a Judgment thereupon; his disorderly bringing them forth having not first examined the truth of matters, and dealt with him face to face, as in the sequel of our matter may be manifested he hath not done: His publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Print and exposing the same to publick view by sale or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof in Shops, so that it is come to the view of the great enemies of Truth and us; and the applications he puts upon our tender care

in the Church of God, as <hi>Antichristian</hi> and <hi>Rome-like,</hi> with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives and malicious Smitings he can invent, renders him plainly to be an <hi>Apostate</hi> from Truth, an enemy to God, and the Principle we have believed in, an accuser of the Brethren, not fit for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Society, but to be rejected as reproachful thereto, and left to the righteous God of Heaven and Earth to reward him according to his works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friendly Reader,</hi> our Testimony is for the sake of that principle of Light and Life in <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> our Lord and Law-giver, in which we have believed, and are bold to Testifie to, and stand in the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of against all the opposers thereof, as that which is our life, and the comfort of our days through the Salvation that we have known thereby, wherein we have peace, and for the sake whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches are not hard for us to bear; and for the removing of the Stumbling-blocks out of the way thereof, that if it were possible all Men might walk therein, and find mercy: We say in a godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that lies upon us, we intend through Gods assistance a little to discover the Face and Image of a Ungodly Backsliding Separate divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Spirit, by rending off the covering it hath got upon its head to hide its nakedness and shame withal, in the departing of those it hath prevailed upon, from the living God, from the way of Truth, and from the unity of the Brethren; to the casting off the Subjection to Gods power (which they once knew, and unto which also Obedience should be given) and giving way to a corrupt mind in themselves, and to a false Liberty that Truth leads not to, have set themselves (being of that sort that loves not found Judgment) against the rule and government of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> (whose right it is) in the Spirits of their own minds, and against the Discipline of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> according to Gospel-order, and the practice of the Church in the <hi>Apostles</hi> dayes; and thereby encouraging a loose and licentious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in others, that would draw back into the liberty of the flesh again, to satisfie the Lusts thereof, and thereby bring a reproach upon that eternal name in which we have believed, and testified Salvation to be thereby; as if it were not Sufficient to compleat the work thereof by us expected and waited for; which we Testifie against whoever otherwise say.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That under a Gospel dispensation, visible Order, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government, in the exercise of the Spirit, is necessary, justifiable, and ought to be found in Subjection to Gods Power, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Gods People, according to Christs Doctrine, Apostolical care, and the practice of the Primitive Churches of Christ, proved by Scripture Record.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the care of the <hi>Churches of God</hi> in this our day, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Children of the Light, with respect to Discipline, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order and rule of Truth, and their practice according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stands justified, as consistant with the <hi>Apostles</hi> Doctrine, with the command of <hi>Christ,</hi> Scripture Example, and the primitive practice touching this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>William Rogers</hi> in his Book (though after a broken contradictory manner, and very much inconsistant with himself) hath denied the care, discipline and order used amongst us in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and hath Judged the same: And that <hi>John Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> with them of the Separation in the <hi>North,</hi> and of Party with him, in an opposite Spirit thereunto, have sleighted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
<pb facs="tcp:94536:10"/>
and laboured to put a dis-esteem thereupon; and have laid Stumbling-blocks in the way of the weak in relation thereunto; and have laboured to obstruct the care and exercise of Gods People in relation thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That <hi>George Fox,</hi> and others of the Antient Brethren, their care and exercise, as Instruments in the Lords hand to see the Churches of Christ every where, in this our age, setled in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Order and Discipline (as the <hi>Apostles</hi> care was in his day) hath been Justified, Embraced and freely closed with (as that which has tended to Friends Advantage in the Truth, and the honour thereof) by the Churches of Christ in this Nation, and in other Nations, which the practice of our Monthly and Quarterly Meetings demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That notwithstanding <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s, and others of Party with him, their abusing <hi>George Fox,</hi> and slandering him with lying accusations, as one that would Introduce his own Prescriptions and Orders, and invade <hi>Christs Prerogative, &amp;c.</hi> And would exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a wrong Spirit, in Rule and Government, Lording it over the heritage of God: His advice and directions in relation to the duty of Gods People, in the Tabernacle God hath given us visibly to appear in, hath been acceptably closed with, and testified to, by Word and Writings, as shall be made appear in the <hi>Sequel</hi> of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and as the Churches Records in our Quarterly Meetings doth declare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To prove that <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Charges and malicious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations exhibited in Print, against <hi>George Fox,</hi> and others of the Brethren, are idle, frivolus and fallacious, and his exercise in that matter a Scandal to Christianity, and ridiculous amongst Men and sober Societies, which the said <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath framed and made up (and brought to publick view) through his perverting <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Honest and Christian words and discourse, and by his uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable deductions in a jealous prejudiced mind; and putting his own perverted Constructions and Inferrences upon <hi>George Fox'</hi>s sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and Christian sence of matters his words related to, otherwise then ever was intended by him (as the plain and charitable constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof naturally deducible therefrom demonstrates) and then places his own judgment upon him, which is an horrid and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing in the Lords <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and detestable amongst Men: And
<pb facs="tcp:94536:11"/>
through Gods help, this is before us to manifest; which we Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion not to effect, to the Satisfaction of all the unprejudiced, and upright minded where this <hi>Book</hi> may come.</p>
            <p>We have also a desire in sincerity of heart, to demonstrate to all, where the knowledge of any difference amongst this People hath come (as the relation thereof may most properly fall in our way) the Christian care that hath been amongst the truly established in God (who have kept their first love and care for Gods glory, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> habitation upon the Rock abides sure) to have preserved this scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered divided People, within the Fold of the true Shepherd, unto whom the gathering is, whilst they were in any measure near unto us; before they turned away from Gods Power, and broke away as the <hi>Israel</hi> of old did, unto whom the Lord had given of his good Spirit, and yet they rebelled against him; and therefore the Lord, (after many visitations and willingness to heal their backslidings, which they regarded not) withdrew from them and gave them up to a reprobate mind, to harden themselves to their utter Ruin.</p>
            <p>We would declare also, as that which is material to our present concern, and yet as briefly as we well can, what exercises particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and more generally, after a more publick manner, many dear Brethren have met withal through this Spirit; what brotherly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, that the Temptations of it was prevailed upon, with Advice and Councel, to remove that groundless ungodly jealousie that entred them, in which the vail came over, and there the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Strife and Contention got place. What care; what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness and Gospel-Order hath been over them, &amp; used towards them? letting the honest hearted see some part of the honest labours and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in Soul and Spirit, and bodily endeavours that have been indured, and used towards them, for the Lord and his Truths sake, and their Eternal good; and how unwilling the <hi>Church of God</hi> was to have had them rent off from us: What patience, long-sufferings, brotherly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have been used towards them; if possible they might live and find rest in God for their Souls; how clear the Lord and his People are of their blood, if they perish for evermore; what pitty was it, hath it been often said, that a jealous prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Spirit, should prevail upon any who have known God, to work them into such a wilful froward perverse state, as to let nothing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that might do them good, having rejected that in themselves,
<pb facs="tcp:94536:11"/>
which God had made manifest in them, not liking to retain the same in their knowledge; as it was of old concerning such whom God gave up to a reprobate mind, and unto great hardness of heart, to the filling up the measures of their Iniquities, for the Damnation that slumber'd not: God Suffers these things to be, that they who are approved may be made manifest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Considerate Reader,</hi> If these before recited particulars be made good, which necessarily relates to our present work, which we doubt not but to be able to do, we hope that clearness of understanding concerning the matter in hand will be opened in thee (as desires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides with thee to God on that wise) as that thou wilt easily judge of the ground of the Controversie betwixt us, and our present Adversary, whom we treat not with now as a Brother, or one of us, but as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy to the Life of our Principle, and holy Profession, a caster of <hi>Stumbling-Blocks in the way of many to fall upon;</hi> which will prove a burden too heavy for him to bear: And thou wilt plainly see what manner of man he is, what Spirit he is of, what his design and all his fluttering Work tends to; and that upon this occasion, if thou hast a Sence of Gods Truth, thou wilt be the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in it, and be the more concerned to keep thy Habitation in it, for thy Salvation and peace sake; or if thou beest one who has not hitherto given up thy self to serve the Truth (though convinced by it) nor our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> We hope (as that which we truly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) thou wilt not find by this occasion, any ground to continue in hardness of Heart against it, but in subjection to Gods Light and Life in thy self; thou wilt be given up in self-denial, to close with that Principle thou hast the sence of, and which we have believed in, and testifie of, and is our Life and Portion in God, and cause of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing; and that thou mayst come to have a share with us in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of God, amongst Gods sanctified ones; which in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal love God hath appeared in, in these latter Days, and in which we travel for the good of all, we truly breath for, as that which will be our Joy, and a Recompence into our Bosoms, for our Labours, Sorrows and Travels manifold.</p>
            <p>We further advise the <hi>Reader,</hi> when this our ensuing Tratise shall happen to fall in the Hands of such, as have not received the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Light (which we have testified to) so as to believe therein;
<pb facs="tcp:94536:12"/>
or when it comes amongst such, as have hurt themselves by too much adhering to a wrong Spirit, (which very probably it may somtimes do) by reason of the endeavours that are used, by the promoters of <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Book, to hand it out to any, where it may have reception, to the dafamation of our holy Profession, and the Unity we have enjoyed therein; as also to the disparagement of such, as the said <hi>William Rogers,</hi> and they who adhere to him, in their malicious undertakings, sets themselves against: We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that such where this may come, (who have also seen <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Book would weigh the matters discoursed upon betwixt him, together with his Adherents, and us with them in whose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half we are thus concerned; not in that Spirit which is gratified with an occasion, which seems through this Exercise amongst us, to be put into their hands; which appears to them to be that which may work us under, and blot out our name from off the Earth, (as too many are apt to do) as that which hath been long desired by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing People, and hath been waited for, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in our fall, thereby to strengthen themselves in their unbelief of that holy Principle of Light and Spirit of Truth, (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns for Sin, and convinceth the World thereof, and of their self Righteousness and false Judgment) which we have born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to; for if things be weighed in such a Spirit as this, it will be an occasion, <hi>Reader,</hi> to shut thee up from the blessing of God that gives an understanding, and under the vail of that darkness that will (by reason thereof) cover thee, thou wilt betray thy self of that inward sence that God gives, and be left uncapable to give right judgment of matters in hand, not knowing what thou sayest, or whereof thou affirms; wherefore to prevent the danger thou art in on this wise; we desire in all sincerity that thy Heart may be open to God, who opened the Heart of <hi>Lidia,</hi> and made her capable to receive the Truth: And let all prejudice be shut out, and prejudging of us (because of any former grudg that hath been too much born concerning us, because of our Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in any respect, and our practice accordingly) otherwise, as to any advantage that thou canst gain, in the matter of thy peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hereof, thy Labour will be altogether in vain.</p>
            <p>And do not think that we are too severe with <hi>William Rogers,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94536:12"/>
for with great Gentleness and Brotherly care, hath he and others of party with him been treated, whilest we felt the Door of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy open (as in the Sequel of our concern shall be made appear) and they still hardened over all; so that as we have said before, we cannot now treat him as a Friend or Brother in Truth, but as an open Enemy of the highest rank; and the Testimony we have now from God on his account, and our exercise accordingly; is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>We desire thee also, whilest thou Reads, consider of things with respect to our Principle, our antient Practice, our Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, our faithfulness therein, our Sufferings by reason thereof, our Labours to confirm each other in the way of Truth (and not to weaken each others hands to the letting fall any of our Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for Truth) our antient Love each to other, as one Family led by one and the same Spirit; our Brotherly fellowship and care over each other, our desire and endeavours to cover the weaknesses of any that have partaked with us, of the Grace of God, for the honour of that Principle and holy Name, we have (as a People distinct from other Professions) received and believed in, and had our Society together in the power of.

               <p>Many may say, <hi>Doth this kind of work tend to his Praise?</hi> thus to heap up Confusion and publish the same to his own shame; to accuse, to slander, and defame with all the malice and Venom that through his Pervertings and Inferences he can stretch matters to, to make accusations thereof as much as possible under any colour he can devise, and then place his own Judgment thereupon; and makes a flutter therewith, like children that play with their own shadows. And as to many charges and Accusations he brings, they are upon no better Evidence, then — If Reports be true: poor <hi>William!</hi> (for so he is; although he be full and rich in his own Esteem) since he went from the Light and the peaceable meek Spirit, he hath marred his repute in the eye of God and God's People, and brought Disgrace and shame on himself amongst men: yea, common and civil Societies are ashamed of his Work, as a Nauseous thing; let him go on, if nothing will be a warning to him, and doe what he hath to do; for his day is almost over, it were well if Repentance he could yet find.</p>

                        </hi> Spirit <hi>there-unto and hath laid Stumbling-blocks in the way of it; and thereby obstructed the</hi> Care <hi>and Exercise of</hi> God's <hi>People, in Relation thereunto.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>To which we say, that in Relation to <hi>William Rogers</hi> his Denial of the Order of Truth setled amongst us, to be consistent with our principle and first love; as also his Judging the same, much need not to be said in this place: That which is already herein Inserted out of his <hi>Book,</hi> as also what may at large be observed in the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> to his by <hi>Ellis Hookes,</hi> &amp;c. Demonstrating, that a great part of the Tendency of his whole work therein relates thereunto; And to manifest the contempt thereof that hath been also on <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> their Spirits, together with them of Party with them in the <hi>North,</hi> and the opposition, they have made thereunto to the Church's grief and the breach of its peace, more may be said af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when we give a Relation of the exercise and concern we have had with them by reason thereof, which in the Sequel (God willing) we Intend to do. As to <hi>William Rogers</hi> we say, his clamouring against us alter an abusive manner on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in his <hi>Book</hi> is so frequently used by him, that it's obvious and clear to the view of every honest man, who hath had a view thereof, that <hi>Contempt, scorn</hi> and <hi>derision</hi> is that which he is filled with on the Account thereof: <q>Whosoever, saith he, shall endeavour by outward ways to establish an outward Government, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rule, &amp;c. they are <hi>Invaders</hi> of <hi>Christ'</hi>s <hi>Prerogative:</hi> And again, saith he, that Spirit that would remove u from our teacher &amp;c. to follow the Dictates of fallible men &amp;c.</q> In the first place, we deny his charge as applicable to us, we have no such design: <hi>God</hi> knows before whom we stand, it's a meer unjust reflection, for we Commend all to the teachings of the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the guidings of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94536:21"/>
Spirit, in which the Unity stands in the Order and Rule of Truth, to be <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Governments</hi> in the <hi>Church:</hi> Neither do we lay before one another in the <hi>Church of God</hi> any thing but what is answerable to Truth, and is freely received of the Innocent to God; we disown the Dictates of fallible men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he give us a Catalogue of those Dictates he so much talks of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we take the less notice of the cluttering work he makes on that wise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is clear that all those Reflections he useth, he aims them at us, and upon our Order and Discipline in God's House, and the directions relating thereunto, otherwise there had been no occasion of his so often reiterating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in this his undertaking to detect us as Apostates on the account thereof.</p>
                  <p>He further says, see page 16. of his first part, <hi>That our Meetings</hi> (in a reproach thereof) <hi>are made up of men uncertain as to Number and Qualifications, and under the notion of the</hi> Church of God <hi>assumes power over Conscience;</hi> and again he says, <hi>He appeals to the Intelligent, if those there assembled, pretending to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof</hi> (meaning the Church of God) <hi>have not been false Accusers, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasers, and many of them a sort of Persons that have loved preheminence and time-servers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we say, this is a malicious Slander which we deny; and we ask, what greater contempt could he appear in against our Brethren in their Exercise? what greater reproach could he any way bring upon our Meetings, and our Order and Care therein, &amp; more vilifie with Derision the exercise and concern thereof, the Advice, the Counsel that may arise amongst us, the Exhortations and Reproofs that any may be concerned in, as the Lord instructs, and leads accordingly, as any occasion may offer it self? What can he do or say more in Contempt of all, when he hath done his worst? and what Spirit this is, and what its work tends to, the Lord be Judge in all Consciences, and give the knowledg thereof; that the Snares of this wicked envious one may never on this wise prevail any more upon any: For to let loose the Licentious, Unclean, Libertine, Ranting Spirit is that which in the Ground he aims at, wherein the Apostacy is entering, &amp; the letting go the Bond of Truth, &amp; the Authority of it in himself, and in such as adhere to him, and are taken with his Bait; where the departing also from the Life of Christianity prevails, which <hi>William Rogers</hi> would charge others with, himself is detected to have the mannagement of the design thereof, which he bends himself to perfect, to his own disgrace and wo world without end: And what blasphemous work also he is clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected to be concerned in, who pretends what a <hi>concern of Conscience he and others of his Brethren had upon them to appear in Print, lest the Life of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity should seem to be extinct amongst the People called</hi>

                  <p>One other Instance out of many we think good to insert out of <hi>W. Roger's</hi> Book, plainly demonstrating his condemning all visible Order and Discipline in the Church of Christ, and so his opposition thereunto: In the Title page to the 3d part of his Book, called The Christian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. it is delivered by him thus — <hi>Manifesting</hi> (saith he) <hi>that there is but two sorts of Governments owned by the</hi> Children of Light, <hi>or the</hi> Christian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>one is the outward Government under which we Live, unto the Laws whereof we owe either Active or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94536:22"/>
Passive Obedience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The other is the inward Government of Christ (who alone is Lord over the Conscience) which is not represented by Persons visible, by carnal Eyes, invested with power from Heaven to execute outward</hi> Laws, Prescriptions, Orders, Edicts <hi>in any outward Form of</hi> Government <hi>visible as aforesaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Brethren, of the Second days morning Meeting in London, well observing (as in the Treatise called, The Accuser of our Brethren cast down, is inserted, that this assertion of <hi>W. Rogers</hi> directly contradicts the Paper therein made mention of; and in this Treatise also hereafter inserted, signed at <hi>Ann Travers</hi> House 1673. subscribed by him (while he kept his first Love and Care for God) amongst many other of his Brethren,; It contradicts also a Paper given forth in the Year 1672. relating to Godly Care, Order and Government in the Church; wherein advice is given to Friends who have a care and oversight committed to them, in their respective places, <hi>for good Order and eomfort in the Church;</hi> as the Words therein are: Which Epistle is signed by James Parke, Jasper Batt, John Story, Thomas Curtis, John Crooke, Stephen Crisp, and Fourteen more Friends, the 3d of the 3d Month 1672. so here John Story, when in Unity with his Brethren, is Uindicating and Encouraging Church care and visible order; and his Party have since expressly set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against it.

                        <hi>First,</hi> That W. Rogers and his Party are by him accounted the Christian Quakers and Children of Light; and that all those that are not of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor in Unity with him &amp; them, are accounted Apostates &amp; Innovators, and why so? but because they are for some outward Laws, Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in an outward form of Order and Government in the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> that's visible.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
                     <q>That this <hi>outward Order</hi> and <hi>visible Form,</hi> is such, as by his sence and state of the Case is rendered obnoxions, both to the <hi>outward Government</hi> under which we Live, and against the <hi>inward Government of Christ:</hi> Insomuch that all the People called Quakers, that are for <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>visible Form</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> amongst them are Charactered Apostates and Innovators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is Malicious, and tends to expose that People to <hi>Persecution,</hi> and is unjustly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; for our peaceable deportment on the account of the <hi>outward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (under which we Live) hath been, and is well known to be such, as our Opposer is not able to disprove; neither need we vindicate our selves therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This also is not only Malitions but Absurd: As if because <hi>Christ's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Government</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> is <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> in the Conscience, therefore he must have no <hi>visible Ministers</hi> in his Kingdom, no <hi>visible Order or Form of Government</hi> under his Dominion, no <hi>visible Persons</hi> exercised in any outward <hi>Rule, Orders, Laws,</hi> or <hi>Decrees</hi> under his Government; as if all Christ's Ministers, Apostles, Elders, Overseers, Helps, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were appointed by him in his Church, with all the <hi>Instructions, Decrees</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> of the Apostle, setting in order all things that were lacking, doing all things decently and in order, were all Invisible, and nothing outward, Visible or Formal, because Christ's inward and spiritual Government (from whence all these proceeds) is Invisible: We can argue no better then on this kind in our Adversaries distinction of his Christian Quaker from the Apostate and Innovator: Nor deduce a more natural Inference from his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94536:22"/>
opposition against visible Persons being concerned in an outward Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order in the Church of Christ: How doth this kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing also of his consist with that Paper signed in the North by his two hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Friends <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> and them of Party with them; which he says is accounted the Foundation of the seperate Meeting? In which Paper are these Words — <q>

                     <hi>Ellis Hookes,</hi> and the rest, on the Words quoted out of the said Epistle observes thus; (and that very materially to the confuting of our Adversaries great Work, and substance of his whole Book, out of his own Mouth, as that which his Heart sealed to (and made his own subscription) unless he hath been an old dissembler before the Lord, which God will bring to Light, let him clear himself one way or other if he can) <hi>That</hi> W.

Secondly, <hi>To the Counsel which the Lord hath opened for that end par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in</hi> G. Fox. And thirdly, <hi>That</hi> G.

Fourthly, <hi>That God hath afforded these</hi> Helps <hi>and</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>in the</hi> Church <hi>which are not to be despised,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We say, what need <hi>W. Rogers</hi> grant more, then what he hath there subscribed to, to the consuting of the greatest part of his whole Book against Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Instruments in Gods hand concerned therein, and against the outward Methods and Rules that he calls <hi>G. Fox'</hi>s Orders, in the 86 Page of his First Part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94536:24"/>And if <hi>W. Roger's</hi> object and say, as he seems to do in his 4th part, page 93. <hi>That there are some new</hi> Prescriptions, <hi>which he cannot imbrace for Conscience sake,</hi> which <hi>G. Fox</hi> is accounted either the Author of, or the Countenancer thereof.</p>
                  <p>Yet however <hi>W. Rogers</hi> produceth none of these new Prescriptions or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods set up and imposed by <hi>G. Fox,</hi> as the aforesaid Authors of the Book subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Ellis Hooks</hi> well observed; with other contradictions between <hi>W. Rogers,</hi> and his Friend <hi>J. Story,</hi> relating to this matter; to which Book we refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as worth his observing: <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> also confessed to a Friend in West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland (which we hope he hath not forgot, if he have, we can help his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therein, by the circumstances relating to the time and place where) <hi>That he had read over</hi> George Fox'<hi>s Paper of Directions</hi> (meaning that which tended to <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> in the Church of God) <hi>and Testified that they were all very honest and good things, and useful to be put in practice;</hi> or words to that very purpose.</p>
                  <p>So then, in short, this is the sum of this matter, that there was a time when <hi>W. Rogers,</hi> according to the aforesaid subscribed Paper, amongst his Brethren, owned <hi>Church Care</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> in subjection to the Power, and the necessary Counsel and Advice therein, as <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Governments</hi> subservient to the Rule and Law of the Spirit, and that <hi>G. Fox</hi> was one in whom most especially the Lord had opened Counsel for that concern, and that he was a dear <hi>Brother</hi> and saithful <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>John Story</hi> confesseth <hi>that Instructions and Rules may be given orth, commending them to the</hi> Church, <hi>and to Gods leading</hi> Grace, <hi>to be made use of as God shall Direct:</hi> And <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> consessed, <hi>that the Instructions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for that end given forth by</hi> George Fox <hi>were all very good and useful:</hi> What is the matter then of all this clutter that's made by <hi>W. R.</hi> against care in the <hi>Church, G. Fox</hi> his Directions given forth, owned by Friends in their Meetings through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole <hi>Nation?</hi> and what is the meaning of <hi>J. Stories</hi> and <hi>J. Wilkinsons</hi> silence under all this ado, from shewing as publickly their dislike thereof, as <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rogers</hi> appears to applaud them, and take them in his quarrelsom conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Work, that he thus with his Inconsistances and Confusion gravels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in?

Hath not a Record dwelt upon your Hearts in in the Spirit of Life, that the Lord hath been with him in this matter? Have you not had an answer in your Consciences (unto which he hath ever appealed for a Witness there) that the Instructions and Directions, with respect to Church order, and the Discipline thereof, hath been commended to you in the Spirit of Truth, as the Lord might direct to be put in practice amongst you?

                     </gap> the Spirit of Truth in your selves sealing to that eternal power that hath been upon him, and other dear Brethren in the matter thereof? Have you felt any straitness upon your Spirits, or want of freedom in the Lord (when you kept to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) to be concerned in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> according to the order, growth and place in the Truth, whereinto the Lord hath brought you? Have you not felt the Blessings of the Eternal God with you, in answering the <hi>Care,</hi> the <hi>Advice,</hi> the <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> of the Brethren in the matters thereof? Are you not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with respect to your own inward Advantage, the furtherance of the Gospel amongst you, and the Truths honourable esteem amongst men through your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, Labours and Travels therein; so that you can say, to Gods praise, your Labour of Love hath not been in vain? We are bold to appeal on this wise unto you in Truths behalf: Have we not a Record in all your Hearts (of you that are saithful to God, and have received of his Spirit) as a cloud of Witnesses in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us, who have set our Signets thereunto? Deal ingeniously with us, as in the Lords sight in this matter; its integrity to God our Souls delights in, and an evidence in that we crave of all, whether with us or against us, touching the same, however <hi>W. Rogers</hi> renders us, we abhor Flattery, or having mens persons in Admiration any further then the honourable Image of God appears in them, &amp; as their Habitation abides in that to which the honour is due: We leave this matter with you, and before all whom it may concern, where-ever any exercise may fall
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94536:25"/>
in relation thereunto, and as you Hear and Learn of the Eternal God, so Judge and Speak.</p>
                  <p>We might in this place very fitly fall in hand with the many <hi>Accusations, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> and <hi>Slanders</hi> that <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath malitiously (the matter of his Work gives it this Character) devised and raised up against <hi>G. Fox,</hi> through his perversions and inferences that he hath put on his innocent clear sence, and Christian Exercise about matters he was concerned in, from which he deduceth very wicked and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid charges against him, in that old Cainish Spirit, in which he would utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy his Repute, if it were in his power, before all; the fallacy whereof we doubt not but detect in the considerable matters thereof, to the satisfaction, we hope, of all the innocent where this may come.</p>
                  <p>Yet we chuse first to give a true and sincere Relation of the many grievous &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable Exercises that the <hi>Church of God</hi> in Mestmoreland hath met withall, more or less, for the space of six or seven Years, or upwards, through this Spirit which secretly hath wrought in too many, to draw them from the first Love and ancient regard to <hi>God</hi> &amp; his <hi>Truth,</hi> into a kind of libertine loose sort of <hi>Life,</hi> animated and strengthened, we dare boldly say (though with grief) by <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson;</hi> who having declined their antient regard to that Eternal Power and Innocent Life in which once they were truly concerned for God amongst his People, and leaning upon the Wisdom that is from below, in the mans part, and not rightly discerning the things of God, became darkned in their Minds, and in that state discouragers of the antient Zeal for Truth, and the honorable Testimonies born therein amongst the Faithful, to the gratifying a People backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Lord and the holy way of Truth, whereupon we have livingly seen (and some have warned them of it) the Lord withdrawing of his good Spirit, by little and little, from them, (as he did from <hi>Israel</hi> of old, whose Backslidings he would have healed, but they regarded not, but hardened their Hearts more and more to their Irrecoverable Ruin) in which declining state they became the wounding of their own Souls, and the piercing the sides of many of the weaker sort, to the Churches grief.</p>
                  <p>We also, together with the concern on this wise, shall manifest to all what care was used in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and with several in particular, for the preservation of these two men, the principal abettors of the dividing Spirit, with tenderness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, with desires and travels both in Soul and Spirit, and in many bodily labours in relation to them, with many cntreaties for, and patient waitings over them, that if possible they might be saved. The Contest and Exercise in relation to it, broke forth first in the <hi>North</hi> through them: <hi>William Rogers</hi> (that we know of) was not at first so early concerned in the matter of the aforesaid contentious Work, but became an espouser of it to himself, on their behalfs, being a man of an arragant Spirit, and appeared to love, being popular, and in the height and restlesness of his mind undertook the work that the Lord blessed him not in; but being drawn aside from the simplicity of the Gospel, to abet a wrong Spirit in himself, and others of the loose sort, is become the Evil-man and Seducer, that grows worse and worse, heaping up Damnation to himself that slumbers not.</p>

                  <p>It was not only our frqeuent course, in the time of our Exercises with them, after they began to set themselves against several Practices used amongst us, to signifie our discontent for their so doing, because of the obstruction they laid in our way in the service of Truth, desiring their for bearance on that wise, and compliance with us in the Churches concerns; and God is our Witness it was in true respect, in which we could have preferred them as such whom we once accounted our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Brethren, their weaknesses we could have hid, and looked over for their sakes, and the Churches Peace; and in that Exercise we have gone from our Meetings many of us, very frequently, with sorrowful bowed down Hearts, considering what hurt to many simple Minds, who had eyed them for their Gifts sake, the prevailing of that Spirit over them would produce; what dammage it would be to their own Souls, to the loosing their Crown and perpetual Peace; what a Feast it would be to our open Enemies, and an occasion for them to clap their hands for Joy to hear of Divisions amongst us; what a grateful thing it would be, to the loose and earthly minded amongst us, to the hardening of them against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs and Judgments of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> in their Exercises in the affairs thereof; and what a weakening of the feeble Knees of such as in a measure of true Love to

God and his Truth, were steping into the way thereof; all these things, and many more, with sadness of heart, entered our thoughts and consideration, in many crys to God, to block up the way of this dividing and soul devouring Spirit; yea, often we admired how Blindness entered them, that they did not see how the Loose and Disobedient hung upon them for shelter, from the Inspection, Reproof and Judgment of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> which they were often minded of, and yet would not regard; verified was the saying upon them — <hi>There are none so blind as those who will not see</hi> — Thus were we concerned on their behalf in Long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Patience many Months, and some Years; some laboured to cover them until they became their shame, our Exercises and Sufferings sustained by them, and the wrong done to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and the offence to his <hi>People,</hi> was so open and publick among us, by their means, that the Exhortations and tender Reproofs upon <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> and them of party with them, were so publick also, that with respect to orderly dealing with them, Friends were clear on that score; if any breach of order was, it was on their parts that went privately insinuating into the minds of the weaker sort, to work a dislike of, and a disrespect to the Churches care, the Discipline and Order established throughout the Nation; and would not concern themselves with our Antient, Honorable and Elder Brethren in the matter thereof; who had been Instruments in Gods hands for settling the Churches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and from our Brethren at <hi>London</hi> many good Exhortations and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we had received on account thereof; we often desired them that is any discontent was in their minds upon the account of any Practice, that we were desirous or concerned to promote, that they would be pleased to let the hearing thereof be referred to our Friends and Brethren of our general Meetings, in order to a determination thereof, which they would not be perswaded too; neither did they after their opposition begun come there, or concern themselves therewith.</p>
                  <p>Now besides these publick concerns amongst us in the <hi>North,</hi> occasioned through the means of these two men, together with their adherents that joyned with them, <hi>J.

                     </gap> he please: Was he not told what a danger he was running himself into, through the straitness that he had let in upon him against the practice of the Church in the Discipline thereof, which through evil Surmisings and groundless Jealousies had prevailed upon him, wherein he was not only a discourager of the tender hearted, in relation to their concerns in the care and order of the Gospel; but an encourager of a loose sort, that were gratified thereby, and emboldned to make Opposition, and work Strife? Was he not also told that there was upon that Friends Heart, and many more, a sence of the decay of Life, and the fresh power of God, in their publick Preaching and Testimony for Truth, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had accompanied <hi>John Story</hi> and him, and that into the Letter and Wisdom of the Flesh, their ministerial Exercise was of late Years much what turned to the trouble of many? so that the pure Wisdom being withdrawn, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, they were darkned as to the knowledg of the sufficiency of that Grace which

preserved pure to God in his Service, and to his Praise, all that keep to it in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Exercise they were concerned, and on that account had the groundless Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies risen, and wrought them into a fear of that, to enter amongst us, on the account of Order and Discipline in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> which he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> could never do on that occasion, as Friends kept to the Power and Grace of God, where no Apostacy could every prevail. <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> may remember how his Heart was broken then into many Tears without a word of reply in opposition to what was said on that account: And we do testifie that the Opposition that hath been in the Church, hath not been from a real fear of a going back into the Apostacy again, through the Churches being settled in Order, and under a Government in the Family of God; but a wrong loose backsliding Spirit from the Power and Life of Truth, that would be at Liberty from under the Yoke thereof, pretended a fear of settling of Forms and visible Order amongst Gods People, to be the way to introduce the Apostacy again, that on that account it may slight and reject the same, to have its Liberty in that which the Truth and the pure Gospel doth condemn: But to go on, let <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> be asked, whether he was not desired to go to <hi>London,</hi> to discourse these matters amongst the Brethren there, by reason whereof his and others Discontent and Straitness had risen (which would work them under into Misery and Ruin as to Truth (it was told him) if they were not aware) that if possibly amongst the many Brethren there, satisfaction might be given him, as to any matter which he scrupled: Many ontreaties there were (we have cause to believe) on that wise, yet none could prevail with him to make him willing to go: Yet notwithstanding in a tender broken frame of Spirit at that time was he subjected through that eternal Power, that was over all, in which the Discourse ended, and they parted asunder.</p>
                  <p>Little did our Friends and Brethren at <hi>London</hi> think that things were working thus in the <hi>North,</hi> amongst the ancient Brethren, where Gods Power and blessed Gospel had gloriously broken forth, and been received and testified to, and loath were the Innocent to divulge it there or else-where, for the Unities sake, which is a precious thing amongst Brethren; and to have had matters composed amongst our selves in <hi>Westmerland</hi> was our desire, and our hopes as yet failed not, and the more because of that tenderness, and bowed sence, <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> was wrought into, which for a time did continue with him, to the glading of Friends on his and the Churches behalf; and although the Brethren at <hi>London</hi> had had some little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of these things amongst us, yet they also under an hope that matters in time would be allayed amongst us, were not enclined to make any publick concern thereof; therefore nothing, unless in private, was said or done in relation to it, which was then but as a Spark, with respect to the Flame of the Exercise it wrought in the Church more generally afterwards, through them betrayed into that Spirit that would work mischief if it could get entrance any way: But to go on, in short, with the concerns in the <hi>North</hi> with these two men, as them on whom here the dependency of those hung, who to work Distraction and Trouble among Friends were set at work: It fell out that <hi>John Story</hi> (who had been in the <hi>South</hi>

and Grief, because of our Gospel concerns, having encouraged himself, with those who were entred into Faction with him, where his Travel and Work had been, he set a work to drive all before him, discouraged the concern and tender practice of Friends in relation to Testimony against Tythes, &amp; judged the recording Condemnations, with the Repentance of such as had been out of the way of Truth, to the open blemish thereof; judged the Paper in relation to Womans Meetings, which <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> (as said before) with many more had subscribed encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to, some of whom he afterwards brought off to abet his Design and Work; so that Friends Books were to have been altered according to his motion; but that being stopt, one of Party with him (and a princiqal Stickler and Preacher amongst them, but since quite turned out) tore his Condemnation for being Married with a Priest out of the Book, and such work as this he occasioned amongst us; and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> turned his back-side of that tenderness that had been upon him, and became with him a resolved man to stand it out; several Friends had a private Meeting with him in <hi>Kendal,</hi> to have done him good, occasioned through <hi>George Fox'</hi>s means; but he shewed himself an angry perverse man: When Friends tenderly asked him whether such or such things were true, which he had said or done, as was repeated, in relation to a manifest mark of his being departed from the Life of Truth to oppose the order thereof; in order whereunto Friends desire was to have dealt with him as a Brother, and an Antient amongst us, and the brokenness that was on Friends in their Exercise with him testified the same, and the Bowels that earned towards him that day would have broken many Hearts; yet in a wilful, stubborn, disquieted frame, and indisposure by reason thereof, he broke away very aburtly, and unchristian-like, treading upon his Brethrens Care and Good-will towards him, telling them, <hi>That he would stand upon his own Legs, and not be beholden to them for their Curtches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> being grieved, and his Spirit much discomposed, writ a Letter to one of us, which he called, <hi>The Word of the Lord,</hi> (and by his order to be shewn to many Brethren) full of enveighing Language, such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not a Minister and Servant of Christ to his fellow Servants; telling us, <hi>That we had begged Authority from others, to make our selves work withal, and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionated. to act therein, to get favour of Persons, or an Office, or a piece of Bread, and was puffed up therein;</hi> and then places this Judgment upon us and our work, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That our Office would cloath us with Raggs, and that Worms would breed in our gathering, and that our Bread should consume;</hi> with this final Sentence upon us, <hi>That the Lord would break us.</hi> The Friend to whom this was directed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to others, writ privately to him, before he shewed it to any, and desired him to take it back again and consider better of it, otherwise it would be his shame, &amp; tend to his great dammage many ways; but nothing would serve him, but that it must be delivered: [Mark the end of it] So that it plainly appeared they were resolved to try their strength with that which proves too strong for them.</p>
                  <p>After a while, at the request of some of our ancient Brethren, and sincere to God, who had private knowledg of the difference amongst us, it being also our inclination, a Meeting was had with them of that Spirit, <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> being amongst us, we being desired also to have with us other three Neighbouring Friends, who had been true and faithful to God from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, never detected upon any account, who being come, and set amongst us,

they also being privy to the Transactions amongst us; <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinson</hi> shewed their dislike of having them with us, and resolved not to concern themselves with any discourse relating to the matter, unless the said Friends would with-drew; but those Friends having a sincere Exercise in the motion of God, as by them it was signified to us, durst not with draw upon the motion of that wrong Spirit, being otherwise preswaded in their Hearts, consistant also with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Brethrens request, as also comfortably agreeable with the sence and desire of the sincere hearted, and truly sensible of that Spirit's opposite work amongst us; whereupon <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> with-drew any further concern in the matter, and took a party of the dark sort after them; so that after a while the Meeting ended, without any effectual work relating to an Agreement and Peace amongst us: The Spirit of Contention prevailing in them, animated also through the Adherents <hi>John Story</hi> had wrought into the Strise with them in the <hi>South,</hi> (where his and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> Travels had sometimes been) such as they had stampt their Image upon, and that readily complyed with them against the Unity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And now our Friends and Brethren at <hi>London</hi> having a certain knowledg that the Difference in the <hi>North</hi> was come to be such, as that it appeared to grow higher, rather then an end thereof was like to be suddenly composed, they writ to Friends, and desired that we would appoint a Meeting on purpose with <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> amongst our selves only, to see if vve could yet so order the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (by information to such as vvere out of the vvay) that if possible an end of all Differences whatsoever amongst us might be made, without any further trouble to the <hi>Churches,</hi> and if at that Meeting there was not a determination concluded amongst us, we might afterwards appoint another Meeting for the same end, and take to our assistance therein some faithful Brethren of other Countries, that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might be heard before them, who had personally been uuconcerned with the Exercise amongst us, and this they judged might be orderly and seasonable, because that they of us, who where not of party with <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> &amp;c. were rendred in many parts of the Nation, by their means to be in the wrong, and condemnable, and not they.</p>
                  <p>A Meeting amongst our selves was first agreed upon to be at the <hi>Draw-Well</hi> in <hi>Sedbergh Yorkshire,</hi> at the House of <hi>John Blaykling,</hi> and Friends being come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and the Meeting set, after a while <hi>John Story</hi> (and some of party with him) asked, <hi>What we had in Writing against him and</hi> John Wilkinson: it was replyed, That it was not our desire or purpose to exhibite matters of charge one against an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in Writing, if it could be avoided (for we desired no memorial of any thing of that tendency to remain) we were there met amicably, as became Gods People, to discourse of matters in which we were not at one amongst our selves, by reason of which, grievous Exercises and Divisions had been amongst us, to the grief of the Innocent and Upright to God; and we desired that things might be fairly spoken of, that so we might come (through Gods help) to have a right understanding of one another, that if possible the occasion of Differences might be removed, and the ancient Unity might arise again, and remain with us to our Comfort and Truths Praise: But notwithstanding, they said, <hi>That they would not concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with any discourse of that nature with us, unless every thing to be discoursed upon were put in Writing:</hi> We shewed our dislike thereof at present, and desired that we might speak of things, to see what could be done on that wise first, and then, if nothing were done this way, as to satisfaction to us, against the next Meeting it might be considered upon vvhich method to take, or Words to that purpose: But the conclusion on their parts vvas, no discourse to be, unless vvhat vve had to say against them vvere put in Writing: We instanced some things that vve vvere dissatisfied vvith, vvhich they had spoken in opposition to the Churches Concerns in the order thereof, vvhich had been a great block in our vvay in the Work of God, such and such passages had happened concerning them, and such things done by them, as vvas the Churches Grief and occasioned the breach of its Peace; but nothing vvould they concern themselves vvith, because they vvere not put in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; only in some casual discourse amongst us, at that time such Words came from them as gave great dissatisfaction to many there, to the breaking their Hearts into Tears, through a Testimony from God against them; they reflected upon our Meetings, to be Formal, and not Gospel-like, being constantly kept in the freedom of Gods Truth, to be ready to attend Friends Concerns, vvhen, or of vvhat sort soever they might be; they called our Practices therein, <hi>Ceremonies brought into the Churches;</hi> as they have often called them, <hi>Mens Prescriptions, other mens Lines made ready to our Hands, Dictates of fallible men,</hi> and the like: And when all was done, nothing did appear to us, and many more there present, of tender inclination in them to Reconciliation and Peace in any Gospel-Way; and so we seeing clearly, that they were resolved in relation to hearing of Matters, to have all written down that must be spoken to: We let them know that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Brethrens desire, another Meeting was intended by us to be had with them, with the assistance of some other Brethren of other Countries with us; and then although it should be our last expedient, we intended, God willing, to write down several things with respect to the Opposition made by them in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> to the Order and Practice used amongst us therein, and this was the issue of that days Meeting; and let the Upright, and the Lovers of Peace amongst Gods People consider, whether this Spirit of theirs, which is acted on this wise, be that which is pure, peaceable and easie to be entreated; which through the Exercise of our next Meeting in relation to them and their work will be more plainly discerned; a faithful account whereof we intend through Gods help to give.</p>

                  <p>The Meeting gathered at <hi>Pow-Bank</hi> aforesaid, and many good Friends there, with them also of other Countries (agreed upon to be with us, as the Lord made way) <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> came not, but only sent a Paper of slight and disregard of Friends weighty concern in relation thereunto, alledging, <hi>That at the Meeting at</hi> Draw-Well <hi>we had no matter in charge against them in Writing,</hi> which in Truth and Righteousness was no plea for their absenting now, because we told them, how unwilling we were to appear on that wise, if it could be avoided, and an end put to things without it; but seeing they said they would not take any notice of any thing we would say, unless it were writ, we told them then, before the breaking up of the Meeting, that we would do it at our next Meeting which we were to have with them by the advise of our Brethren, seeing nothing would be effected there that day; we told them also, we did believe forty matters would be brought against them, to manifest their Opposition; and <hi>John Story</hi> replyed, <hi>You must prove them;</hi> it was answered, he need not question that, for it was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and several things we told them then by word of Mouth, when together, in order to the proof that should be made thereof: They alledged also in the said Paper, <hi>That they told us at that Meeting, that they intended to meet no more about such matters;</hi> the truth of which we own not, for we cannot hear that any one of all the Meeting heard any such Words amongst us, and if any thing of that nature was spoken, vve believe it vvas privately to some after the Meeting broke up, upon their jealousie hovv things vvould go. All vvhich signifies nothing but meer Deceipt, and an absolute unvvillingness to come to Tryal at all, as aftervvards vvill be more clearly manifested; alledging also, <hi>That if they had been clear of the purpose of giving no more Meetings, they did not find themselves obliged to take notice of our sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning of them, who were both Accusers and Witnesses, and chose the Judges:</hi> Which is all impertinent and silly Discourse, seeing the Persons chosen vvere chosen by the agreement of the Quarterly Meeting, long before they separated from us, and they might have been there (as usually they vvere vvont to do) if they had not at that time absented on purpose; and vvhat vve did vvas also in persuance of the Brethrens request from <hi>London;</hi> and to object against the Witnesses, vvas not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

them to absent upon: But to proceed, the Exercise that the Friends (chosen for to hear and examine matters, in order to give their Sence and Judgment as they found the Case) had that day, and the day following at <hi>Milnethorpe,</hi> a Meeting being there appointed for that end, we shall refer the knowledge thereof to what hereafter follows, as an abstract taken out of the former part of their own Paper, to which their Sence and Judgment is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Meeting, had there fairly writ down several matters in charge against them, which they gave to the Friends there; which (notwithstanding the two <hi>John'</hi>s abstance, in contempt of the Churches Order and Care) they the aforesaid Friends, chosen by the Quarterly Meeting, could not but take notice of, it being the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> taking notice also what proof could be made thereof: which said matters alledged in charge related to prove, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> had opposed our Monthly and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meetings, with reflecting words against them, calling them <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Sessions,</hi> and of our Citing into them, and the like.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That they had disorderly and irreverently judged Friends tender Exercises in breaking forth in Mellodious Singings and Soundings to Gods praise, in their Meetings, under the exercise of the power which breaks and fills the Heart, out of the abundance whereof breaks forth Sighs and Groans, and Spiritual Songs, as the Lord is pleased to exercise them that waits upon him.</p>

words to that purpose; but they refused to go on that score, they proffered only to refer the hearing of the matter to two men chosen by each Party one, and that, in relation to that, they might have a Coppy of the Charges; but Friends seeing that it was not only a disorderly thing in them to absent themselves from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Meeting, appointed by the Quarterly Meeting, but also to make such a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as that, in opposition to Friends care and endeavours amongst them for Peace, as their travels and seeking of them did imply: Friends refused (as in all reason they ought to have done) to take any notice thereof; yet told them, <hi>They should have a Coppy of the Charges at the Meeting if they would go, if when they were read they desired the same, to make their defence the better, and they should have time also if there was need for it:</hi> But go they would not, as they had resolved, and said, <hi>That they would come at no more Meetings upon such matters:</hi> But poor men they forgot that, or else mattered not what they had said on that wise, for they offered to refer the matter to two, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is not Truth-like, Orderly or Discreet, in the case of Gods Truth, many Brethrens Testimony and Concern, and the Churches Peace: The Friends proffered to read them the matters in charge against them if they pleased, as in the aforesaid Paper is expressed; but they refused to hear the same: Now let all sober and discreet men, that fear God, consider what this Spirit is, whether it be not the same as was said of it before, not Pure, not Peaceable, nor easie to be Entreated; but Wilful, Stubborn and leading to Strife, and to work Distractions in the <hi>Church of God;</hi> it is evidently seen to have had a design: But blessed be the Lord its way is blockt up, it hath done its worst there, its turned out now too, amongst the Gainsayers, to get an entrance amongst them that are in the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and Rebellious to the Truth's Life, and there it makes a Clutter and Noise as the Wind, which the Lord weighs as a little thing, and its passing away, that Truth may Reign, and take the Dominion over all for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Here follows that part of the Paper given forth at <hi>Milnerhorp,</hi> in relation to the opposite Spirit against Friends Practices in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> which demonstrates the sence of the aforesaid Brethren, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>It may be observed also, that besides some Letters tending to Peace, that <hi>George Fox</hi> writ to them from <hi>Swarthmoore,</hi> where he was about this time weak in Body, he sent to them also to desire them to come over to him there, for he had a desiro to speak with them about the matter of Difference amongst Friends in <hi>Westmerland;</hi> he was neither of ability to come to them, nor to the Meeting at <hi>Pow-Bank;</hi> but they did not take any notice thereof, nor went to him, though we are fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that what he did was in his tender care for their Preservation and the Churches Peace; but this <hi>William Rogers</hi> (our present Adversary) accounts in <hi>George Fox</hi> Ambition, in his sending for them, but where the Stoutness and Ambition was its easily seen, for the time was when they would have gone much further, when they were Poor and Low in their own Eyes; but now being Full and Rich in their own Esteem, thinking they want for nothing, will not step out of their way, nor turn aside for Truth, nor the unity therein, because of the Ambition they are filled with; and therefore will the Lord scatter them with all the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of their corrupt Hearts: And instead of giving the Friends a Meeting as aforesaid, they put an evading slighty Answer to the Charges against them, and sent it abroad amongst those they hoped to make of party with them; which with a large Answer thereunto is ready to be seen, when a further occasion by <hi>William Rogers,</hi> or any of them is given.</p>
                  <p>And not withstanding all this care and tender respect used, and reached out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, they still heardened their Hearts against the Lord, and the fellowship of Brethren in the Churches concerns, stuck to the loose and unfaithful ones, as was said before, and grew more and more opposite to Friends in their Exercise for Truth, and sit in the Confederacy that was hatched amongst themselves, and the design laid to break off from Friends, into an open Seperation they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and up and down the Nation was the cry amongst those of party with them, (from an unchristian mis-representing of things by them here in the <hi>North) That a Judgment was out against them, without hearing, upon the evidence of Persons being both the Accusers and Witnesses;</hi> of which, as the matter is in short truly stated, according to the Circumstances relating to it, we desire the honest and impartial Reader to judge, Whether the Persons before mentioned are justified in the sight of God, the order of the Gospel, and amongst Gods People, according to the rule of Truth, in the aforesaid matter and transactions relating to them? Or whether they are manifested by their doings to have the pure peaceable Spirit that is easily entreated, and that they have upon them any design for the Churches Peace? Or whether they are not the Self-Willed, the Heady and High-Minded, who have the Form of Words only, without the Power, (that unites and knits together) and whether to work Distractions in the peaceable Family of God their design be not laid? And whether their plea for their not receiving dear Brethrens Advice and Care over them, and orderly proceedings to have done them right every way (if

they could have manifested the contrary) and their obstinately absenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Meeting aforesaid on any such account, be not a very ridiculous thing amongst men, and not worth taking notice of?

of hearing matters relating to us on the score of being culpable as well as they (as we had been rendred up and down the Nation by them of that Spirit) and having also a sence of the continuation of the Exercise and Sorrow that we were yet likely to be exposed to, through the separate Meeting, to the blemish of Truth, and our holy Profession. Its true we did signifie our inclination, yea our desires, that on some or all the aforesaid accounts our dear and respected Brethren might have under their tender consideration our continuing Exercises through the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and obstinacy of that wrong Spirit amongst us, which as yet was likely further to occasion the Churches Trouble, and the want of its Peace, and for that end we moved (if they pleased) that some might come down into the <hi>North,</hi> for their and others further satisfaction, if they desired, or saw cause for a further examination and hearing of matters relating to the depending Difference.</p>
                  <p>In order unto which Meeting (agreed upon at <hi>London</hi> amongst our Friends there) they signified unto us what was intended, God willing to be done by them, if all concerned would signifie their free and acceptable complyance therewith; in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer whereunto, Friends in the <hi>North</hi> signified, by a Paper under many Hands, a free and ready closing therewith, unto the Meetings satisfaction there, as in an answer to ours from them was signified: It may be noted also that the Brethrens tenderness towards <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> was such, they being then both in the <hi>West</hi> parts, as also that they might the more readily be perswaded to submit to an hearing of matters and things relating to the Difference with Friends here in the <hi>North</hi> Face to Face, which formerly they had refused to do, in a resolve to come at no more Meetings on that score; but that they again a little retracted that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, and proffered, as aforesaid, to refer the matter to two chosen, by each party one: We say the afore-mentioned Friends, being iealous whether they would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a Meeting or not, for condescention sake gave the Friends at <hi>Bristol</hi> liberty to chuse two, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where <hi>John Story</hi> s and <hi>John Wilkinson'</hi>s great Interest (as was then expected) stood; and in persuance of the aforesaid agreement amongst Friends, at <hi>James Claypool's London,</hi> two Letters were writ, Coppies whereof we have not inserted here, but are produceable, with many more material Letters of Advice, Answers and Replies, in Papers and Books in Maniscript, Material and Satisfactory, in order to the concern of a more large Hystorical Relation of matters on the account of the unhappy Differences, occasioned through this ungodly Spirit, as the day will declare; which aforesaid Papers and Books in Maniscript are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served ready for the service of Truth, against the coming forth in Print of <hi>William Rogers</hi> s Book in Maniscript, so often made mention of by him, or upon what other occasion (as the Lord may direct) shall be seen meet, with respect to all which this our present Relation of things may be taken only as a small, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and impartial Abstract.</p>
                  <p>Yet upon the matter of the two Letters being sent as aforesaid, the one to <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi> and the other to the Friends at <hi>Bristol; William Rogers</hi> happening to be one for the Journey into the <hi>North,</hi> on the aforesaid account, (without whose Company and Assistance 'tis likely <hi>John Story</hi> had not been prevailed upon to have come) being a man of a Turbulent Boysterous Spirit, and one that likes the Applause of men, and loves Preheminence, as in his quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling contentious Work, in the Ambition and Stoutneses of his Mind, in several Papers and Concerns observable, he hath manifested himself to be, as many Ear and Eye Witnesses will Evidence, to which also some of us are not Strangers, with

                           <p>And after that the endeavours of the faithful Friends of the Quarterly Meeting of those parts, both within themselves, and by calling in to their assistance several faithful Men of adjacent Countries, proved not so effectual as was desired, by reason of the said <hi>John Story'</hi>s and <hi>John Welkinsons</hi> absenting themselves, though in much tenderness sought to, and entreated to appear by those chosen Brethren, for the Churches Peace sake and their own real good in the Lord, and though their refusal to meet those Brethren, and denial of their Authority to examine the matter in difference, and theirs that nominated and chose them, to wit the faithful Friends of the Quarterly Meeting; yet out of a deep sence of the Burden of honest Friends in those parts, by reason of the Division, and forefeeing the ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> of leaving such an example uncensured, they passed a general Judgment upon that Spirit which led into Division and Separation, leaving the said <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> to clear themselves, if they could, of such matters of fact (as they then stood charged with, as they have plainly signified both by Word and Writing) but since a dissatisfaction remaineth in the minds of several, in some because of so proceeding against <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> and in others because of their going to offer their Gift abroad whilst unreconciled at home: And forasmuch as the Friends formerly concerned against these men upon an Information given them of the said dislike of several Friends about these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94536:41"/>
the 3d. of the 2d. Month 1676. and continued until the 7th. of the same, whither resorted several antient and honourable Brethren not particularly nominated, that had nevertheless a Concern in their Consciences, a Travel in their Spirits, and a Testimony to the antient Unity.</p>
                           <p>In which Assembly the Matters in Controversie were read, and the Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of both Parties called; and upon the whole Examination of their Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Evidences, we did find, and therefore declare, both from external Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and our own inward Sence; that <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> were really Faulty in the most material things exhibited in Charge against them; to wit, that they have been discouragers of and opposers to the present blessed Order, and Practice of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> with respect to monthly and quarterly Meetings, Womens Meetings especially in the Country, recording Condemnations, weakening the Hands of Friends in their Testimonies about Tythes; and justifying the manner of Friends Meeting about <hi>Preston</hi> in the time of the late Act: And to us it plainly appeared, that a wrong dividing Spirit hath entered, and the Enemy of the Churches holy Union and Peace hath been at work in them, by which they have grieved the Church of God, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in those Parts; and encouraged the late Separation made in those Parts from the antient and faithful Friends and Brethren of the monthly and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meeting; which Spirit, wherever it appears, or hath brancht forth it self; in the Name and Power of Almighty God, whose Councel was and is with us, we do reprove, condemn and judg. But so it was, that after four days deep Travel, unwearied Patience, tender Bowels of Mercy, and a mighty and manifest Operation of the glorious Power of the Lord, as in frequent Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies against that Spirit of Division, and in the Visitation of true and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Love to them; so in many strong Cries and heart-breaking Supplications to the God of our bowed Spirits for a prosperous Issue.</p>
                           <p>It pleased the Lord to bow the said <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> into some degree of Submission; So that at length they produced a Paper containing a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation against themselves and that Spirit: And as we do believe and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore testify, that the Door of Gods Mercy is not shut against them; so we earnestly desire, and are not without some Hope, that they may give a more compleat Satisfaction in time (as <hi>John Story</hi> said he would as the Lord should give him a further Understanding) that Truth and Friends may be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually cleared, and that it may be well with them for ever.</p>
                           <p>And for as much as the Friends and Brethren of <hi>Westmorland,</hi> who have been concerned against <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> did formerly freely offer that if in any thing charged they had mistaken or exceeded, they would endeavour to make them such Satisfaction as Truth required: We finding two or three Particulars of lesser Moment, wherein there appeared some Oversight and Shortness, as to orderly Proceeding, the two Friends concerned therein, did freely acknowledg it according to Truth; and more particularly as to that Passage alledged against <hi>John Story, That Women had nothing to do with the Essential part of the Worship of God,</hi> because it was charged but by one Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <p>And further, we hold our selves in Conscience obliged to commend the Care, Travel and Zeal of the Friends of these Northern Parts in the Affairs of the Church for settlement of Godly Order: We have a real Sence of their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and labouring therein for the Lord his Truth and People.</p>
                           <p>And now Friends in Gods Love, we desire you to suppress all Papers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie relating to this Difference, that the Minds of Friends be not farther troubled, nor any defiled, nor this Controversie kept any longer alive; but that all may sink down into the simple Truth, and in that feel the pure and sweet Union, which being lived in preserves out of those Doubts, Distrusts, Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, carnal Reasonings, and evil Watchings, that harm the immortal Soul; and in that pure Fellowship all are cheerful, tender, and open-hearted, full of Love and Brotherly-kindness, watching over one another for Good; in which the Lord God Almighty establish us for ever.</p>
                           <p>And we do hereby warn all to have a care, that they be not lifted up by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Temptation and Hurt that's come upon these Men; nor yet insult over them for that Spirit is not of God) but rather let all watch in the Fear and Dread of Almighty God against that Spirit, that they enter not into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                           <p>Thus, Friends, have we given you a brief and faithful Narrative of what hath past in these four days of great Exercise, in which the Lord gave us blessed Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the sensible Enjoyment of that Life which was before the World began; pure Praises, pure Honour, and eternal Glory and Renown, be to his own Right noble Arm that never failed his distressed, bowed and travelling People through all Generations.</p>

                  <p>And in this was the honest-hearted to God truly comforted (whatever the Issue of Matters would be, with respect to those entangled in the Snare of a guileful Spirit) that it was well with them, in that they had a certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Peace and Blessings of God into their Bosoms; who had aceompanied them with his glorious Power, and over-shaddowed their Exercise therewith, to their Hearts Joy, and to the causing of them to give God the Praise, who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for ever; and in the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit, upon the 5<hi>th.</hi> day of that Exercise Friends parted asunder, being the 7<hi>th.</hi> day of the Week. Several of our travelling Brethren stayed some days in the Country amongst Friends, and had several blessed Meetings here-aways in a Travel upon their Spirits, during their abode in the Country, for the Churches Peace, and the Return of the stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones, and giving up the whole Concern to Almighty God, and to the Word of his Power, who alone gives the Encrease of all planting and watering, and spiritual Exercises on every Account, God over all in Heaven and Earth, blessed for ever.</p>
                  <p>In many particular Exercises, that the aforesaid Friends had with <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> and them of Party with them, they were very desirous that they would break up again their separate Meeting, as that which they testified against; which also God would never bless.</p>
                  <p>There was that measure of Love and Tenderness raised up in <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> in the aforesaid Meeting, that they took an Occasion to go to <hi>George Fox</hi> then at <hi>Swathmoore,</hi> who, we perceive by good Information, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loving to them, and tender on their behalf, letting them see the Danger they were in if they did not return to the antient Power, in it to become one with Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But upon the matter thus it was, that the separate Meeting they still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; and the Expectations of dear Brethren became frustrated on <hi>John Story'</hi>s and <hi>John Wilkinson'</hi>s account, for any thing that could be observed; for they quickly trampled upon the whole Concern, and Endeavours that had been had with them, and used towards them: <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> presently denyed that they had condemn'd any thing at <hi>Draw-well,</hi> or that they knew of any thing of which they were guilty that was condemnable.</p>
                  <p>At the next yearly Meeting, being about the 3<hi>d.</hi> Month 1676. The Concerns of the Church of God throughout the whole Nation, and of many Countries and Islands beyond the Seas, being under Friends tender Care and great weight of Spirit, the estate of the Church of God in <hi>Westmerland</hi> came before Friends (as some of us were Ear-Witnesses) and an Exercise of Mind was upon them in relation to the Grievances that Gods People in these Parts were still exposed to, through the Spirit of Contention and Strife that had led into Separation from the antient Brethren in the Service of Truth; and the deplorable State also of <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> with them of Party with them they were touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with: In the Consideration of their trampling upon all the tender Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours used towards them at <hi>Draw-well,</hi> in the 2<hi>d.</hi> Month of the same Year, and their obstinate and wilful rejecting the Admonition, the Reproof, the good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Councel of their antient Brethren, in order to a happy Return of them to God again, and into the Unity of the Spirit with the Faithful, in the practice of things relating to the Concerns of Truth, and the Church of God amongst

them: And understanding that the separate Meeting continued still (contrary to the general and particular Advice of the Friends when in the North more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on the account of their Souls Concern tenderly laid before them) to the great danger of their utter undoing, over and besides the Obstruction which that Spirit laboured to make in the way of Truth; with respect to a gathering more unto God, as also the Hurt its Design tended to produce amongst the young and tender not fully established upon the Rock, the Habitation whereupon cannot be shaken: The Brethren with respect to that secret Hope that sprung up in them at <hi>Draw-well</hi> when there, concerning these two men in particular (and on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of others greatly hurt by the same Spirit) that the Lord might have wrought them into a further sight and sence of things, as to their inward (of late Years) deplorable State, and into a tender acknowledgment thereof, under the hand and stroke of Gods Power, to the working of them from the Bondage thereof, that the liberty of the Power in the love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Let God be witness this Day betwixt the Church of God and these two Men, and them of Party with them, whether in the tender Love of God, and of dear Brethren they have not been delt withal in Compassionateness? through great long Suffering and Patience, beseeching them in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Gods manifold Mercies and Forbearances towards them, that they would be reconciled to God, that they might find acceptance with him, as that which was a Soul Concern; yea, the concern of eternal Recompence World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

end, and that which hath been testified in many Labours and Travels, Night and Day on their accounts, and how unwilling Friends were that they should be rejected and cast aside, and their Names blotted out from the remembrance of the Righteous, and out of the Number of the Worthies of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom the Lord Blesseth, and makes as Saviours on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> to his Eternal Praise, and the Comfort of the Church of Christ, and the Peace of the Immortal Soul forever: So that we have a Record from God upon our Spirits in true satisfaction, that we have discharged a good Conscience, in the Lords sight, with respect to them, and that if any of them Perish it shall lie at their Doors, the Lord is clear, and his People thus far clear, let them look to it as they will answer at the dreadful Day.</p>
                  <p>Yet after all these Labours and Travels in the Love of God, and Spirit of Grace and Supplication towards, and in behalf of them, they still continued in the Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from Truths Life, in their separate contentious Work; and the more the Lord and his People strove with them, the more obstinate and hardned they grew, and where the Apostacy, which <hi>William Rogers</hi> is pleased to charge us with, will be seen to center, a little time will declare further.</p>
                  <p>So it was, that (as the evil Men and Seducers that grows worse and worse) they put on resolution and Courage to stand it out, <hi>John Story</hi> betook himself into the <hi>South-West</hi> to keep the Design on Foot there, and to muster up all whom he could draw after him with the Pollicy and Might he had, he set himself, &amp; <hi>William Rogers</hi> ratled about with a dishonest Narrative, that he himself had drawn up, of the Transactions of the Meeting at <hi>Draw-well,</hi> as his prejudiced jealous Mind acted him, and sent it abroad up and down the Country, where any would take notice of it; took off the beliefe or hopes (where any in kindness to <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> had been begot) of any submission given by them, or any real acknowledgement made by them there, notwithstanding the paper they had given forth (and at that time under an exercise, if they had stood to it) which <hi>William Rogers</hi> set at naught, accounting it but a Rattle to please Children with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> also as he had before denied that they had Condemned any thing, writ to some of the Brethren at <hi>London</hi> very comtemptibly, in a slight of all their Love, Labours and Travels concerning them in the <hi>North,</hi> inveighing against the Relation given and subscribed there of matters transacted amongst us, and the product thereof, calling it <hi>a lying Narrative, &amp;c.</hi> And that Courage they took to themselves, and cambined Resolution to stand to their Work, that he, together with about eleaven more, subcribed a Book written by them, and sent it abroad in Manuscript up &amp; down the Nation, amongst those that had entertained Jealousies, and let in Prejudice against the Antient Brethren, who kept true to God, and had let in Murmuring and Discontent against the Order and Discipline used in the <hi>Church of Christ.</hi> The said Book called, or at least rendred to be, their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance or Declaration, pretending therein to stand to the antient Principle of Truth and Faith therein; as also speaking of certain Practices used amongst them: Directed to Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly and Second Days Meetings, in a bold and open Contest with the whole <hi>Church of God</hi> throughout the whole Nation, in which they possitively declare themselves, and those of party with them, to be that part of the whole Family of the Children of Light, that keeps their antient Integrity and Stability in the Truth, and for that cause (say they) are they called, by the rest, <hi>Separates,</hi> (meaning by the Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly and Second
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94536:44"/>
Days Meetings) they are also bold to say, that we, that is to say all those that are in faithfulness to God, careful with respect to Church Order and the Discipline thereof, unto which the aforesaid Meetings relate, and not of party with them, are departed from our first Principle of Light and Life in Christ Jesus, and setting up Forms and outward Methods in the Church, and the like: And for no other cause, we say, it is, that they thus render us, but because we are a People or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly setled as becomes the Family of God, under a Government and Dissipline relating to us, as Men in the Tabernacle God has given us, wherein to be his Praise.</p>
                  <p>In their Book it is Inserted — <hi>No Authority to be used in the Church but the Power</hi> — <hi>Nothing to be set up there but the Spirit of</hi> Jesus. Must there then in the Power and Spirit of <hi>Jesus</hi> be no visible Order or Authority used or placed amongst us as the visible Family of God? This is clear contrary to the Command of. Christ, with respect to the Churches dealing with the offending Brother, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon him if he hear not the Church: This is contrary also to what the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said, who said, <hi>Submit your selves one unto another, and unto them that have the Rule over you, as they that must give account to God, that watcheth over your Souls.</hi> They say in their Book, — <hi>The Gospel that brings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, is inward, and its Order must be inward.</hi> And must there therefore be no Care visible? No visible Inspection? No Discipline visible amongst us? No care over the Weak? Nothing to do visible with the Loose and Scandalous? Nothing to do with the Heretick? <hi>Paul</hi> said otherwise, — <hi>Cast out the Incestuous person.</hi> — <hi>The Heretick after the first and second Admonition Reject.</hi> What will this Doctrine of theirs lead to in the end? but to Stubbornness, and Obstinate Rejection of the Care, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, the Advise, Counsel, Reproof and Judgment; yea, the Authority of the Spirit and Gospel of Christ, in the Saints, to whom Judgment is given, and so lead at last unto Loosness and Ranterisme: Yet when they have made all this Clutter and Bauling against Church Order and Care, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like our present Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <hi>William Rogers,</hi> they consider better again, or else forgets clearly what they said, and tells us what Orders they have had amongst them these twenty Years; and says they use the same still: And so gives a Relation what they do about the Poor, about Marriages, about Condemnations, and the like, though wonderfully deceitful and dishonest in the matter thereof; and talks of things after such a rate and manner, not at all consistant with their Practice, as in the Answer to it is manifested, it would make the Heart sad to see it, and also what abuses they put upon the Church of God, and the tender Practices of Gods People used and practiced amongst us, as our Quarterly Meeting Books will demonstrate; and it may be noted that all this Clamour that's made against the Order, Discipline and Government used in the Power of God, in all the Churches and Assemblies to which their Book of Remonstrance is directed, (to wit, monthly, quaterly, year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and second days morning Meeting, whom also they place a Judgment upon, as departed from their first Principle) and this Cluttering and Exclaming (we say) against these things (as setting up Forms, and outward Rules, and Orders, and the like, and says, <hi>the Gospel is inward, and the Order of it must be so,</hi> and as much as to say, no way else) is made by the very Persons that listed a number of pittiful unfaithful Men, many of them, in a Subscription to such Orders, Rules and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, as the like we have not heard of amongst the Children of God, (to wit) <hi>that none must come and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The aforesaid Manuscript of their Remonstrance we have by us, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, at large, given to it, ready for the view of such as may desire the same, or otherwise to be made use of, as <hi>William Rogers</hi> or any of party with him gives us occasion: Yet before we altogether leave making mention of the aforesaid Manuscript we would give the Reader a little notice of one or two material Pasia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges therein, relating to somthing that their great outcry hath been against the Church of God in the Practice of, and for which the Character of Apostates is given us.</p>
                  <p>First, The Recording of Condemnations for publick Transgressions, which <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> says, <hi>Renders a Man a Knave to Prosterity:</hi> Which Practice we do grant we use (together with the Repentance of such as comes to it) to out live the Memory of the Sin, and thereby to take the Blemish from off the Truth that was cast upon it thereby.</p>
                  <p>The Subscribers of the said Book of Remonstrance say, most slanderously of us, <hi>That when any have done a publick scandalous Evil, upon a few Words writ of their confessing their Fault (though they be not in any measure by Sorrow and Repentance brought to God, and restored to him again) they are right enough again for our Society.</hi> Which we say is an impudent false Aspersion, which they can never prove against us; but we say we deny no Papers given forth, whereby to clear the Truth and our holy Profession, (although the Sin be not repented of, nor Remission come to) and let that go after the Transgression, and remain on Record, as a Testimony for the pure Truth, and the justness of the Judgment of the Lord thereupon, which may also be of Service as a Caution to others in Generations to come, and if the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors do not thus, the Church of God is concerned therein, in a clear denial of any such Transgressions, with a Judgment thereupon, as also of any Fellowship with them found therein, till true Repentance be wrought, and a signal Testimony thereof manifested, and our Records, Practice and Fellowship, will and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the truth hereof.</p>
                  <p>Now a few Words to what they say is their Practice in this matter, inserted in the aforesaid Manuscript: They mention there what a care they have, if any run into Sin, to stir up the Witness of Life in them; and that when any, upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, finds the Mercy of God again arise to them, and that they find the Lords requierings to renew their Peace with him, and clear the Truth, and give out a Paper to tell of his Judgments and Mercies, and leave it upon Record, and publish it to the whole World; such they say are living Testimonies, and they own them, and can with Joy receive such into Fellowship again, but they say they trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Inventions as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:94536:45"/>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> First take notice here is Order and Care visible amongst them, which overturns all their clamoring Work against Order and Government in the Church. And Secondly here is Condemnations to be Recorded to Prosperity, to testifie of Gods Judgments and Mercies, and to clear the Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which grants the matter against themselves, and their trampling upon Records on that account, as the Dung upon the Earth. Yet we ask them, What shall become of the Scandal to Truth in that matter, till such Repentance be wrought, or such a Requiring felt? suppose it never be, as many are never Renewed by Repentance. <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> Preacht that we must wait two Years, nay if it be seven Years. (as hath been Testified by Ear-Witnesses) expecting such a State again, in order to the matter; but not a Word of allowance of any Paper to be received from the Party, if he feel it on him, under Judgment, to go forth to clear the Truth; nor of the Church doing any thing, if the Party will do nothing: Let all consider what regard to Truths sweet Savour and Repute remains among them, who would leave such scandalous things upon the Family of God Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned.</p>
                  <p>But we say, What do they as to Practice in this matter? How many of them that justified flying from their Meeting Houses in time of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>? or of them that let fall their Testimony against the Anrichristian Yoke of Tythes? or of the Drunkards, or Swearers, whom they listed into their consederate Work and Subscription, against the allowed Practices of the Church of God in our Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meetings, and thereby would have limitted the Church of God, as said before, by their Orders and Prescriptions? Which of them, we say (for we have heard of none) in true Brokenness and Repentance have given forth such living Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Lords Judgments and Mercies to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> on Record for clearing of the Truth, before they entered into that Fellowship with them again, in subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing with them? And when did <hi>John Scorife,</hi> who became so hatefully Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, to the grievous reproach of Truth, in the sorrow of his Heart, give forth such a living Testimony against himself and his reproachful Work, and leave a Paper thereof on Record (notwithstanding all the care they say they have on that wise) besore they allowed him to be a Subscriber amongst them, against the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of dear Brethren, in the Service of Truth, and before he became a Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Traveller, with one of them, in the concern of Preaching and Praying to their shame.</p>
                  <p>Its a wonder they are not ashamed to cry against Church Order at this rate, and yet confess they have Order amongst them, but of what sort it is, let it be considered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> also says, <hi>They would not have Condemnation go further then the knowledg of the Offence, nor be remembred af er the Lord hath remitted.</hi> We say so too. But how shall this be done without keeping a Record? For the Man of Sin, that pleads for an hold for it, term of Life, will not loose the remembrance of the Transgressions of such as have struck at his Kingdom in Doctrine and Life; must the Church of God then follow with the Condemnation thereof, and with the Testimony of Gods Judgments and Mercies to the Penitent, only in loose Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that may be soon torn or lost, and if the Transgressions must not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred after the Lord remits, and a Testimony be out accordingly; how is it then that <hi>William Rogers</hi> (like-minded with them, and a Leader) publisheth <hi>Solomon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> Weaknefs far and near, and leaves a Record thereof to Prosterity in his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94536:46"/>
Printed Book, after that <hi>Solomon</hi> did acknowledge his mistake in one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the matter, and shewed his sorrow for it, as he manifested in a Letter under his own Hand to <hi>John Story,</hi> on that wise, long before <hi>William Rogers</hi> published the same; if here be not grosse Darkness and heaps of Confusion mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested we know none.</p>
                  <p>But to go on, they tell us what their Order and Practice is about Marriages, who are offended at us, in that we would have all to publish their intentions of Marriage twice in our Men &amp; Womens Meetings, whether there be occasion seen at present or not, before they be allowed to be accomplished, which they call a new Invention we have found, or the Inventions of others we follow: We say <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Their telling us that they have an order in this case, signifies that they have such a thing among them, then contradictory to all the noise they make against Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we will take notice of their Order, and see if they practice according to their own Rule in this matter.</p>
                  <p>They say, <hi>If two come before them to propose Marriage, Examination is made as to clearness from all other Persons, and if consent of Parents be in the case,</hi> &amp;c. And they say, <hi>If they declare themselves clear, and none hath ought justly to object,</hi> &amp;c. Yet a little respite was to be (meaning before the accomplishment) that Friends might enquire whether things were so or no: But there is not a word thus far of bringing the matter again to another Meeting, for they say, <hi>If nothing appeared to obstruct, then it was orderly to be accomplished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they say, <hi>If either Parents or Relations, or any other Man or Woman, had any reasonable Objection whereby to obstruct them, then they were not to proceed till the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was cleared.</hi> Look their Book before mentioned, if any question be made of the Truth of this, which is the very substance of the whole matter in relation thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> We say, here is not a word of coming twice, unless there be occasion, and if any then (in that little respect, which they say they cause before the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment) have any thing justly to object, we ask to whom must the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection be made? or who, that's hasty in such a matter, will take notice of such an Objection? being they are not ordered to forbear till another Meeting, and when the other Meeting will be, who knows? because their Meetings (as they have often declared) are to be only upon occasion: And what a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and cumber will there be about the matter of any ones Objection, whether it be a just Objection, or no? and whether a sufficient Objection or Occasion to call their occasional Meeting upon; what Distraction and Confusion is this? not like Gospel Order (though such they confess they have) we are bold to declare.</p>
                  <p>But what did they practice in the Case of <hi>Thomas Wilson,</hi> (who is since come off from them, to his Comfort, and we do not upbraid him with it, having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his Weakness in that and other matters) He had been concerned with another Woman, of whom he was not clear, when he proposed his Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; upon which proposal a Letter was sent from the Meeting which the Woman belonged to, signifyng, that he was not clear of her, neither did the Woman give him up to marry another; Friends also of the Meeting he belonged to, gave notice thereof to some of them before whom the Marriage was proposed, and desired them to put a stop to it till matters were cleared concerning the other VVoman, and that Objection removed, and that the VVoman might have right done her which made complaint. They were so far from being answerable in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94536:46"/>
Practice to what they presumed to say is their Order, that there was no notice taken of it at all, with respect to respite, after Friends had sent them that notice, but within a few days the Marriage was accomplished.</p>
                  <p>Let the sober Reader consider, whether these doings be Gospel-like, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such work as this, doth bespeak a People faithful to God, according to their first love and care for Truth, and the sweet Savour of it; and whether it bespeak solidity, and weight in and about the things of God, to make such a noise against Church order, which is practised amongst the Faithful; and for which cause <hi>William Rogers</hi> proclaims the Children of God <hi>Aposlates to Prosterity,</hi> in a Printed Publick Record; and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> signifies no disowning of it; and his Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in these Parts spreads them abroad, and yet confesses to Order, declares what Order they have among themselves, least they should be rendred Loose and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less with respect to Truth; and yet when their Orders, in the practick part of them comes to be search'd into, what sorry VVork they make, which indeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but in the Eye of the Simple, the Honest and VVise in God, render them not only Obnoxious to the Order and Discipline in the Power used in the Church of God amongst us, but also a sort of People that through their jumbling, wrangling VVork they have had in hand, have lost not only the Savour of Truth, but even a great part of those parts, as Men, which the Lord endued some of them with; and for the clearing up of these matters, a little spoken to, and several more rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, and their Practice now a days, we refer the Reader to our Answer in Manuscript, to the aforesaid Book, Subscribed by <hi>Edward Burrow, Richard Stephenson, John Wilkinson,</hi> and several more.

                  <p>And further, it may be observed, That as a People resolved to stand by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they continued meeting together now and then as they had occasion, and kept their Meeting at an House which Friends of the Quarterly Meeting had withdrawn from a long time before, partly on the account of the disorderly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him that lived therein. And that confidence they had in the matter thereof, that they sent to our Quarterly Meeting, claming an equal right with us to our Quarterly Meeting Books of account, of the Transactings of the Affairs of the Church from time to time, together with the Records of our Births, Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Burials; and by vertue of their pretended Title claimed liberty to an equal use thereof, as well as we, from time to time, as they might have occasion, and for that end demanded that the aforesaid Books might be brought to, and kept at the House, where they kept their Meeting, that Friends had withdrawn from, long before they parted from us, on the occasion of his disorderly walking. (Yet well enough still for their Fellowship in that Spirit they are gone into) Friends gave them a plain and sober Answer, in a measure of denial of their Proposal as stated, desiring them to condemn the wrong Spirit that had led them away from the Brethren, and break off from the Separation, and their Meeting in it, and in that which was good associate again with Friends from whom they were goue, then would the joynt Right and Priviledge therein be enjoyed amongst us.</p>
                  <p>But this gave them no Satisfaction, but a more peremptory demand they then made, signified in a Letter to us, Subscribed by <hi>John Wilkinson, William Cartmell, Richard Stephenson, William Chambers, Thomas Hodson,</hi> and the rest to the number of Thirteen, in which several reproachful Terms given to our Quarterly Meeting is inserted, — <hi>As if the Name of it must be bowed to, and on that account seek Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence

If we will be pleased to re deliver the Books to</hi> John Airey <hi>from whence they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The Reader may take notice, that upon the first demand of the Books, when we denyed them an equal use of them; being the Churches Records, which they were gone from, we told them, if they would not be pleased to condemn their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting in a tender mind, and come again in the true Love; if they would be pleased to send us a Bill of what they had laid out on the account of them, or what Charge had been contracted on them, by reason of any Record therein, they should have it returned to them again, and if they pleased to have a Copy of any, or all the Records therein, of Births, Marriages and Burials, that appertained to any of them, they should have a Copy thereof given them; but these things would not give them content; but the asore-mentioned Paper they sent into our Quarterly Meeting without any Name or Hand to it, which we returned again without taking any more notice of it, then having such a knowledge thereof as that we perceived it was the same that afterwards they sent to us, Subscribed as aforesaid.</p>

To which our Answer is thus, Whether this be a just demand let the Witness for God and all Faithful Brethren Judge. Had you not an equal privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in, and use thereof whilst you kept in Unity with us, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Are you not broken off and separated from us, and your Seperation judged by many faithful Brethren, as many of you know? Are you owned of any one Church of God in the whole Nation, in this your Seperation, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Is it a just thing in you thus to foment Strife, in standing by, and encouraging a Separation by such Demands? Have you not in Gods sight and according to equity forfeited your former right in the Churches Priviledges by separating from her? Might not the worst of Hereticks and Apostates from God (the False Church) that may keep up Meetings, make the same demand as you do, because that once they had been concerned in the true Church Affairs? Were it a just thing in them to say, <hi>Let the Churches Books</hi> (in which the weighty Concerns of Truth were Recorded) <hi>be where we may have the use of them as well as you?</hi> What an Expedient were this to prevent the great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences you talk of?

In their Paper, they have very abusively clamored against us, in saying we retain their just Right from them: To which we answer thus, We challing the Right to them, and use of them in the Churches Right, assembling together monthly and quarterly (as our Words plainly imparts) for the Service of Truth; and for which Services, in such Assemblies they were, with an unanimous Consent procured, and for the said Use, and none other, are they stil kept: And notwithstanding this, in that we cannot grant you the use of them at your Will, in your Separation and Strife; you exclaim and say by the same Rule, and in as much Justice, we may take away any other thing, due to you, if we can but secure it into our Possession.</p>

(in the Sense that our Words and Actions carries along with them) have no more right to keep the said Books, having the Possession of them, for the Uses aforesaid, from you so separated and broken from us, and out of Unity with us) then to keep any other thing justly due to you, if we had but the Possession of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This is such a clear Case, that even Children in the Truth are not Strangers to it: If we have done you Wrong, why do you not tell it to the Church according to Christs Rule; but exclaims thus, and nothing will satisfy you but your own Demands in your own Case, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

may be hurt by them, which our Souls most earnestly desire, yea, that it may be truly well with them both here and forever, and from the Lord, we say, had they loved the Prosperity of <hi>Sion</hi> and the Peace of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> more than their own Self-will and Separation, and had they sought the Unity that is in the Truth, and sweet Communion of Brethren which stands in that Love which thinks no Evil, and that Wisdom, that is gentle and very easie to be intreated by the Brethren, sweet and precious had our Fellowship been together at this day; and it is our godly Exhortation to you Friends and Brethren of the Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, that you watch in the Light and Power of God, against this separating Spirit that smites at the blessed Fellowship of the <hi>Churches of Christ,</hi> and where it enters any, in Gods Love to Admonish, Exhort and Warn such to take heed of that ravenous Spirit, and to keep in the Peace and Unity of the Family of the Lord, the Househould of Christ, which we are; and if notwithstanding your tender Christian dealing and forbearance, such Persons persever and go on in their seperate Spirit and Practice, let Gods Truth be cleared of them, and Truth set over their Heads, according to the order of the Gospel of Christ setled amongst you, and dear Brethren be careful not to suffer your Meetings which were gathered up, not by the will of Man, but by the Power and Wisdom of the Lord God, to be disturbed, over-ruled and spoyled by heady, obstinate and contentious Persons that disturb the Peace of the <hi>Church of Christ;</hi> neither fear Man, but eye the Lord, and wait in his Power and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be guided and ordered, and so go on to your Work in the Name of the Lord, for the Seed of Life (and not the wisdom that's below) must rule and have the Dominion for ever; but for as much as the way of the working of this subtil Enemy hath been to suggest, that it is the design of some to make themselves Lords over Gods Heritage, and to set up a Worldly and Arbitaray Power in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> and then to run out into severe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations against Impositions, crying up <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> thereby casting a Mist before the Eyes of the Simple, and Stumblingblocks in the way of the Weak: Thus we feel our selves concerned in the Love of the Lord, for the good of all to declare; and the Lord hath gathered us and preserved us to this day, and his Spirit is our Record, that we deny and abhor any such thing, for we have our Lord, Judge, King &amp; Lawgiver in the Church, and that is <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> unto whose Light, Power &amp; Spirit we have been turned, &amp; in that have Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him and had Fellowship together to this very day, and are your Servants for his sake; and we are assured in the Lord that they that keep in the Light, Life and Power of <hi>Jesus</hi> will have Fellowship with us, and truly our Fellowship is with the Father and the Son, and though it is far from us to bruise or hurt the poorest or least Member in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> who may not have that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sight and strength of Faith which the Lord hath brought us to; but that they may be Cherished: Yet by that Salt which we have in our selves from the Lord are we enabled to savour between the Transformations of the Enemy and the Scruples of the Innocent, and as to be tender of the one, so to give Judgment against the other, and our Day and Age hath lamentably shewn us the effects of that Spirit, that under pretence of crying down Imposition, and pleading for Liberty and doing nothiug but what it is free to, hath endeavoured to lay waste the blessed Unity of the Brethren, and to ove-rrun the Heritage of the Lord (that lived together as an orderly Family

And these, with such like things, Eighty seven subscribed, as the Reason of their Separation and Foundation of a new Government themselves, which is a plain Independensie from the Life and Practice of the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> throughout the World.</p>
                        <p>Oh Friends, watch in the Power of God against this Spirit that would make them twain that God hath made one, and separate that which God hath joyned together: And you that have any Interest in them, and to whom their Regard is. Oh have a care that you give them no Strength in their manifest Separation, but stand upon your Watch-Tower. Dear Friends, in God s Love touch not with that Spirit, the Enemies of <hi>Sion'</hi>s Glory and their Peace, give not your Strength to them, but deal faithfully with them, and seek them in God's Way and Wisdom, that whatever becomes of them in the End, you may be clear of their Blood in the Sight of the Lord; and they may not say, but that they have had a Day of Love and Visitation. And truly, that which hath incouraged in this Epistle, is that good Success that God hath blessed our like Endeavours (in his Power) with: For many deceived by them, and confederate with them, having seen their Snare, in tenderness of Spirit have honestly consessed their Fault, and are come from them, and have testified both against the separate Company and themselves, for having been of it; and now live in Unity with their Brethren, and feel the Joy and quiet Habitation that in the Communion of Saints and Fellowship of the Churches of Jesus is enjoyed, praises to the Lord for ever; and as we desire, so we hope, that more will be brought to the same blessed Sence. So be jealous for the Lord, dear Brethren, and stand up in his Spirit and Power for the Peace of his Church, and in his precious peacible Life dwell, that keeps in soundness of Mind, then will you shew Mercy to that which Mercy is due, and Judgment to that which Judgment is due, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect of Persons, and herein our pure true Love is shewn to them, and all mankinde; and the God of our Heavenly Love, Peace and pretious Fellowship be with usall, and bless us and keep us to the Glory of his Eternal Name, who, over all Spirits, Angels and Men, Thrones, Dignities and Dominions, reigns and is worthy and blessed for ever.</p>

                  <p>And there were several Brethren that had left the City before this Meeting, wherein this Epistle was subscribed, who at other Meetings had testified against this separate Spirit, in the Power of the Lord, and so are one with us herein; and some there were who have already cleared their Consciences at the last Years Meeting, and since at other Meetings, both by Epistles and other Manuscripts in a full and saithful Testimony against this Spirit of Separation and Opposition of his heavenly Truth.</p>
                  <p>After all these Exercises of Soul and Spirit amongst the Lord's People, even the afficted ones, with respect to <hi>Sion'</hi>s Troubles that attended them through the Spirit of Strife, though the Upright to God were comforted in the midst of all, in him in whom Salvation is. The Separation in the <hi>North</hi> still continued amongst the backsliding sort; and as the Mercies of the Lord, and the former great Forbearances of God's People towards them, was made ill use of, and the Concern of Friends despised, thereby taking Opportunity the more quietly to abet and strengthen their Work. Even so was the pure and sound Judgment of Truth, through God's People, and the Sentance now given against them in the Spirit of Christ Jesus, trampled upon by them; hardening themselves against all, as the evil Men and Seducers that grows worse and worse: And all Hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, being much dispaired of, Friends here in the <hi>North,</hi> who had kept their Habitarions in God, and in it their Fellowship one with another, in their Quarterly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In relation to the things of God did agree together to send some saithful Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to the Meetings, which they of the Separation did frequent, to let them know, that unless they that were led aside into the Temptations and the Snares of that dividing Spirit (whereby they were led from us into a Disconcern on that account, of the Affairs of the <hi>Church of Chrict</hi> into a slight thereof,) would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their Weakness therein, and break up the separate Meeting, which was become the stumbling and the Hurt of many, and tended to the Reproach of Truth.</p>
                  <p>Friends were inclined, and resolved (as agreed upon amongst us) to withdraw Meetings from the Houses of such as were in the Strife and Separation, and the Upholders thereof, as that which was not consistent with Unity of Brethren, nor the Repute of our uniting healing Spirit, and principle of Life which we had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And as it was the Agreement of the Meeting aforesaid, they who had that Service upon them, went amongst them with the Testimony that they had upon their Spirits touching that matter; many of the most tender-Hearted of them signified their Unwillingness to be parted from Friends on that wise, but chused (and moved in the Meeting accordingly) the rather to go after the other, and meet at their Houses, than break off from them and meet among themselves: At that Meeting, that <hi>John Story</hi> belonged to, <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> was that Day, and he knows in his Conscience, if he did not put a total stop to those Desires, and the Motion on that wise, which most of the Meeting closed with but himself, and if he did not say, That <hi>if Friends missed that Opportunity, take heed when they meet with such another;</hi> so that was it which prevailed upon that sort of them that were the Leaders and Sticklers in the contentious separate Work: For from that time they drew to themselves into a distinct Meeting, which they of that loose backsliding sort, from their first Testimonies, and from the Life of Truth, keeps the Form of to this Day: But upon that Occasion several of the honest and tender-Minded to God, that loved Righteousness, and them that kept true to the Life of it, came away from them separated and condemned, in a seasonable time, their former adhering to them of the Subscription, to their confederate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, the ground of the separate Meeting, and in the Power of God were renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Love and Care for Truth and God s Glory, and manifested their Sorrow and Grief of Heart for their former Weakness, and were received again into Unity with the Faithful, to their Comfort and Hearts-Joy, as some of them under their own Hands have given a Testimony of to the glading of the Hearts of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

After this it was presently noised abroad up and down the Nation, amongst this sort of Professors of Truth, upon a Letter sent out of the <hi>North,</hi> with no Name to it, <hi>That we had excommunicated them of that Party in the</hi> North, <hi>and that we had forbiden them to come to our Houses,</hi> and such like Discourse they had amongst them, to make our Care and Exercise for Truth, God's Glory, and the Honour of our holy Fellowship hateful, if possibly they could.

                  <p>The Lord hath turned the same to our great advantage many ways as hath been demonstrated and livingly felt to the great Joy and Comfort of our Souls, that into an holy retirement of the antient Power, by which we were first a People, all the Innocent to God are brought, that thither all might be scattered that had any depending upon any other thing, and the Salvation which God revealed in antient days is become precious indeed, and which livingly springs to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of all whose dependency wait on him, in those antient Testimonies which the Lord hath called us to bear for his Name-Sake, so that Peace is become our Portion and the Blessing of God our great Reward. And with respect to any publick appearance of opposition by them of that sort, as to concern themselves on that wife, in our Exercises for Truth &amp; the Glory of God in the Order &amp; Discipline used amongst us, Friends are become, here-a ways in the <hi>North,</hi> much what quit of it, for they begun to see it was in vain for them to resist and strive with that which they say was too strong for them, and their Spirits fainted through the dread of the Eternal God they were in war with, and their Hearts failing them in the day of Battel, and having much what now given up the management (as was said before) of the Work and the Design in hand to them of that party with them in the Southern parts, with whom <hi>John Story</hi> much what did remain, some clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering work <hi>William Rogers,</hi> and some of party with him, made in those parts, but principly he was the man took the matter into his concern, and a deal of stir with writing, and such like wrangling work he made in some of Friends Meetings, and others sent Papers to <hi>London,</hi> and into the <hi>North,</hi> against the Testimony gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at <hi>Ellis Hooks'</hi>s Chamber, made mention of before, with many scornful Terms, and malitious Smitings, ready also to be produced, and many more such-like, with Answers and Rejoynders as occasion was, which to speak of and insert at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We say, God was with us of a truth, when we were with him on that account, which broke many of our Hearts; in which we desired that he would be coole and quiet in his Spirit, that we might speak of things as became Brethren: But instead thereof, he obstinately resisted our tender Advice to him, and brake forth into a perverse froward Frame of Spirit, to our Grief and Sorrow, and hardened himself against us, and our tender Care concerning him, God knows, and in a pitious Passion went away from us, in a sliting manner, with contemptible Words in his Mouth, saying, <hi>He would stand upon his own Leggs, and not be beholden to us for our Crutches.</hi> We are bold to affirm that the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ was not with him in that Concern, but a stubborn Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Will which he hath given up himself to serve, and which grew upon him after that Day to the marring the Image which in measure he once bore: And we do testify in the unity of the Power, if these were our last Words, for which Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count must be given, That <hi>George Fox,</hi> and we, were justified before the Lord, and in our own Consciences, in the matter thereof; and we have our Peace and Reward, when <hi>John Wilkinson'</hi>s Obstinacy and Ambition will be his Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Torment, in the Day of God: And <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Perversion, in a prejudiced Minde of <hi>George Fox'</hi>s sincere Intent, and Fatherly Exercise in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of those Questions put to him on that wise toucheth him not, his Life is over it; and <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Sence touching him, and his Judgment upon him and us, we tread upon; for God never made that Spirit (that <hi>William Rogers</hi> manifestly bears, as his Book and Work demonstrates) judge over the Heritage of God; the Judgment shall return on himself again, from the just God, which he will one Day finde heavy upon him to bear: And all <hi>John Wilkinson'</hi>s shifting eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Answers, and <hi>William Rogers</hi> his paraphrasing thereupon, and drawing his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Then why did <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> say, <hi>It was more Gospel-like to have these Meetings as there was Occasion, and not so formally?</hi> And why did <hi>John Story,</hi> in contempt, call such our Meetings, <hi>Courts and Sessions;</hi> and our general Meeting, <hi>the High Court of Judicature;</hi> and in disdain spoke <hi>of citing into our Courts such as did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c?</hi> These things were proved against them at <hi>Drawell,</hi> to the stopping of their Mouths. And why then did they of the Separation in <hi>Westmerland,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the revolting Paper of Subscription, withdraw from our said Meetings, and contemn the very Name of our Quarterly Meetings? And why did they meet but now and then when they had a mind, without any Regard toour monthly or quarterly Meetings? These things are so true against the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that, we are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they have not the Force to deny them. And how durst <hi>John Story,</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> say, as in the Presence of Almighty God, <hi>That it becomes them to be in Unity with their Brethren in the Serviees thereof:</hi> When as such the aforesaid Slight and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was put upon them, during the time of their being with us; and seeing their Separation from them, out of the Unity, is continued by them unto this Day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They say, as to <hi>Womens Meetings, That though they see no Necessity for them in the Country;</hi> but, as much as to say, in the Cities there may (as they have sometimes confessed;) yet they say, <hi>its not agreeable with the Line of Truth, to oppose others in those Meetings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> then were they called by them <hi>an Idol, and a new Invention, and a Ceremony?</hi> Why did <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> ask <hi>Margaret Fox, what Ground they had to observe things imposed upon them in the Will of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94536:62"/>
although he himself had once subscribed a Paper for the Incouragement of them. as is before inserted? And why did <hi>John Story</hi> say, <hi>He would have been in the River to the Middle, before he had subscribed such a Paper?</hi> And why did they say, <hi>That such Meetings would cause Women to usurp Authority over their Husbands?</hi> These things, and others such like, were proved against them at <hi>Drawell:</hi> And why did they of Party with them say, <hi>The Women were more fit to wash the Dishes?</hi> And such like contemptible Terms they put upon them: And seeing they say, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they see no need of bringing Marriages before the Womens Meetings, yet they ought not to oppose others who are conscientious therein:</hi> Why then did they, and those of Party with them, upon the Occasions of some bringing their Marriages before the Mens Meetings, being desired to lay them before the Women, say, <hi>What need is there for that?</hi> Saying also, <hi>Are all Marriages that have not been before the Womens Meetings imperfect; or must they be married over again?</hi> This Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the just God abhors.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As to <hi>Condemnations,</hi> they say (as inserted in <hi>William Rogers</hi> Book, Part 4. page 39.) <hi>That although it be according to their inward Sence, that there is no need of such Records to Posterity, &amp;c. Yet,</hi> say they, <hi>that this our inward Sence may be no straitness to others, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then why would <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> say, in a Straitness in such Cases (which we use for the clearing of the precious Truth) <hi>That such Recording renders a Man a Knave to Posterity?</hi> And why did <hi>John Story</hi> move to alter our Meeting-Books, and to put all Papers of Condemnation out of them? And after <hi>John Story</hi> had been so concern'd, one of the Preachers amongst them of that Party, who had been married with a Priest, tore his Condemnation out of the Book. Was not this as great an Obstruction, with respect to those Records, as possibly could have been: These things also were possitively proved against them, at the aforesaid Meeting at <hi>Drawell,</hi> before many Brethren.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As to <hi>Discouragement of the Testimony against Tythes,</hi> they say, <hi>It was never on their Hearts to speak any Words relating thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then why did <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> put a clear stop to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise amongst Friends, relating to an Help and Incouragement in the matter thereof? And <hi>John Story,</hi> in a quarterly Meeting, did bring in an Instance, <hi>That some faithful Men in the Truth had paid them all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and said, <hi>They never saw Evil in so doing; and that they had paid them, and would pay them.</hi> Was not this enough to discourage the Testimony, and weaken Friends in the Sufferings that attends the same.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As to their <hi>judging Groanings, Sighings and Soundings,</hi> which was charged against them, <hi>William Rogers</hi> inserts their Paper; in which they say. <hi>That they are only against them, where they proceed from deceitful Spirits, and not the other, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Why then did <hi>John Story</hi> judg (by some Words he spoke during the same) such Exercises, which in Gods heavenly Power broke forth, in a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where the Presence of the Lord was felt, to the breaking of many Hearts; and the Spirit of Life sprung up in the Meeting amongst many tender People? And being spoken to, and asked why he would discourage such melodious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises as the Lord was pleased to concern some in, did say, <hi>That whosoever did sing, sound, or make a Noise, whilst another was preaching or praying, it was Confusion and Disorder, and it was a Spirit of Division that led them to it; and that he had
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94536:62"/>
born his Testimony against it, and he would do it, and bring it down, or leave Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> And why did he compare it to the <hi>Catter-wauling of Cats,</hi> or <hi>Belching of Calves;</hi> or at least, as he himself confest, spoke (in derision, we say) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> some that did so compare it? These things, we do declare, were proved against them at <hi>Drawwell</hi> aforesaid, to their Shame and Confusion, before many Brethren; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Testimony born there, and the Relation given by Friends of the Passages in the said Meeting, and the Sence and Judgment of Gods People <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> upon them, on the hearing and trying the matters relating thereunto.</p>
               <p>Now this we observe, that some may object and say, <hi>That although</hi> John Story <hi>and</hi> John Wilkinson <hi>had been thus concerned formerly, before the said Meeting had with them at</hi> Drawwell <hi>for their Restoration sake into Unity with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, in which State such and such opposite loose Words might come from them, or such Opposition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> have been made by them; Yet,</hi> may it be said, <hi>they may now be of a better mind, and that what they now declare, seemes to be consistent with your Practice: and they also gave forth a Paper,</hi> some may say, <hi>against themselves, acknowledging their Weakness, in some Measure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>so that then, Why are they not since received into Unity, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and Division put an end to?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Answer whereunto we say, If their Hearts had been upright to God in what they declared, and if they had continued in a tender fear and submission, and in a disconcern with respect to any discouragement to others in the Exercises accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted needfull in the Churches, and if they had broke off the separate Meeting, and joyned with the <hi>Church of God</hi> in their Monthly and Quarterly Meetings in the service of Truth, as their Words did there import an inclination to do, in several of the a foresaid matters, as they acknowledged their duty to do, it had been well with them, and many more at this Day, on the account of the Life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>William Rogers</hi> in his smiting Work against <hi>George Fox,</hi> in his fourth Part, page 27. saith, <hi>That what ever was pretended to be</hi> John Story's <hi>and</hi> John Wilkinsons <hi>fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet nothing would give</hi> George Fox <hi>satisfaction, but submission to him and his Orders,</hi> &amp;c. Because, saith he, in his Letter last mentioned, he writes of them, and says, <hi>Had they been right, and in the Light and Power of God, as at the first, they would have come to me when I sent for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which we Answer, let the Reader consider, whether <hi>William Rogers</hi> doth not befool himself in raking up (in an evil mind that watcheth for Evil) such a sorry proof as this, whereby to render <hi>George Fox</hi> an Apostate, or one erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously concerned in the aforesaid Difference, that would make an Accusation against him, on the score of <hi>George Fox'</hi>s desiring to see <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> when by reason of the Weakness of Body that he was under for several Weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> their striving contentious Work, whereby they had occasioned Trouble in the Church of Christ, which was his sorrow for its Peace sake, and sor the sake of the Innocent Lambs of God that were hurt thereby; and whether it did argue a Stout Lordly Spirit in <hi>George Fox,</hi> that would have submission to him, (as <hi>William Rogers</hi> renders him to have) who innocently, and in self-denial came so far under that wrong Sprit, as to desire them to come over to him, who could not go to them, because of his aforesaid Weakness; or whether it was not a Lordly, Stubborn, and Selfwilled Spirit in them, who, when in good heath and ability of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Further we observe, how <hi>William Rogers</hi> picks something here and there out of the Charges against <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> and out of our Reply to their Answer thereunto (alledging that there is no matter of evil Fact therein) whereby to slander and asperse <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> and others concerned in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise relating thereunto, and by the said aspersions cast on them, would malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94536:63"/>
stretch the same to Accusations against <hi>George Fox,</hi> relating to his Charge against him, of being one erroneously concerned in the aforesaid Difference; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>its not like that</hi> Robert Barrow, <hi>and them, would do any thing on that wise without</hi> George Fox'<hi>s consent,</hi> or to that purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We say first, If <hi>George Fox</hi> had been privy to <hi>Robert Barrow'</hi>s, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> aforesaid their Concern, and had been an encourager thereof, and that to have done so were matter of Evil and Condemnable, which we deny, and <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath yet to prove; yet were it uncharitable and untruth-like in him to charge <hi>George Fox</hi> therewith, from his own supposition that <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> and the rest, would not be so concerned without his consent: Now we say, Where is the Life of Christianity? Where is the Love that thinks no Ill? Where is the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (without which all that's done is accursed before the Lord) in this Work of his? <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath clearly manifested himself void thereof, and to be one that watcheth for Evil to smite, withal, and when he wants matter of Fact against him he strikes at, brings Accusations upon this Evidence, — <hi>If Reports be true,</hi> — <hi>or its likely so.</hi> But let us see what the matter is on the account of the Charge that <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> and others have alledged against <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> that hath no matter of evil Fact in it, and therefore <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> and others are Condemnable, and consequently <hi>George Fox</hi> as concerned therein, as <hi>William Rogers</hi> upon his unchristian supposition concludes.</p>
               <p>The first Charge <hi>William Rogers</hi> inserts for that end, out of the forty four Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles alledged against them, is thus; <hi>John Story</hi> speaking amongst many Friends of the danger of Forms, because of the consequences thereof said, <hi>That amongst the Christians of Old, the Differences that did arise were about Froms;</hi> which <hi>William Rogers</hi> saith, <hi>seemeth to have no matter of evil Fact in it.</hi>

               <p>

We prove it thus — Friends were in the Exercise of Church Care, and Gospel Order in the Discipline in the <hi>Church of Christ;</hi> Friends were zealous therein, in opposition to a loose Spirit, that did not like the Inspection, nor Judgment thereof; and it was an evil thing in <hi>John Story,</hi> and matter of Fact chargeable upon him, to lay stumbling blocks in the way thereof, by presenting the danger of Forms; and at this season, and on such an occasion to tell of evil Consequence to arise out of the Order of the Gospel settled amongst us, and on the account of the Government of Christ Jesus instrumentally in the Church; for thereby he gratified a wrong Rebellious Mind, and Evil Heart of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

had been Blessed in) only remained, and then they strove about Methods and outward Forms, having nothing else left, where the Apostate Christians at this day are, and are in their lo here's, and lo there's, and this Form, and the other Form, without the Life and Power, where the Forcing and Compulsion stands, that is Accursed before the Lord. But to come to the Matter, we say, because that in the Apostate State there hath been a false Church, and a false Government, and Rule, exercising Lordship over the Conscience, which is come up since the Apostles Days; Must there therefore in the true Church (come up again out of the Wilderness leaning on the Breasts, of her Beloved) be no visible Government, in subjection to the Power, and subservient thereunto? Must there be no visible Form or outward Exercise relating to it, no Order, no Rule or Directions recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or practiced therein? but the tenderly concerned in it must be run upon as Apostates and Innovators, and bringers in of a new Form of Government, and of Impositions, and Dictates of Fallible Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh abominable Wickedness! that tends to Liberty in the Flesh, and a leading back again into Death, and the paths thereof: Was it justifiable in <hi>John Story</hi> in this day of the true Churches concern on this wise, to go creeping up and down from place to place, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more openly buzing into the minds of the weak and carnal sort an opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto, and telling People of the danger of Forms, and the consequences of them, to draw from subjection to Gods Power, and into a contempt of the Church Care in the Gospel Day, and Power thereof? We say, this was <hi>John Story'</hi>s Work, as the scope of those Articles that belong to this Head tends to prove the same against him; and if <hi>William Rogers</hi> had been sincere in the matter of his inserting the aforesaid Articles, and the Reply to their Answer, he might have manifested the same as clear as the Sun at Noon-Day, to which Articles we refer the Reader, together with the Reply at large to their Answer thereunto, which we have in Manuscript ready to be produced, if any do desire a sight thereof.</p>

               <p>We say again, it is the Fruit of a dark Spirit, and imports great Confusion (as the reply at large manifests) to make this jumbling Work about a clear and plain Truth, which would darken Knowledg.

               <p>And what is that Severity they are offended with, and thus clamour against?

When <hi>William Rogers</hi> Prints again, let him tell us, if ever <hi>George Fox,</hi> or any of us, were otherwise concerned in the matter of the Directions (which <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> once confessed to) but in commending them to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and to be led in the Practice thereof by Gods leading Grace as their Duty, and if any in a wrong fleshly mind resist the same, to declare Dis-union with such, as not worthy of that Fellowship which the Faithful are in, as <hi>William Rogers</hi> in his <hi>Christian Quaker</hi> hath confessed may be done. — <hi>Paul</hi> charged, before God and the Elect Angels, to observe the things he had directed to in the Spirit, which he knew would attend them who were innocent in the Practice of those things which he was moved to lay before them.</p>
               <p>But let us ask <hi>William Rogers,</hi> or any of Party with him. Do they think that <hi>George Fox</hi> was moved of God to give forth things to be practiced in the Churches in the Spirit of Truth, that fleshly minds should be justified in Gods sight, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And shall any be Blessed in saying, <hi>That George Fox only recommended these things to our Consciences to be practiced as we saw need, and that we see no need of Womens Meetings, or of Monthly and Quarterly Meetings so constant,</hi> as both <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> have said: <hi>And we see no need of keeping our Meetings in our Houses when twenty Pound Fine is imposed on them that do so: We see no need of such Inspection, or such Strictness, with respect to the

               <p>And we testifie, that the great ground of Dis-satisfaction about Church Care (which <hi>John Story,</hi> and others of Party with him wofully fell into, and the great cause of all the Contention (which hath been made by them) spoken of, and which <hi>William Rogers</hi> says, <hi>George Fox</hi> hath been erroneously concerned in, and whom he and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> would charge to be the occasion of) was the Churches practising in the Life of God, those things that were commended to the honest Hearted, according to the Directions given forth by <hi>George Fox</hi> and other Brethren, on which occasion the Unfaithfulness of many came to be search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into, and found out, and judged in the power of the pure Truth, which they liked not; they could easily have born the reading of them, and their being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Friends Consciences, so that the Practice might have been suspended, and not come into, but room left for their loose Minds and backsliding Work; for <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> said, <hi>Thas those things which</hi> George Fox <hi>

               <p>But to come to the matter touching the Meetings Concern on the account of <hi>John Story'</hi>s Proposals, as expedients for Peace, (as <hi>William Rogers</hi> terms them) <hi>William Rogers</hi> has dealt very unfairly and unchristianly with us; <hi>First,</hi> in not stating the Case aright, in that he gives no account of the Reasons (we made mention of) given to him and others, wherefore we could not take any notice of any Proposals sent by him for uniting the two aforesaid Meetings, in the Captivity he then stood, as we fairly signified unto him, and them of Party with him at <hi>Bristol,</hi> with them also of the Separation here in the <hi>North,</hi> in a Paper sent to them, which might have stopped all their Mouths, until they had detected the said Reasons as insufficient for our denial, which they never yet have done. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> we say, he abuses us in saying, <hi>That we Judged the Paper unheard;</hi> for we Judged not the Matter contained in <hi>John Story'</hi>s aforesaid Paper, but the Spirit in which he had wrought Dissatisfaction and Strife in the <hi>Church of Christ;</hi> heading and standing by a Contentious Party with him, and leading them into a Separation from the ancient Fellowship in the Truth, and Services relating to it; and an acknowledgment of the wrong which he had done to the Truth and Gods People we expected, and the Spirit that led him to it to be Condemned by him, this the Lord and the Truth first looked for from him, as we told them: And also we say, <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath dealt very Disingeniously with us, in his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus to our Defamation, in that he hath not also Printed the Reasons we gave him and them, why we could not take any notice of Advice or Councel from him, or of his Expedients for Uniting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Capacity he stood: We asked him that brought the Paper into our Quarterly Meeting, whether it was directed to the Meeting from <hi>John Story,</hi> or whether it was a Testimony from <hi>John Story</hi> of Judgment against himself for the abusive Work he had made amongst us? of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which any account could be given us, which if it had, we should readily have received and embraced the same, but otherwise we could not do it, for the

order of Truths sake; he being a man that had run himself out of the Unity of Brethren, and disconcerned himself in the Church Affairs, and the Judgment of Truth through the Brethren being gone out against him, and he continuing in the Separation and Strife still; we say, and we appeal to Gods faithful Witness, what notice could we take of any Papers from <hi>John Story,</hi> unless it were to acknowledg his runnings out, and condemning himself therefore, that so he himself might come again into Unity with us, which we truly desired, and then we should be glad of his Advice and Proposals in the Spirit of Truth, for the helping back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of such as he had helpt to lead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>William Rogers <hi>saith,</hi> That upon these two false Assertions <hi>George Fox</hi> hath builded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Now we desire the Sincere and Wise in Heart to consider, whether <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath not been greatly under a mistake in this matter, and hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Read his tenth Query, <hi>viz. That is attended on like an Earthly Prince, and yet hath Twelve or Thirteen Hundred Pounds well secured, with the encrease thereof for many Years</hi> (<hi>if any be) out of the reach of the Spoylers?</hi> Is not this Query proved a down-right Charge, manifested to his shame, though he hath the face to charge <hi>George Fox</hi> with a Lye on this score also.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth Query <hi>William Rogers</hi> speaketh of some that had secured their Estates from the Spoylers, for their Families, that would not have departed (said he) from their Testimony in Meetings, <hi>&amp;c. although,</hi> saith he, <hi>thou</hi> (speaking of <hi>George Fox</hi>) <hi>hast been a Shrinker.</hi> This is surely a Charge, and yet he hath the confidence to charge <hi>George Fox</hi> with a Lye, for saying, <hi>That the Queries seemed to be Charges against him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Much more might be observed out of the Queries and Rejoynder, whereby to prove <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Queries down right Charges against <hi>George Fox,</hi> and also to manifest what an hardened disparate State the Man is grown into, that so little regards what he says, or whereof he affirms, wronging himself on this wise, by charging Lyes on his own Head, to bespatter others (though Innocent) withal. And if the whole matter, with respect to the Queries and Rejoynder, were but circumspectly looked into, about this matter of proving the Queries Charges, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

the manifest tendency of his whole Design, evidently demonstrating the same) his own Words duly taken notice of, and expressly set down, would much what prove the whole Matter, and bring the Thirteen Lyes back again upon his own Head, which he in a wicked abusive manner chargeth upon another, and spreadeth abroad by his Papers and Printed Book amongst such as Truths Integrity would be ashamed of.</p>
                  <p>So then to conclude this matter, this we say from what as may be gathered from his Writing, that the Intent of the Mans Heart hath been (and continues the same, as his Printing demonstrateth) to Charge and Impeach openly, and affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively only so far as he had any hopes to make proof thereof; and yet in his false and malicious design of Accusation and Charge against <hi>George Fox</hi> he hath been so implacable, and hath lusted so thereafter, that he hath not been content in the matter of charging with what he thought he might prove, but adventured implicitly in the matter thereof by way of Query, to engage himself therein so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>We observe that <hi>William Rogers</hi> denies that those Words in the Conclusion of his Paragraph <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>To Believe, and to Charge, are two distinct things, saith he, a Man may believe a Charge, and yet have no hand in giving the Charge; but a Man cannot honestly Charge, and pretend he doth not believe the Charge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Reader may take notice how he Confounds himself, &amp; hath abused the noble parts which the Lord gave him as a Man; He denies that his Words amount to a Charge, (though he confesses that he believes <hi>George Fox</hi> is guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>a Man may believe a Charge, and yet not give the Charge:</hi> But we say, <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath not only confessed that the Charges against <hi>George Fox</hi> are true, as he firmly believes; but he hath given them forth in Manuscript, and spread them abroad through the Nation; he hath given out the Charges against him also in Print, to stand on Record to Posterity to his Disgrace, so far as in his Power he can do it; and therefore he doth Charge according to his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, and that after the most wicked absurd manner in many respects; had <hi>William Rogers</hi> heard Charges only, and believed them too, and had not been such a publisher of them, but had brotherly treated <hi>George Fox</hi> about the same, then indeed he might the better have stood in his own vindication of being no Charger, or that what he had said on the account of what he heard and believed did not amount to Charge; but poor Man, he hath not been of such a Spirit, it were well if he could yet see himself, that if possible he might find Mercy; for that he hath charged expressly in his Paper of Queries, and in the very Queries themselves its evident from the very Words summed up out of his own Paper, as we have said before, being the very same with the Catalogue of Charges summed up in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, all which he concludes positively, that he firmly believes that <hi>George Fox</hi> is guilty of.</p>
                  <p>And seeing that in several Places of his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> (thereby to make <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Observations on the Queries a false Assertion, and thereby to make him a Lyer Thirteen times over) he says, <hi>He did not intend the Queries to be Charges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:94536:74"/>The most of what we can reasonably say on his behalf touching this matter is, that peradventure he did not think so plainly to have declared them Charges, least he should fail in the proof thereof, it being a desparate adventure, but that the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereof was high Charges, and that after a very absurd and unbrotherly manner its very plain and safe to assert, and the Words themselves demonstrates the same; so that he might see if he were not wilfully Blind, that his Tongue and Pen bewrayes him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Rogers</hi> in his fourth <hi>Query</hi> implicitly chargeth <hi>George Fox, That he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his</hi> Epistle (which he calls <hi>reflecting Queries</hi>) <hi>to be a Man with two Faces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we desire that <hi>William Rogers</hi> (and them of Party with him) may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether he be not the Man that hath appeared with two Faces, in so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now applauding <hi>John Story,</hi> as not one equal to him in Doctrine and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (excepting <hi>John Wilkinson</hi>) that ever he heard of, and in espousing his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel in opposition to Church Care, and leading a separate Party in that Design; and let his Conscience speak, whether or no he hath thus vehemently stood by him therein, from any real sence of <hi>John Stories</hi> Uprightness to God in this his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or from any liking of, or unity with his Preaching? and let him be asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not reckon it once to be an empty, burdensome, dead thing, like the Priests Doctrine? and whether he said not, that he would Preach them all to Death, or the like? If he remember not this, or would make a forget of it, we can help his Memory therein, and so with respect to his praising of <hi>John Story</hi> now, and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him on this wise; we would have him consider whether he hath not been a double minded Man; and that his undertaking in this Contentious Design against the Churches Care and Peace thereof, hath not really been to gratifie a fleshly decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit in himself, from Truths Life, in which also he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> his Contempt and Dis-esteem of, yea, his Malice and Enmity against <hi>George Fox,</hi> (who hath kept his first Love and Care for Gods Glory) whose Person <hi>William Rogers</hi> runs upon, and his Repute too, both as a Man and Christian, with lying Charges and false Accusations, as all (or most of) the Apostates from Truth have done ever since we have been a People; and if <hi>William Rogers</hi> would but consider the woful end of the most of such, he might have great cause thereby to Fear and Repent, that he might find Mercy, and not perish for evermore.</p>
                  <p>We further take notice, that <hi>George Fox</hi> blaming <hi>William Rogers,</hi> for causing so many Smiting Queries and false Accusations to be read against him, in a publick Mens-Meeting, behind his back, when he was nigh Two Hundred Miles off (as unbeseeming Truth) <hi>George Fox</hi> knowing of no such thing intended against him; seeing also they of Party with him, would not allow <hi>Thomas Camm</hi> to read a Paper concerning <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> relating to prove him to his Face, an encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Loose and Wicked Persons, &amp;c. In a Meeting appointed for that end, and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> there present: To which <hi>William Rogers</hi> saith, <hi>This if far remote from his purpose,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may consider how foolish <hi>William Rogers</hi> renders himself, besides very Partial and Dishonest in this matter: Will he justifie his causing to be read such malicious Charges against <hi>George Fox</hi> behind his Back, in the Mens-Meeting, where not a Man present would say he owned the reading of it, <hi>George Fox</hi> not being there to make his Defence, neither knowing any thing of the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against him, for the space of three Weeks time after, by any Account from him, or from any other by his Order; and yet will seem to stand by those

that would not allow <hi>Thomas Camm</hi> to read a Paper relating to make good somthing against <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> in a Meeting appointed for that very end, and <hi>John Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> there present: We say that the remoteness that is in these Cases (which is not a little) tendeth to <hi>William Rogers</hi> his great shame, with respect to the matter he hath had in hand.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>William Rogers</hi> being told by <hi>George Fox</hi> of his unchristian and disorderly dealing with him, about the Matter of causing those smiting Queries to be read against him, &amp;c. <hi>Bray Doiley</hi> also speaking with <hi>William Rogers</hi> about the same disorderly Work, <hi>William Rogers</hi> told <hi>Bray Doyley, That he had sent them to</hi> George Fox <hi>three Weeks before they were read in the aforesaid Meeting:</hi> And yet <hi>William Rogers</hi> denies this, and sayes, <hi>Its probable he might say, it was writ three Weeks before,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In Answer we say, It may be noted, <hi>First William Rogers</hi> denies not but that it was read in the Mens-Meeting after the manner aforesaid, which is base and unchristian doings.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it was read long before it came to <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Hands its clear, <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Letter to <hi>George Fox,</hi> being a cover to the aforesaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Queries, bearing Date <hi>Bristol</hi> the very same day that the Smiting Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Falsly accusing Paper, were read against him in the Meeting at <hi>Bristol.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may be noted what an Abominable Lye <hi>William Rogers</hi> asserts, in denying that he said, that he had sent the Paper of Queries to <hi>George Fox</hi> three Weeks before; for <hi>Bray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </hi> (as by his Letter appears) doth not only assert the Truth of <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s saying so to him; but <hi>Richard Snead</hi> writing to <hi>George Fox</hi> about the reading of that Paper, in their Meeting against him, saith thus — <hi>I forbear to send thee a Coppy of it; for</hi> William Rogers <hi>told</hi> Bray Doyley, <hi>the next day after it was read, that he had seni thee a Coppy of it, three Weeks before: Charles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

When there are Two or Three antient Upright Men in Truth, Men of known credit and repute to restifie the same against him; the Letter that came with the Paper inclosed in it bears date the 21st of the 8th Month 1678. And <hi>Charles Jones'</hi>s Letter beareth date, the 23th of the 8th Month 1678. And the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the day when <hi>William Rogers</hi> said to him, and also to <hi>Bray Doyley, that he had sent the Paper three Weeks before:</hi> Such a Spirit as this God cannot bless, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it ever do any good for God, his Truth or People, What ever it may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to: More Witnesses might be brought against <hi>William Rogers,</hi> to prove the Charges of Treachery, if he should deny these plain things; but this is sufficient to detect him, of being a notorious Dissembler with his own Conscience, and yet would be unworthily charging others with that which he himself is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>William Rogers</hi> to excuse his Unchristian and Disorderly charging behind the Back, a Brother and an Elder in the Truth, saith, <hi>That</hi> John <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a soul Aspertion (and an unchristian Stating of the case) which he is not able to make good against us; as hath already in Manuscript been manifested sufficiently, which might have satisfied him ere now, had he been a reasonable Man; we have also in part spoken to it in this Treatise.</p>
                  <p>We say again, in the first place, It was not <hi>John Blaykling,</hi> and the other Persons, as distinct from the Church of Christ in <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> that had this concern upon them, neither was it their particular distinct case, but the case of the Church Assembled in the Quarterly Meeting at <hi>Kendal</hi> in <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> and the Churches case throughout the whole Nation; in the cause whereof, an Information had been brought, and laid before the Brethren in the <hi>North,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>South,</hi> of the sad Work that <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> had made, in Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Church-care, and the Order thereof, they having been often particularly dealt withal; as also in many publick preceding Meetings in <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> in order to their Reconciliation to Truth, and the Brethren; and yet they still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obstinate, at the motion, and upon the Agreement of the Quarterly Meeting in <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> as also in persuance of the desire of our Brethren at <hi>London,</hi> was there a Meeting appointed, in order to the hearing and examining matters relate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson;</hi> and at the aforesaid Meeting was several Brethren of other Counties made mention of, with a desire to have them there, (having been unconcerned Persons) which thing also was desired by our Friends at <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> had notice of the said Meeting (as is before in this Treatise inserted) knowing also that matters in charge, would be alledged against them, because of their contentious opposite Work, which for the Truths sake, and the Unity of Brethren, which they contemned, could no longer be forborn; and their denial to come to the said Meeting, so orderly appointed, was their contempt of the Churches Power, and the Jurisdiction thereof in the Spirit of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> for which Contempt, together with the ungodly Work which that Spirit of theirs had wrought amongst Gods People, the Judgment went out against them, in the Authority of the Power, which God blesseth the Work of, amongst his People: <hi>John Blaykling,</hi> whom he mentions by Name, is justified amongst his Brethren, in the concern that he and many more have had upon them, touching this Spirit, and them led by it; God hath blessed them with success in the Work they have appeared in, whilst it goes ill with them of this evil Spirit, who stick to it; for they become more and more the Evil Men and Seducers that grow worse and worse. And as to his saying, <hi>That we brought false Accusations against them;</hi> we say, We admire that he dare to Sin against God, and Dissemble with his own Conscience, for he may remember that the matters in charge against them were proved at the Meeting at <hi>Draw-well,</hi> as the Brethrens Narrative of the transacting of matters there, with the Judgment given, doth plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to take notice of what proof <hi>William Rogers</hi> makes of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations which he hath alledged in Charges against <hi>George Fox,</hi> seeing that <hi>George Fox</hi> declares them to be False and Malicious; now it stands <hi>William Rogers</hi> in Hand to prove the same, or else to lay his Hand upon his Mouth, and confess he hath done him and many more Brethren great wrong; it will not serve his turn to fly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

of his whole Work, is to Smite and asperse; yea, if ever Man was Guilty in the matter of accusing our Brethren; <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath by these smiting Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries declared himself to be such a one: There is no plea in the case for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; therefore it is expected by the Reader, that this he should have done, but he is fallen short in this Proud and Presumptuous attempt, he makes himself a Reproach.</p>

The Reader may take notice, that the substance of what he saith, as to proof, is — <hi>That</hi> George Fox (saith he) <hi>doth not deny but that he did so, but pretendeth that he was so weak in Body that he was not able to sit in the Meeting:</hi> But not any thing relating to prove the matters of Charge against him doth he bring forth, and therefore detected as a false Accuser; but of this more may be said afterwards.</p>

                  <p>Hast not thou a sence that the aforesaid Paper of Queries <hi>(meaning</hi> George Fox's <hi>Epistle to Friends)</hi> may cast a line of Reflection on every one, that may secure from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers any part of that outward Substance which God hath given them to maintain their

Families with? Yet art thou not sensible that thou art the Man that hast advised the Rich to secure their worldly Estate, that so the Persecutors might not become Spoylers thereof?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This Smiting Accusation (contained in the latter part of the Query) <hi>George Fox</hi> denies, and <hi>William Rogers</hi> ought to prove it; but instead of making any solid proof thereof, as in reasonableness he ought to have done, or confessed himself the false Accuser: He only concerns himself in making some Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on <hi>George Fox'</hi>s <hi>Reply,</hi> catching at Words here and there, and by perverting and drawing false Inferences, would make <hi>George Fox</hi> a Lyer, as he often uncivil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chargeth him on that wise.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>William Rogers</hi> having a particular Case, that he looked he could detect <hi>George Fox</hi> in, (to wit) the Case of <hi>Mary Pennington,</hi> as he suggested he might prove <hi>George Fox</hi> faulty in: He replies to <hi>George Fox'</hi>s negative Answer to his general Charge thus, <hi>viz. Either must</hi> Isaac Pennington <hi>and his Wife not be Rich, or</hi> Mary Pennington <hi>no body; or else</hi> (saith he) George Fox <hi>is here detected of two Lyes.</hi> Now if this be not ridiculous Work and nauseous to Men of Honesty, and not worth taking notice of, but to manifest his malicious Mind, let that in his and all Consciences speak. And when <hi>William Rogers</hi> comes particularly to charge <hi>George Fox</hi> with <hi>Mary Pennington'</hi>s Case, to prove him faulty in that matter, or any other particular case appertaining to this Charge; then may it be time for <hi>George Fox</hi> to make a particular Reply to it; in the mean time <hi>William Rogers</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of detecting <hi>George Fox</hi> of Lyes, on the score of his general Answer to his general Charge, he himself stands detected as one watching for Evil against the Innocent that thinks him no ill, and manifests great Malice to lodg in his Heart, which he is tugging in, when he wants matter to bring forth to perfect that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al which he aims at. And when <hi>Mary Pennington'</hi>s Case comes to be spoke to in its place, as afterwards there will be occasion to do, from what will be said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, together with <hi>George Fox'</hi>s honest and plain Answer (to which we refer the Reader) touching this matter; the Integrity of his Heart (far from deserving any such Accusation) in what he did in that Case, as in others, his concerns also on the Truths account, to the advantage of Gods People we are satisfied, will plead his innocent Cause in the Hearts of the upright and unprejudiced Persons who may inspect the same, and let <hi>William Rogers</hi> say and do his worst the Burden and Shame will be his in the end, too heavy for him to bear.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may observe, that the Accusation against <hi>George Fox,</hi> charged by <hi>William Rogers</hi> on the account of <hi>Mary Penington'</hi>s case, is not any of the Thirteen, which <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath in his Catalogue of Charges against him
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94536:76"/>
made mention of; but is one brought in at the latter end of his Paper of smiting Queries: yet we think it not amiss to insert the same here, and speak a little to it, and so cast it by, amongst the rest of his dirty malicious Stuff; to be trodden under the Feet of Men. The Charge is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether, thou <hi>George Fox</hi> (whilst <hi>Isaac Penington</hi> was in Prison, and in danger to be Premunired) didst not thou advise, or at least encourage <hi>Mary Penington</hi> to secure her or their Estate? and whether thou <hi>George Fox</hi> afterward didst not speak in discourse with a Friend about the same matter to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> What a condition she, <hi>viz. Mary Penington</hi> had been in, had it not been for thee (meaning as to outward Estate) If thou <hi>George Fox</hi> deny this, I will undertake to prove it; or bring a Testimony under the Hand of a cridible Friend in Truth, that <hi>Mary Penington</hi> did signifie so much as is contained in the first part of the Query; and also prove or bring under the Hand of a credible Friend in Truth, to whom thou <hi>George Fox</hi> spoke according as is Queried in the latter part?</p>
                  <p>In Answer hereunto, it may be noted, that as to the proof of the general Charge against <hi>George Fox,</hi> of advising the Rich to secure their Worldly Estate from the Spoylers, which <hi>George Fox</hi> denies as a false Accusation: <hi>William Rogers</hi> to prove the Charge against him, brings in this one particular Case before Inserted; which, as Stated, is by <hi>George Fox</hi> utterly denied; it now stands <hi>William Rogers</hi> in Hand to prove it, or else he will be detected as a false Accuser, with respect to this particular Charge (as he hath been already detected with respect to the general) and so the Lye turned back upon himself.</p>
                  <p>In the first place, let it be observed (and we desire to be excused if we stand a little on this matter; for to advise the Rich to secure their Worldly Estate from the Spoylers, and to bid the Poor give up their all, which <hi>William Rogers</hi> charges <hi>George Fox</hi> to be guilty in the matter of; if it be proved against him, there is matter of evil fact therein without doubt) We say let it be noted that <hi>William Rogers</hi> is in the first place, clearly detected as a Man out of the Doctrine of Christ, in that he never had dealt with <hi>George Fox</hi> in private about this matter, betwixt them Two; neither did he at any time take two or three with him, to Examine <hi>George Fox</hi> about the matter of this Charge, before he caused it to be openly Read in a publick Mens-Meeting (with many other Charges) behind the Back, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expressed, and after Printed it; which action is unchristan and absurd amongst Men, and manifests his Spirit to be false to the Life of Jesus, and malicious.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is detected clearly to be out of the Apostles Council, (and the Primitive practice amongst Believers) who advised to receive no Accusation against an Elder, but before two or three Witnesses: William Rogers saith to each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part of the Smiting Query and down-right Charge, thus — If thou deny (speaking to <hi>George Fox</hi>) I will prove it, or bring it under the Hand of a Friend in Truth to whom <hi>Mary Penington</hi> did signifie so much as is contained in the first part of the Query, <hi>and also, said he,</hi> I will bring it, under the Hand of a credible Friend in Truth, to signifie according as is Queried in the latter part.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may take notice, that there is but one single Witness spoken of by him to prove each particular distinct part of the Charge against him; he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to no more, which is also like the other antichristian and disorderly doing; and this is not the worst part neither of the Case, in relation to <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd Work; for the Charge being denied as stated, and <hi>William Rogers</hi> in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:94536:77"/>
in order to the proof of matters of fact charged, hath made none at all touching this matter, nor produced any Certificates under the Hands of these cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Friends in Truth, as he calls them, to prove this Charge against him.</p>
                  <p>And now as to the matter it self, which <hi>William Rogers</hi> would make an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation upon, against <hi>George Fox,</hi> and the distressed Woman, which was her Exercise about Twenty Years ago, which he now rakes up in his Apostatizing State, who would make others as bad as himself, if any way he could do it; we understand this was the case on <hi>Mary Pennington'</hi>s account, her Husband being in Prison and liable to a Premunire, according to the outward Law, the Discourse betwixt <hi>George Fox</hi> and her, related to those Lands that were her Joynture, made to her by her former Husband, to have those Lands distinguished from her latter Husbands real Estate, that so the Premunire might not reach them, which in Conscience it ought not to have done, being her Joynture as aforesaid, and to deseend to her first Husbands Child after her decease, and touching that which might tend to distinguish in this matter, that the Executors of the Law might have the knowledge thereof, and the Issue to be left to the Lord: We say where is the Evil that's imputable to the Woman, that all this ado is made about? or wherein is <hi>George Fox</hi> detectable for leaving her to her freedom touching it? which is all that <hi>George Fox</hi> consesseth to, and more then <hi>William Rogers,</hi> for all his cluttering Work, hath yet proved against him: And as touching <hi>Mary Pennington'</hi>s Integrity to God, and the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Truth in this suffering afflicted State she was in, let the Sincerity which is void of Prejudice, not watching for Evil, speak in her behalf; for whom it is testified that she said, <hi>That she durst not remove any part of the Personal Estate, which was her then Husbands more proper Goods (and liable to the spoyl according to the Law) but it was freely given up for the Testimonies sake that her Husband was in Prison for; although as to an opertunity for it she wanted not.</hi> Surely Malice is the ground for this Work, much more then any real matter: And <hi>William Rogers</hi> making away some of his personal Estate out of the danger of the Spoylers, which he confessed to, is a Crime manifold more then any thing he hath yet proved against <hi>Mary Pennington</hi> touching this matter, or against <hi>George Fox</hi> in relation to it; and for <hi>William Rogers</hi> to be told of his own shrinking doings is his Torment and Grief, as his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Work demonstrates.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude this matter; when <hi>William Rogers</hi> brings Certificates under the Hands of those credible Friends he speaks of, relating to evil fact against <hi>George Fox,</hi> as he pretends to do, we shall take notice thereof, and be concerned as the case may require.</p>
                  <p>Some other reproachful smiting Speeches, which we shall pass by, <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath uttered in his Paraphrasing upon <hi>George Fox'</hi>s innocent plain Answer, to <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Charge against him touching this matter, (which we should be glad the honest hearted had the opportunity to see, which is in Manuscript produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, as occasion may offer it self) which hath been formerly spoken to, in the Answer to <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Rejoynder, more fully manifesting the notorious base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Spirit, and indeed we doubt not, but that <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s own Writings, and exposing to publick view in Print to Posterity, with what is already said herein, touching this matter, will sufficiently manifest the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other proof; let him beware, the Lord takes notice of his Doings and evil Speeches, who will repay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:94536:77"/>But to go on to the fourth Query (of his thirteen) or smiting Charge against <hi>George Fox, viz.</hi>

                  <p>The fifth Query, or smiting Charge, against <hi>George Fox,</hi> which, in his Reply, <hi>George Fox</hi> denieth as a malicious Suggestion, and false Inference, from the concern which <hi>George Fox</hi> had with him in <hi>Gloucestersbire,</hi> on which occasion <hi>William Rogers</hi> grounds the matter, and in his <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> wherein his proof should be produced, he concerneth himself on this wife.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now we say, what a Face hath <hi>William Rogers</hi> to charge <hi>George Fox</hi> with a Lye, for calling it <hi>a false malicious charge;</hi> seeing he hath brought forth nothing in his <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> whereby to prove the same, but that <hi>George Fox</hi> should say, Whisht, Whisht, <hi>And did I say nothing else:</hi> Oh! its sad to think what Wickedness the Man is given up to; and what scraffling he makes to his shame, to make the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent guilty, if any way he could.</p>
                  <p>But what can be gathered, that <hi>William Rogers</hi> would infer from <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Words, Whisht, Whisht, upon the hearing of the matter, which <hi>William Rogers</hi> grounds his smiting Query upon. <hi>First,</hi> Doth he think that <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Words <hi>Whisht, Whisht,</hi> tended to justifie his making over his visible Estate to his Servants to avoid Sufferings thereby, being a Man of a great Estate as he renders himself? <hi>Secondly,</hi> or doth he think that <hi>George Fox,</hi> would judge him to be a fit Man, to judge in the Meeting, about the affairs of the Church with such a Spirit, that had laid such an example before Friends, to let in weakness amongst them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to Truths Life, and the Glory of it? We say, surely neither of these things could be the tendency of the aforesaid Words: But according to what <hi>William Rogers</hi> consesseth <hi>George Fox</hi> saith in his Reply, <hi>Did I say nothing else: George Fox</hi> asked the Man, that gave that publick reproof, to <hi>William Rogers;</hi> whether he had given him Gospel order? Had he dealt with him in private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, before the brought it so publickly against him; and until that had been done <hi>George Fox</hi> was the less mindful, to make a publick examination of it, or debate about it. Or <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Dare <hi>William Rogers</hi> in his Conscience now say when he considers well (as he seems to Suggest in his <hi>Rejoynder) That</hi> George Fox <hi>was not mindful to (or durst not) discourse him about that matter; because he then put a stop to any publick debate about it,</hi> we hope <hi>William Rogers</hi> will not have that Impudence, as to make that conclusion about <hi>George Fox'</hi>s tenderness in that matter; for <hi>William Rogers,</hi> we suppose, cannot forget, that <hi>George Fox</hi> (as we also are insorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) discoursed him privately about it.</p>
                  <p>Much more tender discourse (as we understand) <hi>William Rogers</hi> may Remember passed in the said Meeting, to keep all cool, out of extreams, with an Eye to Gospel Order, that in all things we may be Decent, Comely and of good Report one unto another in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> as becomes the Gospel Day: Which may be seen by <hi>George Fox'</hi>s tender Answer by way of Reply,: to <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s simiting Queries, which <hi>William Rogers</hi> consutes not; but it stands clear in Evidence against him to his shame, as a palpable, down-right Accusation, and false malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Charge, and <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s concern therein, nauseous to Men of sober Spirits; and the Lye also that he would charge <hi>George Fox</hi> with, he himself evidently stands detected of.</p>

It had been well if in Moderation and Coolness he had laid the same to Heart, then would it have done him Good; but instead thereof, Grief hath risen, and in the Anguish of his Mind he hath quenched the good, and brought forth all this bad Stuff; <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s silence also in the matter of his proof demonstrateth the Bitterness and Venom of his Spirit to be such, that in the malide thereof he hath engaged himself at such an extravigant rate, as that he is not able to quit the concern in any Christian Repute, have gone far beyond the bounds thereof, to his shame amongst Men, and to the endangering his total Ruin, and the Destruction of his Soul forever, if with speed he Repent not, it were well if he could yet find any place for it.</p>

                  <p>The tenth Query — <hi>Whether it be fit for one that feeds on the Fat of the Land, and lives in fulness of Plenty, attended in many respects like an Earthly Prince, and hath Twelve or Thirteen Hundred Pounds, with the encrease thereof, well secured for many Tears (if any be) out of the reach of the Spoylers and Persecutors, to admonish a few Poor, Innocent, Harmless Friends, that may have three or four Cows apiece to feed themselves and Children, not to secure them from the Spoylers, and if it be not fit for such an one to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish, then I Query whether thou art not the Man that art so qualified, and who in effect hath so Admonished.</hi>

                  <p>Object. William Rogers <hi>says, for his Proof,</hi> That part of <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Answer is. The Lord knows I never had Twelve or Thirteen Hundred Pound secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>&amp;c, To which</hi> William Rogers <hi>says again,</hi> That <hi>George Fox</hi> denieth that he hath Twelve or Thirteen Hundred Pound secured, &amp;c.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> We say, this denial, and <hi>William Rogers</hi> not being able to prove the smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Accusation about this matter, proves the falshood of the Charge, and leaves him detected as a false Accuser.</p>
                  <p>But it appeareth that <hi>William Rogers</hi> is grieved, that <hi>George Fox</hi> doth not tell him how much he hath, and therefore most sad unchristian like and inhumane Work he makes with himself about this matter, whereby he cannot but incur to himself the reproach of Fools: It may be plainly seen, that the matter that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>William Rogers</hi> is, the Judgment of Truth through many Berthren that rests upon him for securing a great part of his Estate from the Spoilers in the time of Persecution on Truths account, and to avenge himself, in his discontent, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to make others as bad as himself, if he could; and <hi>George Fox</hi> is the Object in his Eye to revenge himself upon; he states his smiting Accusations by way of Query; its answered in the Negative; and if he could not prove the contrary, as he hath not attempted to do, this might have satisfied him, if he had been a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Man; but the unsatiableness of his revengeful Mind is such, that to get occasion to pervert, and to get matter of Accusation, in a busie unmanly Spirit he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>We say, let the man come forth that can lay Idleness or Sloth to his charge, and prove it against him; <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Aspersion toucheth him not: the calling that he was of, as a Man, he was diligent in, from his Youth, we are bold to say, whilest leisure permitted; let this stop <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Mouth; yea after the Lord made him in measure a Minister of the everlasting Truth (we are able to Evidence the same against <hi>William Rogers</hi> false charge) till the Lord brought him more to serve the Gospel, and the concern thereof became his Work (and might not serve Tables) and for the sake whereof, let the daily Exercise he hath had upon him, his many unwearied Travels, his Imprisonments in Dungeons, and nasty Places; his tedious and long Journeys beyond the Seas, watchings, and lying out of doors in the Night season, make <hi>William Rogers</hi> Blush to charge him with being not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious, when Health and Oppertunity served him; and his Travels of late Years, since bodily Weakness attended him, and much what upon his own charge, Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to his Zeal for the Gospel, and Care over the Churches of Christ, and clears the matter against all that <hi>William Rogers,</hi> or any whosoever with respect to Sloth, or making the Gospel chargeable, would lay to his charge.</p>
                  <p>It were well if <hi>William Rogers</hi> could justly say that <hi>John Story,</hi> whom he speaks so highly of (as none to exceed <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and him in Doctrine and life, that ever he heard of) in true diligence, with respect to Testimony and Service for Truth, which he had committed to his Charge, had cleared his Conscience in Gods Sight, as <hi>George Fox,</hi> hath done; or that he had kept the like Record and Interest in the Hearts of Gods Faithful Children, as <hi>George Fox</hi> at this Day pretionsly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; then would <hi>John Story</hi> never have been such an Exercise and occasion of Grief in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> as he and <hi>William Rogers</hi> have been, in heading a Separate Faction and backsliding sort, that a Spirit of strife and separation hath prevailed upon; and then would their account have been more easie to have been given, in the Day of the Great God, when the Books will be opened, and things laid to Charge; and the Lord will reckon with <hi>William Rogers</hi> sor his hard speeches, and the evil Deeds he hath done against the Lord and his Faithful People.

                  <p>And as to <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Accusation against <hi>George Fox,</hi> of having twelve or thirteen hundred pound, with the encrease thereof, well secured from the Spoylers; as he saith (if any be) he hath; let him bring his proof; let him name the Persons in whose Hands the aforesaid Money (well secured) is at Interest, and tell us where they dwell; let him not shuffle with his off's and on's, but tell us the names of such as will make this out against him, seeing he hath published such base Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Print to Posterity; or bring Certificates under the Hands of such as will take it upon them so to do; untill which time, it shall stand in our Eye (as we believe it will do with Thousands) as a false, malicious, smiting charge; all his cluttering Discourse on this wise falling to the Ground, as a Nauseous thing, not worth regarding.</p>

                  <p>As to the first part of this we say, <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath not proved the matters of Charge against <hi>George Fox,</hi> alledged in the preceeding Query; and therefore that which he asserts concerning him being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> (being no way-proved) it falls to the Ground; and this his conclusion therefore falls with it; for if <hi>George Fox</hi> be not the Man so qualified, nor under the same Circumstances the smiting Query relates to, then by <hi>William Rogers</hi> own Confession, he may be a Man not unfit to admonish others, and may Answer the Witness, in the Consciences of all those who knows him to be no such a one.</p>
                  <p>And as to the latter part of the Query, <hi>viz.</hi> that takes no more care for such as are in necessity upon Sufferings Account, or whose all may be gone for the Testimony of Truth; but only a bare saying (as <hi>William Rogers</hi> implys) <hi>Never heed, the fleece will grow again, Spread your Sufferings before the Judges, and the like</hi> — To this we say;</p>
                  <p>This is a malicious scornful charge indeed against <hi>George Fox,</hi> being the Man that in his Conscience he knows) he points at all along in his Discourse, and most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Smites at by Name: It is also false and Scandalous to our holy Profession and Christian care in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> as Hundreds will testifie to his shame, having a real knowledg, that <hi>George Fox</hi> is given up to serve the Lord, his Truth, and the meanest of his People, and that it hath been his particular concern, to take what possible care he could; for the helping of poor Friends, Suffering for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Truth; and that he himself doth frequently Administer unto such out of those outward things God hath given him, many have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

thereof, and do bear Record against these false Accusations, that <hi>William Rogers</hi> through his smiting Query doth charge him with; neither hath <hi>William Rogers</hi> in his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> brought any proof of this charge against him, but lets it alone, as if it had been none of his, which is an absurd naughty thing, very nauseous (to give him his own Words) to men of Honesty; but peradventure he'l fly to his Poor shift, <hi>(viz) He charged not; he only asketh the Question,</hi> which makes his Work the more ridiculous and absurd.</p>
                  <p>The twelsth Query which <hi>William Rogers</hi> seems to concern himself with, as to prove the matter of charge therein contained against <hi>George Fox</hi> is thus, (viz.)</p>

                     </gap> that Queries may be) and a plain Charge against <hi>George Fox</hi> its very clear; and we say in Answer to it, That Gods People being met together to Worship the Lord (for which cause sufferings attends them) although it might fall out that something might be spoken in Weakness in the said Meeting; yet being met in the Name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> the Lord is with them; and the sufferings that may attend the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, because thereof, is a Suffering for Truth, and the Lord will bless his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therein.</p>
                  <p>But what hath <hi>William Rogers</hi> to do to lay this weakness of <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> to <hi>George Fox'</hi>s charge, seeing <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> hath already cleared <hi>George Fox</hi> thereof, in a Paper sent to <hi>John Story,</hi> of acknowlegement of his weakness, touching the matter of <hi>John Story'</hi>s Death; confessing that instead of speaking of it temporally; he should have said Spiritually: In the said Paper he saith also, <hi>I am sore troubled that I did not let</hi> George Fox <hi>know of mine Intention with thee, for his Councel was ever pretious to me;</hi> this clear acknowledgement of his weakness, as also clearing of <hi>George Fox</hi> of it thus, together with <hi>George Fox'</hi>s utter denial thereof, and <hi>William Rogers</hi> privy to all this, bespeaketh absurdity in him, under the Circumstances that the matter now stands, to attempt to bring an Accusation against <hi>George Fox</hi> on <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> account; <hi>William Rogers</hi> also not able to prove any matter of evil fact chargeable on <hi>George Fox</hi> concerning it.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>William Rogers</hi> is not able to detect <hi>George Fox,</hi> in the matter of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Eccles'</hi>s weakness, touching <hi>John Story'</hi>s Death, he stretcheth the Line of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; and to make him an Offender any way, if possibly he could, he saith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>But didst not thou approve of this false Prophets going beyond the Seas in the Work of the Ministry?</hi> (not unlike the unbelieving persecuting <hi>Jews,</hi> who sought occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against <hi>Christ,</hi> that they might be avenged of him, for his Testimony for God against their Hypocrisie and Deceit, being a Torment to them, asked him Questions to make him a Witness against himself) And <hi>William Rogers</hi> forth-with Answers himself again thus; <hi>If thou deny</hi> (its best to be plain) <hi>such a denyal is like to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Is this the way of any Christian procedure in matters of Offences, thus to receive Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or otherwise to frame them out of the evil Suggestions of his corrupt Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heart? Its a shame to think what absurd work this is, and disorderly doings every way; Accusations received against an Elder, and no Christian dealing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thereunto; no Proof made, but — <hi>If thou deny it thy denial shall have no place with me,</hi> published up and down the Nation in Manuscript, and the Substance thereof put in Print to Posterity; surely God is visiting for these things, who will do justly, and recompence according to every ones Deeds: However, saith <hi>William Rogers, This denial may reasonably require an Answer to this Query,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether</hi> George Fox <hi>hath been so Industrious, to bar the Door against</hi> Solomon Eccles, <hi>for offering his gift, as he and others have been against</hi> John Wilkinson <hi>and</hi> John Story, <hi>for offering of theirs, though never proved false Prophets?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Charge which <hi>William Rogers</hi> would make matter of evil fact: In Answer thereunto, we say, Its true, it were not well if <hi>George Fox</hi> and others, had not done the same with the one as with the other, if there were the like Reason with respect to both; but we deny that there is the same occasion; for although <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> was overtaken with Weakness in a mis-apprehension concerning <hi>John Story's</hi> Death, yet he hath seen it, and acknowledged the same with Sorrow, as his Paper demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates; and who dares say, but that the Lord hath forgiven him, and shewed Mercy: Might <hi>Peter</hi> be no more concerned in the Gift of the Ministry, because he denyed his Master under a Weakness that was upon him, who acknowledged the same with Tears; but it is not thus with <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson;</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have been manifold more apparently weak, with respect to Truth, then <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> hath been, <hi>viz.</hi> in being obstructive to the Life and Power of <hi>Jesus,</hi> in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and in leading and encouraging a loose People against the wholesom Practices of the Faithful, relating to the Order and Discipline there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and have confederated with a number of unfaithful Men, to the working Strife and Distraction in the Flock and Heritage of God; and although they have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged weakness in Suffering times, and discouraged antient Testimonies for the Truth, as hath been evidently proved against them (though <hi>William Rogers</hi> fails in that matter) we know nothing yet of any real acknowledgement, by them to be made thereof; Yea it cannot be uttered what Mischief they have wrought (as woful experience testifies) Its absurd to make any Comparison betwixt <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> and them, as <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath done, although we own no false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nor Prophesies; but he that confesseth and forsaketh findeth Mercy; as <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> have not done: And as to false Prophesie, <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> if he do not shut his Eyes he may see himself detected in that matter, who Prophesied the scattering and breaking to pieces of those that were not of party with him and them in the opposite distracting Work they had in Hand; for the fulfilling of it (as they may see) falls on their own Heads many ways, when they whom he prophesied against keep their Habitation, in God through his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power; and are established in that which abides sure, and are fastened together in the Bond of Love, and the pure Fellowship (that the evil one hath no part in)

through the blessed Spirit which God hath given us, and in which he is known to be one, and his People one, Glory to his Name forevermore.</p>
                  <p>We cannot pass by one other part of the Charge, but take notice of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof, together with the following, and the last of <hi>William Rogers's</hi> thirteen Queries, and smiting Accusations, both of them being much what of the same Import, <hi>viz. Whether it be not better to secure ones outward Substance from the Spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, then to let it lye open to be taken for Fines imposed for the Preaching of such false Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>And whether it be not the Fruit of an enlightened <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, in those who are called Dark Spirits, to secure what they have from being taken away for Fines, imposed, for the Babling of such whose great Work is to rail against Faithful Friends,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer</hi> — This is an Accusation against <hi>George Fox,</hi> charging him as before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, with encouraging <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> the false Prophet, as he calleth him, and others, whom in effect he calls Bablers; and yet not any proof hath he made of these Charges, otherwise then to say, <hi>If thou deny it, this denial</hi> (saith he, its good to be plain) <hi>shall have no place in me;</hi> which indeed is far from any proof at all; and therefore shall the Accusation lye at his door, till he hath confessed or made better proof of the same; and who those are whose Preaching he calls Babling he tells us not; or who those Faithful he spakes of are that they cry against; in this also he is silent, and therefore the Accusations, by way of Query or otherwise, we tread upon, as not touching those he would smite at.</p>
                  <p>But however, these things tend to manifest his spirit, and fully to demonstrate the bottom of the whole Design, let his discourse, and the tendency of this Spirits Work be considered by judicious Men, (with respect to our Principle, our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for it, and our Practice accordingly) and by those who love the Truth, and would have the Testimony for it faithfully kept unto, such may easily discover what is in the Mans Heart, by what may be gathered out of his discourse on this wise; and his Practice of securing from the Spoylers, being thus pleaded for; doth he not clearly now demonstrate thereby, that he is opening a gap for a Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding shirking spirit to follow him in at, to let their Testimony for the Antient Truth fall: He manifests plainly that its his Grief (which hath occasioned all this smiting Work) that he cannot be let alone in his shrinking Work: The tendency of the design he hath in hand i to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and let loose an earthly Mind that would say, <hi>Pitty and save thy self,</hi> which hath been attempting to creep our from under Truths Yoke these many Years, in some Professors of the Truth, both in the <hi>North</hi> and in the <hi>South,</hi> which the Lord is manifesting and casting out of the Camp, that the approved may remain, to enjoy Blessings which the Lord gives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Rogers,</hi> for his Advantage in this matter, hath laboured to make others as bas as himself, with what false Accusations he can under any tollerable colour devise; and when the course he takes on that wise fails him, his spirit he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hide, nor the corrupted matter in the Bottle hold, but at lest opens him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self plainly, and thereby bewrays their whole Cause, and the Design they have in Hand.</p>
                  <p>It appears now there was need enough, for the Caution, Admonition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof which <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Paper related to, (in relation to such as were thus enclined, which hath been a Grief to <hi>William Rogers</hi> and others too) and the Wisdom of God hath been greatly seen therein; for it hath occasioned the venting of the old Bottle, and given a discovery of the Spirit and Design of this Backsliding sort, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94536:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
manifested it to every single Eyes that may have occasion to take notice thereof, what they aim at, and where they would be; it will hedge up their way, Blessed be the Lord, and be a means to scatter them, and their devises too, that would have scattered and laid waste the Heritage of God.</p>
                  <p>Let the honest Reader weigh his Words, and he may see his Height, and his Bottom Fathom: He asketh now, <hi>Whether it be not better to Secure then suffer on such or such Accounts, as aforesaid?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be seen securing is in his Eye, being scated in his heart, and in the Hearts of others, his Consederates too, their Works manifest it.</p>
                  <p>We say it is our belief (having the Reward of Peace therein) and we have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Hearts of Gods People, Its best to be Faithful to the Testimony recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God, and make no provision for the Flesh, to satisfie its Lusts; and trust him, without whose Providence not a Sparrow falls to the Ground, and suffer joyfully the Spoying of our Goods, if the Lord see meet, as the Faithful of old did.</p>
                  <p>If Friends should secure aforehand, least a false Prophet should come, or some Bablers, as <hi>William Rogers</hi> calls some, (but he tells us not who he means of that he is making provision against) should come amongst us, who might cause Fines to be imposed, and produce Sufferings thereby: If this be justifiable, as his Practice and talk implys; then <hi>William Rogers,</hi> instead of asking the Query, might positively assert, that it may be done, and consequently by this Argument, Friends are to do it; because its not unlike (as there were false Prophets under the Law, in the dayes of Christ and the Apostles dayes, and that they saw such would come) but that false Prophets probably may be in our day, and in Generations to come; and then instead of taking notice of Christs saying, <hi>Take no care, he cloathes the Lilies, and feedech the Ravens,</hi> &amp;c. And of the Apostle's saying, <hi>Make no provision for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> by <hi>William Rogers</hi> Argument, it might have been said, <hi>its better to secure:</hi> And if the matter be thus, why was it not intimated to the Saints, in Christ and the Apostles dayes, to secure from the spoylers, lest such should come? yea, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they saw they would come; and why did they, or had they occasion to suffer the spoyling of their Goods joyfully?</p>
                  <p>And that Spirit in <hi>William Rogers,</hi> which, because that accidentally a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet may come amongst us, would secure outward Estates, lest Sufferings should come by reason of such, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the same that hath wrought in those Apostates from Truth, that have absented from the Assemblies of Gods People, who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made a plea for their so doing, because such or such came amongst us, that they liked not; and <hi>W. R.</hi> saith, <hi>its better to secure,</hi> because such there are whose Preaching he calls Babling, by reason of whom it may fall out that Sufferings might come; This is the Spirit that said, <hi>Master, pitty thy self,</hi> and is shut out behind the Vail that they have drawn over their Eyes, and under which the Temptation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that leads back into the flesh through Unbelief, which the Lake is for that burns forever. Oh, let them who love the Truth, and the Peace that hath no end, and desire the Riches that corrupt not, laid up for the Faithful to God, where Spoylers cannot come, nor Thieves break through and steal, beware of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is the second Beast that comes out of the Earth, and leadeth thither again; they that Runs may see it, it bewrayeth it self in all its undertakings, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> on its own Ruin; Blessed are they who fear God and love his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:94536:83"/>And as for that Reflection which <hi>R. W.</hi> casteth upon <hi>George Fox</hi> upon the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of <hi>James Nayler'</hi>s fall; he cautioning <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> lest they should become as bad as the old Apostates before them, their Examples. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancing amongst others, <hi>James Nayler'</hi>s darkened and hardned State; by reason of which he became the Grief of many, and a great Stumbling Block in the way of Truth, to the hurting of many simple Ones, and the utter undoing of some, to the causing the Name of the Lord to be evil spoken of, by such as became harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby; <hi>William Rogers</hi> would make an Accusation against <hi>George Fox</hi> on this score; because <hi>James Nayler</hi> came to be restored again.</p>
                  <p>Surely it may be said, there is much more Malice then Matter in this against <hi>George Fox,</hi> who did no otherwise in this case, then the holy Men of God have done, who gave forth the Scriptures, who have left on Record <hi>Noah'</hi>s <hi>David'</hi>s, <hi>Manasse'</hi>s, <hi>Peter'</hi>s, Fallings, to be a Caution to others; and <hi>James Nayler'</hi>s, and others fall, and cause of Reproach to Truth in this our day, is <hi>William Rogers</hi> and <hi>John Story'</hi>s and <hi>John Wilkinson'</hi>s Example, and if they were not hardened they might see it, and take heed, lest at last it come to be with them, as it happened to most of other Apostates, to their Total Ruin; and <hi>James Nayler'</hi>s Restoration was the joy of the Faithful to God; and so would the Restoration of them be; which hath been truely sought for.</p>
                  <p>And thus much concerning <hi>William Rogers</hi> Catalogue of his thirteen Queries, manifested to be smiting Accusations; and so his Thirteen Lyes, which he would have detected <hi>George Fox</hi> of, are wiped away; the reward of the Slanderous wicked Work he hath had in hand, on that score, to turn back upon his own Head:</p>
                  <p>And that they are False and Malicious, its plainly demonstrated to every Eye; thats single to God (without prejudice or watching for evil against the Innocent) that may have occasion to inspect the same, together with <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Answer thereunto; in which he hath denyed them all as False and Malicious, and not touching him; to which Answer, <hi>William Rogers</hi> undertaking to Rejoyn, in order to prove the Accusations alledged by him, falls totally short in the matter thereof; and all his Evasions Pervertings and drawing his false Inferences upon <hi>George Fox'</hi>s innocent and plain Words, doth not serve his turn in the sight of the upright to God, to make out any matter of Fact against him, as the Answer to his Rejoynder here inserted plainly demonstrateth; and so leaves <hi>William Rogers</hi> detected as a Treacherous Man to his Principle, and his first love to Truth, and the unity of Brethren, a false malicious Accuser of the Innocent, a shame to Christianity, and not fit for human Societies; whom the Lord will recken with for all, in a day that hasteneth on, which he cannot evade.</p>
                  <p>But to go on, it may be noted, that <hi>William Rogers</hi> is not satisfied with his Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Queries and smiting Accusations against <hi>G. Fox;</hi> but, raising up more matter on the same score, goes on and says, <hi>Now I take notice of what</hi> George Fox <hi>sayes to my Query,</hi> [Note, Its inserted in his Paper of smiting Queries which <hi>George Fox</hi> gave Answer to] viz. <hi>Whether thou</hi> George Fox <hi>didst not advise</hi> Nathaniel Cripps, <hi>to buy off his</hi> Tythes, <hi>both of Priest and Impropriator; if thou deny it, I will undertake to prove it, or bring it under the hand of</hi> Nathaniel Cripps <hi>that thou so did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> This is an high charge, as the rest were, its expected that <hi>William Rogers</hi> make good proof thereof, more especially seeing, that contrary to all Gospel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he hath been concerned in the publication thereof, as said before.</p>

                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:94536:84"/>The Reader may take notice, that <hi>William Rogers,</hi> for proof of this smiting charge, repeats some part of <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Answer, which he thinks may most help his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in this matters, <hi>viz.</hi> — <hi>But for him to turn this, and say, I advised him to buy his</hi> Tythes, <hi>he doth me a great deal of wrong, and so might have been sparing to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And when <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath said all, as to his Proof he confesseth that the Import of <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Words is a denial; therefore, saith he, <hi>I think it needful, here to recite not only</hi> Nathaniel Cripps <hi>his Certificate and Testimony in that case; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Testimony of</hi> Robert Arch <hi>in Relation to</hi> George Fox's <hi>advising him also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Answer,</hi> This Certificate, although it may seem to have some weight in it, to <hi>William Rogers,</hi> and such as watcheth for Evil against the Innocent; Yet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to many considerable Circumstances, that very remarkably appertain to it, together with the inward sence that lives upon our Souls in Relation to <hi>George Fox's</hi> clearness touching this matter; we cannot but signifie that we cannot give any credit to it. <hi>First,</hi> Because it cannot be reasonably gathered, why <hi>George Fox,</hi> who is, and hath been found a Man of great Integrity of Heart, both in this and other his Testimonies for Truth, without ever being Impeached by any of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to God, that ever we have yet heard of, although the Disobedient, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, that backslde from the Life of Truth, have been ever running upon him on this wise; we say, wherefore he should advise any so to do, we see not, It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so far below his known Integrity; as also far Remote from his frequent Advice to his dearest Friends. Secondly, In as much as that he that stands approved in the Conscience of the upright to God, gives a plain, sincere and positive denial thereof. Thirdly It being alledged in Charge against him, by one that was not Faithful himself to God in that Testimony, having as we understand payed the Impropriator his <hi>Tythes</hi> all along; and therefore not excuseable himself in God's sight touching that matter; all which being weighed in the equal Ballance, and just Measure we would give to all Men, we have sufficient ground in our selves to believe the one rather then the other. And besides, what occasion was there for this Advice, being he declared it was his Judgment to pay the Impropriator his <hi>Tythes?</hi> And to advise him to buy off the Priests <hi>Tythes,</hi> that he would never do, <hi>George Fox</hi> knowing well enough, that those were not to be bought, the Priest having no state of Inheritance therein, but at longest during Life, or his enjoying of the Benefit that the <hi>Tythes</hi> belonged to; therefore its plain here is Confusion, which makes the Certificate very inconsistant with it self. <hi>Nathaniel Cripps</hi> also being under a jumble in his own Mind about the matter, as not seeing the evil of paying the Impropriator his <hi>Tythes,</hi> might easily mis-apprehend <hi>George Fox</hi> in the Discourse which it appears they had touching such things, his old Age also being considered, and the time of the said Discourse, nigh Twenty Years before the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faid Certificate (as we understand) was given forth by him; his Remembrance with respect to the Circumstances relating to it, might easily fail him, and leave him under on incapacity of giving a just Relation concerning it: This is the most charitable Construction, that we can give of what relates to him touching this matter; which we are enclined rather to take hold on, then to render him one that would wickedly bely the Innocent on purpose, although he leaves a sufficient ground of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, by making himself a Party with <hi>William Rogers,</hi> viz. <hi>an Accuser,</hi> as the latter part of his Certificate doth Import; and that which makes the case much worse, in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94536:85"/>
relation to him, is, that we cannot understand, that ever before he gave forth this certificate and smiting Charge against <hi>George Fox</hi> he did discourse <hi>George Fox</hi> about it, to inform himself concerning it, where the Mistake might lye betwixt them, or to see, if <hi>George Fox</hi> had been faulty in that matter, what satisfaction he would have given him and the Truth, before he came to be so publickly informed against, and judged, nor that ever <hi>Nathaniel Cripps</hi> told <hi>George Fox</hi> what he intended to do concerning the same: And that which we would ask <hi>William Rogers</hi> is, whether ever he had the Examination of this matter (according to Gospel Order, and the rule of Justice before Judgment be given) betwixt them Face to Face, and the Accused to have Liberty to Answer for himself? did he examine all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that might relate to it, and alter the case, in order to a clear understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the matter before the Judgment was given, and put upon Record by him to posterity? It is a very remarkable saying of one — <hi>He that shall Judge and Determine of a matter, the one Party being not heard, although he shall Judge aright; yet he is not a Just Judge,</hi> meaning if the Judgment do not go against him that is heard. And this also may be pertinently observed, that <hi>William Rogers,</hi> contrary to Gospel allowance, hath received an Accusation against an Elder upon one single Evidence with respect to time, place and occasion, and given Judgment upon the same, and put it in Print to remain on Record to Posterity: We might insert <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Answer to this Charge against him, it being in Manuscript, which would clearly demonstrate, his Innocency therein, and the occasion of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course betwxt <hi>Nathaniel Cripps</hi> and him about this matter, and the very words that passed betwixt them concerning it which are not yet denied, though the Manuscript hath been abroad two Years time, which plainly makes out, that there was not the least ground for any such Accusation to be made against him or the Account thereof, but the same being inserted in the Treatise formerly made mention of, subscribed by <hi>Ellis Hookes;</hi> together with a full and pertinent Answer to this matter relating to <hi>Nathaniel Cripps;</hi> we shall not again insert the same, but refer the Reader to the said Treatise in Print, being an Answer to <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s <hi>Christian Quaker;</hi> as also to <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Answer in Manuscript to <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s <hi>smiting Queries,</hi> of which this was one.</p>

                     <hi>Answer,</hi> What credit this Certificate shall have in the Hearts of the Wise and Faithful to God we see not, and we can commit the same to such to be weighed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Robert Arch</hi> signifies, That one time when <hi>George Fox</hi> was at his House, and as he remembers it was at the same time when he was concerned in setting up Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meetings, and some Papers or Epistles, as Instructions in relation thereunto, was read at the same time, which <hi>George Fox</hi> had given forth, <hi>In which their was Written,</hi> saith he, <hi>as I remember, that such Friends as did pay</hi> Tythes <hi>should be Exhorted or Admonished;</hi> and at the same time was it, saith he, that <hi>George Fox</hi> advised him to buy his <hi>Tythes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We say, this matter laid to his Charge, as that which should be his Advise, is so far remote from his known Testimony and Practice, that not a Faithful Man in the Nation, we believe, will give any credit to it: Besides, can any think, that <hi>George Fox</hi> should be so Indiscreet and Inconsistant with himself, and his own Papers of Directions and Advise, as to order such his Papers to be read, and Friends to be advised to practice accordingly, and he himself forth-with, at the same time, (if this were true concerning him) to throw down what he seemed to build up; this were such Confusion as we never heard spoken of him from any faithful Man, or could it be expected, that any Work begun on this wise could ever cone to ought; and that <hi>George Fox</hi> should advise him to buy off the Priests <hi>Tythes,</hi> is a ridiculous thing to Charge him with, there is no colour for it, being the Priest hath them not to sell; and if <hi>William Rogers,</hi> or <hi>Nathaniel Cripps,</hi> and <hi>Robert Arch,</hi> (his two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers) in two several Countries, could prove it against <hi>George Fox,</hi> that he had at any time declared it to be his Judgment, <hi>That Impropriators Tythes in this Gospel Dispensation ought to be paid,</hi> (as it seems the two Informers have declared it to be theirs) it were something to the matter; but as to that we say, His many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Testimonies have been very publickly as well as privately against Tythes in the Ground, and his said Paper of Direction touching that Case hath that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency in it, without any exception: Upon all which Considerations it can never be supposed that <hi>George Fox</hi> would give forth such Advise; but that this Mans Darkness, through his Unfaithfulness in the matter of Tythes as aforesaid, being such, in Charity we may suppose, that he hath been under a great mistake in himself about this matter, otherwise it must needs be either gross Wickedness or Forgetfulness at the least, that caused him thus to insert in Charge against <hi>George Fox,</hi> and not from real cause by him given them, it being so far inconfistant with his Integrity and Nobility in the Truth, and readiness to lay down for his Testimony in this case, whatever might be otherwise dear to him; therefore what reason <hi>George Fox</hi> should have to advise these two unfaithful Men thus, or what occasion either, (seeing it was their Principle or Practice so to do, contrary to his own professed Testimony and Life, as Thousands in many parts of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other Nations will evidence) for our own parts we say, we are yet to Learn.</p>
                  <p>We are sorry that these two Men should do so unehristianly with themselves and their Friend that wished them well, as not to let <hi>George Fox</hi> know (before they iutended to give forth such Charges against him, and put them into the Hands of such a professed and openly declared Enemy to <hi>George Fox</hi> and the Life of Truth, and Gospel Order) what they were about to do; this manifested a wrong Spirit, and great Weakness as to Truth, that was less enclined to obey and serve the Truth, and to keep their Testimony clear therein, then to gratifie such
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94536:86"/>
a watching for Evil, as <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath appeared in, to get something any way to smite and accuse withal.</p>
                  <p>But as it was very pertinently Queried, in the Treatise called, <hi>The Accuser of our Brethren cast down, &amp;c.</hi> We desire to know who it was that desire these two Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates from these two Men in Charge against <hi>George Fox,</hi> or whether they ever intended or expected that they should be put forth against him in Print? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were not subtilly drawn from them, and that such as dealt with them in that matter have not betrayed them therein? For as we understand two publick Friends asked <hi>Nathaniel Cripps,</hi> Whether it was his Advise and Consent, that his said Certificate, concerning <hi>George Fox'</hi>s advising him to buy his <hi>Tythes</hi> Twenty Years ago, should be made use of against <hi>George Fox?</hi> or whether he gave <hi>William Rogers</hi> any order to publish the same in Manufcript to the Nation, as he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to do? and whether he did not say in Answer, <hi>No sure, I gave no such advise, I knew nothing of his so doing; He had no order from me to spread it further then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it at</hi> Bristol, <hi>if there was occasion, when</hi> George Fox <hi>went down thither,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not expecting it should go any futher.</hi> We further desire that <hi>Nathaniel Cripps</hi> and <hi>Robert Arch</hi> be minded, whether they be not bound in Conscience to bear a Testimony against <hi>William Rogers</hi> for his treacherous unbrotherly dealing with them, that have brought such an Accusation against an Elder and Antient in Truth on their score, and not first let them know, that they might have given <hi>George Fox,</hi> in the first place, the priviledge of an Elder, or a Brother in relation to Gospel Order, as the Truth and Christian Society necessarily requires.</p>
                  <p>William Rogers <hi>in his Rejoynder to</hi> George Fox's <hi>Reply saith,</hi> Now it remains that I say somthing concerning <hi>George Fox'</hi>s departure out of the Meeting in <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mead,</hi> in the City of <hi>Bristol,</hi> in the time of Persecution.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It may be noted, that this smiting Accusation (which <hi>George Fox</hi> utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth, as in his Answer may be seen) <hi>William Rogers</hi> asserts upon the sight of his own Eyes, with many more as he saith.</p>

                     <hi>William Rogers</hi> makes a great ado about this, and says, <hi>He that runs may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now we say to remove this Ambiguity, and also to manifest <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s watching for occasion, in which into Confusion and Mistakes he runs himself; It may be noted that these two Relations appertain to two several distinct Meetings, at one of which when the Officers came in <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> was speaking, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94536:89"/>
they took him away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And at the other, into which no Officers came, when <hi>George Fox</hi> came in, <hi>Margaret Thomas</hi> was speaking, and afterwards ceasing, <hi>George Fox</hi> kept the Meeting, as it was said in quietness till the end of it, which Meeting the aforesaid charge of flying we perceive relates to; these two distinct Meetings and Occasions may be easily observed out of <hi>George Fox'</hi>s two former Answers, which <hi>William Rogers,</hi> but for his haste and lusting to Envy, might have seen, and thereby had occasion to have covered his bussing distracted Spirit; if <hi>William Rogers</hi> deny this, it may be further cleared, as occasion may be seen.</p>
                  <p>And now touching <hi>George Fox'</hi>s coming to <hi>Bristol</hi> to the Meeting, on the Account whereof <hi>William Rogers</hi> lays his Charge against him — <hi>George Fox</hi> saith, <q>I lay at <hi>Edward Pyot'</hi>s House, a little way out of the City, and that Morning several Friends came from <hi>Bristol,</hi> and desired me not to come to the Meeting that day, for the Souldiers intended to come, and said also, <hi>What were they? if they were taken it were no great Matter; but they would not have me to come except I were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now this plain and honest Relation (as in Christian Charity we look upon it to be) being considered upon, which <hi>William Rogers</hi> also contradicteth not, though he labours abusively to mar the Face thereof; we say again, by leaving out many of <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Words in his reciting thereof; and so making his own Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereupon, and thence most inhumanly infers; we desire it may be observed, whether it may not be reasonably concluded, that the Charge <hi>W. R.</hi> hath framed up, is not only absolutely false, as the foregoing Certificate under the hands of so many honest impartial Friends (manifold over-ballancing what <hi>W. Rogers'</hi>s indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, smiting and accusing Certifiers have said) doth demonstrate; but that also the Charge is notoriously wicked, with respect to the Circumstances observeable upon the Exercise that <hi>George Fox</hi> had amongst Friends that day, touching this matter, as his tender Relation doth declare; signifying how he was wrought upon to have kept him from the Meeting that day, by some of the most eminent Friends then amongst them, and several more; and yet notwithstanding all, in that he did go,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94536:90"/>
signifies, that he was of such a Spirit as contemned the least shrinking in Suffering times; although <hi>William Rogers,</hi> this grand Accuser of the Brethren, is basely Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that matter, as he hath confessed, by making away his personal Estate, that the Spoilers might not come thereat. And what silly Malicious Work this appears to be, seeing <hi>Thomas Goldney'</hi>s Wife (a principal Friend at that day (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Mary North</hi>) who probably might be privy to these Transactions, that she may asperse the Innocent, if she could any way do it) thus bewrays her own Husband's weakness, with the rest of them, on this wise! And if these, before made mention of, had prevailed upon <hi>George Fox,</hi> to have got him that day to have stayed from the Meeting, as they laboured to do, what Work would they have made of it, its easie to see.</p>
                  <p>And let it be considered whether this case in relation to <hi>George Fox'</hi>s supposed Weakness in Suffering times (and yet not proved) can in any respect be comparable to <hi>John Story'</hi>s leaving the Meeting, to the grief of Friends, when Souldiers were at the Door, ready to break in, and hid himself in an upper Room, tell the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were gone, and took some Prisoners with them; and in leading a simple Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by his example and allowance thereof, into holes and hidden places upon the Commons in Suffering times, which hath been to the grief of the said Meeting, as many of them have since confessed, and condemned the same; although <hi>John Story</hi> and some more justified it.</p>
                  <p>And although <hi>William Rogers</hi> is not a shamed, but hath the impudence to charge <hi>George Fox</hi> upon the Evidence of, <hi>If reports be true,</hi> to be the greatest flyer in time of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

R.</hi> and the rest of the factious sort, that have occasioned Discord and Trouble in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> in opposition to the Life of Truth, and the Unity of dear Brethren; and <hi>W.

                     <hi>William Rogers</hi> makes an Accusation against <hi>George Fox</hi> also by a smiting Query concerning a Meeting at <hi>Ringwood,</hi> which <hi>George Fox</hi> was at many Years ago, charging him about his flying there, and undertakes here to concern himself with it, that he may find Work for his smiting Tongue, which Accusation being denyed by <hi>George Fox,</hi> in relation to any evil fact done by him touching the same; and <hi>William Rogers</hi> expected to have made sufficient proof thereof, which in his <hi>Rejoynder</hi>

                     <hi>Answer,</hi> Whether this be not sorry Work, let him bethink himself, and then speak, he surely loves to be busie one way or other, when such poor drudgery Work as this he is glad to be concerned in; We say his Charges being False and Malicious, according to <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Words, he weighs them as a little thing, they touch him not, and all he can say against him, when he hath said his worse, he treadeth up on, without notice taken of them, as to hurt his Life or break his Peace with God, or lesten his Repute amongst the Faithful; he may go on, and what he hath to do, do it quickly, for his time is far spent, and the Damnation slumbers not.</p>

That those who were not of Party with</hi> John Story <hi>and him in opposition to Church Care, but testified thereunto in the Name of God should be broke to pieces?</hi> A poor shift indeed! which <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> can never thank him for, for it brings his Testimony and Prophesie into the Dust, if the fulfilling of it must center in this: But what doth <hi>William Rogers</hi> say in relation to the dealings of Almighty God concerning the Rebellious, that are not worthy of the Lords for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and long suffering towards them, nor their Works worth taking notice of? and yet the Lord waits to be Gracious, and would heal their Backslidings, as was testified of from him in relation to the backsliding <hi>Jews:</hi> Let him take heed of bringing the Power and Kindness of the Lord under his Judgment, for the Lord will not hold him Guiltless in so doing: Dare <hi>William Rogers</hi> say, That the Lord was divided against himself in the exercise he had with them far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their deserts, or any worthiness in them of the Mercies that waited over them?

                     <hi>William Rogers</hi> may know that its their own Case, and is coming on their own Heads, they are in a divided Spirit, broken off from the Life of God, and Unity of Brethren in the Spirit of Truth; and many of their own Pertakers comes away with joy, their Kingdom totters, whose fall will be great, its Foundation is rotten, &amp; it cannot stand; several of the few of them that remain are beholding with fear, the Structure which they have! framed, &amp; are making a way to escape with their Lives: They who love the Lord and Righteousness will quit their Hands of this ungodly Work that <hi>William Rogers</hi> is so disperate in, let him look about, and those few that yet sticks to it, many are cut off on every Hand, and the Hearts of the great Ones begin to fail them, for they can find no Hands in the day of Battel; God of a Truth will blast their Design forever, let them go whither they will for help, its all in vain, the Desolation of their Spirits Work is determined of God, and they'l perish forever, if they repent not: The wise in Heart sees how they are looking about them for help any way, and bemoan them for the ancient Glories sake that some of them were covered with.</p>
                  <p>Let <hi>William Rogers</hi> be asked what he says of his great Confederates at <hi>Chippen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> the place of <hi>John Stories</hi> great Interest? and what he says of their Letter sent to <hi>Jeofrey Bullock</hi> in <hi>Suffock,</hi> the old Apostate, that was publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied of Friends for denying that <hi>Christ</hi> that dyed at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and hath been a publick opposer of Truth in Friends Meetings several Years: In which Letter they applaud him, and his Blasphemous Books, being (as they say) affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and desires Correspondency with him, and to have some of his Books, in opposition to the <hi>Foxman</hi> Party and Orders, as they contemptuously speak of him and the Churches Care; we may have occasion hereafter to insert the aforesaid Letter to <hi>Jeofrey Bullock,</hi> and discover his Spirit by the Works thereof: <hi>William Rogers</hi> and them of Party with him may think their Case sad and disparate, when <hi>Jeofrey Bullock</hi> (and the Apostate <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> who spreads abroad <hi>Jeofrey Bullock'</hi>s Books against Truth, and the Friends of it) becomes <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94536:92"/>
his Confederates Friend to associate with, and they are glad to solicit him to their aid, as their letter to him plainly imports; surely it may be said, their case is bad, and their Design can never be blessed, thats upheld by such a spirit as this; Oh it were well if any of them would yet truely be turned to God, that they might yet be healed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Rogers</hi> further goes on his smiting Work against <hi>George Fox,</hi> which he takes occasion to appear in, from some of <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Words, and saith he; — <hi>Now I come to take notice, of a Postscript written by</hi> George Fox <hi>in these words,</hi> viz. <hi>Here follows mine Epistle that hath touched thee</hi> [meaning the Epistle to Friends (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly inserted) relating to faithfulness in the time of Persecution] <hi>which</hi> (saith <hi>George Fox</hi> to <hi>William Rogers) thou makest all this Work and Writing about; who would make me Inconsistant with my self; and so mightst thou have done the Apostle, who one while Circumcised and afterward forbad it; who one while said they should not judge one another about dayes, and Meats and Drinks, and afterward judged them for it, who made it their Principle so to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These few Lines (<hi>saith</hi> William Rogers) do manifest that <hi>George Fox</hi> doth not divide and distinguish as he ought to do, if he be not Ignorant of the Scriptures, and of what I have writ, and what his Name is to: <hi>And to prove what he seems to hold forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> George Fox, <hi>he saith,</hi> I find no where that ever the Apostle forbad Circumcision in the same case in which he practised it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> Its to be admired what this Man would fetch up, or frame matter of to smite with (though thereby he demonstrates sometimes his own folly) for we say, where doth <hi>George Fox</hi> say that the Apostle did so: Nay we do affirm that <hi>George Fox</hi> doth plainly shew that the Apostle did not forbid Circumcision on the same Account, or in the same case in which he practised it: and so for <hi>William Rogers,</hi> to say he finds it so no where, is the same, and no otherwise then what <hi>George Fox</hi> saith; wherein then is <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Ignorance of Scriptures, and what his Name is to, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> If <hi>William Rogers</hi> knew rightly what himself says, he might see how he runs himself into Confusion, and makes himself Work with his own Shaddow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>George Fox</hi> intimates, that the case in which the Apostle practised Circumcision, and tenderly bore it for a season, was because of the hardness of the Hearts of some (in the days of the Churches infancy and gathering to God, that could not easily be brought off from Circumcision; and least his very much pressing the unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of it, might have hardened some that used it, against the Truth; and because also of the tenderness of some others that had made some Conscience of it, in Zeal (though without knowledge, as some of the <hi>Jews</hi> were said to have) therefore also did he forbear, and some little practise it; and bid the believing <hi>Jews</hi> in the day of that weakness amongst them, to be cautious of judging one another therein, and in Meats and Drinks, and the like. These were the Cases in which the Apostle practised Circumcision, and bore with the tenderly weak in those matters.</p>
                  <p>And the other case in which the Apostle judgeth them in, it was (as <hi>George Fox</hi> says) when some who were come to see the nothingness of Circumcision, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Days, and the like, with respect to a Gospel Dispensatiou, and Salvation by Christ Jesus, and not of Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and afterwards turned thither again, pretending it to be their principle, and make a Sect of it: Then the Apostle expressly forbad it,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94536:92"/>
saying, <hi>If you be Circumcised Christ shall prosit you nothing,</hi> and he said also — <hi>And now after you have known God,</hi> or rather are known of God, <hi>how turn you back agaid into these Beggarly Rudiments, the observing of Days, and the like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is one thing, we say, in the Infancy of Truth not to see ones way out of the practice of some things Erroneous, and an Exercise of Conscience may be in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereunto; In which case great forbearance, and render dealing with such in the Spirit of Meekness is profitable.</p>
                  <p>Its another cause when after Convincement, and an understanding be given of the evil and unprofitableness of some thing in order to Life and Peace; and yet to stand in the Observation of those things; or being once redeemed therefrom to turn back thither again, and say its their Principle, and make a Sect of it; in this case Truths Authority comes to be exercised, and the Judgment thereof placed: And this is the substance of what <hi>George Fox</hi> intimates touching this matter which <hi>William Rogers</hi> makes so much quarrelling about.</p>
                  <p>And had the case on <hi>William Rogers, John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> their Account in Relation to Church Care, Government and Order therein (which all this ado hath been made against by them) been the case of tenderness, or want of seeing the necessity thereof, because of the Infancy as to Truth, that they might have been in; and that they had been tender in their Spirits under a fear to have offended the Lord, his Church and People, undet a mistake in themselves (that Simplicity would have been Jealous of) then would they not have wanted all possible forbearance every way, to have done them good; but this was not their case in any respect, as their Testimonies and Works demonstrate: They were not the Weak in their own Eyes, for when they were in the first Love they were not ignorant of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Church Care, Order and Government amongst Gods People in this Gospel day; Witness <hi>William Rogers</hi> Subscription amongst many Brethren to a Paper for the promoting the same, and encouraging Friends therein, inserted in the first part of this Treatise; and <hi>John Story</hi> his hand amongst the Brethren also on the same Score; <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> owning the Papers given forth by <hi>George Fox</hi> as Directions touching the same, as very good and useful to be practised: They were not humble and passive in the day when they begun to stumble thereat, and turned back there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from to indulge a wrong Spirit in a fleshly ease in themselves, and such as hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, or were gratified thereby; much need not be said here, what is already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in this is sufficient to satisfie touching this matter; and <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Book also fully demonstrates what obstructions he lays in the way of it, and what contempt he puts upon the care in the Church of God, used amongst the faithful, that all this cluttering Work hath been made by them against; in a word, they are manifested to be such, as are gone back again from their first Love and Aeal for Truth, and the Power thereof; and the concerns of the Churches Advantage and Peace is not of weight upon them; but the old liberty in the fleshly part is that they would be indulged in, wherein Antient Testimonies for the Truth comes to be departed from, to the dishonour of Truth, and the holy way of God, to the Grief of God's People who keeps faithful to him; and this is the case that the Truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow any such in, but the Judgment thereof, in the Spirit of <hi>Jesus,</hi> wherein Authority and Rule, stands is placed there.</p>
                  <p>But again, to the matter we were upon; Let us see from what, touching <hi>George Fox'</hi>s instancing <hi>Pauls</hi> sometimes using and allowing Circumcision, and in some cases judging it, <hi>William Rogers</hi> fetcheth his smiting blows against him, for that's the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94536:93"/>
Work he is concerned in; <hi>William Rogers</hi> infers from this, and saith, <hi>It appears, that the actings in some things according to ones Principle in matters of Conscience were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable; when the practising things not according to ones Principle in matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science might be justifiable in</hi> George Fox'<hi>s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> we say, this is a gross Perversion of <hi>George Foxs'</hi>s Words, and a false Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication from the Apostles Practice, and <hi>George Fox'</hi>s instance, nor any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible there-from: And we require <hi>William Roger,</hi> if he can, to make it out, that ever <hi>George Fox,</hi> or any of them that are of his Spirit, and in Fellowship with him, ever justified any in the practice of things against their Consciences, or disallowed any thing practised by any who acted the same from a clear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But what is this in Vindication of their practizing in Opposition to Church Care, and the Government of the Spirit instrumentally in the Church of God? although they may say its their Principle so to do, or they are not perswaded in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to Act otherwise; Certain it is, that this is a false application from the Apostles Practice, and <hi>George Fox'</hi>s instance, in relation to the allowing of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision amongst the Weak for a time, in the Infancy of the Church of Christ in his day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> William Rogers says, for as much as <hi>George Fox</hi> instanceth the matter of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision; as if the practice or not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Several things more might be observed (which we shall pass by) from <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s paraphrasing; on <hi>George Fox'</hi>s tender Discourse which he calls his <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script;</hi> whereby to manifest <hi>William Rogers</hi> to be given up to serve a quarrelling Spirit, contending against the simplicity of the naked Truth, and the Innocent to God, who keep in the Power; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Some other things there are in <hi>William Roger's</hi> aforesaid Book relating to charge against <hi>George Fox</hi> and other Brethren, which do not come so much within the compass of our knowledge; but that some others may have a more perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, neither are we in that Capacity, with respect to distance from the places where the Passages relating thereunto, have been transacted, and therefore uncapeable for the examination and finding out what matter of Fact can be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on the score thereof, against those whom in the matter of Charge <hi>William Rogers</hi> points at; therefore we shall leave them to what may be said by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>One thing more we cannot but take notice of (which peradventure <hi>William Rogers</hi> aims at, in his charging <hi>John Blaikling</hi> with giving forth a false Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate against <hi>John Story</hi>) which he hath inserted in some part of his Printed Book, as also in several Manuscripts some Years ago, relating to Charge against <hi>Robert Barrow, John Blaykling</hi> and others, particularly in a Paper which he sent to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> from <hi>Bristol,</hi> he writes thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Robert Barrow <hi>and</hi> John Blaykling <hi>are Men of evil Lives, because,</hi> saith he, <hi>they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>To which we answer in Manuscript thus, <hi>viz.</hi> When <hi>John Story</hi> hath said all that he can or dare say, as to a denial of having an hand in, or encourageing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:94536:96"/>The Reader also may remember what a boast <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath made of his standing for the Government of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and gives several Instances of what he hath done, whereby to demonstrate the same: One whereof was his <hi>Narrative,</hi> as he called it, concerning a Meeting which <hi>George Fox, Willian Pen, George Whitehead</hi> and others had at the City of <hi>Bristol</hi> with him and several others of the Principal of them of that Spirit; Which said Narrative was subscribed by him and <hi>William Ford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to manifest that the aforesaid <hi>William Rogers</hi> is not a Man of such a Spirit as can stand in the Spirit of <hi>Jesus,</hi> in the Vindication of the Rule and Government of <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> or be any Help or Comfort to Gods People therein, but an Enemy thereto, and that all his boasting on that wise is but a meer flourish of his vain and corrupt Mind, and not worth taking notice of.</p>
                  <p>We think meet to insert here some Observations formerly made on the aforesaid <hi>Narrative,</hi> given forth by <hi>William Rogers</hi> and <hi>William Ford</hi> at <hi>Bristol,</hi> as aforesaid, which was given forth in Manuscript in Answer to his aforesaid <hi>Rejoynder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of which Narrative or Relation of his, touching the said Meeting, we find several things worth observing, manifesting his base unworthy Spirit, which we have given a brief, yet true, account of, from his own Words there inserted, whereby to manifest of what Spirit this <hi>William Rogers</hi> is, and whether he can be judged to be a Man that can be any Instrument in promoting the Kingdom of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> or be any Credit to the Holy Truth, or Comfort to Gods People, who keep their ancient Integrity to the Lord; or whether he be not clearly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be one that in a backsliding state from Truths Life is an upholder of, and contender for the Kingdom of <hi>Antichrist</hi> (the Old Serpent, the Lyer from the beginning) and as a Man given up to a reprobate Mind, many times not taking notice (as may be reasonably observed) of what he says, or whereof he affirms; and hath run himself to that disparagement, both as a Man, and as a Christian, that doubtless (about things relating to the Truth and the Principle he hath been a Professor of) he hath rendered himself such an one, as that little credit can be given to him, or notice taken of what he may affirm, manifested (as well by his late Queries, the Answer thereto, his Reply, and what hath been thereunto writ, so also) by what hereafter follows, touching the aforesaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning whereof it is thus expressed by him and <hi>William Ford,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>A Brief Relation of some Passages happening amongst the People called, Quakers, of the City of <hi>Bristol,</hi> since the late coming of George <hi>Fox, George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>VVilliam Penn,</hi> with divers others of the City of <hi>Bristol;</hi> and chiefly for the sakes of those, who hearing the various reports thereof, are desirous to know the substance of Material Passages.</p>
                  <p>To which we say, Let them that love the Truth consider, whether the Words of this Prologue to his following matter (<hi>viz.</hi> Passages happening amongst the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) do not much manifest, that the following Relation should either come from one not rightly affected with those Peoples Principles, or out of Fellowship with them, or at least Dedicated to such as are not Friends thereto.</p>
                  <p>And whether matters therein contained be communicable to such from any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing Truth, let the wise in Heart judge? and that <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Heart was not right to God in this undertaking is manifested clearly to all who fear the Lord

and love his appearance, who may come to have a knowledge of these matters.</p>
                  <p>Now it may be observed in the first place, touching <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Narrative, that at the said Meeting which the Persons above mentioned had with <hi>William Rogers, William Ford,</hi> and divers others of that Party, at <hi>Bristol</hi> aforesaid, that several Propositions were agreed upon (as we observe out of his Narrative) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>William Penn</hi> on the one Party, and <hi>William Rogers</hi> on the other, on the behalf of themselves and others concerned (relating to the Order of the said Meeting, and the matters to be debated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and were Signed by <hi>William Rogers</hi> and <hi>William Penn,</hi> and several others.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is agreed upon by the Persons above mentioned, That each may have a Scribe to take all the Passages in the Conferrence, which to them severally shall seem meet; and that before any matter be left, or new matter begun, all that each Party hath thought fit to be written be first read, if any thing be defective, amended, and finally agreed upon by both Persons, to be a true Record or Memorial of the Conferrence; or if any thing be written or expressed short or besides the meaning of the Speaker, that the said Speaker have Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to correct the said Expression.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:94536:97"/>Neither hath <hi>William Rogers</hi> written the Agreement in the Head of the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, according to the sixth Proposition signed by himself and <hi>William Pen;</hi> so in this also he hath broken the Covenant made amongst them.</p>
                  <p>And if he say, It is his freedom so to do; or it is his Principle, or that he hath Liberty in Conscience on this wise and so would not be juged in it.</p>
                  <p>We say, that very common People will say, that such a Conscience is a false Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and a Corrupted Conscience; and all pretence to Conscience, or Liberty in the inner Man with such a Spirit as this, will be as unsavoury Salt, good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to be cast out and trodden under Foot of Men.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He hath broken Covenant also with <hi>William Pen,</hi> and the rest concerned in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing his Quotations out of <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Book, without publishing, also <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Answer, which (as we understand) he gave to them there in the Meeting, wherein he explained his Mind concerning the said Quotations, which thing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the proposition, (viz.) <hi>If any there present have any thing to offer to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand such having his or their Liberty to speak, that every such thing said (if either the Friend that spoke, or</hi> William Pen <hi>or</hi> William Rogers <hi>shall desire it</hi>) <hi>be also Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Let the wise weigh these doings.</p>
                  <p>Again <hi>William Rogers,</hi> and <hi>William Ford</hi> say in their Narrative, <hi>This is a brief Relation of some Passages happining in</hi> Bristol <hi>since the late coming of</hi> George Fox, George Whitehead, <hi>and</hi> William Pen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>And yet how many passages have they made mention of that did not happen in the City of <hi>Bristol:</hi> Several Passages are therein inserted, that fell out amongst Friends in <hi>Westmoreland</hi> about <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> as several things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in Charge against <hi>John Story,</hi> which <hi>Robert Barrow'</hi>s name is put to and twenty six more made mention of; And yet doth not insert any thing, that hath been writ by <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> or some of the twenty six he Speaks of, Satisfactory to Men of equal Spirits for the Confirmation of the weight of the said Articles, as also of the Truth of them.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>William Rogers,</hi> and <hi>William Ford</hi> had been men of just and equal Spirits, they would also have sent through the Nation, what Proof had been made thereof to <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> their shame; and the Sence that the Brethren had, and delivered concerning them, as he himself was a Witness of at <hi>Draw-well,</hi> and not so deceiptfully have taken pieces here and there out of the Charges or Reply to their Answer, as seemed to have least weight, as he or they had placed them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the foregoing or following matter, and left out the most material things relating to Charge against them, thereby (as may be easily gathered) thinking to invalidate the whole matter of Charge against them, and for the further manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the business of <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Spirit about this matter, we refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Answer to that part of the Narrative, that concerned Friends here in <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> given forth several Months since.</p>

                  <p>Now we say, surely <hi>William Rogers</hi> manifesteth great deceit and wickedness here, when as he himself was in <hi>Westmer land</hi> about the beginning of the Separation, and at the Meeting at <hi>Draw-well,</hi> where things relating to Difference were debated, as about the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And now, how can this Man be trusted, or what he says be believed, although he pretend to Conscience, and would be accounted a Man of Honesty, and a VVise Man? but let him look over his Narrative again, and let him judge whether these things savour of Honesty and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or of Deceit and VVickedness, that seems to make himself innorant of what in his Conscience he knows to be true.</p>
                  <p>Again it is inserted in the Narrative, as that which was one (to wit the sourth) Proposition, <hi>That Matters or Subjects to be discoursed upon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>And we understand that <hi>William Rogers</hi> and his Company did not according to Agreement deliver a Copy of those things he charged <hi>George Fox</hi> with, to Friends before he brought them into the publick Meeting.</p>
                  <p>And did not <hi>George Fox</hi> tell him in the publick Meeting, <hi>That in that he was worse then the World; for in their Courts they will give a Copy of the Indictment, to the Party charged?</hi> This may be seen in <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Answer to <hi>William Roger'</hi>s Smiting Queries.</p>
                  <p>Likewise in the Narrative <hi>William Rogers</hi> and <hi>William Ford</hi> say, <hi>That the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet see how <hi>William Rogers,</hi> and those of his Spirit, would impose their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; as the order to <hi>John Batho,</hi> (the keeper of the Key of the Meeting House) subscribed by <hi>William Rogers</hi> and several of them, charging him not to suffer a Meeting to be in the said House, as intended by <hi>George Fox, George Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>William Penn,</hi> manifesteth, the Order runs thus — <hi>We do now order thee to suffer no such Meeting to be held therein</hi> (meaning in the Meeting-House) And also <hi>William Rogers</hi> saith, <hi>that</hi> Richard Vickers <hi>had been in effect warned by</hi> Thomas Goldney <hi>not to suffer any such Meeting to be in our Meeting-House;</hi> And yet <hi>Richard Vickers</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more were Proprietors therein, as well as <hi>Thomas Goldney;</hi> or any of those Thirteen Subscribers of the said Order or Warning as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>Now all may see, that though these Men despise and resist the order of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel in the Power of God, and say, <hi>that the great Difference in the Nation amongst Friends is about outward Orders.</hi> Yet would they excercise Lordship over the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with their Orders, and start away from the Unity, if not condescended to; instance them of the Separation in the <hi>North,</hi> that proposed an Order whereby the Ministers of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> should be limited, from being concerned amongst the Brethren in the Meetings of any other Counties then those they belonged to, and should not so much as sit or stay amongst them, any longer then they had a Word to deliver, and then to with-draw: To which order if the honest Hearted to God
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94536:98"/>
would not Submit, they signified a with-drawing to do their Business amongst themselves: Who accordingly upon the rejecting of this Order and Imposition Indeed; betook themselves into a Separation, and some of them have continued so ever since: What darkness this Spirit of theirs leads them into, its to be admired!</p>
                  <p>Its also said in the Narrative, that <hi>William Rogers Proposed to the Meeting, the reading of a Paper from two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

sent to <hi>John Story,</hi> as their Christian offer towards the Reconciliation of those sad Differences; but <hi>William Rogers</hi> notwithstanding he knew not the contents thereof judged it an unfit Paper to be read; and as we conceive contrary to all Truth, Justice, and common Sobriety, said, <hi>I will oppose it, it shall not be read; again I say it shall not go as from the Meeting:</hi> Which we took to be in high Arrogancy and Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Meeting, raising and continuing his voice when it was begun to be read, so loud on purpose, as to drown the reading of the Proposition, his behaviour being so Rude, that we never had the like in our Meeting before, which rude practice we look upon to be condemnable in all sober and free Societies, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This is testisied to, by <hi>Twenty Eight</hi> Friends of <hi>Bristol,</hi> who were present at the Meeting before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>And therefore what credit can be given to <hi>William Rogers,</hi> and them that gives forth such false Certificates to make People believe Lyes, which they are glad to make their Refuge, let the wise in Heart consider.</p>
                  <p>Again, as we hinted before, <hi>William Regers</hi> saith in his Narraitive, <hi>That the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Days Meeting at</hi> London <hi>have allowed that which they are not satisfied can stand justified,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The matter is something concerning <hi>Robert Barclay'</hi>s Book. In his Narrative he saith thus — Robert Barclay <hi>speaking of the Order of Government, thus saith,</hi> &amp;c. In his Book, Entituled, the <hi>Anarchy of the Ranters;</hi> in which Book it seemeth (as he says) is that which he and others are dissatisfied with: This is mentioned in his Narrative written at <hi>Bristol,</hi> the Eleventh Month, 1677. [This is a Passage that happened at <hi>London,</hi> and not at <hi>Bristol,</hi> and so contradicts the preamble to his Relation]</p>
                  <p>The Reader also may take notice, that in the Third Month, 1677. being Seven Months before his Narrative was writ. <hi>William Rogers</hi> by a Paper under his own Hand acknowledgeth; that touching <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> Book, a fair and Christian debate was had before many Friends at a Meeting in <hi>London,</hi> to both <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> and his Satisfaction, and the things by him objected was fairly and Brotherlike, and in much love discoursed; and he saith, that upon the whole matter, he was satisfied, that <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> was not principled as he and others took him to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And further</hi> William Rogers <hi>saith in his own Paper,</hi> That it lies upon him to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie on the behalf of <hi>Robert Barclay:</hi> Since many have taken occasion of Offence against him for that cause, and as may be doubted so far as to reject the Testimony and service for Truth; it lieth upon me as my duty for his and the Truths sake, to warn all to take heed not to entertain a prejudice against his Testimony, on jealousies that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on score of my apprehensions or mistakes of his Book, or that Answer that I have given thereto, but rather in an unprejudiced Spirit, to wait upon the Lord to feel and savour his Testimony, even as if the occasion had never been.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And further, saith</hi> William Rogers, I freely confess in as much as I published my Book before I gave <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> notice of my Objections and Intentions therein; I acted in that Respect not according to Gospel order, but am justly worthy of Blame therein.</p>

                  <p>Now let it be considered, what a restless unsetled Spirit this Man hath, void of Christian Behaviour and Humanity it self: Who notwithstanding, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own Hand, he hath cleared <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Now let all see, whether these proceedings of <hi>William Rogers</hi> come from any Honesty or Conscientiousness; or whether this restless, unsetled, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>We cannot but tell you that we hae Sufficient cause to doubt, that under pretence of this Proposition, the Meeting will be entertained on your part, with such Idle and vain Testimontes in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Now let it be considered, that this is one that cryes so much for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and against Imposition; and yet see how these would limit the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Friends, and not permit them to clear their Consciences and exercise their gift (contrary to the tendency of his Paper of Queries, in which <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> is so much cryed for) when <hi>Elizabeth Sturridge</hi> must thus be struct at, who spoke nothing (that ever we heard of from honest Men) then what she might be required of the Lord to do, to the clearing of her conscience; and yet <hi>William Rogers</hi> is not ashamed, to call it an Idle Vain Testimony in the Name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And yet in another place of the Narrative, and other of their Writings, they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94536:100"/>
of this Spirit said, John Story <hi>and</hi> John Wilkinson <hi>must be left to Act as their Lord and Master shall lead them:</hi> And yet would not allow <hi>Elizabeth Sturridge</hi> to clear her Conscience as her Lord and Master might require her: Doth not this manifest a partial and byassed Spirit, in judging thus partially as he hath done? And yet contrary to their former Judgment, as some of them of that Spirit have said, (to wit) <hi>That we must not judge of Spiritual things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how answers this also, that which they say; <hi>That all must be left to the Witness of God in themselves?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And from what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> (do we say) doth that Jealousie and Fear arise, of having the Meeting entertained with Testimonies, being the same also with that which made all the Bawling in the Meeting at <hi>Bristol,</hi> when Friends were waiting upon the Lord, for the Testimony of Life to arise amongst them, that <hi>William Rogers</hi> said, <hi>His Soul abominated such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> which was to wait to see if any thing might arise in any to Write to <hi>John Story,</hi> about the reconciling the sad Differences risen, as the Certificate imports: Is not this the Spirit thats gone from the Truth, and likes not sound Judgment, being gone from the Command of God. <hi>Cain</hi> after he had done evil concerning his Brothers Blood, his countenance fell, and he thought that every one that met him would slay him.</p>
                  <p>But it is not so with the Righteous, for they are bold, and makes no such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for the Flesh: And is not <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Testimony more Idle and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent (and <hi>John Story'</hi>s also, and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi>) then Hers was, who saith, <hi>God hath raised them up, to stand in the Gap;</hi> and yet are opening Gaps for the Loose and Fleshly to enter in at, out of the Way of Truth, and their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for it (to wit) <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s making away part of his Estate from the Spoylers, and says, <hi>Its his Principle;</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> creeping in suffering times, and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> standing to justifie it; and what an idle Testimony was that in <hi>John Story,</hi> that condemned Friends Soundings and making an noise in Heart-Melody to God in their Meetings, whilst others were Preaching or Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and said, <hi>He had born his Testimony against it, and he would do it, and bring it down or leave Preaching?</hi> And was not <hi>John Wilkinson'</hi>s Testimony Idle and Prophane, and charged it upon the Lord too, that said, <hi>God will break us;</hi> when we were in the exercise of Truth according to Gospel Order? and yet it fell on the neck of his own Spirit, for many (not long after) broke off from them, and came away with joy.</p>
                  <p>Again in the <hi>Narrative</hi> it is said by them, <hi>That from henceforth there may be no occasion to say that they are Men of Strife,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We say, Would they be look'd upon not to be Men of Strife? we can confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently say, that <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s work of spreading abroad this <hi>Narrative,</hi> and others his contentious Papers, sufficiently gives himself the lye if he say so; and the Fruits of <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> and their Company in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions and Separation, and Contentious Work sufficiently manifests that they are not Men of Peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We further observe, that it is said in the</hi> Narrative, That the consideration of the present Differences amongst Friends, and the sence they have that the Name of the Lord is dishonoured amongst the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who at this Day may clap their Hands for joy, and cry Ha! Ha! They say, They have cause to enter into the House of Mourning rather then Joy.</p>
                  <p>In Answer we say, it may be seen what a deceitful Spirit this is, thus to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94536:100"/>
and use a deal of smooth Words in Hypocrisie, that have no Answer in the Consciences of the Faithful to God.</p>
                  <p>For hath not <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> and other Partakers with them in this contentious VVork, been the only cause of dishonour to the peaceable Truth and the Name of God? Doth not the Separation, and such work of Strife and VVrangling as is brought forth amongst them, and <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s sending abroad his contentious Papers up and down the Nation, contrary to Covenant and Agreement made and signed, testifie of what Spirits they are? Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to the tender Advise and Judgment of the most of Friends in the Nation sheweth them to have a stubborn Heart, far from the House of Mourning — VVhat Kindness and Care hath been extended and used towards this People? VVhat tender Entreaties have been made to them, to be reconciled to God and the Brethren, and to come off from the Separation? And <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> have been desired that they would be instrumental in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Separate Meeting, or testifie against it; and yet with an imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit do they despise and resist all, and this Hyprocrisie atop of all causes the Lord the more to abominate their doings: Hath <hi>William Rogers</hi> forgot the Crys and Tears to the Lord for them at the <hi>Draw-well,</hi> when he and they stood in that heardness of Heart that many were made to admire? Let them say what they will, the House of Mourning they are Strangers too; yet the Day of it will come from the Lord God, who sees their VVorks, and will judge accordingly; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Spirit nor their VVorks do answer the Light of Christ, nor the Grace of God that hath followed them; and the Strife that is begun, and which they still maintain, shall be laid at their Doors, let them look to it as they will answer the Lord in the great Day.</p>
                  <p>VVe observe also; that <hi>William Rogers</hi> in the <hi>Narrative</hi> recites two Questions that were put to the Brethren at <hi>Draw-well,</hi> by <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> to be resolved; although we shall not concern our selves here much to give any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to them, then what was delivered amongst the Brethren then; yet we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that the said Queries may be compared with the Paper of Prescriptions subscribed by <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> and them of the Separation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The first Question, Whether or no we, and all Gods People, ought not to be left in all matters of Faith and Discipline,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the manifestation of Gods Spirit and Truth in our Hearts, to Speak and Act therein as we are thereby Instructed and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, and not otherwise?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer was given Affirmatively <hi>(viz.)</hi> They Ought. And our Sence and Judgment in the Truth closed therewith, as that which we stand for and have maintained against every contrary appearance.</p>
                  <p>And yet <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> in their Paper of Subscription, the foundation of the Separation in the <hi>North,</hi> say, together with others of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, <hi>That none of their own Country, or of other Countries, must sit amongst them, to concern themselves in the Business of their County</hi> (although it be about matters relating to Discipline) <hi>but their chosen Men to whom they give Power, and if any do, they are usurpers of Authority,</hi> they say; yea, it was moved also by them, <hi>That no Ministers of Truth should be any of those chosen Men,</hi> only they come in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with a proviso, <hi>That if any had a Message from God to deliver amongst them, they must declare their Message and withdraw.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:94536:101"/>Now let the wise in Heart see. What Darkness and Contradiction is this? For doth this Proposition and Practice of theirs answer their Conclusion in this Cuestion, <hi>That all must be left to the manifestation of Gods Spirit and Truth in their own Hearts, to Speak and Act therein as' they are Instructed and Perswaded;</hi> that would thus limit the Spirit of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> in his People, by shuting out such as might be moved of the Lord to come and sit amongst them to be concerned as the Lord might instruct them.</p>
                  <p>And how doth this answer the Liberty and Motion upon Peoples Consciences they so much cry for? And how doth this answer those Words in the <hi>Narrative, That</hi> John Story <hi>must be left to Act as his Lord and Master should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> him?</hi> And yet <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson,</hi> by their Order and Prescription, will not allow others the like priviledge, but says, <hi>That none must came and sit amongst their chosen Men (but such as they have chosen, and to whom they have given Power) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their Lord and Master by his Spirit should lead them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not here exercising Lordship over Mens Consciences to purpose, even over the <hi>Heritage of God?</hi> And is not this Order and Prescription of theirs, which they would have had Gods People to have submitted to, worse then the Worlds Courts, either such as are called Spiritual, or any of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Courts or Sessions?</p>
                  <p>The second Question proposed at <hi>Draw-well</hi> aforesaid, inserted in <hi>William Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers'</hi>s Narrative is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Since there are diversities of Talents and Gifts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ven by the Spirit of God, and received by Men; whether the judgment of Truth, given forth through a part of the Members of Christs Body, can become any bond upon any other part of the same Body further then their Vnderstands are enlightened thereby?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Question was answered in the Negative, and in the Spirit of Truth we have Unity therewith; but we do further affirm, that whatsoever is given forth in the Judgment of Truth, and from the Gift of the Spirit, by any of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body of Christ, that the rest of the Members of the same Body (which keep their Eye in Christ their Head) have Unity in the Spirit of Christ therewith and if any slight thereof, or opposition thereunto do arise in any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; it is because they are become benumbed Members, and have lost the spiritual lively sence of the Truth in themselves, and are become thereby Strangers to the mind of God communicated to such as keeps alive in the Body to be distributed by such (as Instruments in his Hand) for the good of the Body as the Lord sees meet.</p>
                  <p>But how doth this Question of theirs answer their Order and Prescription sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by them, that would have all to submit to what they give out as their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Order to be condescended to and covenanted in, or else they would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from such as would not, and do their business themselves, amongst their chosen Men; and the Order such, as would limit the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of the Lord in the Members of Christs Body, and to cause subjection to such their Inventions as <hi>Christianity</hi> would be ashamed of? And yet these are the Men that cry against <hi>Orders,</hi> and for <hi>Liberty;</hi> but that it is the Order of the Gospel, the Power of God, that they cry against, not loving sound Judgment; and that the Liberty they would be at, and which they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94536:101"/>

            <head>THE POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>NOw,</hi> saith William Rogers, <hi>I take notice of a Postscript written by</hi> John Blaykling.</p>
            <p>Now it may be observed, that this which he calls <hi>a Postscript,</hi> is something which I writ in Reply to some part of <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Smiting Queries and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations against <hi>George Fox,</hi> my Name being inserted on the Occasion of one or two of the aforesaid Queries, <hi>William Rogers</hi> seeming therein to bring me in as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to a charge against him.</p>
            <p>The smiting Query sormerly inserted amounts to the charging <hi>George Fox</hi> to forbear coming to Meetings, a great part of a quarter of a Year, &amp;c. So that, saith <hi>William Rogers, it became matter of Exercise and Burthen to others for thy sake; and did not</hi> John Blaykling <hi>by Name, manifest his Exercise and Burthen of Spirit on thine and the Truths behalf for thy so doing? and didst not thou after he had so done a little amend in that case?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And wouldst not thou have accounted this in another to be the fruit of a Careless Slothsul, Negligent Libertine or Dark Spirit, that was either departed or departing from the Truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I say, The Reader may take Notice, that by an Interrogatory Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <hi>William <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> asserted the aforesaid matter on <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Account, as in the rest of the Queries he hath done, <hi>viz.</hi> — <hi>So that,</hi> saith he, <hi>it become matter of Exercise and Burden of Spirit to others for thy sake; and did not</hi> John Blaykling <hi>by Name manifest his Exercise, &amp;c? And wouldest not thou have accounted this in another to be the fruit of a Careless Negligent Libertine and dark Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. — [And that these smiting Queries were matters of high Charge against <hi>George Fox</hi> (as <hi>William Rogers</hi> confesseth that Queries may be) as the rest of his Queries were, and the greatest part of his whole Paper did tend thereunto, (as by what formerly hath been said is so very evident) it cannot be denyed.</p>
            <p>For I say, if they were not matters of Charge against him, but Questions asked, that he might be satisfied of the Truth thereof; Why then did <hi>William Rogers</hi> cause them to be read in a publick Meeting three Weeks before they came to <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Hands, and send them up and down the Nation in Maniscript amongst those of party with him, to as much disgrace to <hi>George Fox</hi> as any way he could? It's an horrid shame for <hi>

            <p>Unto which my Answer was in Sincerity of Heart, thus; If <hi>William Rogers</hi> do affirm that I had a Burthen upon me with respect to <hi>George Fox,</hi> as being out of Gods Counsel, or departing from the Truth; in so doing, I do testifie, he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an untruth.</p>

               <hi>In the Answer to</hi> William Rogers's <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> it is <hi>expressed concerning this point thus</hi> — Might not <hi>William Rogers</hi> have been sparing in this Matter of charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Contradiction? for he may remember what Contradiction and Confusion he hath run himself into, in his Queries and Rejoynder, to Query and Accuse in plain Words, as the Queries themselves do manifest, and as in the Paragraph he speaks of, it doth appear; and yet says <hi>George Fox</hi> is a Lyer thirteen times over for calling his Queries Charges; and yet himself confesseth Queries may be so; <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>But to go on; touching the Contradiction which he says I have run my self into; I say, If <hi>William Rogers</hi> will but allow my Query the like priviledge that his own Imports (<hi>viz</hi>) an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, (which may be rationally dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therefrom, on the Score of this dialoguing Discourse) and no more is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired (for clear explanation sake) but what is allowed him: Then it may be easily granted that an Affirmation might be easily drawn from my Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>:</hi> For,</p>
            <p>Let the case be stated thus: It being by me observed, that <hi>William Rogers</hi> asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this smiting Accusation, as he had done the rest by way of Query, against <hi>George Fox,</hi> wherein he would bring me in as a Witness against him: By way of Query it was intimated, that though he seemed but to ask the Question (about the matter in which I was concerned) yet that it was affirmatively intended, it might easily be granted, it being of the like tendency that the rest of the smiting Queries were; though its believed <hi>William Rogers</hi> might not intend to express himself in this matter in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> plain Words, so as to make it so binding a Charge from him against the Innocent, that he could not some way help himself off, if he fail'd in the Proof; as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> he hath done in his other malicious Accusations when he could not prove them, alledging that they did not amount to charge, as before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> manifested; Therefore with Respect to the sence given of <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Accusations, through all his Queries, it might be satisfactorily granted, that <hi>William Rogers</hi> with himself <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>But to go on to his Paraphiasing Discourse upon mine Answer to his Smiring Charge.</p>
            <p>I am Charactered by him, (for my Testimony which I was in Conscience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to bear for an Antient and Worthy in the Truth of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> in the Sincerity of my Soul) to be one that flatters for the Belly; and saith and doth, in all things to please the humor of another, to have a repast (or small Dinner;) so I understand his meaning may be, upon the Tearm he gives me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> In the first place, I take this to be a Smiting Reflection on <hi>George Fox</hi> (on whose Account I having been thus concerned) against whom he thus appears; for whom I am bold to say, he is a Man of no such Spirit; its an abhorence to him to Correspond with such, or to be gratified with such Dissembling as this: If <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Spirit, by which he judgeth others, be such, let him take it to himself, and get such treating and flattering where he can have it, he shall have none of it from me, and therefore is he grieved, and <hi>George Fox</hi> is known to be a Servant of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and for Christs sake to the least of Gods little Ones, and there the honour that is from above attends him, which <hi>William Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> with all that Death and Hell can do, cannot eclips, nor he have a share in whilest such Works are done by him, let that stand over his Head.</p>
            <p>And as to the Reflection, yea, the Gross and Infamous Charge that relates to me, as I have a Record in my own Soul over this foul Abuse; I do appeal to the Testimony of Truth, that lives in the Hearts of my Brethern, Familiers and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in the Truth, who knows my Spirit, (and are out of this prejudiced malicious Work) to speak on my behalf, as they have felt and known my Life and Demeanour amongst them, in relation to my plain-dealing with all, with whom I have had to do; I have cleared my Conscience in God sight, in faithful dealing with all, without flattery or fear, though I have Suffered thereby; I was never accused on the account of flattering or self-seeking, or speaking any way in favour for a Repast or small Dinner, till I met with <hi>William Rogers'</hi>s Spirit, which is the same which accused <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> to be a Friend to <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners;</hi> and as <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> Impudently said to me and others, because of our care in the <hi>Church of God, That we had got an Office, and were puffed up in it: and acted therein to get favour of Persons, or a piece of Bread;</hi> and said also, <hi>that our
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94536:107"/>
Office would but cloath us with Rags, and Worms would breed in our gatherings, and our Bread conjume.</hi> I bless God (as a Mercy I prise) I never stood in need of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any, for any such Reward, nor my Ancestors before me, neither were they of such Spirits, as my Country-Men and Neighbours knows, from the relation that hath been given of them, who have been known in Hospitality open and free, and that to the best of People, for Religions sake, some Generations past; and if I have been of another Spirit, its not well, for God hath been no less kind to me, in giving me of his Truth and the best of things, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> enough as to the World; and a Spirit also, I bless the Lord, in which I-detest the the State he applyes to me, and loaths the occasion for such a scandal, as he would leave me under; I have done something for the Trnth, out of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God hath given me, and its my Gladness that I have thereof, and an Heart prepared even as the Lord shall direct; and my Exercise and Travels in my Testimony on Truths account, have been a Burthen to none that I know of, for I challeng the whole World to lay it to my charge, and prove it against me, that I have ever received one Penny from any one on the account thereof, though I have met with a charge from a corrupt Spirit on that score, which I deny: If I have been a But then to any on the Gospels account any way, let it be made appear, and it shall be repaid double; I desire to be excused on this wise, I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as relating to the charge against me, of which also I make no Boast but in the Lord, and on the riches of his Grace alone, by Which I am what I am; and the Lord never made <hi>William Rogers</hi> (nor the Spirit he is of in any) judge over me, I stand to God whose peace I have, which comforts my Soul over all.</p>

               <hi>to</hi> George Fox's Reply, <hi>and my</hi> Postscript, <hi>it is Inserted by some Brethren thus.</hi> — <q>Let <hi>William Rogers</hi> be asked, whether he had not another Testimony in his Spirit for <hi>John Blaykling</hi> when he was at <hi>Draw well,</hi> the place of his Residence, at the Meeting there, with many Brethren on <hi>John Story's</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson's</hi> Account; the sence which he had of him then, as he testified to several, hath not produced such an effect as this; which Testimony that he then had for <hi>John Blaykling</hi> (though he smothers it now) shall be his Torment; and this Testimony we have to bear on his behalf, as a Man far remote from such a Spirit; or deserving any such Reflection, &amp;c. — And <hi>John Blaykling</hi> is the same in his Spirit that he then was; though prejudice hath blinded <hi>William Rogers</hi> his Eye, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>William Rogers</hi> further upon the occasion of his smiting Query in Relation to <hi>George Fox'</hi>s being of a careless, negligent, libertine and dark Spirit, that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Answer, First William Rogers</hi> here doth not deny, but that his said Query was
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94536:108"/>
an implicite Charge against <hi>George Fox;</hi> and therefore no lye in <hi>George Fox</hi> to call it so; And <hi>Secondly,</hi> He doth not deny but that he did secure part of his Estate; and therefore the Fruit of a Libertine Loose Spirit, departing from the Antient Nobility of Truth; and he did not well in calling it a Prophane Charge from me; because he hath confessed it and pleaded for it, saying. <hi>That it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so to do, then so,</hi> &amp;c. as before is cleared; only says <hi>John Blaykling can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay his Prophane Charge at his Doors, but contradict his own Testimony for</hi> George Fox, <hi>who,</hi> says he, <hi>denyeth not, but that he advised</hi> Mary Pennington <hi>to secure hers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Well then, let the case with respect to this matter stand here, <hi>William Rogers</hi> granting the case (as to matter of Charge of securing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) against himself. And as to my contradicting my self, with respect to my Testimony for <hi>George Fox'</hi>s Integrity, because <hi>William Rogers</hi> charges him in <hi>Mary Penningtons</hi> case, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say, let <hi>William Rogers</hi> make good any matter of evil Fact against <hi>George Fox,</hi> relating to <hi>Mary Pennington,</hi> which he hath not yet done, neither hath <hi>George Fox</hi> confessed to any, and there will then be a further concern about it as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> case may require. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may be observed, in my <hi>Answer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Rogers;</hi> that I applyed to <hi>William Rogers</hi> the case of a loose libertine Spirit and his departing from his Subjection to Truth, not only with respect to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but also with respect to his making it a great part of his concern, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> by and strengthen a Spirit of Strife and Separation, the great and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> receptacle of all the loose, libertine, dark, contentious, backsliding sort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Truth; so that what woful, sad, contemptible Work this Spirit of Separation (<hi>William Rogers</hi> hath been so deeply concerned in managing the cause of) hath wrought it cannot be expressed.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>William Rogers</hi> exclaims against me after a very abusive manner, for speaking plainly to him, and telling him, <hi>That from a Spirit of Envy, against the Government of</hi> Christ Jesus <hi>Instrumentally and visibly in Gods Power amongst them that believe; he ceaseth not to Calumniate the Instruments whom God is pleased to concern in that matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he storms at and makes a large Discourse, what he hath said in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Government of <hi>Christ,</hi> both in Word and Writing (but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may say, and it will ere long appear, that he mean's immediately on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not by Instruments in relation to Gods visible Family; for otherwise he will contradict his whole design, and overthrow the fabrick of all his Work) He saith, <hi>He hath stood for it in his Answer to</hi> Robert Barclay's <hi>Book: The Postscript to the Narrative about the Meeting at</hi> Draw-Well: <hi>His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Brethren's</hi> (so termed saith he) <hi>Narrative at</hi> Draw-Well: <hi>His Dissatisfactions subscribed by him and others at</hi> Bristol, <hi>and several other Papers,</hi> saith he; <hi>by all which it appears that I have contended for the Government of</hi> Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I say what is it for <hi>William Rogers</hi> to contend for the Government of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Kingdom, which stands not in Words, but in Righteousness and Peace, when he together with <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> have acted so clearly otherwise, gratifying and serving an ungodly Spirit in opposition to the Churches Care, Labour and tender Exercise, in the Spirit and Power of <hi>Jesus,</hi> in order to the keeping down the Spirit, and the Works of the Flesh, wherein the Kingdom of <hi>Sathan</hi> stands, and is upheld: Yea, through all his late

            <p>I do affirm its meer Deceit, and a false Pretence, to keep the Head of a false Spirit, from under Truths Yoke, and the Judgment thereof, to talk of standing for the Government of <hi>Christ,</hi> with that Spirit thats not subject to him, nor hath any regard to the unity of Brethren, in their Exercises that relate to the same, in keeping all things Decent, Comely and of good Report in the <hi>Church of God;</hi> to answer the Pure Religion, the glory of Christs Kingdom, in visiting the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and the Widow, and keeping our selves unspotted of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
